<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andreasen (ELDR) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, the European Union faces great challenges over the next few years, challenges which all demand greater involvement on the part of the public. With a view to enhancing knowledge and understanding of what the EU really stands for and what it does, the EU must therefore develop a new information and communication strategy for its citizens. The objective of such a policy must be to see information and communication from the citizen’s point of view and, in this connection, two factors must be taken into consideration. Firstly, people do not, in general, distinguish between the institutions of the EU: the Council, the Commission and Parliament. Instead, they see everything in terms of Brussels. Secondly, people want to receive their information from the sources closest to them, including those that are physically closest. Therefore, the key messages in this report are those relating to coordination and decentralisation.</p>
<p class="contents">What is required is coordination between the institutions where information to citizens and communication with citizens is concerned, together with the highest possible degree of decentralisation in all information and communication activities of the European institutions. It is very gratifying that the Commission and Parliament have resumed and strengthened their cooperation in the Interinstitutional Group on Information and, when the group meets tomorrow, we can also feel very pleased that the Council is participating for the first time in this important coordination of the work.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to decentralisation, it is important that the Member States participate more actively in the work. Decentralisation means that the tasks of providing information are delegated to the representations in the Member States, together with the responsibility for these and the necessary financial resources. In this way, the tasks are carried out as close to the people as possible and in the manner required by the people in the particular country, region or local community. At present, far too much information about the EU is provided in too general a form with, for example, the same brochure being translated into 11 languages. However, people in Lapland and Sicily may not necessarily have the same requirements, in terms either of the content of the information or in the way they receive it.</p>
<p class="contents">Coordination is understood as overall high-level planning, that is to say at the level of the Interinstitutional Group on Information. In the report, the European Parliament asks that the Commission draw up an annual report on activities as a whole – including those that take place in the respective Directorates-General, for there is apparently no one who has an overview of what happens there.</p>
<p class="contents">This report concerns the frameworks for information and communication. In a few months’ time, the Commission will be producing another statement on the content. Where the frameworks, or tools, are concerned, we know that more than 60% of people want to receive their information from the television. We must therefore consider whether we should create a European Union TV channel dealing with European Union politics. The ‘C-SPAN’ model from the United States, ‘BBC Parliament’ in Britain and the German parliamentary channel, ‘Phoenix’, as well as DK4 in Denmark are various models that can be considered at European Union level. The Commission and Parliament have combined in setting up a service called ‘Europe Direct’, through which people can very quickly obtain answers via the Internet or over the telephone about where they should apply in order to obtain the information they require. This is a service that has already been very well received by the people of Europe. It is a splendid initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">When we turn to the content of this policy, we must also proceed on the basis of what people want, and what they want is information about those matters close to their everyday lives, such as food safety, employment, the environment, traffic, human genetics and so on. We must be very careful about preventing any propaganda from the institutions of the European Union. Information must be as reliable, unbiased and pluralist as possible, and those who provide it must be accountable. Where pluralism is concerned, people could, of course, be made aware of points of view other than those of the institutions by means of Internet links from European institution web sites to the web sites of Eurosceptics, NGOs and others.</p>
<p class="contents">It will cost money to turn this report into a reality. We would ask the Commission how much. On the other hand, the task is enormously important for democracy and, at present, the information budget in the EU is approximately a quarter of a euro per person per year. It is a small amount, given the task concerned, especially in comparison with the amounts spent in the Member States on information provided by national and local authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I have many people to thank for assisting in the preparation of this report: officials of the Commission, Parliament and the Council, many experts and a large number of NGOs but, first and foremost of course, my colleagues in the Interinstitutional Group on Information and in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. Many thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This shows us on the Committee on Budgets that we are, on the whole, definitely on the right road as far as the Commission's information policy is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, though, we also have to strike a critical balance. Looking at the great need for public information occasioned by the introduction of the euro, being aware also of how much money the European Union made available for this purpose, and, still repeatedly reading surveys that show that many citizens feel themselves to be badly or inadequately informed or not informed at all, questions have to be asked about the effectiveness of our information policies. We will have a great common task on our hands in the coming months and years. We on the Committee on Budgets will also be very closely monitoring the process of accustoming the public to the fact that this European Union of ours is going to grow, that it will have more members, and that we will have new challenges to face together. Hence the request by the Committee on Budgets – and I know that Mr Andreasen and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport will not let us down – that it is together that we should press on with this change in strategy that we began together many years ago, so that the European Union's information policy may do what it claims to do and satisfy the public demand for objective information about current problems and developments in Europe. Everything else, I think, can adequately be dealt with via Parliament's groups and individual Members. They, too, can safeguard Europe's diversity; I do not believe that to be a task for the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me also congratulate Mr Andreasen on an excellent and innovative report, looking at the problems, but, I believe, bringing fresh and new solutions. May I thank him for his support and may I also thank the LIBE Committee for its support for my opinion which it voted upon and adopted unanimously. It is a sad reflection for me that I did not gain that same support from my own Group within the Culture Committee, for various reasons which I hope will become obvious at some point in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to Mr Andreasen's report. The implementation of existing policies and future development of the European Union needs to be based on active and informed participation of its citizens. I particularly welcome moves to coordinate the information activities of the institutions and as far as possible provide information in a one-stop shop so that it is not necessary for citizens to understand the institutional structure of the Union in order to obtain the information they require.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key aspect of information policy of the EU institutions is access to documents, and as I repeatedly noted in connection with the adoption of Regulation No 1049/2001 on public access to documents of the institutions, documents – and I stress this – cannot be separated from the information contained in them. It therefore follows that the information and communication policy of the institutions should be coordinated with the activities for the implementation of the aforementioned Regulation. It is therefore sad that we fail to grasp the political opportunity to have the interinstitutional group on information which is responsible for cooperation on information activities working and taking on board the activities in Article 15 of Regulation 1049/2001. I hope we will revisit this and take this wonderful opportunity to combine the information policies, transparency and access to documents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The communication from the Commission calls for cooperation, and that is the key word: there has to be cooperation in communication. We will be proposing a very slight amendment suggesting that the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee should be allowed to sit as observers on the proposed institutional group.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know the present dire state of citizens' knowledge about the organisation and policies of the EU. Eurobarometer showed that only 6% of EU citizens thought they knew a lot about the EU. 83% said that they know a little, or even very little. This influences the low and declining turnout in European Parliament elections – down to 49% at the last election. That is a problem for democracies all over the world, and not least the United States of America, but it is a real problem for the EU as well.</p>
<p class="contents">When the people of Ireland rejected the Treaty of Nice in the recent referendum, the most telling slogan was: "If you don't know, vote no". That was precisely what the people did. I would be the first to admit that my own country, the United Kingdom, is probably one of the worst examples. According to Eurobarometer again, we are bottom of the list in terms of knowledge, but not surprisingly top of the list in having reservations and objections to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Andreasen is absolutely right to say that the EU must concentrate on factual information. Diverse and balanced information must be free of propaganda; but the people of all countries are crying out for information and explanation of what the EU is doing. According to Eurobarometer 66%, that is two out of every three European citizens, want more information. That has to be within proper cost constraints but again, as has already been said, at present we are spending just 25 cents per annum – for English ears, that is 15 pence per citizen per year. Citizens will also judge us more by what we do than what we say. This report calls on the Council of Ministers to be more open in its decision process. Its secrecy does a profound disservice to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament need to ask ourselves whether we are getting value for money. We are always delighted to see visitors in this Parliament, but 43% of our budget goes on the Visitors Service. Are we really getting value for money? We certainly need to target the media and information formers. We need to be more positive about Euronews. We should also not neglect radio as a good way of getting information. IT is properly addressed in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">All I would say is that the EU has created a stable and prosperous continent. Half of Europe is queuing up to join the EU and yet 48% of present citizens wonder whether it is a good thing. This report is not before time. It must not be allowed to gather dust. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report supplements, strengthens and, in a positive sense, counterbalances the communications which we have received from the Commission since Commissioner Vitorino took up this post. I am sure that the Commissioner will agree with me that the Andreasen report comes at a very appropriate time to improve the future communication which the Commission is going to present to us in June.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, without wishing to be over-optimistic, I believe that we can say that the information and communication machinery of the European institutions is well-oiled, the defects have been detected and the instruments fine-tuned. What we must do is act according to the guidelines indicated in the Commission’s documents which have now been so wonderfully complemented by the Andreasen report.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I did want to mention a worrying aspect on which I agree with the rapporteur: the budgetary forecasts for the coming years show a decreasing trend in this area. And, while it is true that the euro campaign has turned out to be very successful and that its entry into circulation is a great boost, there are other great challenges such as institutional reform and enlargement, which will still demand a great effort over the coming years. And I therefore believe that both the Commission, which is responsible for preparing the draft budget, and Parliament, as the budgetary authority, should be very attentive to these needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, information and communication are key elements for the success of European construction and I believe that we must communicate the idea that the Union is a community of values, a legal and political entity which has no historical precedent, which defines a new concept of transnational citizenship, to every corner of the Fifteen countries and all future Member States. This is the message we must communicate and, if we manage to deliver it to its destination, we will make Europe a principal player which is respected on the world stage. There is no doubt that Mr Andreasen’s report is an excellent contribution to this task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Andreasen on his excellent report, which provides an opportunity to consider the development of our new information policy. The report that you have just discussed directly mirrors the work that the Commission is doing to urge all the institutions to draw up a global information policy of the European Union. The Commission can see that its work is being supported and it welcomes this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, in response to the Andreasen report and to the debate that has just taken place, to present the broad objectives of our strategy, and then to elaborate on some aspects of its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the framework for interinstitutional co-operation set out in the communication of 27 June 2001, the Commission is now considering what should be appropriate objectives for a genuine information and communication policy of the European Union. Interinstitutional co-operation is not an end in itself, as the Andreasen report quite rightly stresses, but must essentially enable us to develop a better understanding of the citizen and of the existence and role of the European Union as it stands. In order to achieve this, we need to do more than just disseminate factual information. It seems to me that our aim must be to develop a genuine communication policy that will enable us to enter into dialogue with the general public in the Member States. I also think that a genuine global information and communication policy of the European Union should also attempt to increase citizens’ involvement in European debates.</p>
<p class="contents">These questions encourage us to be aware of the European Union’s need to have better control of its own image, which involves drawing up its own set of messages. This should be able to be adapted to its various information activities, whether they are urgent or specific. As the rapporteur points out, these messages must be changed according to the local situation or specific concerns of the people. This involves defining targeted local information which is as credible as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully supports the principles mentioned by Mr Andreasen, the first of which is decentralisation. This must not only apply to the implementation of the strategy, but also to the adaptation of messages to the requirements of the various sectors of the public, whether this involves adaptation to different national situations in the 15 Member States or adapting messages to the various target groups of the information and communication policy. This also, however, requires our institutions to be better coordinated and to have better guidance. In this respect, I fully support the rapporteur’s idea to strengthen the coordinating and guidance role of the Interinstitutional Group on Information, chaired on behalf of Parliament by Vice-President Vidal-Quadras Roca, whom I would like to acknowledge and thank for the comments he has made on the efforts to co-operate with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns interinstitutional cooperation. This should eventually develop into a multi-annual action programme, providing better prospects for our work on information and communication. The Commission can only welcome your proposal to organise a debate, to be held every year in Parliament and in which the Council takes part, on the information and communication policy. I also welcome the fact that the Council has decided to take part in the meetings of the Interinstitutional Group on Information. I hope that other bodies will also participate in the work of the IGI, as observers.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to partnership with civil society. As you quite rightly point out, if we wish to strengthen this partnership, we must make more rational use of the networks and relays that we have established with the Member States at national, regional and local level. As you can see, it is useful and necessary to think about the strategy itself, but this must go hand in hand with improving the organisation of our resources, and this is why the Commission is currently in the process of assessing the real ability of the tools that we have available.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that the coherence of our message depends on there being greater synergy between our various resources. The rapporteur stresses the need to establish common European Union Houses in the candidate countries as well as in all the Member States. As you know, the policy of the Commission is to do exactly this. Your idea to develop a ‘one-stop-shop’ in each country for European citizens is very much in line with the concerns of the Commission. In this connection, the Commission is interested in achieving greater coordination, which you have been hoping and praying for, between the institutions and the Member States, which should bring about greater complementarity between their respective activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same respect, the Commission is also seeking to create greater synergy between the networks and relays and the external offices and the representations of our institutions, which you refer to as ‘European Union Houses’. I think that, today, this coordination is already a reality on the ground. Furthermore, to respond to your concern regarding the visibility of these ‘common Houses’, the Commission is considering ways of making information from the European Union more easily recognisable by its recipients. In addition to drawing up common themes and messages, should the European Union not seek to develop its own identity using a logo or a unique way of conveying its image through its various channels; a branding of some sort?</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that you are right to stress the need to develop a more global and more systematic audio-visual policy as a prime source of information and communication for the European Union. First of all, if I may, I would like to stress that the responsibility for this falls to the Member States themselves. The Council itself acknowledged this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also carry out an in-depth assessment of this area in order to bring its partnerships into line with all national, regional and local audio-visual media.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Europe by Satellite is concerned, the Commission has always seen this as a leading source of interinstitutional information, which it will strive to develop in line with the budget provided.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the budget, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we are currently bringing an end to the campaign on the euro, which will free up some financial resources. In the future, I believe that we should agree on the priorities for the forthcoming years; the future of Europe will certainly be one of them, and globalisation, as well as the continuation of the campaign on enlargement. I hope to be able to count on the support of the European Parliament in establishing the budgetary priorities that are required to fulfil the new tasks of the information and communication policy of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also takes careful note of your desire to discuss setting up a European public television channel, the specific aim of which is to provide the public with continuous, relevant information on the initiatives and work of the European Union. The Commission will do all it can to present you with an initial analysis on the feasibility of this project by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this venture that we are embarking upon together is of enormous scope, but it is also very exciting. The Commission welcomes the political will and the awareness that is driving our institutions today. This shared political will will enable us to develop a coherent and global information and communication strategy of the European Union that will benefit our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the excellent spirit of cooperation that prevails as we go about drawing up our new information strategy. There will be a further communication on this strategy, due to be adopted by the Commission towards the end of June. It is a pleasure for me, following the debate that will be held tomorrow within the interinstitutional group – a debate which will be a brainstorming session on the essential priorities of the substance of the information and communication policy – to return to present our conclusions to you at Parliament’s part-session in July. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
