<p class="contents">Colleagues, today it is a very pleasant duty on behalf of Parliament to open this part-session. This Parliament now comprises the 626 Members elected for the fifth mandate of Parliament and the 162 new Members from the 10 new Member States, which acceded to the European Union on Saturday, 1 May.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for our Parliament – as we have already marked in a symbolic ceremony outside – a special and extraordinary moment. In Dublin last Saturday, Ireland's Nobel literature laureate Seamus Heaney captured this special event with the words 'On a day when newcomers appear, let it be a homecoming.' This is indeed a homecoming and we are so pleased that so many new colleagues join us today. It is a moment of hope, a moment that shows that determined will within the European Union, its institutions and Member States can deliver real results: a win-win situation for all involved. Fifteen years ago, early in 1989, this would have looked like an impossible dream, but it has come true: what a wonderful moment.</p>
<p class="contents">From this platform I should like to issue – on behalf of the 626, to the 162 – a heartfelt, warm welcome to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud and sustained applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to pay tribute to all who have contributed to this moment, parliamentarians – European and national, Member State governments, many presidencies of the European Council and the determined leadership of the European Commission. I am sure the House would want me in particular to thank Mr Verheugen for his extraordinary personal leadership.</p>

We all felt this emotion when, accompanied by the Ode to Joy, our European anthem, we saw the ten new flags hoisted alongside the 15 already flying on the masts in front of Parliament. The emotion of a day on which we are seeing the fulfilment of the ambitions and hopes of so many people who have fought for freedom for so many years. A moment which means overcoming brutal scars, which for too many years have marked an artificial division of our Europe, the division which originated in war, the division which left many European countries separated by this wall of shame, by this completely artificial Iron Curtain, which goes against our very nature, which left all of those countries in a situation of oppression and communist dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">The twenty-first century must overcome the horrors of the twentieth century, and we are overcoming the horrors we have experienced in Europe for good. The twenty-first century is the century which will see Europe burst onto the international stage as a leading player, in the concert of nations. To this end, we must conclude the agreement on the Constitutional Treaty as soon as possible, which would genuinely provide us with the instruments and capacities Europe needs in order to become a reality not only on our continent, but as a principal player on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is what we must all achieve together.</p>
<p class="contents">We are witnessing an historic moment in this Parliament. An historic moment which is a repeat of what we have seen on the television or personally, in some cases, in recent days, on 1 May 2004, which will forever remain a fundamental milestone in Europe’s full recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to these 162 new Members of Parliament, Mr President, that we in the Commission hope to continue with the cooperation that has taken place over all these years between the two institutions, together with the Council, building this thrilling project which is Europe. A project which ultimately seeks peace and to guarantee freedom, democracy, human rights, human dignity, on our continent, but which also wishes to be a beacon and to support our values, our principles and our aspirations at international level.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that we see the Commission, and we all agree on this, as the true heart of this European project. But this heart beats thanks to the support it receives systematically in this Parliament. This Commission, which has been key to promoting enlargement, this Commission, which throughout these years has been able to promote a cooperative, collaborative and respectful working relationship with Parliament and also with the other essential institution, the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these are historic days and moments. Days which will remain in our memory, which will be an example for future generations: everybody working as one – Parliament, Council and Commission – for this great project, for this great ambition which is Europe.</p>

A freely-elected European parliament, representing 25 self-aware, free and sovereign European nations, having voluntarily bound themselves together in an association, goes far beyond the boldest hopes of those who first dreamed and thought of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">More now than ever, am I convinced that this great enlargement, which has now been completed, is a shining example of the attractiveness, dynamism and youth of the European ideal, an ideal that has not grown old, and whose attractiveness is demonstrated by the nations that have had to walk a hard road in search of freedom, democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">This enlargement is also evidence of what we Europeans can do when, together, we get stuck in to a great project and when we have the will to see it through to completion.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There were not many who thought we would do it, and we can take pride in what has been achieved. As I see it, this is final proof that the idea of European integration has a future.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of popular beliefs going around at the moment, and I would like to lay them to rest. Firstly, European integration is not an elite project; this enlargement, in any case, was a matter of the peoples’ express desire and stated will. It would not have come about had not the peoples of the Baltic states, the Poles, the Czechs, the Slovaks, the Hungarians and the Slovenes made it unequivocally plain that they wanted to belong, once and for all, to the democratic family that the united Europe is, rather than to be left isolated in the no-man’s-land between East and West.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this great enlargement makes Europe stronger rather than weaker, both in political and economic terms. There are risks and problems involved in it, as well we all know, but the chances and opportunities far outweigh the risks, and we have good cause to be optimistic. Those of you, honourable Members, who hail from the new Member States will have a difficult task back home; you will encounter scepticism and doubt because things are not going as quickly as people would like. Whether or not the belief in European integration will remain strong enough to sustain future great projects will, to a large degree, depend on you.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, joining in this great work of integrating Europe does not mean the surrender of sovereignty or of national identity. Those who – in both the new and old Member States – assert that European integration means the end of popular sovereignty do not understand the world as it is today. Not one country in Europe today is capable, on its own, of dealing with the problems that beset us.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Not one country in Europe can cope with the consequences of globalisation on its own. Not one country can single-handedly balance growth and social justice. Not one country can, relying on itself alone, win the war against terrorism and international crime. We can only do it together. National sovereignty can be exercised and defended only if it is exercised jointly with others. That is the fundamental idea, and that is why we are here.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank all those who have played their part in getting us this far, especially your House and your President, Pat Cox, who has given you firm political leadership. I wish to thank the committees, particularly the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and its Chairman, Mr Brok. My thanks go to all the political groups that have been with us throughout in a critical and constructive spirit. From the depths of my heart, I welcome you all here and rejoice at being able to work with you.</p>

It is my privilege to have been a Member of this House ever since 1979, when it was, for the first time, directly elected. If, during the 1979 election campaign, somebody had said that, on 1 May 2004, the European Union’s Member States would include three nations occupied by the Soviet Union – those being Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Warsaw Pact states of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, part of Communist Yugoslavia, not to mention Malta and Cyprus – the latter of which will, we hope, one not too distant day be a united country – then, in 1979, when the European Parliament was directly elected for the first time, our answer would probably have been that this was a lovely vision, a wonderful dream, and a great hope, but that we feared that this dream, this vision, this hope – much though we desired it – would not become reality in our lifetime.</p>
<p class="contents">That dream has become reality. The fact that we are able, today, to welcome 162 Members of this Parliament from these 10 countries makes this a great day for democracy, and a great deal for parliamentarianism. Let us rejoice that we can welcome as colleagues our new Members today!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that it was our House, with every political group playing its part, that insisted that we would be negotiating not merely with five countries but with 12, and that those who were not yet ready would be given the opportunity to catch up. The fact that ten countries have joined the European Union today is attributable to our demand, in this House, that the negotiations should include Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia, and they have made it. We should congratulate them all.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that, as we know, the reports on the European Parliament in the media do not always reflect the decisions taken in it.</p>
<p class="contents">It was our House that demanded a timetable for the negotiations – which the Commission and the Nice Summit accepted – so that they could be completed in time, enabling the countries capable of doing so, and their people, to take part in the 2004 elections to the European Parliament. It was our House that did that! That is what we should be telling people, and it is something of which we can be proud, for it helps to make democracy real in Europe and to give the people of the ten countries the opportunity to send freely-elected representatives to the European Parliament. Let us rejoice in that!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Everyday life will soon catch up with us, and, necessary though great speeches are, it is not by them that Europe is maintained. Today is a wonderful day, as 1 May was, but everyday life will soon overtake us; we will discuss things, we will argue about things too, but we, the people of the European Union, must remind ourselves of what is new and represents a great opportunity; that the great thing about this European Union is that our discussions and arguments are now carried on with words, no longer by force and weaponry. That is a great step forward for our continent of Europe in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My dear friends … perhaps my addressing you as ‘dear friends’ was a slip of the tongue, and I apologise, but we do somehow belong to one another through our shared ideal of European unity. At the impressive ceremony outdoors, Mr President, we heard not only from you, with your impressive speech, but from Lech Walesa. He embodies solidarity, and solidarity must mean for all of us a future in which we of course have to respect the national interests of individual countries, such as those of the Baltic States with their minorities, whilst not jeopardising those countries’ independence, an obligation that is reciprocal. Anything else, therefore, we have to speak out against, as Commissioner Verheugen has done, and I would like to thank him for making the important point that this Europe of ours in founded upon solidarity. That will benefit all of us. For the first time in its long millennia of history, this continent has the opportunity to face the future in peace and partnership. This is our continent, an ancient continent endlessly renewing itself, and nobody will succeed in dividing us. Side by side, we walk into the future together; this is a great day for us all!</p>

<p class="contents">First of all, Mr President, I would like to thank you and congratulate you because you have been a worthy representative of the European Parliament during these events. I would also like to thank and congratulate the Prodi Commission and in particular Commissioner Verheugen for having pushed ahead with this task.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have a date with history and with our future. By means of the decisive step we took last Saturday we are taking a great and historic step forward by bringing together the majority of the landmass and population of our continent, for the first time in history, without an emperor, a king, a general or a dictator deciding to do so. This is a decision taken freely by all of us. And that is what makes the difference. We have heard the Ode to Joy by Beethoven, who was also someone who fought for freedom, and political censorship made him change the word <span class="italic">Freiheit</span> to <span class="italic">Freude</span>, and I therefore believe that we should call it the Ode to Joy and Freedom, because it is freedom which has united all of us.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have been able to take this step because we believe in democracy, in freedom, in respect for human rights, in governance, in the rule of law and in a secular Union which respects everybody's beliefs and philosophies. This is what has allowed us to unite in these circumstances. It is democracy that has allowed this to happen. Nor must we forget that on this continent we have lived through a twentieth century which has been the age of extremes and during part of which Nazi, fascist and communist dictatorships have predominated. First there was the liberation of Europe following the world war and then a chain reaction which has been gathering pace; little more than a week ago we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Revolution of the Carnations in Portugal, which was a key event in terms of ending the dictatorship of Salazar; then my country joined ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... then we had <span class="italic">Solidarność</span> in Poland; then came the fall of the Berlin Wall and now we are consolidating what we have done following that event, with the entry of the ten new Members. My Greek colleagues point out to me that they also defeated a fascist dictatorship, I believe that we can all congratulate ourselves because we have had to fight to win freedom and I also hope that now, with the entry of the ten new Members we can complete this historic process and that we do not have to wait long for the Republic of Cyprus to be reunited, since this too is an essential step.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Never before in European history have so many people lived together in peace, democracy, under the rule of law and on the basis of a shared sovereignty and destiny.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is being reborn. This is a great challenge and a process of historic construction of the greatest importance, not only to live interdependently, but also to respond to globalisation; Europe has a great deal to contribute. We have great challenges before us; firstly, to overcome our own fears, and we must not forget that the general public does have these fears; we must work to educate and explain, pointing out that the opportunities far outweigh the costs, and that we are prepared to confront that complexity. Why? Because there is a spirit of solidarity and furthermore foundations which maintain us and fortify us through shared values. Shared values which are based on mutual tolerance and fraternity.</p>
<p class="contents">The engagement – a long one – has come to an end, and we have wed. We now share the same house and the same future. Now we are a family with not just the same rights, but also with the same obligations, and this applies to those that were present at the outset, those of us that have joined, such as my own country and others, and those that are joining now.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the best thing we could do to end this legislature and move on to this Europe of 25 Member States is to ensure the conclusion of the process of definitively approving the European Constitution which, fortunately, has been unblocked since March. I am justifiably proud to come from a country that has allowed the deadlock to be broken. I believe we should call on the Council, which is unfortunately absent today, and the Intergovernmental Conference, which you will have to address, Mr President, to fulfil its duty and its historic responsibility so that we may have a European Constitution by June. That is the next stage, which will complete this successful round of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I hold out my hand as a mark of friendship to all our new friends and colleagues joining us today.</p>
