<p>The ST Microelectronics group, 34% of whose capital is held by Italy and France, had a turnover of about 3.8 billion euro and a net profit of 187 million euro in the first half of 2003. The group apparently received 542.6 million euro in public subsidies from France and Italy and 90 million euro from the European Union. Despite its good economic performance and public financial support, the group's management has decided since summer 2003 to relocate some production activities to Singapore, close the Rennes site in France (600 jobs) and reorganise these activities by closing down the production site at Castelletto in Italy and shifting the work to Agrate, with the loss of 321 jobs at Agrate and 115 at Castelletto.</p>

<p>(EN) As the Honourable Member correctly points out, the Council did not reach agreement on the Commission proposal of July 2003 which aimed at establishing detailed implementing provisions for Community funded research activities involving human embryos and human embryonic stem cells. Any decision to fund such research projects are therefore based on the European Parliament and Council Decision of 27 June 2002 on the Sixth Framework Programme, as well as on the Council Decision of 30 September 2002 in respect of the relevant Specific Research Programme, ‘Integrating and strengthening the European Research Area’.</p>
<p>These Decisions provide the framework for the examination by the Commission of proposals for research projects and exclude certain activities, such as reproductive cloning and modification to the genetic heritage of human beings, from Community funding. Moreover, research banned in a given Member State may not receive Community funding in that Member State. However, the Decisions adopted in 2002 do not explicitly ban research activities involving human embryonic stem cells, provided that such activities fall within the scope of the specific programme.</p>
<p>As to the other specific question raised, the honourable Member will be aware that the research programme is managed and implemented by the Commission. In this role the Commission is assisted by the Programme Committees composed of representatives of Member States. In particular, proposals for research projects involving human embryonic stem cells are dealt with under the regulatory committee procedure in accordance with the Council Decision of 28 June 1999. Under this procedure, the Commission refers proposals for projects to the Council if there is no agreement at the Committee level and the Council may, by a qualified majority, oppose such proposals.</p>
<p>Over and above the committee arrangements, the Council has no competence in the management of the research programme and the honourable Member is advised, therefore, to turn to the</p>
<p>Commission for any further information on the Commission’s intentions on stem cell research. For these reasons the Council has no plans to come back to this issue in the near future.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as the honourable Member will be aware, the current programme Decisions expire in 2006, after which subsequent programmes will be subject to Decisions by the European Parliament and the Council on the basis of proposals from the Commission. The debate will most probably be renewed in that context.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0023"></a>

<p>On 21 March 2003, the Constitutional Court of Malta, at the request of an injured party, gave a definition of 'residence' (the Cassola Case, Judge Tonio Mallia, Case No 6/2003/1: Harry Vassallo vs the Electoral Commission and John Mary Magro). The definition given by the Malta Constitutional court reads: ‘the word 'residence' does not mean physical presence in the country’.</p>
<p>Moreover, the new law on European elections in Malta, (Act No XVI of 2003, published in the Malta Government Gazette of 26 November 2003) explicitly states that all Maltese citizens living in the 25 EU countries have a right to vote and stand for election in Malta.</p>

<p>(EN) Following the commitments undertaken by Iran relating to measures aimed at the settlement of all outstanding IAEA issues with regard to its nuclear programme on the occasion of the visit by the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom to Tehran on 21 October 2003, the Council reiterated in the conclusions of its meeting of 8 December 2003 the EU‘s readiness to explore ways to develop wider political and economic cooperation with Iran. The Council emphasised that this can only be achieved through full international confidence in Iran’s adherence to non-proliferation and, in particular, in the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme, as well as improvements in the areas of human rights, fight against terrorism, and Iran’s position on the Middle East Peace Process. It was in the context of this policy approach that the High Representative welcomed the signature on 18 December 2003 by Iran of an Additional Protocol to its IAEA Safeguards Agreement as an important step in building international confidence about the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme. The Italian Presidency also reiterated this view in a statement it issued at the time.</p>
<p>High Representative Solana visited Iran on 12/13 January, to discuss the modalities of taking forward the EU’s dialogue with Iran in all areas, as requested by the Council in December. It was agreed to continue discussions on how to take forward dialogue in all areas.</p>
<p>At its last meeting on 26 January 2004, the Council also welcomed steps taken by Iran and particularly the signature and commitment to implement an Additional Protocol to the IAEA Safeguards Agreement and underlined the need for Iran to fully comply with the IAEA Board of Governors' resolution adopted last November.</p>
<p>The Council noted that the EU followed the political situation in Iran with great attention and encouraged a resolution of the situation which would allow free and fair elections. Finally, the Council announced that it would continue closely to follow these issues and awaited in particular the next report on Iran's nuclear programme by the IAEA Director-General, which is expected later this month.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0048"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council thanks the honourable Member for his attentive follow-up to this proposal for a Regulation.</p>
<p>The Council also attributes great importance to this matter and has taken due note of the request made by the European Parliament on 13 January 2003.</p>
<p>After intensive discussions the Council held an exchange of views at its meeting on Competitiveness on 19 May 2003 on the amended proposal for a Regulation concerning sales promotions in the Internal Market, notably on the basis of a compromise text submitted by the Greek Presidency.</p>
<p>At that Council meeting delegations generally considered that the compromise could be regarded as a step in the right direction. They confirmed progress made so far and identified the main remaining problems to be discussed further, particularly the scope of the proposal (notably in relation to application of the principle of mutual recognition) and provisions regarding promotional games. However, a number of points are still under discussion, and the subject of differing standpoints, such as the form of the act (regulation or directive) or the link stressed by some between this proposal and the framework proposal on unfair commercial practices.</p>
<p>That link was confirmed by the majority of delegations when the latter proposal for a Directive was submitted to the Council in June 2003, and more precisely during the policy debate held on the subject at the Competitiveness Council meeting on 10 November 2003.</p>
<p>The Irish Presidency has voiced its determination to take these two proposals forward in parallel, pointing out the importance of ensuring consistency between them. It intends to resume examination of the proposal concerning sales promotions in March 2004, in the light, in particular, of the progress made with the proposal concerning unfair commercial practices.</p>
<p>The Irish Presidency will continue most particularly to cooperate with the European Parliament on this matter so that Community legislation is adopted at the earliest opportunity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0052"></a>

<p>(EN) One of the priorities of the Irish Presidency is to make progress in working towards agreement on the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation. The pending issues which are still being addressed, relate to its headquarters, legal status, its administrative staffing, the setting up of an Advisory Committee, the appointment of an Executive Director as well as its financial resources. As agreed at the Euromed Ministerial Conference in Naples in December 2003, the pending issues are to be tackled according to the following schedule:</p>
<p>The Foundation and its related bodies, i.e. Board of Governors, the Advisory Committee, Executive Director, and administrative staff, will be established within six months (i.e. by 1 July 2004). To this end, each partner will set up its own national network of institutions involved in the dialogue between cultures and civilisations.</p>
<p>By 1 July 2004, the Board of Governors (Euromed Committee) will present the general guidelines for the work of the Foundation, and approve the nomination of the Executive Director.</p>
<p>Before 30 September 2004, the Executive Director will submit to the Board of Governors (Euromed Committee) the Foundation start-up procedures, along with the draft plan of activity for the first three-year period.</p>
<p>The Statute of the Foundation, to be prepared by the Commission and the Council Legal Service, will have to be approved by the Board of Governors (Euromed Committee) and finalised once the Headquarters decision is taken.</p>
<p>The Commission will submit to the Board of Governors (Euromed Committee) a shortlist of candidates after having taken into account partners' views concerning the appointment of the Executive Director.</p>
<p>In Naples, all partners confirmed the support for the launching of the Foundation which would be granted financial resources. It was agreed that the Commission would ensure a start-up grant of 5 Mio Euro under the MEDA programme (regional component) provided that voluntary contributions by partner countries would be at least equivalent to the same amount.</p>
<p>Regarding the Headquarters, the Euromed Committee, as instructed by the Naples Ministerial, will continue work with a view to a decision to be taken at the next Mid-Term Ministerial to be held in Dublin on 5-6 May 2004.</p>
<p>As indicated in the Crete Mid-Term Ministerial Conference conclusions and acknowledged by the Naples Ministerial conclusions, the discussion on the objectives and activities of the Foundation will take into account the recommendations of the latest report of the High Level Advisory Group on Dialogue between Peoples and Cultures in the Euromed area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0053"></a>

<p>(EN) Negotiations on an Association Agreement have been underway since 1998 between the European Union and Syria. The Council is hopeful that the agreement can be finalised in the very near future, although difficulties still need to be overcome on certain political aspects of the agreement.</p>
<p>Syria is the only Euro-Mediterranean partner which has not yet concluded an Association Agreement with the European Union. Once an Agreement has been signed, ratified and entered into force, it would complete the network of Association Agreements concluded with the Euro-Mediterranean partners, who are members of the Barcelona Process, bringing us closer to shaping the Euro-Mediterranean area envisaged in the Barcelona Declaration.</p>
<p>In comparison to the existing Co-operation Agreement from 1977, this Euro-Mediterranean Agreement would considerably enhance bilateral relations between the European Union and Syria. As with all of the Union’s Association Agreements, it would cover cooperation in a broad number of areas, political, economic, social and cultural. It should lay the basis for economic and political reform and prepare Syria for integration into the world economy.</p>
<p>An agreement would also establish an appropriate framework for conducting a regular political dialogue with Syria. The standard provision on respect for the democratic principles and fundamental human rights established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights would be an essential element of the Agreement. In addition, cooperation on counter-terrorism would be provided for. In line with the Council’s decision of 17 November 2003, it would also include, as another essential element, a clause providing for cooperation in countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. All these elements would lay the basis for engaging in a real dialogue.</p>
<p>On that basis this agreement would foster the political, economic and social development of Syria, as well as encourage cooperation both within the Euro-Mediterranean framework and at the sub-regional level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0059"></a>

<p>According to several participants at the last Fisheries Council, some of the measures the Commission had proposed were rejected.

<p>However, four days later, on 23 December 2003, the Commission presented a proposal establishing recovery measures for hake and Norway lobster in the Bay of Biscay and areas to the west of the Iberian Peninsular. It is hard line proposal, which provides for annual cuts of up to 25% in Norway lobster catches, establishes five closed areas and fixed limits on kilowatt-days, is scientifically unsound (the Commission acknowledges not knowing the biomass and appears not to have consulted the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee on Fisheries when drawing up the proposal) and does not include financial aid to the fishing fleet, which will be severely affected by such measures and numbers over three thousand vessels in the Bay of Biscay and 213 in the Gulf of Cadiz.</p>

Thus the above-mentioned Proposal presented by the Commission to the Council is within its remit. The Proposal is based on the most recent scientific advice from ICES.

<p>These payments have been made for the following operational programmes: Energy, Research and Technology, Continuous Training, Telecommunications, Health, Education and Training, Public Administration, Fisheries, Technical Assistance, Bus CGC, Private Infrastructures in Northern Greece, Urban Development and Community Initiatives: Retex, Konver II, Leader II, Adapt, Urban, Employment, Rechar II, Pesca, Interreg IIc-Drought.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to examine the remaining programmes, closure of which is expected during the first half of 2004.</p>
<p>European Social Fund (ESF)</p>
<p>On 31 March 2003, the appropriations still to be paid for the ESF stood at EUR 365 million.</p>
<p>The Greek authorities requested payments in the sum of EUR 315 million.</p>
<p>The difference of EUR 50 million has therefore been officially agreed to.</p>
<p>The EUR 315 million correspond to 24 Operational Programmes and 12 Community Initiatives.</p>
<p>The examination of these requests to date have led to the payment of EUR 295 million and an additional sum of EUR 9.7 million has been agreed to.</p>
<p>The requests relating to Operational Programmes ‘Epirus’ and ‘Telecommunications’, which involve a sum of EUR 10.3 million, are currently being dealt with.</p>
<p>European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund – Guidance Section (EAGGF-Guidance)</p>
<p>The total sum requested by the Greek authorities in relation to the eighteen operational programmes and Community initiatives of the CSF II payable by EAGGF-Guidance amounted to EUR 123.28 million.</p>
<p>The procedure for examining the final reports and requests for payment are under way and the responses of the Greek authorities to the Commission’s observations have just arrived with the relevant services.</p>
<p>If the responses received are deemed to be satisfactory, the closure of the programmes will be carried out during the first half of 2004.</p>
<p>Financial instrument for fisheries guidance (FIFG)</p>
<p>The total sum requested on 31 March 2003 by the Greek authorities in relation to the OP/Fisheries and the Community initiative programme (CIP)/Pesca stood at EUR 7.34 million of FIFG aid.</p>
<p>(In an initial analysis, the Commission had estimated that it would have to reduce this sum to EUR 7.2 million).</p>
<p>The additional information awaited will allow a detailed analysis of the final reports to be carried out with a view to closing the said programmes and setting the precise amount of Community aid during the first half of 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) There are still a number of trade barriers in intra-Community trade of precious metals due to diverging national rules.

<p>The traditions in Member States are strong and divergent with about half of Member States applying certification by a third party and the other half focussing on post market surveillance of manufacturer declarations.</p>

Consequently, more and more items of footwear are thrown away as refuse. This is environmentally irresponsible and costly to the consumer. In the light of these developments, can a fresh evaluation be conducted in which footwear makers' associations are also involved?

<p>(EN) Directive 94/11/EC<a href="#defann_22_2" name="refann_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> imposes obligations on the Member States regarding the implementation of procedures relating to labelling of the materials used in the main components of footwear for sale to the consumer.</p>
<p>The aim of the Directive is to protect and inform the public as well as to ensure that the internal market functions harmoniously.</p>
<p>The evaluation report<a href="#defann_22_3" name="refann_22_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> the honourable Member refers to, is based on Article 6(4) of the Directive. Under this Article, the Commission must submit to the Council, three years after the Directive has been brought into application, an assessment report.</p>
<p>The report:</p>
<p>(a) must take into consideration any difficulties which may have been encountered by operators when implementing the provisions of the Directive, and</p>
<p>(b) present, should the need arise, appropriate proposals for review.</p>
<p>The report is based on two main sources of information:</p>
<p>(a) the data provided by the Member States in response to a letter from the Commission and (b) a questionnaire sent to the trade associations in the footwear sector and consumer associations on the qualitative aspects of implementation at national level.</p>
<p>The conclusions of the report were that the Directive 94/11/EC had demonstrated its ability to provide an adequate level of consumer information and protection and to ensure the free movement of footwear throughout the EU. Harmonisation of the legislation of the various Member States on a minimum common labelling system had enabled manufacturers to provide consumers with better information and increased transparency. Thus, the objectives clearly expressed in 1994 in the regulatory text – i.e. to harmonise the rules governing footwear and permit free movement – were considered as having been achieved.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in 2000 there appeared to be no justification for amending the Directive. In this context, it must be stressed that the evaluation in 2000 was based on a one-off obligation in the Directive and concerned implementation. Therefore, there is no need to repeat the evaluation.</p>
<p>As to the Directive being out-dated due to development of new materials, there are four pictograms for materials used for footwear:</p>
<p>leather,</p>
<p>coated leather,</p>
<p>natural textile materials and synthetic or non-woven textile materials, and</p>
<p>all other materials.</p>
<p>These pictograms are used all over the world, not just by the EU. New materials are being developed all the time and developing new pictograms for each new material would easily lead to confusion. It must be remembered that the aim of the Directive is consumer information.</p>
<p>As to impact on environment, the Commission would draw the attention of the honourable Member to the European eco-label. This is a voluntary scheme enabling European consumers including public and private purchasers, to easily identify officially approved green products across the EU, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. It allows producers to show and communicate to their customers that their products respect the environment. Footwear is one of the product groups for which the manufacturer can apply for an eco-label<a href="#defann_22_4" name="refann_22_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. In order to put the eco-label on the footwear, the manufacturer has to respect a set of criteria. One of these criteria is exclusion of substances harmful for the environment and health. As to durability issue, the eco-label also includes clear criteria for performance and durability of footwear.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Commission is always open to proposals that aim at improving the protection of environment and consumer information.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission's proposals concerning the olive oil, cotton and tobacco crops produced in the Mediterranean will, as they stand at present, lead to a drastic shrinkage in production and to the collapse of the associated social and economic fabric in the most disadvantaged Objective 1 regions.

Furthermore, the Commission has not put forward any serious proposals with a view to retraining agricultural workers who lose their jobs and it is trying to modify certain COMs which have operated satisfactorily.</p>

<p>(FR) In accordance with the conclusions of the Agriculture Council of June 2003, the Commission is committed to proposing a reform of the current common organisations of the market (COM) in olive oil, cotton and tobacco, which will provide for:</p>
<p>the inclusion of these products in the new support mechanisms adopted on 29 September 2003 within the context of the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) which provides in particular for the promotion of the competitiveness of European agriculture, its orientation towards the market and its sustainable development, while improving the effectiveness of the income support for producers;</p>
<p>responses to some of the criticisms made of the current COMs both by the institutions responsible for the control of Community policies (the Court of Auditors, OLAF …) and by an increasing number of politicians and citizens.</p>
<p>In order to analyse all the direct and indirect implications of such a reform, both in the production sector and in sectors and regions dependent on it, the Commission has carried out a preliminary economic analysis and in particular has published an in-depth impact study of three options for reform in the case of tobacco.</p>
<p>Within the context of these studies, an in-depth analysis has been carried out including, in particular, an examination of the issue of employment. This issue was also emphasised by the local representatives of the producing regions at a tobacco forum organised by the Commission on 4 June 2003 and at a seminar involving all three sectors, which took place on 10 and 11 November 2003, which brought together representatives of all the interested parties.</p>
<p>The analytical tools available to the Commission indicate that the proposed decoupling of the current aid will not have a negative impact on the revenue of farms. The productive reorientation of farms, and specifically the abandonment of production by farms whose market receipts do not cover the variable costs of production, may have a negative impact on jobs in the upstream and downstream sectors linked to the economy in these products. However, the Commission recognises the importance of this production for the economic survival of certain regions and wishes to prevent the negative impact on local employment of a modification of the current form of support. This is why it has proposed that a proportion of the funding currently allocated in the form of direct aid to production should be dedicated to maintaining olive groves in sensitive areas and aid for production in the case of cotton. It is also the reason why the Commission has proposed a mechanism for transfer of funds in the case of tobacco and cotton (the respective sums being EUR 205 million and EUR 103 million per year<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>) intended to increase the current rural development funds which benefit the producing regions, including Andalusia, and thereby promote their economic diversification with a view to guaranteeing the maintenance of jobs there.</p>
<p>In accordance with the functioning of the rural development programmes, which is based on a significant degree of subsidiarity, the definition of restructuring programmes will be the responsibility of the Members States in question, who will thereby be able to adapt them to their specific needs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Investment in human capital is a fundamental priority for the EU, and in the Employment Guidelines adopted by the Member States on 22 July 2003, special attention was paid to the need to foster the integration of people facing particular difficulties on the labour market, including early school leavers.

<p>(EN) The role and importance of lifelong learning and specifically of reducing the number of young people leaving school early receives a high profile in the new European Employment Strategy. The specific guideline includes a target of 'an EU average rate of no more than 10% early school leavers'<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> by 2010. In 2002, the relevant figure stood at 18.8%, only a slight improvement on 2001 (19.4%).</p>
<p>Member States must report annually in their National Action Plans for Employment on policies they are adopting to help achieve this target. Any assessment by the Commission and Council of insufficient policy action results in a specific recommendation to the Member State in question.</p>
<p>Member States submitted their latest National Action Plans for Employment to the Commission in October 2003. They have been assessed by the Commission and the draft Joint Employment Report 2003/2004, which contains the assessment, was adopted on 21 January 2004. On that basis the Commission will also prepare its proposals for country-specific recommendations, to be adopted by the Commission in April 2004, and later on by the Council.</p>
<p>Policies to reduce early school leavers generally fall under subsidiarity territory, but Member State policies are often co-financed by the European Social Fund (ESF). With the increase in profile given by the 2010 target, ESF co-financing could only increase in the next programming period, post 2006.</p>
<p>The schemes adopted by the Member States in the framework of both their social cohesion and education policies include measures for preventing school disaffection and supporting weaker pupils, including second chance opportunities. The Commission supports such strategies in particular through its action programmes Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci and Youth for Europe. One of the priorities of the Socrates-Comenius action for school education in 2004, for example, is to support school achievement by helping teachers to gain better skills in specific areas, such as guidance and counselling, conflict management or intercultural education.</p>
<p>The future action of the Commission will also specifically take into account the content of the Resolution adopted by the Education Council in November 2003 on making school an open learning environment to prevent and combat school disaffection and to encourage the social inclusion of young people. The Commission will therefore promote measures designed to make school an open place of learning and to support joint activities between schools and other public and private bodies in order to encourage communication between generations and to enable young people to test their aptitudes and attain personal and social fulfilment. It will support the training of teachers in pursuing complementarity and interaction between formal and non-formal learning.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Resolution, the Commission will also strengthen the complementarity and integration of the Community programmes and promote the exchange of good partnership practices. Through such programmes it will encourage school initiatives aimed at making young people aware of social problems and instilling in them a commitment to social welfare and an interest for voluntary work.</p>
<p>Reducing early school leaving also largely depends on the quality and effectiveness of the education systems. It is therefore a relevant indicator for assessing education policies in Europe and a major element in the achievement of the strategic objectives for the education systems as pursued by the Member States and the Commission. In this framework, the Commission will therefore help to enhance cooperation between Member States on the priorities of the objectives process, in order to support informal learning and the prevention of early school leaving, and will foster the inclusion, within the framework of the new Community programmes, of measures which pursue the aims of the Council Resolution.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) First, the Commission would like to confirm to the honourable Member that it is aware of the occurrence of the disease called 'Sudden Oak Death' in the United Kingdom on four trees.</p>
<p>The Commission is very concerned by this finding.</p>
<p>The disease is caused by Phytophthora ramorum, a newly described fungus in the genus Phytophthora, which includes that causing potato blight. However, the fungi affect different plants. The fungus causing sudden oak death can also affect other species such as beech, horse chestnut, Rhododendron and Viburnum.</p>
<p>As regards Community actions, the Commission took provisional phytosanitary emergency measures in September 2002 in response to outbreaks of 'Sudden Oak Death' on ornamental plants (like Rhododendron and Viburnum) in nurseries in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany.</p>
<p>These measures aim to prevent the introduction into and subsequent spread of the organism within the Community. The measures apply to the susceptible hosts which could potentially transmit the disease, the inspection of plants at the border and in nurseries in the Community, the movement of some highly susceptible ornamental plants such as Rhododendron and Viburnum as well as to a general survey within the Member States for the presence of the organism.</p>
<p>The results of the survey, carried out in 2003, have shown that the disease is also present sporadically in the wider natural and semi-natural environment, and also affects trees growing in forests and woodland, such as oak and beech. This is new for Europe. Until recently, the disease had only been found in ornamental plants.</p>
<p>Based on the results of these surveys, the Commission is preparing modifications to Community legislation in order to improve the protection of the Community landscape and of nurseries growing susceptible plants. These will be presented for discussion and possible vote in one of the forthcoming meetings of the Standing Committee on Plant Health.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission can assure the honourable Member that it will continue to follow the situation closely in order to act appropriately when necessary, and would hope that the fungus does not cause the type of devastation seen in the 1840s as referred to by the honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0860"></a>

<p>(EN) In response to the honourable Member’s question concerning the refusal of a satellite TV shopping channel which is received in the United Kingdom and Ireland to sell goods in the latter country, the Commission is of the opinion that neither Directive 93/83/EEC nor Directive 89/352/EEC as amended by Directive 97/36/EC are relevant in this case. As stated by the honourable Member both Directives have the objective to facilitate crossborder transmission of broadcast services, but do not regulate questions relating to sale of goods associated with those services.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Treaty’s provisions on free movement do not oblige such a broadcaster to extend his sale of goods to other Member States where his signal can be received as 'overspill'. Though the Commission does not know the details of the case that the honourable Member refers to, it considers that such refusals to take orders may be justified by the broadcaster not having an adequate distribution and logistics operations in that 'overspill' market. Indeed, without such operations the broadcaster cannot effectively process and fulfil orders to the standards that he/she aspires to and, more significantly, he/she may therefore not meet the distance selling regulatory requirements as harmonised in Directive 97/7/EC.

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to remind the honourable Member that it is indeed committed to the principle of transparency, and that in the concrete case he refers to, it has made available to Mr Ronnan a list of names of persons who attended the meeting of October 1996 and had submitted documents in the framework of the enquiry the Commission carried out following Mr Ronnan’s complaint on the question of United Kingdom guest beer. The Commission has only withheld the names of those persons that explicitly objected to such disclosure and those that could not be reached. In this respect, it needs to be stressed that the Commission is bound not only by the principle of transparency, but also by the right of an individual to the protection of his or her personal data.</p>
<p>This fundamental right is recognized by Article 8 of the European Charter of Fundamental rights and has been implemented by the data protection rules, Directive 95/46/EEC and Regulation 45/2001. Those rules impose an assessment of all the circumstances of each case to be carried out, and a balance between the rights and interests at stake must be struck. Mr Ronnan had been fully informed of the interests and bodies represented at the meeting. Therefore, the Commission felt that his legitimate right to be informed had been met and that the right of the individuals who attended the meeting prevented disclosure of their names without their consent.</p>
<p>Moreoever, Mr Ronnan requested to receive the names of persons who provided information to the Commission in relation with infringement proceedings. According to the rules on access to documents the Commission should refuse access to a document where disclosure would undermine the protection of the purpose of inspections, investigations and audits, unless there is an overriding public interest in disclosure. In an infringement procedure, such as the Bavarian Lager case, the Commission’s duty is to obtain as much information on the case as possible, and some persons who may have valuable information may only be prepared to provide it if their anonymity is guaranteed. This is parallel to the right to a confidential handling of a complaint, which is recognised to all complainants, including Mr Ronnan, not only by the Commission, but also by the Ombudsman and by this Parliament. In fact, the Commission would not be in a position to play its role as guardian of the Treaty if it could not guarantee confidentiality to persons willing to supply the information it needed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0002"></a>

<p>The publication condemns the latest amendment to the Criminal Code, which is intended to prevent the President of the Basque Government holding a referendum of the Basque people, and to cast him into prison if he does so.

<p>(EN) The President of the Commission has emphasised on numerous occasions over the past months that the Commission remains fully committed to tackling all forms of religious discrimination and intolerance in the Union, including anti-Semitism. In a statement on Holocaust Memorial Day on 26 January 2004, President Prodi supported the proposal that a European Day of Remembrance be set aside in each country to remember the victims of the Holocaust and the struggle against all crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>The seminar which the honourable Member refers to in his question has not been cancelled and will take place in Brussels on 19 February 2004. Key themes which will be addressed include the historical and cultural identity of European Jewry; religious dialogue; anti-Semitism today; and Europe and Israel.</p>
<p>In addition to this initiative, there is a range of polices, programmes and action at European level to support the fight against discrimination and intolerance in the EU. Two new Directives, one which prohibits discrimination in employment on the grounds, inter alia, of religion or belief and the other which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of racial and ethnic origin have entered into force across the Union and will apply to the acceding Member States from 1 May 2004. For many States this will mean for the first time the creation of a strong legislative framework to tackle such forms of discrimination. The new legislation is supported by a €100 million action programme which funds a range of projects, studies and awareness-raising activities in the field of combating discrimination.</p>
<p>In addition, Member States are still considering the Commission's proposal for a framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia. This proposal aims to establish an EU-wide approximation of penal laws on racist and xenophobic offences and to allow for judicial cooperation between Member States on these issues.</p>
<p>Measures to combat anti-Semitism are also funded through the Youth programme which has as one of its key aims to promote respect for human rights and to combat racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia.</p>
<p>Responsibility for monitoring incidents of racism and xenophobia lies with the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. As the honourable Member may know the Monitoring Centre intends to publish in the coming months a comprehensive report on anti-Semitism based on interviews with Jewish leaders across the EU as well as data on anti-Semitism collected over a two-year time period.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0010"></a>

<p>(EN) With regard to the honourable Member’s question on the link between the World Trade Organisation (WTO) challenge on the Union’s authorisation system for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and GM food and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, the Commission views this Protocol as a very important development, being the first international legally binding agreement on the trade of genetically modified goods.</p>
<p>The Protocol establishes an Advance Informed Agreement (AIA) procedure for imports of living modified organisms (LMOs) intended for deliberate release into the environment and lays down detailed information and documentation requirements.</p>
<p>The relationship between the Protocol and trade agreements is addressed by the last three recitals of the Preamble. They recall the concept of mutual supportiveness between trade and environment, that rights and obligations of Parties under international law remain unchanged and that the Protocol is not subordinated to other international agreements.</p>
<p>The Cartagena Protocol could not be used to justify a general ban on import of GM crops. However, the precautionary approach could be invoked in order to delay, suspend or refuse the import of GMOs, to the extent that an assessment establishes the 'lack of scientific certainty due to insufficient relevant scientific information and knowledge' on the potential adverse effects of specific GMOs on biodiversity in the Party of Import, taking also into account risks to human health.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to recall that the Protocol allows the Parties to apply more stringent rules. The Union has over the last years developed a regulatory regime to ensure that GMOs are only put on the market on the basis of a careful assessment of risks. Under the existing Community regulatory framework, individual bans at Member States level on GM imports could not be justified. However, in some specific circumstances Member States can introduce temporary safeguard measures on GMOs or GM food, which are then subject to a Community decision on the merits.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0013"></a>

<p>(EN) The introduction of an origin-marking scheme for Community (and third countries’) products has in recent months been proposed or raised afresh by some industry sectors in the Union as well as by some Member States, Members of the European Parliament and of the Economic and Social Committee. Following several requests, the Commission submitted a Working Document to the Council’s 133 Committee on 19 December 2003 setting out possible options for a Community regulation on origin marking, inviting the Member States to do consultations domestically. The Commission has also sent the document to the Parliament (to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy) for consultation. It is available on the Commission’s website at :</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This Document is not presenting any concrete proposals but only launching a debate on the subject. The Commission would like to make it clear that there is no intention at all to prohibit the use of national origin markings on product packaging. The document does not question the continued use of national marks and labels which are important marketing tools.</p>
<p>This paper gives an overview on the pros and cons of a made in EU origin marking and indicates the options to be considered, namely:</p>
<p>the option of origin marking both for imports and domestic market products on a purely voluntary basis;</p>
<p>the approach of a mixed system with a compulsory origin marking for imports and a voluntary scheme for domestic products;</p>
<p>and the third option of a compulsory origin marking both for imports and for domestic products.</p>
<p>The Commission will consult consumers and industry in early 2004 and invites Member States to do likewise.</p>
<p>Currently, there is nothing to prevent voluntary origin marking either on domestic production or on imported goods where traders wish to indicate this for consumer information purposes.</p>
<p>In the case of agriculture products, there are some legal instruments for foodstuffs, both at national and Community level. Thus, Directive 2000/13/EC relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs provides for the mandatory indication of the place of origin or provenance, in case this omission can mislead consumers, and sets out a procedure at Community level for approval of measures envisaged at national level.</p>
<p>It is for all interested parties at the national and Community level to determine their interests in the issue of developing a Community regulation on origin marking and if they favour change, the nature and scope of any possible regulation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0014"></a>

<p>Does the Commission consider that Israel’s policy of determining origin in a manner that does not distinguish between production carried out in occupied territories and production carried out in the territory of the State of Israel is the critical obstacle? Is Israel still applying the Protocol on Rules of Origin in a manner that the EC cannot accept, systematically issuing proofs of origin for products that are not eligible for preferential treatment under Community law and insisting on its right to continue doing so? Does the Commission consider that amending that Protocol under such circumstances could undermine the EC’s right to require Israel to end its malpractice unless the amendments adopted expressly preclude the continuation of that malpractice or Israel otherwise undertakes to end it?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission has received no information to the effect that Israel has changed its practice with regard to the certification of origin.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the Commission believes that when amending the protocol on rules of origin to the EU-Israel agreement in view of the introduction of the pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation of origin, the issue of the origin of products from Israel must also be dealt with. The Commission has informed Israel of this position in the proper manner, and this position was reiterated at the last meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council on 18 November 2003.</p>
<p>While maintaining contacts with the interested parties, the Commission does not currently intend to introduce the concept of ‘qualified industrial zones’, as currently exist in Jordan in accordance with an agreement with the United States, into the EU agreements with Jordan and Israel. The issue of the possible connection with imports from Israeli settlements does not therefore arise.</p>
<p>While the EU recognises Israel’s right to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, it is opposed to the current route of the ‘wall of separation’ in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The abandonment of the route of the ‘green line’ could in fact prejudice future negotiations and make the solution of two States living side by side physically impossible to apply. The route makes the economic and humanitarian situation of many Palestinians even more difficult. The EU has expressed these positions clearly, particularly at the last EU-Israel Association Council in November 2003, and has asked Israel to comply with the provisions of international law as they relate to this.</p>
<p>The construction of this ‘wall of separation’ should not under any circumstances influence the work (carried out by the customs authorities of the Member States) of identifying products originating from Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The agreement on the development of the 10-year framework of programmes for sustainable consumption and production in the Johannesburg plan of implementation is one of the successes of Community at the World Summit on Sustainable Development. The Johannesburg plan of implementation calls for the development of 'a 10-year framework of programmes in support of national and regional initiatives'. In Johannesburg, the global community has recognised the importance of decoupling economic growth and environmental degradation. In addition the plan of implementation underlines that developed countries have a special responsibility in taking the lead in this regard.</p>
<p>In this context research has a leading role to play. The Sixth Framework Programme takes duly into account this dimension throughout the programme and the relevant thematic priorities.</p>
<p>Sustainable development is one of the driving forces of the Sixth Framework Programme highlighted mainly through thematic Priority 6 'Sustainable development, global change and ecosystems' (with a dedicated budget of 2120 € million) and partly through thematic Priority 3 ('Nanotechnology, Nanosciences, Knowledge based Materials, New production Processes and Devices' called shortly NMP with a budget of 1300 € million).</p>
<p>The NMP Priority of the Sixth Framework programme covers issues that are relevant to the research needs in the domain of 'Sustainable Consumption'. However it should be mentioned that this research domain was not open to cover large and ambitious research projects such as integrated projects. For example after its first call, one Specific Support Action (SSA) proposal entitled 'Feasibility and scope of life-cycle approaches to sustainable consumption' has been retained. The objective of the study is to provide the Community with an evaluation of how the life-cycle approach contributes to sustainable consumption and user awareness raising.</p>
<p>The domain Increasing the 'user awareness' for Sustainable Consumption remains open to Coordination Actions and Specific Support actions in the new work programme of 2004.</p>
<p>More generally, consumer organisations are explicitly mentioned under a number of topics in various thematic priorities as an important stakeholder group. Task descriptions for research activities frequently request proposals to take into consideration consumer perception, concerns and requirements. Also it is an explicit requirement for a number of tasks in the thematic priorities that the full-life cycle approach is covered.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission on 28 January 2004 adopted an ambitious Action Plan to improve the development and wider use of environmental technologies. Many new environmental technologies have great potential to improve the environment and, at the same time, boost the competitiveness of companies. The Action Plan aims to overcome the barriers hindering their development, including the complexity of switching from traditional to new technologies, and insufficient access to capital.</p>
<p>It will also represent a significant contribution to fulfilling the commitments on sustainable production and consumption agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0039"></a>

<p>At Sosnovy Bor, close to St Petersburg, there is a nuclear power plant with four 1000-MW reactors. They are all of the same RMBK type as at Chernobyl. At the insistence of the EU, the nuclear plant, at Ignalina in Lithuania, also of this type, will close when Lithuania joins the EU. According to a report published on 21 January 2004 by the environmental organisation Bellona, the Sosnovy Bor plant is characterised by poor working practices. Thefts have taken place there, for example, and the used nuclear fuel storage has been over-filled for several years. The plant is situated some 200 km from Helsinki and Tallinn. It constitutes a significant safety risk to Estonia and Finland in particular, but also to Europe as a whole. Last autumn the original operating permit for the oldest of the Sosnovy Bor reactors expired, and a request was made for it to be renewed for another 15 years.</p>

<p>(FR) At the Munich Summit in 1992, the G7 and the Union decided to help the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to improve the safety of the most recent nuclear plants, and called for the closure of the least safe plants.</p>
<p>The St Petersburg plant, located close to the town of Sosnovy Bor, has four RBMK-type reactors of which two are first-generation (put into service in 1973 and 1975) considered by experts not to meet recognised international safety standards. The Commission has always called for them to be closed as soon as possible, as well as other first-generation Soviet reactors.</p>
<p>In order to improve the level of safety of plants during the remaining period of their operation before their final closure, improvements have been made to these reactors partly as a result of TACIS funding - more than EUR 20 million for St Petersburg since 1994 - and BERD funding. In particular, the improvements involve protection against fire and safety systems allowing better control of reactivity and facilitating the shutdown of the reactor (enriching of fuel, efficiency of control clusters …) in order to prevent any further accidents such as Chernobyl. Nevertheless, the design of these reactors does not provide them with levels of safety which conform to Western standards and discussions are under way between the Commission and the Russian Government to negotiate the closure of these first-generation reactors.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposals have not so far received the favourable opinion of the Russian authorities, who refer amongst other things to the number of reactors in question (ten reactors, representing a quarter of the nuclear power installed) and the importance of nuclear energy to the development of the Russian economy (more than 15% of electricity produced is of nuclear origin).</p>
<p>The desire to extend the working life of plants beyond 30 years is a subject of great concern which demonstrates the difficulty of the negotiations under way between the Commission and the Russian Government. The safety of first-generation power stations is dealt with in the energy dialogue between the Union and Russia within the framework of the discussions on exchanges of electricity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0040"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission will continue to ensure that environmental aspects are taken into account in the financing of transport projects, notably within the scope of the proposed Trans-European Transport Networks.</p>
<p>Both Article 8 of the Decision of the Parliament and the Council (the TEN-T Guidelines (1996) as well as the new Article 8 envisaged by the proposal for amendment of October 2001 stipulate that, when trans-European network projects are developed and carried out, Member States will envisage the protection of Environment through the respect of existing Community environmental regulations.</p>
<p>At the level of individual projects, according to the Council Directive on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, Member States must carry out an environmental assessment. At the level of plans and programmes, they have to implement the Directive of the Parliament and of the Council on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment<a href="#defann_43_2" name="refann_43_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> by July 2004. Art.6 of the Habitats Directive requires Member States also to assess plans (and projects) in relation to their impact on NATURA 2000 sites. The subjects of these regulations are plans and programmes of the Member States including those in the transport sector: for these a strategic environmental assessment should be carried out to protect the environment before the project is planned. The strategic environmental assessment is a contribution to promote sustainable development.</p>
<p>Regarding Kresna Gorge, the Commission has been closely following the proposal for the Sofia-Kulata motorway which is part of the Helsinki Corridor IV and it is well aware of the problems that the originally planned alignment might cause to the very rich bio-diversity of this region.</p>
<p>So far, the Commission has not received any request for financing of this project. In the case it does receive it the Commission services will require the Bulgarian authorities to apply the Union environmental acquis.</p>
<p>While Community legislation will, from a legal point of view, only apply in the Candidate Countries from accession onwards, the Commission has maintained the view that all Community sponsored investments should respect Community environmental law. This applies, in particular, to the need to assess the impact of the projects on the environment on the basis of provisions similar to those included in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) directive and where relevant, to Article 6(3) and (4) of the Habitats Directive<a href="#defann_43_3" name="refann_43_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Regarding the Strait of Messina, a formal complaint has been registered with the Commission, which will entail that an investigation is carried out by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>These products may pose a risk in relation to avian influenza in accordance with OIE international standards and EU legislation on the prevention and control of this disease.

<p>Subsequently, on 29 January, the Commission adopted Decision 2004/93 to ban the import of birds other than poultry, such as ornamental and pet birds, from the countries currently affected with avian influenza, in order to exclude any possible risk of disease occurrence in quarantine stations where – under normal circumstances – these birds have to be introduced once they enter the Community.</p>

<p>(EN) The scope of Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is defined in Article 2. However, there are certain products for which it is not immediately apparent according to Article 2 whether they are electrical or electronic equipment. Some Member States want certain of these products to be included in the scope while other Member States want these products to fall outside the scope. Therefore the Commission recognises that there is indeed a need for further clarification of the text as agreed by Council and Parliament.</p>
<p>The Commission, since the adoption of the directive, has tried via the Technical Adaptation Committee (TAC) to encourage a common understanding of the scope in order to facilitate the implementation by Member States and industry. However, the Commission reminds the honourable Member that the WEEE directive is based on Article 175 of the Treaty, which in principle leaves some flexibility to Member States in adopting measures to achieve the environmental objectives. The measures shall in any case respect the Treaty itself and be notified to the Commission.</p>
<p>It is also important to underline that, in order to promote the good functioning of the Internal Market and avoid distortions of competition, the Commission is in favour of making the scope for Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste and the scope for Directive 2002/95/EC on the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS), which is based on Article 95, as consistent as possible.</p>
<p>As no common understanding concerning the scope could be reached, the Commission has presented recently to the TAC its interpretation on the scope. This document is indeed intended to serve as guidelines in order to clarify the status of borderline products, including those under the category of 'consumers equipment'.</p>
<p>Concerning the relocation of firms outside the Union, the Commission has no knowledge of this. It should however be noted that all companies whether located inside or outside Union have to comply with the WEEE and RoHS directives if they want to sell their products within the Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Patriarch Bartholomeos of Constantinople, the ecumenical leader of the Christian Orthodox Church, who is known and respected worldwide for his commitment to progress, visited Cuba in January. The reason for this visit to Latin America by the highest religious authority of the Orthodox Church was the consecration of San Nicolas Cathedral, which was built in Havana with assistance from the Cuban authorities in a gesture of tolerance and recognition of religious freedom. The spiritual leader of the Orthodox Church expressed his opposition to the attempts to impose isolation on Cuba.</p>
<p>Has the Commission appraised the importance of that visit for millions of European Orthodox Christians, whose spiritual leader is conducting normal relations with Cuba, and also ostensibly distancing himself from the U.S. representation on the island?

<p>(EN) The Commission has followed the visit of the Ecumenical Patriarch with great interest. Unfortunately, the Commission’s Chargé d’affaires in Havana has not been invited by the Cuban authorities to any of the official ceremonies in the context of the five-day visit of the Patriarch. The Commission very much hopes that the inauguration of the first Orthodox Church in Cuba can be read as a signal of granting more space in the exercise of religious freedom and freedom of expression in general. In this context the Commission noted that Patriarch Bartholomew I, when officially inaugurating the San Nicolas Church in Havana, did indeed criticize the economic sanctions imposed on Cuba by the United States, underlining in his speech, however, that people enjoy the unalienable right to dissent.</p>
<p>The Commission is not of the opinion that the Union is pursuing a 'policy of sanctions' vis-à-vis Cuba. It may be useful to recall that the Council Conclusions of 21 July 2003 following the last evaluation of the Common Position, emphasise that the Union, despite the crackdown on the peaceful political opposition and human rights activists and the insults directed at several European Heads of State by the highest Cuban government representatives in June 2003, intends to pursue a policy of constructive engagement, is willing to conduct political dialogue and is prepared to continue development cooperation. This policy approach did not change after the refusal of Union official aid by the Cuban Head of State (26 July 2003), nor did the Union retaliate against any of the measures imposed on the Community missions which invited dissidents to their National Days. It is not the Union but Cuba which pursues a 'policy of sanctions'.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0049"></a>

<p>The Association Agreement will provide a solid platform for economic and political reforms in Syria and for developing our relations further. It is our belief that the Agreement will strengthen the incentives for reforms in Syria, both by creating a more open economy and society and by establishing a political dialogue on issues such as respect for democratic principles and human rights. There are still concerns with Syria regarding respect for human rights, non-proliferation and terrorism. The provisions on these issues in the Agreement will strengthen our ability to engage with Syria on these issues.</p>

<p>According to several participants at the last Fisheries Council, some of the measures the Commission had proposed were rejected. For example, the Council agreed with regard to Southern hake and Norway lobster in the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of Cadiz, that the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries should draw up a conservation and recovery plan in conjunction with the Autonomous Communities during the course of 2004, and present this to the Commission.</p>
<p>However, four days later, on 23 December 2003, the Commission presented a proposal establishing recovery measures for hake and Norway lobster in the Bay of Biscay and areas to the west of the Iberian Peninsular. It is hard line proposal, which provides for annual cuts of up to 25% in Norway lobster catches, establishes five closed areas and fixed limits on kilowatt-days, is scientifically unsound (the Commission acknowledges not knowing the biomass and appears not to have consulted the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee on Fisheries when drawing up the proposal) and does not include financial aid to the fishing fleet, which will be severely affected by such measures and numbers over three thousand vessels in the Bay of Biscay and 213 in the Gulf of Cadiz.</p>
<p>Has the Council discussed the possibility of introducing these measures, along what lines, what was the Commission's position, was consensus reached, and has any minister raised the possibility of aid for the affected fleet?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Under the common fisheries policy, the Council decides on fisheries regulations exclusively on the basis of a proposal by the Commission. Nevertheless the Commission is conscious of its obligations to undertake a dialogue with Member States and relevant sectors when making its proposals. This procedure applies to decisions concerning recovery plans for the southern stock of hake and for Nephrops around the Iberian peninsula.</p>
<p>During 2003 the Commission convened two workshops with industry sectors to discuss recovery options for the southern stock of hake and for Iberian Nephrops. The Commission also sought scientific advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries and a special meeting was organised on this topic.</p>
<p>At the Fisheries Council of December 2003, the Council invited the Commission to come forward with recovery plans for the southern stock of hake and Iberian Nephrops (as well as other stocks requiring recovery measures). Consequently, the Commission has prepared its proposal in accordance with the Council’s request, after consultation with industry, and on the basis of scientific advice.</p>
<p>The December Fisheries Council also considered that the recovery plans for these stocks should be adopted as early as possible in 2004, subject to the availability of the respective European Parliament’s opinions on the proposals.</p>
<p>When the recovery plan is adopted, additional facilities for the provision of aid will become available according to Article 16(c) of Council Regulation (EC) 2792/2002, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) 2369/2002.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0063"></a>

<p>(EN) In response to the honourable Member’s question on the awareness of cross-border restrictions limiting cross-border trade opportunities between Denmark and Sweden and notably in the Øresund region, the Commission wishes to confirm that it is aware of a number of restrictions. The Øresund Chamber of Commerce were very helpful in signalling to the Commission a variety of problems affecting the cross-border provision of services at the time that the Commission was preparing its report on the State of the Internal Market for services that it adopted in 2002<a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As regards the honourable Member’s second question, the Commission will pursue any infringement complaints that are lodged on these problems. More generally, in January the Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive on Services in the Internal Market. This sets down the process to establish a well functioning Internal Market for services by resolving the administrative and regulatory barriers identified in its report on the State of the Internal Market. The Commission believes that this proposal encouraged by the Parliament given its recognition that a well functioning Internal Market for services is an essential prerequisite for meeting the competitiveness and growth goals of the Lisbon summit, will directly contribute to resolving a number of the problems that the honourable Member alludes to. The Commission will be contacting the Honourable member’s office to provide her with a more detailed explanation of how this proposal will address the specific problems of interest to her.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
