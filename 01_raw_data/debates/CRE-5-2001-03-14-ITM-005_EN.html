<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I appreciate the opportunity afforded by today’s debate because the triad of conflict prevention, civil crisis management and military capabilities needs to be seen in a wider context, ensuring of course that conflict prevention and civil crisis management are given a high ranking. All three concepts are interconnected. Credible civil crisis management and prevention are only possible if all sides are aware of the military capabilities. On the other hand, developing our potential for conflict prevention and crisis management will ensure that we never need to use military force. Hence the high ranking.</p>
<p class="contents">With the resolutions of Cologne, Helsinki and Feira and the conditions created in Nice, we have a clear brief to forge ahead with the civil aspects of crisis management. This includes developing the capacity to plan and implement policing operations, cooperation with the United Nations and questions of coherence and efficient improvement to Union policy in this area. In the meantime, we have seen – and we still see time and again – that the present artificial separation of powers – some of which rest with the Commission and some with the High Representative – is damaging us in the long run and the Council should consider if it would be better in the long term for the vice-president of the Commission to have special relations with the Council and take over these matters, and for this to be used as a springboard for bringing greater transparency to these three areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The point is, we should really like to know that a check has been run on the extent to which these various capabilities are available in the institutions of the European Union. We need to do something about improving the European Union’s information and analysis capacities. We must be careful not to develop dual structures; instead we must combine the resources of the Council, the Commission, the Member States and other institutions so that we really can benefit from them.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to go into all the details, but I think that it is immensely important in this context for the Commission to take more of an initiative in these areas and play a central role in planning crisis prevention and crisis management, so that we can create the political awareness needed for all these capabilities to be brought under one roof.</p>
<p class="contents">We specifically call on the Member States to provide the capacities and resources needed so that the European Union can be quickly deployed in the four areas defined in Feira, although this will depend, among other things, on defining specific objectives in advance, possibly with a timetable, as we did during the discussion on police forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The example of Kosovo shows just how badly we need these capabilities; it also shows that we can act in a coordinated manner under uniform guidance. Even though the Council, the Commission and the Member States have done a great deal of good over the last two or three years, we still have to admit – more’s the pity – that we are far too backward in coming forward in certain areas and taking on tasks which we need to tackle directly, which is why we feel it is so important that we make progress here.</p>
<p class="contents">In doing so, we shall certainly need proper coordination with organisations such as the UN, the OSCE, the Council of Europe, financial institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank and non-governmental organisations. I need only remind you of the status quo here and the fact that the old principle still applies to Kosovo: now at last we must find the coordinator for the coordinators. A great deal still needs to be done here and I think that, given the problems, especially for individuals, we really must overcome the difficulties, power struggles and vanities between the institutions and develop European capabilities which enable us to foster and contribute to peace and freedom, both within and on the edge of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to take this opportunity to give a general answer on the way the Swedish Presidency approaches preventive work within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">“All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.” This is the opening of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights – the cornerstone of our work for individual freedom, safety and dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, war and armed conflict destroy all fundamental principles. Instead, the law of the strong rules through firepower and oppression.</p>
<p class="contents">The 20th century was the century of war with the world wars and wars in the Middle East and the Balkans. Each time alarm bells rang, but the international community often reacted too late. Now we can show that we are learning from the past. By actively focusing on preventing armed conflict, we can help make this century different.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has a key role to play in this regard. Let me quote what Mr Hume said in Parliament when he was awarded the Nobel peace prize: “Let us not forget that European Union is the best example, as we have learned, in the history of the world of conflict resolution.” Today, conflict prevention is also a central element of the developing Common European Security and Defence Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The ESDP is based on three pillars: military crisis management, civil crisis management and conflict prevention. These are closely linked. At the same time, prevention is different to military and civil crisis management in that it is not about reacting to a crisis that has already flared up, but about promoting in good time the fundamental values on which we all agree: that children should be able to go to school instead of to war and that democracy must be established at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has an extremely large number of instruments which can be used to prevent armed conflict and manage crises. We must use these in a more considered and coherent way, both in the field and in Brussels. These issues must involve the whole Union and all institutions. We already know that the EU can make important interventions. Our unarmed monitors in Presevo and the police mission in Albania are just two examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience from the Balkans has clearly shown that conflict prevention must be based on long-term involvement. The basic causes of armed conflict must be removed. Therefore, development work has a key role. The decision of the Commission and the Development Council to integrate prevention into development work is central and must now be turned into practical guidelines for projects and programmes. It is a matter of strengthening human rights and democracy in the long term and of the way crisis management and humanitarian aid gives way to development work. The Commission’s upcoming communication on conflict prevention, on human rights and democracy and on humanitarian aid, reconstruction and development will, therefore, be significant.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also identify potential conflicts at an earlier stage. One example is the way water issues are often a source of conflict nowadays. However, we can see a telling example right next to us of the way the EU can mean that resources of common interest can create partnership and development. The river running through Strasbourg used to be a poisoned watercourse, a barrier. Now it is a common waterway and source of fish.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must also develop sustainable and effective partnerships with other important players. The UN is our most important partner. We are trying to establish close long-term cooperation at all levels between the EU and the UN. Similarly, we are strengthening relations with the OSCE.</p>
<p class="contents">In Africa, we are seeking partnership with the sub-regional organisations SADC, IGAD and ECOWAS, which also work on conflict prevention and crisis management, in order to help them build up their capabilities and support local processes. ECOWAS’ small arms moratorium is a good example.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also setting up a joint expert group for conflict prevention with Canada and developing contacts with the G8 group.</p>
<p class="contents">Partnership with others naturally has to be driven by real needs and comparative benefits. When I recently visited the Southern Caucasus with Mr Patten and Dr Solana, it was an obvious occasion to build on the OSCE’s and the European Council’s knowledge of, and presence in, the area. Now, we are discussing how the EU can work with the OSCE to develop monitoring of the border with the Northern Caucasus. The Troika’s visit to the Caucasus in February and to Israel and Gaza in the past two days is another example of the EU’s role in conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that relations with civil society and NGOs are crucial if we are to succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a request for a Council declaration on the situation in Northern FYROM, and I would like to take this up as an example of the way the EU can work:</p>
<p class="contents">For several years, we have taken measures to try to prevent conflict through unarmed monitors, aid for political and economic reforms and for central and local institutions, the 1998 Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement which is expected to be signed shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">On 22 February came the first reports that an armed Albanian group had entered Northern FYROM. Their purpose was unclear, but there was clear resistance to ratification of the border agreement recently signed between FYROM and FRY.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to prevent increased violence, the EU and the presidency representatives in Skopje established a close dialogue with FYROM’s government. The Troika called a meeting of the leading Albanian parties and urged them to vote for ratification of the border agreement, which the majority did.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the gun battles, explosion of mines and exchanges of fire, the EU has condemned the violent attacks and urged all parties – particularly representatives of the Albanian minority in FYROM – to distance themselves from the violent actions. We have said that it is important to have closer cooperation and have also welcomed the cooperation between KFOR, UNMIK and the FYROM authorities and expressed support for FYROM’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, while also urging restraint.</p>
<p class="contents">The important message to the public has been that FYROM’s future lies in closer ties with Europe and the EU and that stability and security is a vital condition of this. The desire of the people of the Balkans for integration and cooperation with Europe means that the EU can play a vital role – including a crucial role in forming opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">We have started an important process in carrying out the proposals the Commission and the High Representative presented in their report to the European Council in Nice and will hopefully be able to go on to approve a programme for conflict prevention in Gothenburg in June. In preparing the programme, we will naturally be carefully studying the proposals from Parliament, including the important Lalumière resolution of last year and the resolution which will be adopted tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finally say a few words about other elements of the cooperation surrounding the Common European Security and Defence Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have not addressed the subject of military capabilities today, but I believe that they have an important role to play. The knowledge that the EU has military capabilities also plays an important role in preventive work.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to civil crisis management, we have to press on with what the European Council addressed – civilian police, the judicial system, civil administration and rescue services. We are working hard to turn the target of 5 000 police into reality. Member States have been asked to state their national contributions. An initial reconciliation will take place in May. We are putting a great deal of energy into developing the ability to plan and manage police initiatives and into common standards for equipment, training, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also started work on other areas of capability – strengthening the judicial system and civil administration during crises and conflicts, and the Council Working Group for Rescue Services is drawing up concrete targets in its area.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that armed conflict damages all vital functions in a society. Crisis management must therefore include support for everything from the judicial system to refuse collection. Human rights, international agreements and humanitarian principles must be defended, especially with regard to safe access to help those suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">We will therefore also open discussions on areas of capability other than those which we have previously identified, e.g. observers and experts in human rights and disarmament.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we also have to solve the issues of how we are to achieve effective cooperation between civil and military crisis management. It is almost always the case that we solve these issues jointly when it comes to practical work in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">If it turns out that I have to leave this debate early, I would like to emphasise that this in no way means that I am not interested in hearing the thoughts of all Members of Parliament. The fact is, I am going to Murmansk to discuss important nuclear safety issues in Northern Russia, and getting to Murmansk is not easy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a great privilege for me to follow on from the Minister with whom I have spent a good deal of time on Troika visits in the last few weeks, I guess dealing with conflict prevention, and it is a pleasure to take part in the debate launched by the honourable gentleman. We last exchanged words in the same general direction in Washington a few days ago. He has raised an important debate. Perhaps I can be excused if I can take a few moments more than my allotted five to begin with and shave that off anything I say at the end of the debate. I will not come back at the end of the debate unless there are specific questions which people wish me to respond to, in which case of course I would be delighted to do so, not least in the Minister's absence in Murmansk.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Minister reminded us, the European Union is not new to the whole field of conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict reconstruction. We recognise that conflict prevention and crisis management are long-term undertakings. All of our regional cooperation programmes, CARDS, the ALURE Latin America programme, PHARE, MEDA, TACIS and so on, the Cotonou Agreement as well as our pre-accession strategies and stabilisation, association and cooperation agreements with third countries – all of them contain conflict prevent and crisis management provisions. Rehabilitation programmes such as that in Rwanda after the genocide, economic reconstruction programmes such as that in Kosovo today, bilateral aid programmes built on peace agreements such as those in Guatemala and El Salvador are practical examples of how we are helping every day to prevent conflict and to build peace around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">No one disputes that recent history in the Balkans, in Africa and elsewhere has taught us that we need to equip ourselves better to try to prevent the outbreak of violent conflict and to react more effectively when it occurs. We have taken some important new initiatives in relation to conflict prevention. Last December the Commission and the High Representative jointly presented a report to the Nice Council with recommendations for improvements. We focused in particular on developing better methods of analysis, closer coordination within the Union and more effective coordination with our international partners – and this follows a point that my honourable friend made – especially the United Nations and the OSCE.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now working with the High Representative to follow up the recommendations of the Nice report. We are looking at the development of conflict indicators and early warning systems so that we can focus our attention much better on countries or regions in difficulty. We are also examining how CFSP instruments such as political dialogue can be adapted so that they are more robust, flexible and timely. The Commission is working with the presidency on the action programme which the presidency, as the Minister made clear, will present at the European Council meeting in June.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also preparing a communication on conflict prevention which we will present to the Council in April. This communication will focus particularly on addressing the root causes of conflict through Community external aid and development instruments. We will put forward proposals, for example, to build the objectives of peace and democratic stability more clearly into our assistance programmes. We will place greater emphasis in future on support for the building of stable institutions and the rule of law including, of course, the police and the administration of justice. We will also ensure through our assistance programmes that we take account of indicators of political exclusion, ethnic, social or regional marginalisation, environmental degradation or other factors which can contribute to violent conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We intend to contribute to international initiatives, for example through the G8 and the OECD, on issues such as international crime, the diamond trade, drug-trafficking and child soldiers. We have also to exploit to the full other means such as trade policy instruments and trade and cooperation agreements, or our skills on border-management police training, customs assistance missions – which have been such a success in the Balkans – or expertise in migration, social or environmental policy. I look forward to returning to this Parliament to present the communication once it has been finalised. But I am acutely conscious that while we are working on these issues, events in the real world are not put on hold. In southern Serbia and on Kosovo's borders with Macedonia we have a real-life example of a crisis that needs managing, as the Minister said, and a further conflict that must be prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear. What is happening on these two borders threatens, if it is not tackled firmly and rapidly, to reverse much of the recent, very heartening progress that has been made in the region. It threatens fresh conflict, fresh instability, just as we were putting those things behind us in the Balkans. Plainly, the straight military security issues involved are for the Council, and above all for NATO, not for the European Commission. I know how hard the presidency, the Minister and my colleague, Javier Solana, have been working on these issues, as has NATO. I very much welcome the cease-fire negotiated on Monday in the Presevo Valley. I very much hope that it will hold.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have been determined that the Commission should contribute as rapidly and fully as possible to support the wider efforts to tackle this crisis both in southern Serbia and on the FYROM border. As Parliament may know, we have already announced that we were prepared to provide about EUR 1 million in assistance for southern Serbia, for the Presevo Valley. We have made available another EUR 900 000 and agreed on 24 projects with deputy prime minister Covic of Serbia and with the local mayor. The 24 projects are in areas like improvement of water and improvement of schools, which we are prepared to undertake as well. That raises our immediate assistance to almost EUR 2 million. I think that is the right way to support deputy prime minister Covic's commitment to try to resolve these issues through dialogue rather than conflict. We are also prepared to put some of the EUR 240 million that we are providing for Serbia in reconstruction assistance this year to doing more in the Presevo Valley.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have a long way to go in improving our capacity to respond to crises in the short term. I would characterise the challenges we face under three headings. First, we have to react more quickly in crisis situations. The Commission is responding to this challenge. As Parliament knows we are engaged in a process of the reform of our external aid, which will mean that we are able to deliver assistance more rapidly and more efficiently across the whole range of Community aid programmes. Last month, on our initiative, the Council also adopted the regulation establishing a rapid-reaction mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we must be able to deploy appropriate personnel in sufficient numbers, which is a real difficulty and a challenge for all of us. The rapid-reaction mechanism will give the Commission the possibility to do this and we will shortly start to negotiate framework contracts for this purpose with Member States, international organisations, NGOs and others. The major problem we face in this area, however, is the lack of suitably qualified and available personnel in the Member States. It is a problem faced not just by the Union but also by the UN, OSCE and other bodies engaged in international peace missions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's view, the best way to build up the Union's capacity in this field is by developing common recruitment standards and training programmes. The Commission is encouraging Member States to work together and with the UN and OSCE in this area, and is prepared to support such training programmes from Community funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Third and last, we have to develop more effective coordination. In the Commission's view, effective crisis management does not necessarily require major changes in existing decision-making procedures laid down in the Treaty. It requires the establishment of improved mechanisms for day-to-day coordination at headquarters level, in the field, and between the field and headquarters.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Commission is engaged in reorganising itself internally in order to ensure better coordination of Community instruments in crisis situations. The Commission has established a conflict prevention and crisis management unit. Within that unit the Commission intends to establish a crisis management cell, which will coordinate various Community initiatives and provide a focal point for the Council situation centre. The crisis management cell should be operational by the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in the context of the on-going debate in the Council on crisis management procedures, we have suggested to Council that the coordinating mechanism provided for in the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council should be relaunched. We are prepared to play our full part in the functioning of this mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to both conflict prevention and civilian crisis management, the Commission intends to play, in full association with the work of the Council's Political and Security Committee, an active role in helping to take forward efforts in this area with the Council. We want to work with the High Representative, the policy unit and the Council secretariat in this spirit. We will work closely with Parliament, as well as the Council, on these issues. We will certainly keep Parliament fully informed. I very much hope that the communication which we bring forward in April will provide a focus for a debate which gives us the opportunity to bring together in a more creative and constructive way the responsibilities with which the Commission is charged, the responsibilities which we have agreed to share on a Europe-wide level. We can take initiatives in this field which are not available to others and if we do that constructively we will make a reality of the construction of a common foreign and security policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She is on her way to Sarajevo and has asked me to stand in for her.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that, once again, we are right up against the concepts of “civil crisis management” and “conflict prevention” in the crisis region, and we pray that we shall not have to deploy the third option, i.e. of putting our military capabilities to the test. Recent developments in the region have been both positive and extremely negative and I think that we have taken account of both in Parliament’s compromise resolution which will be put to the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">On the positive side, I would point out that efforts to keep the peace in Macedonia really have worked over recent years and the Georgievski government has made a special contribution here by including representatives of the Albanian minority in the coalition. And if you take a closer look, you will see that this is not just a formality and that many important positions in Macedonia have been given to members of the minority. We have all the more responsibility for stabilising this country and it is good to hear that relative peace has now been restored on the fifth day, including in Tanusevcí, which was temporarily occupied by UCK extremists.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to raise another point in this connection. Croatia has also made good progress and the Mesi� government currently in power in Croatia – unlike the previous government – is not under any suspicion of encouraging Croatian extremists in Herzegovina who want to interfere with the successful community in Bosnia-Herzegovina and try to impose their own agenda there. In this respect, the appeal to the HDZ in Herzegovina is justified, but should be seen in isolation from these trends.</p>
<p class="contents">As proof of our trust – and I think as justifiable proof of our trust – towards the new Yugoslavian Government, we had allowed Yugoslav troops to start patrolling the Presevo valley in order to keep UCK extremists there under control and, in return, NATO has also stepped up border controls. This is, I think, an important point.</p>
<p class="contents">But what must we do when we demand that communal representatives in Kosovo and the local authorities fight the extremists? I think that it is important to say in this context that we must strengthen the legitimacy of moderate forces in Kosovo and that we strengthen Mr Rugowa – to name a name – by making it possible for elections to be held in Kosovo. I think that is an important political point. Otherwise the UCK can maintain off its own bat that they have more influence than they actually do. If we move in this direction, it will, I think, be a positive development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is becoming clear that a civil strategy will be forming a completely fresh component in conflict prevention and foreign policy. I would like to thank Commissioner Patten who has pointed out very clearly how vital it is that we provide the human resources so as to add substance to civil strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start on a practical note. The Group of the Party of European Socialists has added a new point to its amendments on the wide issue of the small arms trade. This issue will be discussed in the PrepCom which will be taking place in New York between 19 and the end of March. This meeting will prove to be of overriding importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, our Member States are closely involved in this matter. We know that there is a code of conduct, but we also know that we do not always implement those rules consistently. Europe’s role in the New York meeting will be of crucial importance. A number of key points are still missing from the action plan. We have included these in our amendments which we hope will be adopted tomorrow in a resolution, so that Europe will be sending out a clear message in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of the last century, conflicts claimed as many victims among the military as it does among citizens today. There are over 100 conflicts, most of which are of a civil nature and are ethnically and regionally coloured. That fact alone entirely justifies our strategy of conflict prevention, but also forces us to appreciate the complexity of this strategy. It is no longer a question of diplomacy in the traditional meaning of the word. There is a whole gamut of mechanisms involved. It is a long-term task which cannot be carried out by one specific group alone and nobody else. And that has not always been Europe’s strong point, not now or in the past. The Group of the Party of European Socialists believes that we are facing a huge challenge in order to achieve a result by means of which Europe will put itself on the map using a fresh approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, therefore, I have to stress the on-going need for cooperation between NATO and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Rapid Reaction Force, the rapid reaction mechanism, and the Civil Peace Corps must be complementary to NATO. Indeed that is stressed in paragraph 8 of the General Affairs Council's comments on international cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been mentioned by Minister Lindh, soldiers today carry out peace-making Community activities. The crossover between peace and war activities is now difficult to see. The European Union must be complementary to NATO. I urge the Council of Ministers and the Commission to comment on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">Tackling the root causes is another problem. Society is seriously destabilised by organised crime. Can the Commission and Ministers stress that they will tackle this across borders through Interpol and with mechanisms such as Scotland Yard's Paedophile Unit?</p>
<p class="contents">Capacity building is another critical point. When we look at Pristina we see that the hospital is under great stress. Is it not a necessity for the new AIDCO organisation that the Commission has created, which we welcome, to build up the capacity of the medical and educational professions?</p>
<p class="contents">Local professionals maintain civilian society but under stress, however excellent NGOs may be, surely local professionals, particularly in education and medicine, are vital. I urge the Commission to support those functions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, of course, accountability. I truly believe, and I am sure everyone here does too, that the best of all conflict prevention mechanisms is a fully functioning Parliament. I urge those present to ensure that this Parliament plays its full part, not just in conflict prevention and crisis management, but in ensuring that the Rapid Reaction Force has an ultimate responsibility to this Parliament as well as to national parliaments, the Council of Ministers and the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That underscores the crucial importance of non-military conflict prevention in foreign policy. The Kosovo crisis showed us that. Post-war costs rock the EU budget every time. They are many times higher than what 2000 OSCE observers or a stability programme for the region at the beginning of the 1990s would have cost.</p>
<p class="contents">The example of Kosovo also teaches us that civil conflict management must be deployed early on. It takes time and it is not very spectacular. Conflict prevention today requires not just political instruments; it also requires economic instruments, as well as social and ecological measures. The EU has this potential. It could play a significant role in preventing and managing conflicts in the world. It has the biggest internal market, it has economic clout, it can plan economic cooperation. It has a broad range of historical and cultural experience and has a diplomatic corps at international level, but it is not the biggest conflict preventer in the world because it splits this strength into 15 plus 1 fragmented interests and that is the main problem.

<p class="contents">Now, experience has shown us that there are certain problems to be considered. To this end, although we agree in general with Mr Brok’s oral question and we recognise that he has accepted collective work by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, there is a specific point that concerns us which is just the opposite of what Mrs Nicholson says. In both recital D and in paragraph 8 it is unfortunate that NATO is mentioned because NATO has been one of the main causes of problems in many places, as we saw in the former Yugoslavia, in Kosovo and in Cyprus when it was invaded by Turkey. Our support cannot therefore be total.</p>
<p class="contents">This oral question also contains an important element: targeting the global economic and social factors which may forewarn us of conflicts. We should be alert to situations which may arise tomorrow or the day after. In the Western Sahara there is currently a very explosive situation which the authorities do not want to acknowledge and which should cause us great concern in the European Union. The same could be said of Israel and Palestine, where a crisis with serious consequences for us could blow up in our faces at any time.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to behave like the United States of America, which whenever there is a problem – such as in Colombia for example – instead of supporting a negotiated solution, reached through discussion, sends more soldiers, more aircraft and more military force, thereby making the situation worse. We want Europe to promote stability, peace and a negotiated solution to conflicts. We therefore believe that, in relation to the conflict now arising between Macedonia and Kosovo, we must first concern ourselves with the complacency with which the Americans in the region have fallen into step with the KLA forces and, on the other hand, we must recognise and support Macedonia’s efforts to reach a border agreement and condemn terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe is making great efforts to keep the peace in South East Europe and many individual countries are also doing just as much, in terms of financial assistance and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, peace is unfortunately a long way off; in fact, corruption is growing; elections – if there are any – often lack transparency, and emigration from Kosovo, Montenegro and Albania has reached overwhelming proportions, those remaining on the territory being the worst of the criminal population.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union probably ought to devote more attention to making return immigration easier, ensuring that there are active populations in those countries who are genuinely committed to redevelopment and pursuing a process of peace and tranquillity in their homelands.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is not just a problem of military security at the frontiers. The ethnic minorities are becoming increasingly demanding and violent towards the inhabitants and the peacekeeping forces, thus demonstrating the still very evident fragility of local governments, particularly the Albanian Government, which ought to uphold the rights of the political opposition more firmly, and the fragility of relations with the European Union and with some non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that the solution to the Balkan crisis must be a political solution, but it must be accompanied by full, transparent affirmation of rights and a genuine will for tangible and intangible reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must commit itself wholly to achieving the aims of peace and stability in the Balkans, but it must be increasingly clear about the fact that genuine financial assistance has to be closely linked to the pursuit of these aims, in the short term and without further tolerance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think what is happening now in Macedonia is proof that we have seen, heard and learned nothing, or rather, that you have seen, heard and learned nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening now in Macedonia is happening in Macedonia and there is no point in creating alibis for ourselves and in saying, as many do, that the crisis stems from Kosovo, from the transfer of persons, of ex-members of the KLA to Macedonia. The crisis in Macedonia is a crisis which arose and which spread because of our lack of a serious policy on Macedonia over the last ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">My socialist colleagues will remember the insistence with which Mrs Pack and myself came back time and time again to the importance of a project which seemed marginal, which my socialist and communist colleagues regarded with a certain condescension. I am speaking of the Tetovo University project, which was fundamentally important in terms of reacting to the frustration of the Albanians in Macedonia. We were looked upon condescendingly as we were looked upon condescendingly fifteen years ago when, in this Parliament, we called for the accession of the then Yugoslavia to the European Community as the only way of avoiding the explosion which did indeed take place several years later.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that arises is that of the frustrations of the Albanian population, which are extremely long standing and which did not meet with an initial response until the entry into office of the government of Mr Georgievski. Throughout the first eight years of Macedonian independence, these frustrations were played on by the Social Democratic government of Mr Crvenkovski, who literally bought a few Albanians, a few quislings, by offering them marginal posts in his government and a few ambassadorial posts here and there.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the government of Mr Georgievski certainly saved Macedonia from an enormous disaster. Mr Georgievski did this by integrating in his government the party of Mr Xhaferi, whom socialist colleagues regarded as an extremist, though they had to sing another tune when they saw the role played by Mr Xhaferi at the time of the 1999 crisis, when hundreds of thousands of Kosovars were chased out of Kosovo by the regime of the war criminal, Mr Milosevic. The then Macedonia was about to explode. That it did not explode was thanks to this ‘extremist’, Mr Xhaferi. That it still has not exploded is thanks, once again, first and foremost, to Mr Xhaferi and certainly not to our action, to the action of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten has now taken charge of this case. The question of the university should be resolved. It is an urgent matter because it concerns 6 000 students who should be able to be transferred to this new official university. If they are not, they will not have the possibility of gaining equivalent diplomas, and if it is not resolved by the end of the year, we will have 6 000 desperate young people who will subsequently fuel the crisis to which we have contributed so much during the course of the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the situation in Macedonia. The situation is getting even worse, however, because, in addition to the frustration of the Albanian population, we also have the enormous worry of the Macedonian counterpart. So the solutions of the past, which may have been progressive, which may have led to the creation of this university, which may have been a gradual process to dismantle the national Slav-Macedonian state to replace it with a federal state, now need to be speeded up. We must propose new solutions to our Macedonian interlocutors which go much further and which can tackle both the frustration of the Albanians and the deep concerns of the Slav-Macedonian population.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards conflict prevention in this context, for ten years we have been witnessing absolutely intolerable behaviour on the part of our Greek colleagues. Instead of looking ahead and trying to convince the Greek population of the need to give an identity to the Macedonian population, both Albanian and Slav-Macedonian, through the name ‘Macedonia’, they have blocked, with insolence to say the least, any process which would enable Macedonians to finally have a republic which is not called FYROM, Madam President-in-Office, but ‘Macedonia’. It is perhaps high time that, within the Council, an attempt is made to convince the Greek representative so that, finally, this problem can be resolved and so that, finally, the Macedonians can have full entitlement to this name.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the situation we find ourselves in. I think it is urgent that we act, that we move more quickly, and that we restore the confidence of the Macedonian population and the Albanian-speaking population of Macedonia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the fact that two points will be addressed during this meeting, namely the development of the civil capacity to manage conflicts, and the conflicts which affect Macedonia. For what have we been witnessing in Macedonia for years now? That it is indeed a fragile state which is only held together by the wisdom of presidents and government leaders – particularly the present ones – and of a number of political leaders who have managed to establish mutual coalitions and have not set about carving up the state of Macedonia. As long as ten years ago, the Macedonian Albanians came to us with a list of the regions in which they did not have a majority. This line of thinking shows that the seed of ethnic cleansing had already been planted. We must avoid going down that road at all cost.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is also important that we are doing something about this, mainly by civil means, as is currently happening under the guidance of Mr Patten. I am also extremely taken with the serious plea by President-in-Office Lindh on this matter. And we will not only be using the regular means, but really all instruments which must be deployed in a coordinated manner, but particularly those which touch the hearts of the nation, and which can bring about a change in the citizens’ mentality. For example, Paragraph 7 of our resolution is about better radio and TV reporting. This topic has been discussed many a time in this Parliament, also during the Bosnian wars, because radio and TV have a huge impact on what people think, and how they view each other. I believe that it is of utmost importance that this weapon is also being deployed as one of the civil channels, not only via the independent media which exist, but, if necessary, from an independent base in the European Union, so that we can actually influence the population in those regions and put an end to the atrocious ethnic thinking which will be the downfall of the Balkans as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am delighted at the fact that the Commission’s actions have already been spelled out clearly. It is important that these are widely known. The actions of the Commission in the Presevo Valley are crucial and I hope that Mr Patten will take the necessary action in the other border regions too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is important to know what the Swedish Presidency of the Council and the Commission have done since then as promises were made, especially regarding the civil aspects of crisis management. Thank you, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, for the information you have already given us. However, I cannot hide my true concern. Having worked with or in organisations such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe, both of which deal with the prevention of conflicts and the civil management of crises, I know from experience how timidly the Member States support their efforts. I am not talking simply of the lack of finances. In this regard, the European Union is fortunate enough to dispose of quite considerable amounts of funding. It is obviously a question of using them in a coherent and coordinated fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking above all of the lack of political support. What can an international organisation do? What can the European Union do if the Member States carry out different analyses, have different objectives or do not have any objectives at all and if the Member States hesitate in taking decisions? The war in the Balkans offers sometimes tragic examples of all these shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, that Parliament would be pleased to feel that the members of the Council clearly have the will to provide this real political support, which conflict prevention needs if it is not to descend into taking ad hoc actions founded solely on charitable sentiments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For military interventions, men and supplies are already in prospect, but it appears that we are not quite ready for prevention. We are looking forward to April. The key question remains, as Mrs Lalumière remarked earlier, whether the European Union will be sufficiently resolute when it comes to prevention. In the former Yugoslavia, we were unable to prevent conflict for a long time. And every now and again, conflict prevention ended in disastrous circumstances. I would refer to the many African examples, and Rwanda, in particular. The mandates on the basis of which prevention is organised must be sufficient so as to be one step ahead of the conflict. They must be able to work proactively and provide for crisis management.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you talk about this entire armed force which will need to be set up. But our point of departure must first of all be based on a sound understanding of the underlying reasons and of the origin of conflicts. In many cases, the underdevelopment, neglect or suppression of certain regions, religions, cultures and ethnic minorities lie at the root of the evil. That is a fertile breeding ground for the illegal arms trade and banditry. Let us therefore not overlook integrated development cooperation as a means of addressing the deeper causes of conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tragic situation in the Balkans is, I think, proof of this. We say we are going to improve all this and let us hope that we do.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, everything is completely cut and dried. We do not need any generalisations or insults nor do we need insinuation. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is threatened by a number of state or civil forces which refuse to acknowledge its definitive borders. It is that simple. And everything else stems from this, throwing FYROM’s very existence into doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">So, if you want to prevent conflicts and manage the crisis which already exists, you should state very loudly that UN Resolution No 1244 applies to the letter. Ask KFOR to do its job throughout Kosovo, to control borders, to make arrests and to refer people to the courts, in liaison with the representatives of the UN. State, even more loudly, that the border agreement signed by Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on 24 February is valid and completely legal, that all neighbouring countries must abide by it to the letter and that this is a criterion for our relations with them and for the funds which you so proudly announced and which are totally inadequate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However conflict resolution and prevention of conflict do require investment. Investment not just in terms of theories and studies and knowledge of history but also financial investment to try and ensure that the causes of conflict are recognised. Some of the causes relating to ethnic and religious origin and so on have already been mentioned. But there are also economic causes. The most successful area of conflict prevention with which the European Union has been involved in recent years was in the city of Mostar. Even though it did not succeed in the end the kind of investment we started to put into Mostar was very successful.</p>
<p class="contents">As we look forward now to a new range of conflicts and regional uncertainties, we have to make sure that we have the capacity to respond. Ireland would be proud to play its part in a European Rapid Reaction Force with a humanitarian and peace-keeping role, but that and NATO must not be the only option. The resolution and prevention of conflict requires dialogue and opposing parties have to be brought together. You must make peace with your enemy, not with your friend. There is a saying that opportunity comes to pass, not to pause. Too often we miss the opportunity to intervene and prevent conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that, in our discussions, we must be mindful of the effects of conflict on children and young people. According to UNICEF reports, over two million children have been killed in the conflicts in the last decade. There are 300 000 child soldiers around the world and millions and millions of orphans. More must be done to protect children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am pleased that the President-in-Office and Commissioner Patten understand the need to put in place measures to anticipate violent conflict and to promote what I would call a culture of prevention. Troop deployment, as we know, is expensive and very prone to failure. Of course, we need to be able to react rapidly, but the EU must improve its ability to use all the economic and political levers at its disposal and use them more effectively to tackle the root causes of tension, which the Commissioner mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty-four of the world's forty poorest countries are either engaged in some kind of armed conflict or have recently emerged from it. In Africa, 20% of the population live in countries affected by armed conflict. Therefore I have to ask the Commissioner, how it is that the Commission's policy planning and early-warning units, provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty, have 20 members of staff, 11 of whom are engaged in working in Balkans whereas only one is assigned to the world's most conflict-prone region, Africa. I would be very happy if the Commissioner could look into that. Are there plans to have a more balanced approach in the early-warning unit?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, would the Council and Commission not agree that we need urgently to develop common strategies for west Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Great Lakes region and for southern Africa?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, does the Commission agree that country strategy papers which have been drawn up under the Cotonou Agreement must urgently include an impact study of policies on conflict so that we can be assured that we know what might happen in the 77 countries which are part of the Cotonou Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One example is the renowned civil peace corps which Parliament has requested a number of times and which is mentioned in paragraph five of this proposal for a resolution.

Armed clashes occurred on FYROM territory at the beginning of this month, clearly linked to forces acting outside the country.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have in the FYROM is the same phenomenon as in so many other countries – Albania, Kosovo, Cyprus and, to a large extent, Turkey – countries which are inhabited by mixed populations, mixed nations with different languages and religions, but which border on compact, nationally homogenous countries or regions inhabited by the overwhelming majority of the nationalities in question.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, situations such as these have resulted in a familiar, tried and tested process, a tragic process and, from the point of view of the times we live in and from the point of view of what we as the European Union are trying to achieve, an unacceptable process. This process starts with bloody acts of terrorism against one of the two nationalities, the purpose of which is to prove that it is impossible for them to live side by side under the same state roof. It is followed by the demand for a geographical division between the communities within a single state and the formation of self-governing minorities, develops into inter-community clashes, a division into separate states and, finally, secession as a separate country. It is a scenario which we have witnessed numerous times in our region and, as we all know, it is accompanied by bloodshed, ethnic cleansing and the intervention of foreign forces, with both good and bad intentions. It is a disastrous process for the people and it is a dangerous and costly process for the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Crises such as these are managed primarily by political and diplomatic intervention to bring about the social integration of the disadvantaged minority. Steps have been taken in this direction in the FYROM. Tetovo University is a typical example. In all events, what Mr Dupuis said about Greece was wrong, because at the moment Greece is, if you will, the mainstay of this state and it shall continue to be so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Conversely, however, the escalation of conflicts in the countries of the South is a barrier to their prospects for development and creates a vicious circle. That being the case, the prevention of conflicts cannot be divorced from a policy of sustainable development aimed at a better distribution of wealth and the institution of real democracy at a global level.</p>

Ten out of ten for intentions, ideas and the set of conflict prevention and crisis management measures taken. However, when it comes to the practical, as we have seen in the Balkans, the results are a disaster, an absolute disaster. It is enough to make you cry, not just for what is happening in the FYROM, but for Bosnia and the Croatian stand on Herzegovina and its independence, which shows that everything is up for grabs and that good intentions pave the road to hell if they are not reconciled with stable, clear and fair political guidelines. And this is where the problem arises and this is where I should like to say to Mr Patten: Commissioner, that there is a member here who constantly and dogmatically supports the position of the KLA is, if you will, only natural. But to applaud his position by talking of constitutional change and converting the FYROM into a federation is, I think, highly dangerous, especially in the present circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, they often overlook the fact that this often creates new minorities which are then subject to the same discriminatory mechanisms and which must again try to become independent and break free from this yoke.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Balkans in particular, with its widely scattered mixture of people from different ethnic, religious and linguistic backgrounds, it is impossible to make a clear ethnic division, nor, from my understanding, should we want to do so. Conflict prevention and crisis management in the Balkans nowadays mainly consists of not taking any unilateral action which might upset the precarious balance of power. Especially as assassination attempts and terrorist activities are not, of course, designed to bring about a new order, but to create new disorder.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have to do is to provide support, especially to all those states – and Macedonia is at the top of the list – which are doing everything they can to integrate minorities into civil society, and this also applies to present-day Yugoslavia and Serbia. To my mind, conflict prevention and crisis management by the European Union today means sending out clear messages to all extremist ethnic Albanian groups who do not want peace and to the extremist organisations or people – there are not many, but they do exist – attached to the HDZ in the Croatian part of Bosnia-Herzegovina which is unilaterally trying to upset the Dayton agreement – however problematic that may be. And I also think that we need to send a clear message to Montenegro, so that no unilateral action is taken there, action which may be to celebrate their independence but which jeopardises peace and stability in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Crisis prevention is the icing on the cake of all political debates because prevention is better than cure. We talk about peace, war and security but we do not know what to do. And this leitmotiv presented by our diplomats, our generals and our politicians is without substance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say, Mr President, Commissioner, that the concept of crisis prevention will remain devoid of meaning as long as we do not have the tools and the instruments to implement it. The key to conflict prevention is anticipation and we will only achieve this if we have specific strategic monitoring supported by genuine geopolitical and social observations instruments which are appropriate for the permanent monitoring of ethnic, linguistic and religious tensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament, which has done a lot of work on this, voted in favour of two motions for resolution on this subject. One, in 1996, called on the Commission to create a <span class="italic">Crisis prevention network</span> (CPN) to take on the role of strategic monitoring so that the analyses, diagnoses and proposals could be inter-European. The Commission set this up in 1998 and extended it in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Commissioner if the Commission is satisfied with the work that has been done. What lessons has it learned? What use has it been able to make of these reports? I would like to ask the Representative of the Council if the Council knows about this work. Has it ever, in spite of the Commission’s bureaucratic oppression, known about this work? Has it been of use to you?</p>
<p class="contents">The other resolution was incorporated in 1997 and 1998 in two reports on Africa, one by Mr Martens and the other by me. This resolution called on the Commission to propose to the ACP countries, on the occasion of the negotiations which were to lead to the Cotonou partnership agreement, that Europe should provide finance and expertise to enable four regional observatories of ethnic, linguistic and religious tension to operate in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Without such tools of anticipation, which Mrs Lindh spoke of earlier, though she did not actually talk about tools, we manage crises, but we do not see them coming. The Commission did not act on this suggestion. Nor did the Council. The idea, like the need, is still there. Does the Commission intend to take it up? Has the Council buried it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, when nations are turned into guinea pigs on the basis of the “stick and carrot rather than policy” approach, something is seriously wrong. Let us at least try out a new starting point, the sole aim of which is conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be a long time before those guilty of tragic mistakes in south-eastern Europe in the past are able to unravel, decode and understand the political and social DNA of the Balkans. Now that the European Union has taken substantial initiatives and general conditions in the area may be said to have improved, no new aggravation and no more armed reckonings should be allowed. Peace, cooperation, the rule of law and inviolable borders must form the backbone to our policy, along with constant efforts to improve the democratic institutions and standard of living in all these hard-hit regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must assist and strengthen the healthy forces in the area and must keep its distance from those trying to turn the underworld and organised crime into political agencies. We still have not calculated the huge cost – either to the region or to Europe as a whole – of the mistaken action which at last appears to have come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace and stability in the region would appear to be the primary <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>for a political resolution to the extended crisis and it will take a great deal of time and effort before stable, viable, constitutional institutions result. For the European Union, what a splendid victory. At last it can emerge wearing a olive wreath, Athena’s olive wreath of wisdom and peace, rather than the spear and shield of Mars, the ancient god of war.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to say to Mr Dupuis that, before saying what he did in the House about relations between the FYROM and Greece, he would have done well to talk to the FYROM government. Then he would have discovered that the European country with which it maintains the best relations is Greece. This is a fact of life and it makes an excellent contribution to stability in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne addresses the issue of organised crime as a significant cause of conflicts and wonders whether the Council has tried addressing the problem of organised crime in its work on conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov are travelling to Stockholm next week for a meeting with Heads of State and Government along with foreign ministers in conjunction with the European Council. One of the main points of the meeting will be to continue discussions on how we can work with the Russian Government on the on-going fight against organised crime, which can unfortunately be found in many parts of Russia and which constitutes a cause of many of the conflicts we see around Russia’s borderlands. I can therefore promise Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne that the presidency is actively trying to combat organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lalumière addresses an issue which is key to all work on conflict prevention, i.e. how the Union can achieve a greater consensus on foreign policy matters. Such a consensus is necessary if we are to be able to operate effectively in our work on conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the hope of the Council that the common strategies in particular that we have developed for a number of areas of conflict will help to develop such a consensus. The common strategies have not always worked in the way that the Council and others had hoped. In its meeting in January this year, the Council (General Affairs) approved conclusions, based on a report from the EU High Representative, Dr Javier Solana, containing an undertaking to try to refine this instrument, improve it and make it more concrete. I hope that this will prove an effective means of achieving what Mrs Lalumière is calling for. I share the honourable Member’s view fully.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would also like to refer to Mrs Kinnock’s question on the extent to which more common strategies should be developed for other areas, of which several were mentioned. The general opinion of the Council is that we must start by ensuring that the instrument of common strategies is more effective, before we move on to investigating whether it can be expanded to cover other areas of conflict. However, we note the proposals and will naturally bear them in mind in our on-going deliberations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Rocard asks a number of relevant questions and asks for concrete reactions to the way the Commission has been strengthened in its work on conflict prevention. I will hand you over to Commissioner Patten to answer this question in more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let me point out that one of the primary reasons for the presidency prioritising the development of a programme of measures to prevent conflict is that we see a need within the Union to pool our resources in order to improve efficiency in the area of conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">In this work, we will look at the decisions already taken and the embryonic state of the organisational structure in various areas. Hopefully, we will be able to draw up a common effective programme which makes the Union even better equipped to prevent conflicts around the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – I would like to respond to four questions which were put during the course of the debate. I see that two of those who asked me direct questions have not unfortunately been able to stay in order to hear the response, but I am sure that does not mean that they do not think the questions were important. In any event, I thought the questions were important so I will respond to them and perhaps they will be able to read the answers in the official record.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question was about the Tetovo University and I want to make it clear to the honourable Member who raised that question in absentia that I think the university is extremely important. I am very pleased with the commitment of the government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the establishment of that university. I am sure that Parliament will be pleased, but not surprised, that the Commission intends to put EUR 5 million of support into that university which has an extremely important role to play in ensuring the development of a successful multi-ethnic community.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the question of extremism, I agree with the honourable Member who said that we should not support Albanian extremism. We should all denounce it vigorously. In that context, I do not myself believe that it is remotely helpful, indeed exactly the reverse, to talk about constitutional change in the FYROM. We know perfectly well that there is a government in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia which has done an extraordinary job, a very brave job, a very committed job, in moving along the road of economic and political reform. I commend the efforts that the government has made so far. That is why we have agreed to start negotiating a stabilisation and association agreement with that government and that is why we completed those negotiations for an agreement before completing them with anybody else. We should continue to support the government of the FYROM in all its efforts to build a successful pluralist open society in the FYROM. They have done an excellent job so far and we will continue to support them against the extremist threats with which they have to contend.</p>
<p class="contents">Two other questions, first of all the question of country strategy papers and the importance of including ideas of conflict prevention in the country strategy papers. I thought, and certainly meant to make it clear in my earlier remarks, that this was a question that we intended to address in our communication in April on conflict prevention. I can assure the honourable Member that we will do that. It is extremely important. It represents the sort of development in the preparation of country strategy papers that we have seen with other aid donors and development partners so I hope we can pursue that.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member suggested, perhaps in view of our past experience a tad ambitiously, that we should launch ourselves on four new common strategies. I think we have some lessons to learn on common strategies as both the High Representative and this Commissioner have made clear in public and in private. But the honourable Member is entirely right to say that we need to look at more coherence in our policies in Africa. We have to take account of the fact that there is an unholy and unhealthy relationship between developmental problems in Africa and conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to address the question raised by Mr Rocard, who is, in many respects, the godfather of the conflict prevention network. That has been and remains a very valuable contribution to our policy armoury, although I think that we have to do rather more in making use of it. I hope we can in future. We had an extremely good meeting on the CPN last week with a group of parliamentarians. Two of his colleagues from the Socialist Group were able to attend that meeting at which there was a good exchange between my officials and the group of parliamentarians. We have an excellent relationship with the parliamentary advisory group on conflict prevention and will certainly take account of their advice and of the informed advice and wisdom of, as it were, the godfather – I mean that in an entirely benign sense – in our future development of the network and of our policies in this area. I hope that we can return to this subject in April when the Commission produces its communication on conflict prevention as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
