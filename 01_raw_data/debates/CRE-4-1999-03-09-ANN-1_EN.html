<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">President</span> <span class="bold">. </span>‐ Ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency, Mr Blaise Compaore, the President of Burkina Faso, to the House today. Mr Compaore is also President‐in‐Office of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organisation of African Unity. This formal sitting could not have been held at a more opportune time.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations between the signatory states to the Lomé Convention and the European Union are progressing towards the establishment of a new instrument which should allow the ACP States to become fully integrated into the world economy and which should further strengthen our partnership. The European Parliament has always emphasised the link between respect for human rights, democracy and good government on one hand and the achievement of development objectives on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, we are convinced that transparency and responsibility are vital elements of an effective cooperation policy and our relationship is therefore based on these elements. In Burkina Faso, political stability and progress towards a parliamentary democracy have been accompanied by major economic growth and controlled inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we can only congratulate the current positive role of Burkina Faso and its President as a centre for arbitration and the peaceful solution of conflicts in the African context. Your participation and that of your country in this work and in maintaining peace in West Africa are of paramount importance.</p>
<p class="contents">President Compaore, in receiving you today, this House is once again showing its faith in an African continent which, by overcoming current very difficult events, is preparing itself to achieve economic growth, to implement its own models and to tackle globalisation in an African style.</p>
<p class="contents">President Compaore, we are delighted to welcome you here today.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Compaore, </span>  <span class="italic">President of Burkina Faso and Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity. – (FR)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, 1999 will undoubtedly be a year of major challenges for all our peoples and for the organisations representing them. This is particularly true for the people of Africa who regard an exemplary partnership with the European Union as the central theme for the beginning of the new century. This partnership is needed in order to confront the three challenges on which the development of the African continent is dependent. These challenges are peace, the rule of law and sustainable development within the new frontiers of a wider world.</p>
<p class="contents">In these three areas, the work facing the African public authorities, our civil societies, our peoples and our partners, led by the European Union, is of almost Herculean proportions.</p>
<p class="contents">In my dual capacity as Head of State of Burkina Faso and Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity, I must firstly express my esteem and gratitude to you, Mr President, and I must also pay tribute to your noble House, which is an essential institution in the construction of Europe, and to its Members. Finally I must thank the town of Strasbourg and Europe which have welcomed me and through me honoured Burkina Faso and Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe and Africa are like two ships which have regularly crossed paths in a long history of agreement and conflict but which have now steered a course through these agreements and conflicts to reach a safe harbour of accord and partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention between the European Union and its African, Caribbean and Pacific partners has been in operation for twenty‐five years. We undoubtedly all agree that this has been the most exemplary instrument of cooperation at its level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, despite being exemplary, there is room for improvement. This is the reason for the new relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries that is now being negotiated. As you know, these negotiations are occurring at a time when the challenges of globalisation are requiring changes to be made, including the reexamination and reorganisation of the broad principles of traditional North‐South cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Africa today, bruised as it is, presents an image of a continent in despair. Fifteen or so African states are currently struggling with conflicts causing insecurity and instability. At this time, nearly forty other countries, in a less tumultuous context, are trying to create societies which are more capable of using their potential to the benefit of the vast majority of the population who aspire to a future of greater security and well‐being and increased development.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace in Africa can only be the result of an internal dynamic within the continent. This belief is so firmly held that the Heads of State and Government in the Organisation of African Unity have created a mechanism for preventing, controlling and settling conflicts in Africa. This mechanism has a central body whose last summit meeting was held on 17 and 18 December 1998 in Ouagadougou with the aim of finding solutions to the persistent conflicts in the continent. Certainly, Africa is continuing to make every effort to prevent, control and settle these conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the OAU framework agreement has just been accepted by both sides. This bodes well for the future and will form a milestone in the history of the continent in terms of controlling and settling conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">In Guinea‐Bissau, the various sub‐regional initiatives supported by the OAU have led to the signing of an agreement which is being implemented in particular through the formation of a government of national union and the imminent organisation of general elections.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sierra Leone, the joint efforts of the OAU and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have allowed the establishment of a plan for dialogue between the sides which will certainly help to ensure the return of peace and stability to this country.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Comoros, we are continuing the mediation work in order to achieve a solution protecting Comoran unity.</p>
<p class="contents">There remain other major areas of concern, in particular the situation in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of the Congo and the Sudan. We have high hopes that the extraordinary summit of the OAU, planned for the end of this month in Ouagadougou and devoted solely to the solution of conflicts, will openly and resolutely produce solutions to overcome these crises.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must support the efforts of Africa in implementing peace agreements. In particular we ask the European Union to remain constantly available in order to provide Africa with logistical support, expertise and assistance in dealing with humanitarian issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Africa is experiencing a paradox. Although democracy is supposed to be a means of preventing, controlling and solving internal conflicts in Africa, the road to democracy is sometimes itself a source of conflicts or violence, particularly on the subject of elections, due to the proliferation of a monopolistic power culture in our continent. The construction of the African nations requires us to build national and regional areas of freedom, to extend and protect human rights and to develop popular responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why Africa must resolutely commit itself to consolidating the current democratic process by reinforcing the mechanisms which underlie this process. In particular this involves the organisation of elections, the reinforced roles of the democratic opposition and of organisations of civil society, decentralisation, the principles and rules of good governance, the republican nature of the military and security forces, and the proper operation of the institutions of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of the cooperation between the European Union and Africa in the context of a renewed and reinforced partnership on the eve of a new millennium is clear at this juncture.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to bring about the changes desired by both sides and sometimes reluctantly accepted, the future Convention must allow the praiseworthy efforts of the African states in terms of reforms, good governance, human rights, democracy and increased production to continue to be assisted.</p>
<p class="contents">Far from challenging the privileged relations which exist between the European Union and the ACP countries, the future Convention must succeed in establishing a mature partnership based on genuine sharing of responsibility in the context of mutual commitments. Furthermore, the weakness in intraregional trade and the extremely wide disparities between the ACP countries which only really have poverty in common must advocate against identical treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the main challenge of the current negotiations is to achieve a responsible partnership which takes these disparities into account and which respects the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the current requirements of economic efficiency and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The political dimension of the next convention must be reinforced in order to give it the best chance of encouraging the unavoidable changes in the continent. Universal democratic principles, human rights and good governance constitute an essential requirement for the African people.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the rate of positive change may not meet our expectations and common hopes because the negative side of the historical and cultural situation frequently takes precedence over the tenacity of our ambition and our desire for change.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, which I am honoured to be addressing, has contributed enormously in recent years to the construction of democracy and to respect for human rights in Africa. The many missions, hearings and reports of the Members of the European Parliament are evidence of this.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for all these present and future actions to positively assist in the harmonious development of our countries and the African continent, the African private sector must now be involved through a partnership of assistance between companies. In addition, decentralised cooperation must be stimulated and in particular the African civil society must be strengthened by establishing a dynamic cooperation between non‐governmental organisations and associations and trade unions from the North and South.</p>
<p class="contents">This is how to ensure optimum acceptance of the promotion of human rights and the protection of workers, with a view to an increasingly modern and transparent participative management of public affairs. This solidarity between civil societies has become essential to steer people in the direction of the changes keenly awaited by all in order to bring peace, security and prosperity to Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the efforts made by Africa in order to bring about its economic transformation, with a view to its integration into the world economy, the strategic and essential nature of economic integration stands out, as it has done in Europe. The existence at continental and sub‐continental level of numerous regional and sub‐regional organisations is making this vision become reality. This will culminate with the effective establishment of the African Economic Community, created by the Abuja Treaty of 1991.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the regional integration plans are gradually moving towards the development of regional transport, communication and energy systems, the facilitation of trade within certain production sectors, the development of regional trade and support to the private sector. All this requires measures which range from the removal of non‐tariff barriers to the promotion of research and include support for reforms aimed at creating an institutional and legal environment favourable to private investment and a system encouraging the development of services.</p>
<p class="contents">In this ceaseless enterprise, Africa can never have enough friends and partners. In this respect, the reduction and even the elimination of debt and the improvement and raising of the level of political dialogue between Africa and Europe are essential. Popular wisdom says that all our destinies are interlinked. This can be viewed as a threat or as a marvellous hymn to fraternity and solidarity. This is the choice facing us.</p>
<p class="contents">Long live the European Parliament, European‐African cooperation and solidarity between our people!</p>
