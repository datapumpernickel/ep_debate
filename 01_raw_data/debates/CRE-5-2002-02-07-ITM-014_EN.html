<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watts (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, since 7 November the SNCF has suspended all cross-Channel rail freight services because of fears for the safety of its staff at Calais following threats from those seeking to enter the UK illegally. As a result, Channel Tunnel freight services are now in a state of deep crisis. However, we are pleased today that both French MEPs and British Labour MEPs have pushed for a debate, and indeed that the ELDR Group has joined us in calling this debate this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">We need cooperation, not conflict, to resolve this particular problem. No more naming and shaming, no more buck-passing; we need the British government, the French government, the SNCF, Eurotunnel, EWS and others to start working together more effectively. A lot has been done, but there is a lot to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Added to my list is the European Commission. Articles 28 to 30 of the Treaty and Regulation 2679/98 guarantee the free movement of goods. That means free movement through the Channel Tunnel. I thank the Commissioner for intervening in this particular crisis and for responding positively to requests from myself and others. In the past few days a security fence has been built and we welcome that. But policing is still only between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. We hope to be able to persuade our French colleagues of the need for 24-hour policing and adequate police numbers. We need the SNCF to resume services as soon as possible and we need urgent modifications to locomotives to ensure they do not need to stop at Calais purely for technical reasons. These are practical measures that will make a big difference in the short term. We hope you, Commissioner, will continue to act to ensure that this vital link in the single market is restored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, the Commission is worried about the fall in rail freight due to security problems at the SNCF station. This situation is having an adverse impart on the distribution of freight transport services between the modes of transport on this important route. This is damaging rail transport and runs counter to the Commission's collective view of the role of rail transport, as set out in the White Paper presented in September 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The partial suspension of rail traffic through the Tunnel is reducing the use made of its potential and, as a consequence, the return on the investment in this vital European transport infrastructure. The Commission has been fully apprised of the situation since it emerged in November. In application of Regulation No 2679/98 on the free movement of goods, the Commission services asked the French authorities to take all the necessary measures to restore the smooth flow of traffic back in November. They also asked for regular reports on developments in the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">According to our most recent information, the situation has improved slightly. The police are patrolling the area, rail capacity has been increased, where possible, from 1,200 to 1,600 tonnes. Work on the Frethun freight terminal started in December and a reinforced fence is expected to be completed at the beginning of February. Security installations on the site, such as video cameras and heat detectors, will be in place by the end of June. Contacts with the French authorities will be maintained, Commissioner Bolkestein has suggested meeting his French and British counterparts and the ministers responsible for the internal market in order to discuss the matter on the fringe of the next Market Council on 1 March. Our objective is to restore the free movement of goods by June at the latest, once all the work on the terminal has been completed.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment refers to asylum and external border controls. The policy of the Union and the Member States on asylum and external border controls is also in jeopardy. The Commission believes that approving harmonised rules will help stop certain Member States from being more attractive than others and it has already tabled proposals along these lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now it seems more a case of people loose in the Tunnel and trains and trade cut off – which is altogether more serious.</p>
<p class="contents">The effects of the restrictions are very damaging to free movement and employment: thousands of jobs are at risk. I have to say that for those affected, removing the restrictions by June sounds a very long way off. The problem is the proximity of the Sangatte camp for refugees: it is too close and should be moved, and makes policing very difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">This Tunnel is an asset and enterprise which is jointly owned and benefits both France and Britain, as well as the wider Community of Member States. It is probably the single most important physical link drawing Britain and the continent together. The difficulty of policing illegal immigrants is damaging to this process and must be resolved soon.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to press the French authorities to take action. I call on the United Kingdom government to offer more assistance to its French counterparts and to the hauliers and businesses concerned, rather than seeming to turn a blind eye to their concerns and difficulties and spending more time harassing truck drivers and train operators with prosecutions and fines. The authorities need to take action and not take it out on other innocent parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is ironic that I speak on this subject because, as a rapporteur, I helped push through this House the issue of free movement of goods at border areas where there was disruption. Primarily it was meant to attack the issue of industrial relations at borders. But this is interesting: I praise and applaud the Commission's lateral thinking about the application of these articles that have been laid before them.</p>
<p class="contents">I knew then, as I know now, that the requirements set down in that particular set of articles were merely mechanistic, that it comes down to political goodwill. People here today will appreciate that it requires all parties to pay attention to what is happening at the Channel Tunnel and to make sure that they do not allow it to be obscured by the mere arguments, cultural or political, that exist there.</p>
<p class="contents">There are problems. In this particular issue there are problems of slender resources – we understand that – whether of the police or of security personnel at the areas where they are involved. But we need to get freight through unfettered. Let us also recognise that this is an international problem. People have been displaced as a consequence of wars and of major disruption and there are also economic émigrés who will pay any price to get into the UK. Quite often it is a price paid to criminal gangs, there to exploit the motivation of these people.</p>
<p class="contents">Real solutions, therefore, lie in the hands of politicians coordinating their actions at government level. Peace and development in the areas of the world facing crisis are also what we must strive for. In France we have also seen, all too unfortunately, human tragedy that has left in our minds the human aspect of all that is going on there.</p>
<p class="contents">The attempts of the French authorities to tighten security are welcome. The highest level of vigilance must continue to be demanded, as Mr Watts has said.</p>
<p class="contents">Attending to this question in the House confirms the international status and interest which it deserves. Not just the Channel Tunnel, but other issues as well, will be resolved by such processes. This gives us just such a platform to launch that process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Coming from one of the more remote parts of Europe, namely Scotland, it is so important for us to be connected with the centre. The problems we face at the moment are acute. I refer to exports and the logistical problems that are being created, as well as the problems for the rail freight companies generally.</p>
<p class="contents">What is an acute problem could, if matters are not dealt with properly, become a chronic one. Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already referred to the fact that what is happening with the Channel Tunnel is counterproductive to the policy which we all want to see pursued, namely that of getting freight on to the railways and off the roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the present situation within the United Kingdom, the difficulties that it has in exporting and the railways there, and looking to the future of the whole transport policy of the European Union, I sincerely hope that as much pressure as possible can be brought to bear from all quarters to get this problem resolved as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very grateful to Mr Watson and to the Liberal colleagues who put forward the questions which promote this debate today. It is a vital debate.</p>
<p class="contents">To try and make the point Mrs Attwooll was making yet more vivid, 30 miles away from the house in which I live in Edinburgh, midway between Edinburgh and Glasgow, at the town of Motherwell, lies the most northerly freight outpost of the trans-European network into the United Kingdom, the Motherwell Eurocentral depot. We have been told in recent weeks that the carrier out of that port, EWS, will not be able to afford to continue providing a service out of Scotland at the current available number of trains per day. It would be a crisis for Scotland, and therefore a crisis for transport across the Union, if that happened. It is well known, for example, that the Scotch whisky industry depends heavily on rail freight to get malt scotch and blended scotch into the European market. Heavy losses are being made on a vitally important trade.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances it is encouraging to be told that the Commission takes this matter seriously, but it is not encouraging to be told that all will be well by June, because the information we are receiving from the commercial parties involved is that they cannot last until June at present levels.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a time when people throughout the European Union people are asking themselves the question: Do we obtain the benefits which we are promised from our membership of the European Union? These benefits particularly relate to the opportunity to trade freely across the Union. Other benefits which have been promised are those arising from intermodal transport – that not everything should go on the roads. That affects not just people in Scotland; it even more affects people down the motorway routes through England, if far too much heavy freight traffic goes down there. We need traffic on the railways. We also need traffic by sea. We are very grateful to Commissioner de Palacio for the work she has put into securing the new ferry link between Scotland and Zeebrugge, but if we are going to have a sensible transport policy which really does spread the load and save the roads from excessive use by heavy traffic, we must have this railway line kept open.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to colleagues who have raised this question. I am grateful to the Commission for taking it seriously; but I want to know as well what compensation will be available to ensure that those who have lost money are not prevented from trading altogether by the uneconomic conditions now prevailing on this route. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The free movement of people, but also of goods, should not lead to the unverifiable movement of asylum seekers as a result of open borders. Untenable situations have arisen at the Eurotunnel caused by stowaways on trains. As a consequence of this, restrictions have been in place for three months now, as a result of which the volume of goods by rail through the tunnel has at least halved. This loss of turnover causes disproportionate damage to the Channel Tunnel operator, who is not even certain that the sanctions for stowaways are now in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion on the White Paper on transport policy is in full swing. Despite all the differences of opinion, almost everyone involved is agreed that the growth in the transport of goods must not unilaterally end up on the roads. Rail, in addition to water, is a sound alternative. The restricted use of the Eurotunnel has forced many companies to transport goods by road for the time being. There is a fear that, once again, the reputation of rail transport will incur lasting damage. In order for transport capacity to recover, the underlying problem has to be solved. This is not the place to discuss the problem and tragedy of illegal immigrants in Europe. However, the asylum policies of the two countries on either side of the Eurotunnel is undeniably responsible for the drastic decline in the transport of goods by rail though the tunnel.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom has to contend with the dubious reputation of pursuing a flexible immigration policy and of hardly fighting illegal employment. Whether this is an accurate description or not, the British government fails at any rate to discourage refugees. On the other hand, French asylum policy can be referred to as being two-faced. The large stream of refugees via France is not stopped until they reach the Eurotunnel and are held at the camp near Sangatte. This amounts to a concentration of hundreds of desperate people only 3 km away from the Eurotunnel, the gateway to England, their country of destination. Locked up in a camp within walking distance of the gate to the other side. Surely this is tantamount to leaving the fox to watch the geese!</p>
<p class="contents">Asylum seekers deserve our sympathy, for they too are ultimately the victims of ambiguous rules, random implementation and inadequate inspection. It is high time that the French authorities detained the asylum seekers in France, for example near an international airport, from where, upon being refused admittance, they can return to their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The sad images from Frethun require both the Commission and the Council to do everything in their power, not only to remove this impediment, but also to tackle the cause. They must not be allowed to shirk their responsibilities while the market for the transport of goods is being disrupted in this way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I am truly perplexed by the oral questions tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party on the disrupted Channel Tunnel rail freight services. This disruption was caused by refugees trying to enter Great Britain illegally.</p>
<p class="contents">Judging by the oral questions tabled, the main, or even the only problem, is that of the disruption to the freedom of movement of goods through the Channel Tunnel, and therefore the losses incurred by rail freight companies which could be exacerbated – I shudder at the thought – by unfair competition between the various methods of transport to the detriment of the railways.</p>
<p class="contents">Like my fellow Members, I strongly regret the losses incurred by the rail freight companies and I would even add that, in my view, it is illogical that France, whose socialist government bears the responsibility for this matter, is not severely punished, morally and financially, for its inability to maintain public order.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would also like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that this matter poses much wider and much more serious societal problems than just unfair competition between private operators.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I will add a set of additional questions to those tabled by the PSE and ELDR Groups.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, some of the people who attempt to enter Great Britain illegally are asylum seekers, but some are illegal immigrants, even in France. How do many illegal immigrants manage to reach the heart of Europe, having passed several internal borders, without being noticed? This is a fundamental issue that should be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, what measures are being taken to immediately escort these illegal immigrants back to the European Union’s external border?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question refers to the fact that a large number of asylum seekers who attempt to enter Great Britain are from Afghanistan. However, as far as I know, the Taliban regime has now been eliminated and these people can return home. What measures are therefore being taken to repatriate them?</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final question refers to some people's belief that if we had a single European asylum policy, we would not have such problems. Of course, this might mean that refugees would no longer receive unequal treatment in different European Union countries. But does the Commission think that the overall number of asylum seekers would go down? If it does, how exactly would this be achieved? On the other hand, this might mean that if the European asylum standards were aligned at a high level – which is what the Commission regularly states it intends to do – the overall number of asylum seekers in the European Union would significantly increase. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It may surprise the Commissioner to have such a representation from Scotland, but Scotland is probably one of the greatest victims of this situation in the Channel Tunnel. Because of the reduction in transit through the Tunnel, we do not have a mere three services a night – we have none, because the service from Scotland to the continent has been withdrawn completely. As Mr MacCormick said, it is no longer possible to transport Scotch whisky to the Continent or to send our microcircuits to Paris, Frankfurt or Milan. But more than that: it is no longer possible for us to import parts and continental products by train. Costs for both exports and imports are increasing, as are road congestion and pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">A service which did something to bring Scotland closer to the golden triangle of Europe has been lost, and so Scotland returns to the periphery. This is a tragedy, and why? Because we seem incapable of organising our immigration systems on a European basis and of providing adequate security to ensure that any such arrangement works. Clearly there are faults on the French side of <span class="italic">La Manche</span> and on the English side of the English Channel, but the victims are my constituents – hundreds of miles from Dover and Calais – in Scotland.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the UK government to resolve its immigration system, in collaboration with its neighbours, so that it does not attract tens of thousands of desperate people. It is surely not coincidental that the UK is one of the only European countries without identity cards.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the French authorities, from their old allies of the Auld Alliance, their Scottish cousins, to enforce real security at their end of the Tunnel so that the rail freight service to and from Scotland can be resumed.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the Commissioner and the Commission to knock all their heads together urgently in order to reach a solution to this absurd state of affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason why we tabled this question is because the public sees the problem at the Eurotunnel site – since it involves two large European countries and also since it concerns our security and asylum policy – as requiring intervention by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot let this situation rumble on, as it would then illustrate Europe’s lack of power. This situation also implies that we have envisaged solutions that can be applied to other borders and to other locations that are under pressure from migration. We are therefore calling, since the asylum policy and judicial and security policy are not sufficiently harmonised, for the Commission to work with France and Great Britain so that strong measures can be taken in three areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The first area is to re-establish, as far as possible, the freedom of movement, particularly that of rail freight in the Channel Tunnel. What is happening, despite considerable investment by the rail operators and the SNCF in particular, contradicts our policy of moving towards using rail rather than road.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area is that if we fail to harmonise security legislation and mechanisms, we must take coordinated and coherent measures in the two countries to combat those involved in human trafficking, by increasing controls and introducing stiffer penalties, as this activity constitutes an intolerable attack on human rights and is a shameful trade.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the third area is concerned, what is happening at Eurotunnel demonstrates the urgent need to harmonise Europe’s asylum policy. This is because what is happening there, and what France and England are being remonstrated for, is a problem which may concern all European Union countries in the future. We know, thanks to the experience of what is happening throughout the world, that there will never be a perfect and wholly reliable solution, given the disorder in the world and the growing disparities between North and South.</p>
<p class="contents">The first and most important solution, the fundamental solution is, of course, to have a much more generous and more balanced development policy. However, since we do not have this and as a short-term measure, I think that we must implement common measures in the two countries, so that we can ruthlessly track the people who trade on illusions – human traffickers, in other words. I think that this is very important. Lastly, I personally hope that, rather than leaving the these two countries to face their responsibilities alone, we find, with the help of the Commission, measures which are strong enough to be held up as an example and that can be applied to other locations in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Numerous approaches have been voiced, from the possibility of invoking articles in the Treaty to intervention by the Commission to persuade the French government to act more quickly. The current legislation of the European Union allows the Commission to institute infringement proceedings against a Member State found to be obstructing the free movement of goods.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these proceedings are subject to strict criteria when the obstacle is created by a few private individuals and the Commission can only act if the authorities in question fail to take the necessary measures. This clearly does not apply in the present case. Serious efforts are being made, contacts between the Commission and the French government have proven useful and we shall continue to work along these lines. The French government has already closed the site in question, a study has been carried out and initial efforts have been made to install the technology required but, of course, the level of policing, the number of police officers required and the installation of the high-tech equipment needed are matters for the French government.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I should like to make brings us to the root of the problem. Why has traffic been suspended? Why are there constantly problems with train traffic through the tunnel? Why are illegal immigrants trespassing on various sites used by rail freight transporters? I think, as several Members have said, that the root of the problem is to be found in common European policy; we need a common asylum policy to discourage immigrants from trying to reach specific Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">So the Commission has already tabled a number of proposals on procedures and rules for granting refugee status and minimum common requirements for receiving asylum seekers. Another proposal sets criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining asylum applications. These proposals stipulate that, if an asylum seeker remains in one Member State for an extended period, then that Member State is responsible for examining the asylum application. This means, in this particular case, that asylum seekers will be unable to acquire refugee status in Britain after an extended period in France.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think that, when it comes to finding an immediate solution to a problem which is having a significant impact on certain areas, especially remote areas in Scotland, as well as on the European continent, and on trade relations with Great Britain, the French government alone is responsible. It needs to take action as quickly as possible to complete the plan submitted and it is working with Great Britain and the Commission in order to do so. As far as a long-term solution to the problem is concerned because, as numerous Members have said today, the problem today may be on the border between France and Great Britain, but tomorrow it could well surface somewhere else in Europe, we need a fast decision on a common asylum policy at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
