<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pirker (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, we are able to celebrate a ten-year anniversary almost exactly to the day. Almost exactly ten years ago to the day, we started discussing which country should in fact be responsible for processing asylum applications. Then the Dublin Convention came into force. Yet, to this day, we have failed to make Dublin truly enforceable, in other words, we have been unable to establish a suitable instrument of control. We have been discussing the fact that we need an instrument of this kind, for years, but so far to no avail, and tomorrow we will have our one and only chance to actually complete Eurodac. I would be delighted if we could. A great many Council Presidents, who have held office in the intervening period, would be delighted too, and everyone has promised that they will make it an absolute priority to try and make Eurodac a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been a long, drawn-out business, and it concerns an important issue. Why do we need Eurodac and what can it do? Eurodac is a system that will enable us to compare fingerprints and ascertain in an appropriate manner, which country was the first point of contact for the refugee, and, as such, which country is responsible for processing the asylum application. This will also allow for a distribution of the burden amongst the Member States. And, of course, it is also an instrument that will be used to establish if an applicant has submitted asylum applications before. In other words, it is also an instrument for fighting abuse and illegal activity. It is an instrument that we both want, and need, to have at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, it has been a long, drawn-out business and the last time we discussed it in Parliament was December 1999. The vast majority of us were agreed, firstly on the fact that we must get Eurodac up and running, and secondly, on the conditions under which it should be implemented. Above all, we have seen eye to eye with Commissioner Vitorino throughout, and I would like to thank him, because he has moved heaven and earth to enable Eurodac to at last become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament established that the implementing powers would be conferred on the Commission, in accordance with the provisions of the EC Treaty. However, immediately after we had taken this decision, the Council met in December and, for reasons which we do not understand at all, shelved these joint proposals from Parliament and the Commission, and reserved the most important implementing powers for itself. Consequently, because there had been a substantial amendment, this required reconsultation of Parliament, i.e. we have had to review the situation, albeit only in respect of the relevant points, i.e. Articles 22 and 23 alone. We confined ourselves to these areas in committee, with the exception of Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, who sparked off a new discussion. I do not know what she was hoping to achieve in this way. The object of the exercise was simply to deal with Articles 22 and 23.</p>
<p class="contents">The new proposal relating to these articles accommodates the Council’s wish to retain sole responsibility for the most important implementing powers, i.e. those regarding the collection, transmission and comparison of fingerprints, those for the blocking of the data concerning applicants for asylum, and those for drawing up statistics on asylum applicants. There was unanimous agreement in committee that we should stand by our original proposal and reject that of the Council. Why? For two quite crucial reasons. Firstly, the Council’s move is contrary to Article 202 of the EC Treaty, which establishes the principle that the implementation of the rules which the Council lays down shall be conferred on the Commission. This is particularly important in this case. The Commission could take a far more impartial – i.e. it would be less likely to accommodate specific national interests – and objective line when it comes to implementing this regulation. Therefore we as a Parliament support this. There is also a second reason as to why we oppose the Council’s proposal. It works against Parliament because it excludes us, because there is no longer a comitology procedure, and because we will no longer have access or entitlement to the information we need.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal would whittle away Parliament’s rights. For these two highly convincing reasons, we are in favour of the proposal submitted by the Commission and Commissioner Vitorino, to the effect that implementing powers should be bestowed on the Commission, and I would urge you all to attend tomorrow’s vote. This will be our opportunity to make Europe a safer place, and to take action against abuse. Let us seize this opportunity and use this chance to at last make Eurodac a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a past Minister for Immigration and Asylum in the United Kingdom, I am well aware that the confusion with regard to determining which country should deal with any particular application has been an immense problem and one that has created a considerable level of friction between Members of the European Union. Unless it is tackled urgently, it will continue to be an area of friction as we look at the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Dublin Convention in itself has always been important but it is the flaws in the Dublin Convention and our failure to administer the Dublin Convention properly, which has caused issues to arise which could even threaten the human rights of some of the applicants and individuals concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">All the countries that are signatories to the United Nations Convention of 1951 are well aware of the criteria for determining whether someone should be granted the extremely valuable and significant status of a refugee and I hope that nothing we ever do here would affect the right to make an application within those criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">However – with new technology, with new travelling arrangements, and indeed with people who want to abuse the system using that technology – it has become more and more difficult for the authorities to treat people in an appropriate and fair manner in handling their cases. Eurodac has to run hand in hand with the reform of the Dublin Convention and I am somewhat concerned at the attitude that the Council has adopted in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pirker has spoken of the delays that have occurred and the numerous times that this vital issue has been reconsidered. My feelings are clear: if the Council wishes to reserve powers to itself when the information from Eurodac should be available to this democratic body, Parliament, then that is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all the more reason why we need to treat this matter with urgency, why we need to resolve it, and why Parliament should continue to play a strong role in the future in the superintendence and monitoring of vital issues relating to the granting refugee status to those who might apply.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support Mr Pirker and I hope we make strong moves now to conclude this matter in the interests of everybody. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last time it expressed its opinion on the proposal as a whole and I believe that the position Parliament adopted was very close to what the Socialist Group wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to defend Parliament’s position, which this House voted for a few months ago in relation to the Eurodac Agreement. I therefore believe that we are now being consulted on an amendment which the Council is introducing in this communication, and that it affects the allocation of competences for this action by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty established that the Commission must have responsibility for implementation – for Eurodac also, we believe – and also established that Parliament can supervise what the Commission does. This still does not seem sufficient to us, and we hope that, at least in the legislative and supervisory field, we can have further competences. For this reason, my Group is tomorrow going to abstain in the vote on all the amendments which do not relate to this change to the Council’s communication. We are going to abstain on those amendments which we feel have already been approved by Parliament and which are already included in this Parliament’s previous report. We are going to abstain for reasons which I imagine are very different from Mr Pirker’s reasons for voting against it, but we are going to abstain in order to maintain the position which Parliament has already expressed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on behalf of my group, I would like to express my support for the amendments proposed by Mr Pirker, for the reasons which I have already expressed, because I believe that the previous proposal was better and because I believe that the Commission must take this project forward. I hope that it does so taking account of Parliament’s decision and it is important that tomorrow’s vote shows Parliament’s strong support for the previous proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are developing a third pillar on the basis of policies which have been intergovernmental and which must become Community policies. I believe it is very important for Parliament to support these first actions we are taking and also to support the Commission so that it can play the role accorded it by the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is absolutely right to argue that the Commission is in a stronger position to take an impartial view which does not bend to accommodate specific national interests and therefore it is arguably more capable of drawing up adequate data-protection safeguards.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, although Parliament may have its arguments with the Commission from time to time, we do have a much better chance of exercising democratic supervision if the Commission has the implementing powers than if the Council has them. This is because the regulatory committee procedure, coupled with the interinstitutional agreement, entitles Parliament to receive draft implementing measures. And when – rather than if – we achieve codecision in this area, this will enable Parliament to require the Commission to re-examine the measures if the implementing measures are exceeded.</p>
<p class="contents">We would be foolish, as a Parliament, to rely on the Council’s goodwill rather than on rights which we possess if the Commission has the implementing powers. That is why my group will abstain on some of the amendments of substance which would alter the substantive details of the Eurodac regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">My group supported these amendments when the focus was on the substance but at this stage it is better to concentrate on the issue of whether the Commission or Council has implementing powers so that we in Parliament state loudly and in unison that our interests lie in backing the Commission. That is the only issue that we ought to concentrate on now and, perhaps with some slight regret, we feel that Parliament’s position needs to be slimmed down to Mr Pirker’s points on comitology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Last November, the majority of the European Parliament adopted a report on the creation of the Eurodac system. Following this vote, the Council modified its proposal for a regulation, stating that the Eurodac system for comparing fingerprints should be established and administered by the Council rather than the Commission. This important change is the reason why this report is being re-examined by this Chamber. In the opinion of our Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, it was the Commission rather than the Council that should be given responsibility for administering this new facility, Eurodac.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the Commission quite rightly emphasised that, as the only Community institution of the Union, it ought to have responsibility for administering a Community programme like Eurodac, and not in any circumstances the Council, which is an intergovernmental body. We wholly support the Commission on this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the new proposal being examined today has not taken any account whatsoever of the amendments Parliament has voted in favour of. Whether it be about specifying 18 years as the minimum age at which an applicant for asylum can be registered on the Eurodac database, about erasing personal data once legally recognised status has been acquired or about substituting the expression ‘third-country national’ for ‘alien’, the Council has not seen fit to take account of Parliament’s opinion and has been supported in this by the Commission, which has also declined to take account of it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in view of this situation that I am today asking you again to uphold the vote which Parliament wisely held last year. This means voting on the text adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which includes the amendments relating to the lower age limit of 18 years, the erasing of personal data in the case of any applicant who has achieved legal status and the use of the expression ‘third-country national’ rather than ‘alien’. The amendments to the report proposed by the Group of the European People’s Party, to which the rapporteur belongs, should therefore be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">I really find it difficult to understand how anyone can remain silent and avoid taking sides and consider taking fingerprints from 14-year-old adolescents to be a legitimate action, when it is something which contravenes all the international treaties in force, particularly those on the rights of the child.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to erasing personal data, it is just a question of being sensible. Once the applicant concerned has obtained legal status, there is in fact no justification for retaining the personal data and fingerprints of someone whose situation has been regularised in law. That would be to view him as a potential criminal. It is not solely in the future Charter that the protection of fundamental rights, close to our hearts as it is, becomes an issue, but also in every European text, where we must be vigilant in their defence.</p>
<p class="contents">What is at stake is Parliament’s credibility in the eyes of those who already have a lot of difficulty putting their trust in us. The people of Europe find it incomprehensible, and surprising to say the least, that the European Parliament should one day come out in favour of a report only, a few months later, to go back on its decision and vote in favour of a radically different report. How can our electorate have confidence in a Parliament which changes its views according to the way the wind blows and which is incapable of facing up to the Commission and the Council which do not, for all that, have the democratic legitimacy with which we have as an institution.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would today ask you to vote in such a way as to reaffirm last November’s vote and to adopt the report in the form presented to you by the committee. It is in adopting coherent and consistent positions that Parliament will enhance its stature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Eurodac system is part and parcel of a general tendency to criminalise and penalise immigrants and those who are being persecuted the world over. It reveals the true face of liberal Europe, which is setting itself up as a besieged fortress. How can anyone imagine that it is by means of repressive laws that the starving of the earth are to be prevented from coming to Europe, even at the risk of their lives, as has been seen recently at Dover and in Gibraltar.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, it is, as we all know, these combined weapons of criminalisation which force thousands of foreigners to become illegal immigrants who then fall victim to smugglers, slave merchants or unscrupulous bosses who grossly exploit them. Regularising the status of illegal immigrants en masse is the way to put a spoke in the wheels of all these dealers in human misery.</p>
<p class="contents">It is these combined weapons of criminalisation which will erode our own freedoms, as witness the French Presidency’s plan, which we shall have to express our opinion on. This plan is aimed at cracking down on anyone who comes to the aid of an immigrant without the proper papers. It is because of these weapons and because of this strategy that, today in France, a boy of Tamil origin is imprisoned with his mother in the Aranc detention centre waiting for a judgement from the Minister of the Interior and, in all likelihood, his expulsion from the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Recording people’s fingerprints on computer is an attack on individual freedom. It systematically treats asylum seekers as suspects and puts a question mark over the confidentiality of the documents held by the bodies responsible for examining their applications. It infringes the legal protection due to refugees in being applied even to 14-year-olds. It contravenes the International Declaration on the Rights of the Child and, in particular, Article 10 of this. Who, among you here, would dare take the fingerprints of a young lad of 14? The Eurodac project makes criminals of immigrants without proper papers, often deprived of legal status because of the differences in the laws between one European country and another.</p>
<p class="contents">It fundamentally violates all the international conventions protecting human rights. With this project, Fortress Europe is guilty of failing to assist refugees who are in danger. This is hardly a surprise coming from a liberal Europe which equips the Ankara dictatorship with combat helicopters at the same time as rejecting Kurdish refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when a wave of racism and xenophobia is forming across Europe and when consideration is being given to drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights, you ought to reject Eurodac, with or without amendments. It is our own freedoms that are at stake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Eurodac incident is an example of this: without having defined any kind of European political asylum policy at all, the Member States, through the Council, created the Dublin Convention, which legalises mutual backscratching as regards applicants for asylum and the examination of their applications for political asylum in our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, in order to bring the Convention into operation, the Council promoted the creation of the Eurodac system, and initially made the Commission responsible for its implementation. However, it then decided to go further and extend electronic fingerprinting to illegal immigrants, removed the management responsibilities from the Commission, and took them directly upon itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of this confusion, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is right, through Mr Pirker’s report, to restore these responsibilities to the Commission and to make other amendments of substance which we fully support. Having said that, since we do not, however, support the basic bureaucratic, repressive approach sustained by the Council and abetted by the Commission, which is reflected in the Dublin Convention and the EURODAC system, we will vote for the amendments of substance tabled by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs but against the legislative resolution, for it leaves the way almost completely open for this absurd piece of legislation which introduces the systematic compilation of police records on refugees and illegal immigrants at European level: a legal, political and humanitarian atrocity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is nevertheless worthwhile saying, in line with the views of the rapporteur Mr Pirker and of the Commission itself, how incomprehensible we find it that in the new text, the Council proposes to reserve to itself responsibility for implementing the Eurodac regulation, which departs from the system previously envisaged, in which these powers would fall to the Commission. We are unhappy with this, firstly because Parliament, as has already been pointed out, is seeing its rights diminished, specifically its right to remain informed. In fact, the Commission is, in general terms, obliged, under the terms of Article 7 of the decision on comitology, to keep Parliament informed of committee proceedings and whenever the Commission transmits relevant measures or proposals to the Council. With this new text, this prerogative is clearly undermined. Secondly, there is a lack of legal coherence and above all a lack of legal justification in these transfers of competence. Article 1 of the decision on comitology has not been respected and therefore this course of action breaches Article 202 of the Treaty, since this article contains no provisions that would justify this procedure being adopted in this specific case.</p>
<p class="contents">Our view is that the generally accepted status of the Commission is still valid: it is the guardian of the treaties, equidistant from each of the Member States; it is autonomous, independent and the defender of the common good. It is the Commission rather than the Member States that is responsible – transcending borders and national peculiarities – for drafting laws that provide adequate protection on issues involving fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has demonstrated its lack of confidence in the Commission. Without wishing to appear perverse, perhaps the Council is looking for a legal fight over this issue, which would clear the way for an almost certain application to the European Court of Justice to delay the universal implementation of the new Community legislation in progress on the right to asylum. Sometimes in politics, things are indeed what they seem! Unfortunately, Commissioner, and this is not your fault, this is a matter on which you cannot allay our fears. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I am grateful to Commissioner Vitorino for his work. I speak for some Members on this side of the House in saying that there are concerns about this report. We are not one hundred percent happy. We wish we were not at this stage today, but I look at this from the point of view – which I share with several colleagues, that we do not want asylum seekers to be seen as criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">Criminals have their fingerprints taken and we need not automatically or in any way assume that asylum seekers ought to be put into this category. Many of them are escaping from terror, from torture, from other experiences. We want to make certain that at our frontiers they are not put through similar experiences and practices again.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept what Mr Kirkhope said a few minutes ago, that there are frictions and difficulties with the system which need to be sorted out. Other colleagues have referred to the issue of fingerprinting 14-year-olds, which has been very sensitive and very emotive.</p>
<p class="contents">On this side of the House we are realistic. That is why we are looking for the safeguards that have been put into the report. It is why we would prefer that there be parliamentary scrutiny in the question of Commission versus Council. We believe that Parliament is there to safeguard citizens and make certain that the asylum policy is carried out in the fairest possible way.</p>
<p class="contents">With those reservations and I know I speak on behalf of several colleagues – I will be following Mrs Terrón’s line. We wish the Commission well in this work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all the Commission wishes to thank the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and especially Mr Pirker, for the speed with which the renewed consultation on the Eurodac project has proceeded, as well as for the quality of the proposals that have been presented.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin by reminding honourable Members that the Tampere European Council requested that the Eurodac system be completed as quickly as possible. We can conclude from this report that the Commission and the European Parliament have played their part in this task most speedily. What is under discussion today is merely a new consultation on the specific issue of comitology. I am not going to comment again on the fundamentals of the Eurodac system, but I would like to remind you, and particularly Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, that following the debate in the European Parliament the Commission submitted an amended proposal. Although it is true that this amended proposal did not include all the amendments approved by the European Parliament, it must at least be recognised that some of the suggestions made by Parliament were incorporated.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, on the only issue which is still under discussion – comitology – the Commission wishes to remind Parliament of the position it adopted towards the Council: we disagree with the Council’s decision to reserve to itself the power to lay down most of the implementing rules here. This factor was crucial in the commitments that the Commission made to you, the European Parliament, with regard to our reasons for being prepared to participate in a Eurodac system. One of the crucial factors is that, if the system is managed and implemented by the Commission, there is a guarantee of effective control by the European Parliament. Some of the doubts as to the legitimacy of the Eurodac system could be dispelled by bringing these two elements together, with responsibility for the management and implementation of the system falling to the Commission and democratic control to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is our view that the Council’s decision is not properly underpinned by the principles and criteria governing the actual comitology rules. We will therefore continue to state our position to the Council, which is that we would have a win-win situation if the solution adopted were the one for which the Commission has always fought.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like once more to make it clear to Parliament that we have not used these doubts or this quarrel about interpretation in relation to Eurodac as an excuse for inaction: the Commission has already submitted a working paper on revising the Dublin Convention, which it has in fact sent to the European Parliament. It is our view that the shortcomings and errors in the workings of the Dublin Convention show precisely why we need a European asylum policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased to be able to tell you that the Commission has today given substance to a key aspect of the Tampere mandate on asylum by approving a proposal for a directive on minimum rules for a common procedure for requests for asylum. This shows that we are not working on a piecemeal basis; we are putting together a jigsaw puzzle, a jigsaw that involves revising the Dublin Convention. Another piece of this jigsaw is the decision that we have adopted today, to propose a directive on minimum standards for a common asylum procedure, and another piece is the preparatory technical work on the Eurodac system, which has not stood still, but is continuing. This work can, of course, only be carried out when there is a clear and unassailable legal basis for developing the Eurodac system.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would like to thank you – even the honourable Members who have criticised the Commission – for the support expressed by various political groups for the Commission to manage and implement the Eurodac system. We are prepared to take on this challenge, in the hope that the Council will listen to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
