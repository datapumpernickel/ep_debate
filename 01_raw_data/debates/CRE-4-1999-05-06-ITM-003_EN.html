I have put the staff and my colleagues under tremendous pressure to get this through in the May part‐session. I would particularly like to thank the staff members who have had to work exceptionally hard. I would also like to say that my colleagues have been remarkably good‐natured and entered into the discussion in a spirit of cooperation and good will. Because of that we have managed to complete the work on time.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very important area. Electronic commerce is a growth area. It should produce a lot more prosperity for the European Union. It is helpful to consumers and companies alike. Consumers benefit by being able to shop on the Internet in the comfort of their own home and enjoy home deliveries. It is quicker, simpler and consumers can do research on the market for the goods they want, much more simply.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies benefit also by having contracts of major importance. It opens up the market across borders and gives consumers much more choice because it is easier to get goods – if you are British for instance – from France, Germany or Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are some snags. We need to ensure that the law we establish is clear, simple and that problems can be rectified easily. We need to ensure that consumers can be confident that they are not dealing with rogue companies and that when they enter their credit card number into the computer they will actually receive the goods and not find that the company has disappeared. In the vote in committee we put great emphasis on codes for regulating industry and for greater consumer cooperation. I feel this is important.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the detail of the proposal, when you are trying to harmonise what is effectively contract law over 15 countries, that is difficult. The Commission was keen to ensure that it was clear when a contract was completed with a third click. The Legal Affairs Committee is concerned about that because is seems unduly onerous and it is more likely that mistakes might occur.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of conflict of law, which is a horrendously difficult legal subject, we need to ensure that the rules are clear. I like the Commission's idea of having the certainty of home country law applying. This gives the advantage of simplicity and clarity. But again, we have to be aware that consumers need protection.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of the debate has turned on the subject of copyright and illegal material. We have to get a balance here between civil liberties, freedom of expression, people's freedom to put on the Internet what they want, no more official snooping on the Internet than there would be on the post or telephone, and balance the other argument that companies should not have people infringing copyright, infringing their logo, and pretending to be a company that they are not. It is a really big problem for well‐known companies that other companies steal their designs and ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel we have just about achieved the right balance in the Legal Affairs Committee. Again, that is because of the good‐natured discussion of my colleagues trying to reach a satisfactory, simple solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I want to flag‐up is ‘spamming", unsolicited e‐mail. I do not believe that those consumers who want to ban all unsolicited e‐mails are correct. I personally, as a consumer, like getting some on my interest areas like details of what is on at the theatre. I do not want it banned totally. I want the opt‐out.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Whitehead </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. ‐</span> Mr President, I should like to pay a very warm tribute to my colleague, Ms Oddy, for this report which characteristically she has taken through in the last days of the Parliament in a committee where there were other preoccupations and where there were immense legal and technical complications. It is not an easy subject and some of us feel that to bring this forward in the last few months of the Parliament when it needed considerable reflection and study was a little premature. Nevertheless, we have offered an opinion and I believe that Parliament's committees jointly have attempted to make sense of this difficult matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Ms Oddy on two of the key areas she raised today. Firstly, the issue of country of origin. This makes common sense. I know some of the consumer movements disagree with me but the only rational way to trace out responsibility is to do it along this line.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area where I agree with her is that in the issue of opting in or opting out we have to give the consumer the right to opt out, but to prescribe what may, or may not, be put on the Net is so to restrict the expansion of this traffic that we would have a harmful effect within the single market itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to be very careful that we strike a correct balance between liberty, on the one hand, and licence, on the other, between the world of private rights and the world of public obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">The only area where I, and the Committee on the Environment, whose opinion I presented, differ from our friends and colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs, is on the issue of whether we have gone the right way in terms of consumer protection. In my opinion in some areas we have not. I do not believe that the amendment that seeks to bring broadcasting regulations into what is, essentially, a one‐to‐one transaction between individuals is right. We should vote down that amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also gone far too far to bring in some of the issues of copyright into this debate, where they have no place whatsoever. In my opinion, it would be far better to go straight down the line with the proposals that originally came from the Commission in this area.</p>

The United States, Europe, Japan and even China are examining the realities of electronic commerce as well as focusing some of their attention on what, at the present time, remain mere visions. These visions are expected to become reality in two to three years' time, which, if the figures can be believed, would mean that by the year 2001 some 110 million PCS will be used for electronic commerce, generating a trading volume of 200 billion dollars – an enormous sum. It is easy enough to say that, but numerous questions remain unanswered. A great many of these are answered in the Commission proposal and in the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and I believe that both of those bodies have done an excellent job. Allow me, however, to add in all modesty that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy also recognises its own opinion, delivered under the Hughes procedure, in parts of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People's Party and large sections of the Legal Affairs Committee therefore support the Commission draft. But we have had to agonise over some of the amendments, including those on the liability of intermediary providers. Three or four amendments from Mr Barzanti and one from Mr Glante fall into this category. I believe that these amendments undermine the structure and the logic of this entire report. For that reason, our group will be voting against them.</p>
<p class="contents">One very important and very dangerous element is Amendment No 63, in which Mr Glante proposes reopening the question of exempting activities definable as broadcasting. In Article 1 of the television directive, we said very clearly what new services mean and how new services are to be defined. We also made a clear statement by saying that we want these new services to develop and that we shall discuss frameworks for the revision of the television directive again in the year 2002. It goes without saying that we in Parliament naturally expect the Commission to honour its pledge to hold a large‐scale discussion of the implications for audiovisual services. That was one of the pledges which were made. When they will be honoured is not known. But I believe this ought to be mentioned here, since it was one of the balancing acts that were performed to secure our support for Article 1.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of our group will vote against this amendment, because they believe, as I do, that it is out of place here. The fact that the German federal states are pressurising the German Government to have services comparable to broadcasting, as they are called here, exempted from the rules governing electronic commerce derives from the internal situation in Germany. I believe that the public broadcasting system, which is certainly a staunch advocate of this amendment, really ought to trust the Commission and ourselves to continue the discussion of this matter. I have a request, which I have made in our amendment, that Annex 2 should be put to the vote in the form adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, because it is my view that the common market, the internal market, can develop better with this Annex 2 as we formulated it in the Economic Affairs Committee. That, of course, is consumer protection too. We can help by ensuring that benefits for consumers develop from the great struggle between conventional trade and the electronic networks. The shopping experience must be reshaped, and I believe we are progressing in that direction.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Heinisch </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media. – (DE) </span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is essentially a good means of creating a minimalist regulatory regime in the field of electronic commerce. Ms Oddy's report also sets out a clear line of approach which accords with the spirit of the Commission draft. May I also express my sincere thanks to her for adopting the proposals made by the Committee on Culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to one or two of these proposals. It is essential to guarantee freedom of expression in the new information services. The more open the networks, the greater will be the cultural diversity we can enjoy. At the same time, in the areas in which Community action is appropriate, the directive has to provide strong safeguards, especially as regards the protection of young people and of human dignity. The people of the Union will use the facility of electronic commerce to the extent that it proves useful in satisfying their everyday requirements in the real world. However, the Internet must be accessible to everyone. By ensuring that children learn how to use these new forms of technology at an early age and that training opportunities are provided for adults, we must prevent the exclusion of European citizens from the benefits of information technology.</p>
<p class="contents">The connection between electronic commerce and medicines is a point I wish to address as a pharmacist and as a member of the Committee on Culture. For more than 30 years, medicines have been subject to a complex system of rules, which serves primarily to protect patients and consumers. Strict controls on the marketing, advertising and sale of medicinal products are in place at both the national and European levels. The Internet could invalidate some of these rules. There are misgivings about safety, the conduct of transactions, payment, the treatment of confidential information, the possible misuse of personal data, the quality of the products and the absence of expert advice. In order to protect patients, who are the consumers in this case – and I am thinking especially of our young people here – we must guarantee the application of Council Directive 92/28/EEC on the advertising of medicinal products for human use to electronic commerce in medicinal products.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Barzanti </span> <span class="bold">(PSE). </span>‐ <span class="italic">(IT) </span> Mr President, this long‐awaited directive enriches the European Union"s impressive body of legal texts establishing rules for many aspects of the information society. This text certainly deals with one of the most sensitive matters; as clarified, completed and corrected by the Legal Committee, the directive definitely appears useful and acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The point is not to overburden service providers with undue and unusual costs and unreasonable monitoring responsibilities. The limitations on liability provided for make up a simplified legal framework, while still recognising the serious problems which arise. I should stress that the list of liability limitations should be exhaustive, because this is the only way in which the directive really will lead to harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">If, ladies and gentlemen, we wish to combat the rise in illegal activities, those offering on‐line services need to be able to provide all the information required to trace and identify illegal content providers, whilst of course still complying with the provisions of Community law on the protection of personal data. We need to give those entitled the means to carry out surveillance, we need strategies to combat unlawful conduct, and we need to use notification and deletion procedures by means of appropriate electronic instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive does not aim – nor would it be able – to call into question what has already been achieved by the legislation on copyright and related rights, which was voted on a short time ago, nor – and might I point this out to Mr Hoppenstedt – is it intended either to apply to what is already covered and harmonised by the Television Without Frontiers Directive or to revise the definitions consolidated in the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope of this directive is separate and distinct; I do not think that anyone wishes to cause untimely confusion here. There is a fundamental distinction to be made between technologies, technical management of networks and the protection and promotion of contents and works. This is the major conclusion to be drawn from the long and intensive debate on the convergence of technologies and means of disseminating messages which has been on‐going for some time. As I have said on previous occasions and will repeat once again, cyberspace is not a no man"s land.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this my last speech as a Member of the European Parliament I mentioned the Television Without Frontiers Directive. This was the subject of my first ever report, back in 1988. If I were to seek a leitmotiv running through my modest yet steadfast and devoted work over the fifteen years I have been here, I think I would find it in my determination to help provide Europe, our beloved Europe, with effective instruments to guarantee pluralism of information, protection of creativity, support for the dissemination of European works and new momentum in audiovisual production, making the most out of irrevocable differences between cultures and transforming an apparent weakness into a strength.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all those whose cooperation has allowed me to enjoy such a productive and unforgettable experience, and I do hope that these subjects will be given the time and attention they deserve and benefit from our Parliament"s universally acknowledged determination and consistency.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Palacio Vallelersundi </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I am taking the floor for the last time on behalf of the Group of the European People"s Party to reply to Mr Barzanti, who has just spoken on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. I feel that I can but sum up, in one single sentence, what I believe many of us are feeling: we will miss you a great deal. I believe this institution as a whole will miss you a great deal as, of course, will all of us who have had the honour of working with you. We will miss you here although we hope that we will be able to continue to rely on your knowledge and your advice.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, to move on to the substance of this directive, I believe that some of the more important problems it raises have already been discussed. This is a proposal for a directive that seeks to establish a difficult balance, a balance between service providers and those who provide the content, a balance between consumers and suppliers. In short, it seeks a balance between interests competing in the market, and all these interested parties deserve protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking this as a starting point, I believe we must acknowledge the major task achieved by the European Commission. This involved knowing where to stop, as this directive is special in that it does not attempt to regulate everything, but what it does regulate, it regulates sensibly and with an underlying idea, one that guides and directs it. I believe that Parliament would be making a mistake if it were to alter these balances. It would be making a mistake to attempt to modify such a delicate situation where, in my humble opinion, has been dealt with very well.</p>
<p class="contents">As my colleague Mr Hoppenstedt has spoken on particular amendments in detail and because the PPE Group is well coordinated, all I can say as spokesperson for the group is that I agree with everything he said. I would just like to add a few clarifications, particularly on the subject of liability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People"s Party will vote against some of the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights on the issue of liability, particularly Amendments Nos 45, 46, 47, 48 and 50 to 54. We will vote against them as we feel they upset this balance. Despite what Mr Barzanti said, which is a philosophy we fully agree with, I believe that they are of no benefit to content providers or authors in general terms. And in response to Mr Whitehead, there is little protection for consumers if we act in an arbitrary fashion when legislating. Therefore, and more specifically, it is meaningless to impose limits on service providers" liability for specific policies or specific activities. It is also nonsense to expect that they will, for example, be notified of this by the relevant authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Mr President, the Group of the European People"s Party supports the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs to a very large degree. It also supports some of the amendments tabled by the Liberal Group and, on the whole, except for the amendments mentioned by Mr Hoppenstedt and myself, we will vote in favour of these amendments in general.</p>

Contrary to what happened with the directive on copyright in the information society, we have managed – in just a short period of time – to conduct a more informative debate. Passion and zeal, rather than the search for new knowledge, tended to dominate those copyright discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Ms Oddy for her work. The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights will miss her open‐minded approach. She is very much her own person, and a creative one at that – even if we occasionally disagreed over my use of her mother tongue, English!</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, endorse what has been said by those speakers who found the Commission"s proposal more balanced. I certainly feel that to be the case with regard to the duty of surveillance, the question of technology, and neutrality in terms of different standards. My group will therefore be voting against many of the amendments on these points. However, I would like to ask for support from the other groups on the matter of a technology‐neutral solution for signing up to agreements and contracts. The Committee on Legal Affairs has improved the proposal considerably here, but there is still one noticeable shortcoming from my point of view. We are currently too obsessed with ‘clicking" on buttons. There have to be other ways of concluding electronic commerce agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I now have an afterthought, a little late in the day. I suspect that, when we use the words "electronic commerce", many people do not know what we mean. A better term must be found, since more than straight ‘commerce" is at stake here. We are talking about issues of liability and the ground rules which will apply to the whole information society.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, I have to note that even one"s fellows forsake one from time to time. The proposal put forward in the Legal Affairs Committee on ‘spamming" came from me, yet my group will be voting for an alternative proposal. The discussion so far nevertheless suggests that my idea stands a good chance of getting through. I honestly think that we would be making life far too easy for certain telecoms companies if we decided to adopt the amendment which has been tabled. I am sorry that it has come to this.</p>

Commerce on the Internet does not in itself raise new problems of consumer policy, but since we are talking about a new medium, there is a need to establish security and confidence. Commerce using digital networks should be at least as secure and safe as commerce in the physical world. It is therefore unacceptable that the Commission's proposal should seek to put Danish consumers in a worse position in relation to commerce using digital networks than is the case for commerce in the physical world. One of the major problems with the directive is that it is the rules of the country of origin that apply. This will mean that countries with a high level of protection may risk being overrun with advertisements and marketing from firms and from countries which have a lower level of protection. The level of protection in the Nordic countries is generally higher than in other countries, especially as far as marketing in relation to children is concerned. This could result in distortion of competition, whereby foreign firms are able to use methods which Danish firms are not permitted to use under the Danish Marketing Practices Act.</p>
<p class="contents">The background to the principle of using the rules of the country of origin is that it is too difficult for trade and industry to be familiar with every Member State's legislation in this area. But the consequence is that this burden is simply placed on the shoulders of the consumers. For the consumer, commerce on the Internet thus virtually takes on the character of Russian roulette. What rules apply, and what rights do we have if something goes wrong?</p>
<p class="contents">I support the amendments, which improve the directive, but I cannot support the text as a whole – and the June Movement cannot support the text as a whole – because it still takes the country of origin principle as its starting‐point.</p>

In this particular field, common rules are one of the main prerequisites for efficient commercial transactions. At the same time, due consideration must be given to the safety aspect and to protection from illegal activities and health hazards.</p>
<p class="contents">Regular commercial abuse of the Internet is one of the unfortunate realities of cyberspace that cannot be ignored. Effective control mechanisms are therefore essential. On the one hand, the development of software for the recognition of illegal content must be supported with a view to ensuring that these controls are more than a token gesture. We must therefore forge ahead with the promotion of the necessary research projects. On the other hand, however, I believe we should also consider whether the only type of control that is likely to be effective, namely control by the provider, cannot be effected in future in a technically and economically expedient way. Public access to the information made available by providers would be appropriate in the light of the special responsibility borne by providers of online services.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by dealing with a very specific problem. Among the possibilities opened up by the draft directive is the purchase of medicinal products without expert advice, which, as Mrs Heinisch said, creates a potential health risk that must not be underestimated. Moreover, the Internet offers opportunities for large‐scale fraud at the expense of patients, as the WHO, along with other bodies, has repeatedly stressed. These things have to be borne in mind. Although the draft directive, when all is said and done, is a step in the direction of an Internet that would serve the best interests of society, there is still a long way to go before that aim can be achieved.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Medina Ortega </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, it is fortunate that we have you as President of the sitting in this House at the moment because this is one of the last reports, if not the very last, by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights and you were a very efficient member of that committee for many years. At the moment, today's sitting has a rather nostalgic feel to it because we are reaching the end of this parliamentary term and some of our colleagues will not return. Others may perhaps return but, in short, the current Parliament is dissolving and at the moment there is a certain amount of nostalgia, a hint of twilight to this sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to point out that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights has always been known for the great deal of internal work it does and for the high level of coordination within the committee. Above all, I should like to point out that our rapporteur, Mrs Christine Oddy, with her usual skill, has helped, and will always help, make our work easier within the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment we are debating a directive on certain legal aspects of electronic commerce in the internal market. This directive attempts to harmonise certain aspects of the Member States" legislation, aspects which, in truth, are aspects of private law. I would say that we are dealing with an area where Member States seem rather small. This area covers the whole electronic commerce sector, the electronic activities sector covering everything from intellectual property to digital signatures and everything related to information services in general, including intellectual property issues. And not only do the Member States and the European Union seem small but also the world in general as, at a speed of three hundred thousand kilometres per second, borders have no real significance.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union did not exist, we would have had to have invented it simply for this. With the fifteen or twenty or so Member States that will eventually make up the European Union, we cannot maintain different legal systems; rather, we must establish a full, specific and correct code. And, of course, I believe that, by definition, the principle of subsidiarity cannot be invoked at all in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to electronic issues, it is true that the beginnings of legislation are beginning to take shape precisely because of the major violation of privacy bringing computers into our homes may entail. On the screen, our children, our friends and our families may be exposed to a flood of information, which may well be unsolicited. I feel that we are currently exaggerating the cultural elements that set us apart within the European Union. In the European Union today, for better or for worse and despite national cultural traditions, the basic principles, the principles of law and order and the principles of the protection of morals, rights and minors still apply. I therefore believe that, at the moment, a directive such as this will make it easier to integrate our national legislations through the defence of certain principles that are common to all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as a member of the Socialist Group, I should like to express my support for the proposal for a directive as proposed by Mrs Oddy.</p>

I should like to congratulate the rapporteur who I know has worked very hard on this proposal. It is a very detailed dossier, a heavily lobbied dossier, as I know to my cost. As always, when you have a heavily lobbied dossier one of the problems is that the lobbies cancel each other out, which demonstrates how Members of the European Parliament have to be able to cope with lobbyists, like they have to be able to cope with journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget, however, that this is a proposal from the Commission. I would like to congratulate the Commission on having produced a very practical text. Indeed so practical was it that I withdrew all of my amendments to some of the controversial Articles 12, 13, 14 and 15 and made a suggestion – which I was surprised they rejected – that colleagues like Mr Barzanti and others should withdraw their amendments as well. But as they did not the EPP will be voting against a number of amendments which were passed in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">One in particular which I feel very strongly about is Amendment No 45, which was originally put in committee by Mr Barzanti, which would allow means of surveillance to be rendered operational on the basis of legislation or codes of conduct. I am very unhappy about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barzanti told us that in his ten years here he has concentrated on European culture and protecting it. Fine. In 15 years here I have been dedicated to Europe being open to world trade and particularly to liberalisation. The Commission has put forward a liberalising proposal. It would be very unfortunate if the European Parliament were to appear to be less liberal than the Commission, bearing in mind that we are talking of a very high technology, fast‐moving area where Europe is in very grave danger of falling further and further behind the United States.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Watson </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – Mr President, I would like to talk about junk mail or ‘spamming". Junk mail through the post is an inconvenience but junk mail received electronically or by fax is actually charged to the telephone bill of the recipient. That is why it must be legislated for separately. I have received 42 pieces of junk e‐mail in the last week alone and I can tell you it is a bloody nuisance. I have not personally received anything offensive but I know a number of my constituents have and 10 % of unsolicited e‐mail is now pornographic.</p>
<p class="contents">There are programmes available through which companies can harvest names from the Web and send out vast amounts of e‐mail to companies. A report last year from Novell showed that junk e‐mail has cost British and Irish businesses £5b a year. It also jams up the networks. We have legal cases pursued by Virgin Net in the UK and Bibliotech in the US, taking the fight against spammers to the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month 23 000 signatures on a petition were presented to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights of this House. They call for junk e‐mail to be banned. The opt‐out does not work. There is one in the United States. It has proved to be unworkable. I disagree with Ms Oddy. I believe it ill behoves us as legislators to legitimise a practice which allows advertisers to invite themselves to use other people's telephone bills and to use Internet provider infrastructure to pay for their marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">There is every reason why an opt‐in would work. It gives the consumers the opportunity to request marketing information that they want; it gives advertisers the possibility to target their messages to those who wish to receive them; it gives the Internet providers, who provide access to the Net, the possibility to continue to provide fast, effective and safe electronic e‐mail.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why my group is calling for support for Amendment No 70 to this report.</p>

This is the only way to make people confident enough to get involved in this form of commerce. At the same time, consumers must be able to protect themselves effectively against unsolicited e‐mail. I also feel it is extremely important to protect those who are under age and to protect human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to combat illegal activities on the Internet. I would like to ask Commissioner Liikanen whether the way in which the Committee on Legal Affairs has formulated this in Amendment No 48 is acceptable. Will this not be making Internet service providers into censors? I have nothing against censorship, but it should be carried out by the police and the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have to say that reading the amendments filled me with enormous respect for the Committee on Legal Affairs. Take for example Amendment No 23 on recital 22, which has an 88‐word sentence that left me completely baffled.</p>

Christine Oddy"s report is, in my opinion, a well‐informed, skilful and excellent one. It is also important for us to ensure that, in enacting legislation, we do not create bottlenecks for businesses in this fast‐growing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that the big problem with the Internet is the protection and freedom of the individual. The scale of the problem has not yet revealed itself. This is a historical stage in the process, one in which the global surveillance of people has become possible, and it is the first time civil rights have not been protected by international borders, as they used to be. In this respect we have entered a new era, and it must therefore be possible to opt out or opt in. I have also received junk mail, even in a language I do not understand. For some reason, a lot of it comes in Spanish from one particular sender. We must be able to put a stop to this. I cannot see how the police can take action, although that is what should be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the European Union needs to take action to create an effective, sound civil rights and protection movement in respect of the Internet. I would ask the Commissioner whether such a suggestion has been discussed. It would involve encouraging civil participation at European level, and protecting people"s rights, in order to prevent this adverse trend from getting out of control. As a trading place it must be safe, because that is also in the interest of business. We must be able to locate criminal material, which should not have to be a job for the police. The post office, for example, looks out for a bomb, if one is suspected. The same should go for the Internet. When a third party sends information, that party can obviously be made liable for the bill, and liability should extend also to cases where a crime has been committed.</p>

I thank Mrs Oddy for her report, but in the very heated debate that has developed on the subject of electronic commerce in Europe and the thorny issue of on‐line content, its origin, its destination and its legality, I think I am justified in stressing that there must be room for freedom of expression on public networks such as the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to concentrate on an aspect which particularly concerns satellite providers. With regard to the responsibility of the on‐line network service providers, the initial proposal from the European Commission distinguishes the responsibility of the various players according to what they actually do, without denying the problems of illegal content. In my opinion there is no point in amending this. In the transfer of information by satellite, cable or any other means, the network service providers, who are the intermediaries, are not the authors of the content. They may have to accept responsibility <span class="italic">a posteriori </span> for the information that they supply and they may also ensure that there is <span class="italic">a priori</span> monitoring at the request of national authorities, but in very specific cases.</p>
<p class="contents">However, they cannot ensure permanent <span class="italic">a priori</span> monitoring of all the information – freely available on the Internet – to which they want to offer access. The network service providers are suppliers of technical services and do not have editorial responsibility. In a way, they play the role of the printers, which does not mean that they can print whatever they like, but their responsibility is not unlimited. The Web is an excellent tool for any firm or individual that wishes to make itself known, a tool that should be developed and not censored. Like my group, I will not vote for Amendments Nos 45, 46, 48 and 51, which have absolutely nothing to do with the issue and which would result in an impractical degree of censorship.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, electronic commerce could be a tremendous boost to the economy and create a great many new jobs, jobs that Europe desperately needs. The proposed directive now before us will remove many obstacles and uncertainties and provide legal certainty and security for all those involved, particularly consumers. However, as well as the problem of ‘spamming" which Graham Watson described, there is another problem too. Section 4, Articles 12 and 13 of the directive provide that where a service provider is only passing on information passively, it is not liable for the content of that information. So it is only operating as an intermediary.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the temporary storage of information on the Internet, known as ‘caching". Indeed, it appears from the explanatory statement to the Commission proposal that the restricted liability actually applies to all illegal on‐line activities by third parties, such as unfair competition, misleading advertising and the pirating of copyright material.</p>
<p class="contents">However, two months ago Parliament adopted an amendment to Article 5(1) of the copyright directive specifically bringing caching within the scope of the directive, so that it would be covered by copyright protection, yet caching as such does not involve any individual use of the information supplied. There is a contradiction here. I would like to ask the Commissioner something. These provisions contradict each other ...</p>

I remember many moments in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights and, among them, those shared with Mrs Oddy where we always reached similar conclusions on new technology issues that we began debating in the previous term with respect to their incompatibility with copyright.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate Mrs Oddy and also my colleagues who have tabled amendments, for example, Amendment No 45, that my dear colleague Mr Cassidy is criticising. Mr Cassidy, I believe in freedom for men and women. We must be careful with devastating mechanical technologies that have no consideration for human nature. There is no reason why the network should eliminate the need for a certain degree of control, which is needed both for our children and for ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Octavio Paz said that we are not made for a society whose aim is to produce to consume and to consume to produce. The fact that messages are sent to create artificial consumption is often distressing to a person, as pornography and other such things are. I believe that all this rubbish should be controlled. And I therefore feel that it is a good idea to have a certain degree of control at the centre of this network so that the consumer – which is first and foremost a human being – can tell where the problem comes from. If we control the network, we create a place for the law, and the law must, of course, be above mere technology.</p>

A whole new market has opened up, as Mr Hoppenstedt has so eloquently argued. We have here a potential springboard for European growth, but we must avoid taking the kind of political decisions that might force Internet providers to locate outside the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amendment No 36, it is suggested that ‘information society service providers must keep all information necessary for the purpose of tracing and identifying providers of illegal content." This is a crime prevention issue, however, and responsibility for criminal matters lies with the country concerned. That is the approach taken by our competitor, the United States, and the same principle should apply here. The State bears the cost of crime prevention and takes the necessary decisions where there is suspicion of serious criminal activity. Very strict regulations and technical provisions may need to be put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">If the proposal in Amendment No 36 were to be implemented, some Internet service providers would be forced to establish themselves outside the Union, which would not be the best way of utilising the growth potential of the new Internet economy. The net result would be a typical political fudge, based on a misguided attempt to reconcile various societal interests. Such an approach is born, in my view, of insufficient knowledge of the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The nominee for the office of Commission President, Mr Prodi, spoke on Tuesday of the importance of leading‐edge technology for Europe"s advancement. And he was right. It is essential that we build up, rather than undermine, the conditions for growth within the IT industry, particularly from the point of view of small and medium‐sized companies, which need to be shielded from storage costs. Respect for the integrity of companies is also paramount, especially when they are small.</p>

It promises to create added value, and therefore jobs. It is also a world‐wide, global phenomenon, and it is unthinkable that we should be left out, as if Europe could be run as an island in the middle of the ocean. I therefore do not think that we should impose rules and constraints on ourselves that would mean placing ourselves on the fringe of this extremely rich field of development.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am well aware of the risks that it involves and they must be eliminated or contained. Having said that, I felt that in this respect the Commission"s proposal was very well balanced. With all that I am hearing, seeing and observing, I am now wondering whether the amendments from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights have upset this necessary balance. As most of the speakers from my group have pointed out, I do not think that in order to protect consumers – a concern which is nevertheless quite legitimate – we should at the same time deprive them of all the advantages and all the benefits that this development can bring, both in employment terms and in economic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I feel it is very important that we take great care to maintain this balance. This is why, along with my colleagues, I will vote in favour of certain amendments which aim to improve the situation, while on the other hand I will vote against others which I feel have upset the balance.</p>

And since, as a famous writer from my country said, ‘there is no certainty in the morrow", I shall take this opportunity to say good‐bye and thank you to all the colleagues, officials and interpreters with whom I have shared these five years which have been so important for European integration. It has been an honour for me to work with many of you.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue being discussed now is one of the most important of all in economic and social terms, both because it particularly relates to young people and because it can lead to many jobs being created.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday Parliament voted on my report on the White Paper on commerce, which looks at length and in favourable terms at electronic commerce as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the Commission, which kept its pledge to produce the Green Paper and the White Paper on commerce within the same term of office, making sure that this sector was tackled comprehensively by the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the White Paper we managed to get the Commission to undertake measures to support enterprises and at the same time to protect end‐users.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal aspects analysed today are a vital foundation for regulating and harmonising electronic contracts and future use and developments, on condition that the Internet is accessible to all, accessible but regulated, so as to defend the groups at greatest risk, particularly children, to protect people from unlawful electronic acts and cable intrusion, but to encourage anything which can create jobs and help our culture to grow and flourish. There can be no Europe without culture, as the great President Delors reminded us.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though much remains to be done in the new Community market, we have shown that it is possible to protect the interests of entrepreneurs and traders, particularly in small and medium‐sized enterprises, and at the same time to defend the public in their role as consumers, who are the target and focus of the work of enterprises, both public and private. Let us continue along this road!</p>

If we use them properly, they will present us with a vast range of opportunities which have to be grasped and which will enhance the competitiveness of European business. But we do need a uniform legal framework here. Internet users are bombarded with a barrage of online information. The Member States cannot rely on their national legislation, since there are no national restrictions on electronic commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">For the sake of consumer protection, the Member States and the Commission must press for the development of codes of conduct. One very important point concerns unsolicited commercial communications. ‘Spam" must be clearly recognisable as such to recipients, who must also have a means of refusing it, especially in view of the costs they might incur by opening or downloading such messages. Greater transparency must be achieved in this area. Clear labelling of incoming messages is essential so that users are free to decide whether to avail themselves of the services being offered.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liikanen, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, the Commission is glad to know that Ms Oddy's report, which is very thorough, shares the approach and the main lines of the Commission's proposal. It is particularly important as regards the unanimous backing of the internal market principles underlying the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of the amendments in Ms Oddy's report clarify and improve the original proposal and I am happy to indicate that the Commission will accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 4, 6 – the latter in the English version only, 7, 12, 13, 16‐20, 22, 24, 32‐34, 37, 40, 41, 43, 55‐57, 62, 65‐67. Subject to redrafting the Commission is also in a position to accept Amendments Nos 3, 5, 11, 15, 25, 29 and 35 and part of amendments 9, 14, 38, 51, 69 and 73.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, a number of amendments the Commission is not in a position to accept for one of the following four reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, because their objective and formulation is not sufficiently clear, which could lead to legal insecurity. This is the case of Amendments Nos 8, 24, 26, 30, 39, 58, 59, 60, 64 and 72. Amendment No 42 cannot be accepted as such. However, the Commission recognises that Article 11(1) concerning the moment at which on‐line contracts are concluded needs to be reviewed. The Commission accepts the objective of Parliament's amendment to simplify the process of contracting and will address the question in the amended proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, because there would not be consistency with other Community directives or with Community law. This is the case of amendments which could be interpreted as being in conflict with the rules on the protection of personal data or with principles of Community law: Amendments Nos 10, 28, 36, 70 and 76. It is also the case of amendments trying to modify the scope of application of the directive in a manner which is not consistent with other information society service directives (Amendments Nos 27 and 63), and of Amendment No 31 changing the proposed definition of commercial communications.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, because they would upset the balance of interests on a number of issues that has been achieved in the original proposal. Amendment No 48 belongs to this group; there was a question on that.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the case as regards the amendments on the issue of liability of intermediaries from 44 to 54 and 75. It is a very important sensitive area where particular effort was made in the original proposal to achieve a reasonable compromise solution that takes account of all interests at stake. It is also the case as regards Amendment No 71 narrowing down the list of contracts established in Article 9 of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, because they would be too ambitious at this stage given the level of Community integration. This is the case of amendments aimed at narrowing down the derogations in Annex 2 of the proposal (Amendments Nos 21, 68 and 74), and Amendment No 61 concerning court actions, although on this last issue the Commission recognises that there is a need to improve the possibilities of redress, especially in cross‐border contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by again thanking Parliament for its work on, and its support for, the proposal. It will be of fundamental importance for Europe and its citizens to fully reap the benefits of electronic commerce and to strengthen the European position in the global context. I agree with Mr Paasilinna that all non‐governmental activities are welcome in this context.</p>

<p class="contents">The report by a conciliation committee concerning the recognition of young people's vocational qualifications is a very important matter. As I discovered quite by accident this morning, the report is not to be debated until six o'clock this evening and the vote will take place tomorrow morning; this is not the sort of treatment that such a report merits, because it is about people, about young people. We in Parliament have said that this is one of our European policy priorities.

Can you advise me as to whether those people who have telematic lenses have the Bureau's permission to take pictures from the gallery? Have they been granted permission to take these pictures?</p>
<p class="contents">This point was raised at the last part‐session and those people were removed from the gallery, as is only proper and right.</p>

If this House does not give assent to the general regulation, there can be no agreement for the regulations that follow on from it. In terms of legislative logic you need to take the general regulation first, even though that involves only assent, and take the regulations thereafter.</p>
