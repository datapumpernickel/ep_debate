As usual, only the early birds are present. Nonetheless, there is an abiding memory of the best moments of all the meetings held and the hours of work undertaken together.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, Budget Commissioner, colleagues from the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, on 17 November of this year I presented the annual report for the financial year 2002 prepared by the European Court of Auditors to the Committee on Budgetary Control at its meeting. I was also able to take the opportunity of providing the committee with a detailed account of the observations and conclusions contained in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the conclusions concerning three areas, namely the Statement of Assurance, budgetary management, and the process of reforming the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The first chapter of the Court of Auditors’ report contains the Statement of Assurance, known as the DAS. The latter will be published in the Official Journal together with the Community’s consolidated accounts. This is sound practice and should provide greater transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court is adjusting its DAS methodology to bring it into line with the process of reforming the Commission’s financial control. The intention is to provide more accurate information about the areas where problems arise and about their causes. This is in response to requests by Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, our observations and conclusions centred on four main elements. Firstly, they were based on the quality of control systems in the Community institutions and Member States. Our assessment is based on several indicators. We also examined the extent to which the Commission followed up our earlier observations. The second element entailed examination of a sample of transactions and payments for each area of expenditure. Thirdly, the annual declarations of the Directors-General at the Commission were considered. Work undertaken by other auditors constituted the fourth element.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to this audit, it is the Court’s opinion that the annual accounts for 2002 submitted by the Commission were drawn up in accordance with the Financial Regulation. The accounts accurately reflect the revenue and expenditure for the financial year, and the financial position of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, as in previous years, the Court expressed a number of reservations regarding the Commission’s accounting system. It should be noted that last December the Commission adopted an action plan to modernise its accounting system. This plan is due to come into force in 2005. I would urge caution concerning the timetable. The scope and quality of the necessary reforms should not be jeopardised by undue haste.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to revenue, commitments, administrative expenditure and pre-accession aid, the Court believes that the transactions are legal and regular. In the latter case, however, controls must be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">As concerns the EAGGF-Guarantee, we believe the number of faulty transactions is still excessive. Errors occur most frequently at the level of the final beneficiaries of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">A higher risk was noted for measures not subject to the Integrated Administrative and Control System. They include amongst others aid for production, rural development and export refunds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court noted an improvement in the controls on structural measures. This was the case at Commission level in particular. Nevertheless, the errors are similar to those of previous years and mostly concern the management undertaken by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will appreciate, ladies and gentlemen, the Court’s report is somewhat mixed. If improvement is to be effected, it will be necessary to continue strengthening the management systems of the Commission and of the Member States. This is the <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for attaining a totally satisfactory Statement of Assurance in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the observations on budgetary management in Chapter 2 of the report. Firstly, a swift change in the structure of revenue is apparent. Traditional own resources such as customs and agricultural duties have fallen by 23% compared with the previous year. At the same time, revenue from GNP has risen by 32%.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it was noted that the budgetary surplus had fallen appreciably. The surplus has dropped from EUR 15 000 million to EUR 7 000 million. Nonetheless, the figure remains high. It is indicative of systematic problems that must be rectified.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main reasons for the surplus is the difference between planned and actual expenditure. For the financial year 2002 the Member States overestimated expenditure in the Structural Funds by almost EUR 5 000 million. Consequently, the financial year 2002 closed with more than EUR 66 000 million in outstanding commitments known in French as the RAL. This was almost EUR 10 000 million more than in the previous year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should adopt a more active policy in this regard. It should undertake budgetary adjustments to maintain the balance between anticipated revenue and expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">On a positive note, I should like to mention the general improvement in the rate of payments. One notable exception to this is the SAPARD programme for rural development in applicant countries. Only 2% of the available funds have been transferred to the final beneficiaries, although this programme has been in operation for three years.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that the Commission has implemented the recommendations of the Court and improved its report on budgetary and financial management. This report will prove very useful throughout the whole budgetary cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the budgetary management of the European Development Funds. The Commission has accelerated the decision-making process for the financing of programmes. Nonetheless, the rate of implementation is still low. At the close of the financial year 2002, the available balance amounted to almost EUR 3 000 million. Outstanding commitments awaiting settlement amounted to more than EUR 8 000 million. The Court is of the opinion that management would improve if the EDF were integrated into the general budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to move on now to the state of the administrative reform. The Court has paid particular attention to analysing the degree to which internal control standards have been put in place. The assessment is along the lines of ‘could do better’. Despite the progress made in all Directorates-General, standards had not reached the required level by the end of 2002. Priority must be given to attaining these levels without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main difficulties facing the Commission is the control of measures managed jointly with the Member States. This mostly concerns EAGGF-Guarantee and Structural Funds. Article 274 of the Treaty does confer full responsibility for management on the Commission. In practice, however, the Commission is limited by activities of the national administrations. Stronger control by the Member States is needed to improve management of European funds. The activity management plans for the Directorates-General have improved. Nonetheless, it is recommended that the objectives be specified more clearly. It would also be advisable to introduce indicators to allow results to be measured and compared.</p>
<p class="contents">Activity reports and statements by the Directors-General have also improved. Most of the measures detailed by the Commission following the summary of the reports for the financial year 2001 have been implemented. The Commission has improved its procedure for drafting reports in line with the recommendations made by the Court. Nonetheless, Directors-General should provide more detail concerning the content of their reservations about the way control systems work. They should also provide a clearer description of the shortcomings noted.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Court recommends updating the White Paper adopted in 2000 in the interests of greater transparency and in order to facilitate following up the reform. The Court also recommends revising the timetable set.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, reform did make progress in 2002. The Commission proved capable of diligently implementing the new provisions of the Financial Regulation. Progress was noted in all areas. Much remains to be done, however, as the Commission itself recognises.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the content of the Commission’s reform plan is adequate, and the plan itself consistent. It will no doubt require adjustment and amendment. At this juncture, however, it would be a mistake to reject it or to launch into reforming the reform. The latter would be a risky venture. The plan does actually contain appropriate measures to improve management and control. A sustained effort is now needed to ensure these measures are applied with a will across all the Commission’s services. This is the Commission’s main responsibility. The same applies to all the institutions. Simply launching plans is not enough. It is essential to ensure that the plans are implemented. I believe that is one of the lessons to be learnt from the Eurostat affair.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I trust you will allow me to depart briefly from the agenda just before I finish. I would like to say a few words on the Intergovernmental Conference and the draft European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors has expressed concern because it is not mentioned by name as part of the institutional framework, alongside Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Court of Justice. The Court of Auditors is the body charged with external control of European public finances. It is not acceptable for it to be placed at a lower level than the institutions it is required to control. It must not be placed in a position where it is dependent on them either. If that were to happen, the Court would be deprived of the independence it needs in order to discharge its obligations. All those involved in the Intergovernmental Conference have been made aware of this concern. I trust it will be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention, ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Members of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, the Court has been unstinting in its support for the Commission’s reforms, and acknowledges in its report for 2002 that these have made good progress. Not only for that, but also for the depth and breadth of their work, as also for their unambiguous recommendations for specific further action, many thanks are owed to all the members of the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Budget, there is no doubt that the highlights of 2002 were the recasting of the Financial Regulation and the conclusion of the financial negotiations with the candidate countries, whereby enlargement was put on a sound financial footing. These two things had been targets that I had set for myself personally and for the Commission. It is because we are on the very threshold of enlargement that I am very glad that the Court of Auditors was able to state, in its annual report for 2002, that no mistakes of any significance had been made in the handling of pre-accession aid. The effort made not only by the candidate countries but also by all the European institutions to support more widespread and functioning financial controls in the enlargement states are bearing fruit. This is made all the more important by the fact that the implementation of pre-accession aid is at last gathering pace, and, from next year onwards, all ten states will participate in all the aid programmes funded from the European Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors has the function of checking the books of the European Union – that is to say, of examining the way it keeps its accounts. It is our accountant. It has again given a favourable opinion of the correctness of the books: the accounts of the European Union truthfully reflect the receipts and outgoings in 2002, and the balance sheet presents a faithful picture of the European Union’s assets at year end.</p>
<p class="contents">I might add that the outgoings for 2002 amount to EUR 85 billion, rather than the EUR 100 billion that is always quoted in the media, and not only for a Budget Commissioner is the difference between EUR 100 billion and EUR 85 billion something more than marginal. The Court of Auditors’ comments on the balance sheet for 2002 also show that the European Union’s entitlements and obligations are not set in stone, but vary according to the tasks – and the example I would give is our share in Galileo, which represents a challenge not only to technology, but also in terms of auditing and of the balance sheet. The Court of Auditors also issues a positive Statement of Assurance in respect of the receipts, examining both the levying of customs duties<span class="italic"> </span>and the computation of the European Union’s VAT receipts and of the national contributions based on gross national income, which – the various deceptive rumours in connection with the Eurostat affair notwithstanding – is declared by the Member States rather than by Eurostat.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Court attests the reliability of the commitment appropriations and of the administrative expenditure, it does not do this in respect of the other items of expenditure. This clearly shows where new priorities in improving financial management both at Commission level and in the Member States are to be found. I emphasise that the Court acknowledges the Commission’s tighter controls and stresses the problems involved in joint management, which applies to 80% of the expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">The agricultural budget required the Court to audit 64 paying agencies, in the course of which it discovered three where errors cropped up so frequently that they could not be certified as reliable. One of them was in Portugal and the other two are in Germany, one being in Baden-Württemberg and the other in Bavaria. The Court again had criticisms to make of the Structural Funds, in that, whilst the funds are not expected to be used to their fullest extent, the surplus is not to be repaid to the Member States next year, but in a supplementary budget in the current year. This year, we have taken on board this criticism and submitted a supplementary budget totalling EUR 5 billion, and this House will probably adopt it on 18 December.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that there are discussions every year about how the EU’s finances are managed might give the impression that no progress is being made. It is the Court of Auditors, though, that stresses the fundamental and comprehensive nature of the Commission’s financial reforms, which is precisely what the Court had asked for. At the heart of them is the adaptation of financial management to the realities of a budget that will, over the coming year, come close to reaching the EUR 100 billion mark and will comprise over a million payment transactions every year, spread over 35 Directorates-General and 15 – soon to be 25 – Member States, and administered by international and non-governmental organisations. Responsibility for the ex-ante control of financial transactions has been transferred to the operational departments, and any attempt to reverse this – even the demand that ex-ante checks be carried out by the accounting officer – takes no account of what modern public-sector financial management requires. Checks are no less thorough since the end of centralised budget control, which was in any case only capable of carrying out limited spot checks. In every one of the directorates-general, the new financial circuits, which must involve trained financial experts in every service and ex-post controls by the auditors, all reinforced by the addition of human resources in this area and by a hitherto unseen level of expenditure on initial and in-service training in auditing, make it possible for every Director-General to give the Commission a regular account of how the finances are managed. If one also takes into account the audits by the internal audit service, the regular evaluation of the examination of the control systems by the Central Financial Service, the investigations by OLAF and, of course, the ever wider-ranging audits by the Commission’s external auditors, then it becomes apparent that an extensive structure is in place for monitoring the European budget, to which one must add the checks carried out in the Member States in respect of 80% of the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Member States, 16 000 persons are employed in auditing the agricultural funds and 6 700 on the Structural Funds. I agree with the Court of Auditors that this is where there needs to be greater convergence if these controls are to be made efficient. Controls require rules, for which the conditions were created when the new and fully recast Financial Regulation entered into force on 1 January. What lies behind this is shown by the example of the financial support given to institutions, which, although a central instrument of Community expenditure, were subject to no rules whatever prior to the Commission’s first Vademecum in 1999. There are now detailed and binding rules for them in the new Financial Regulation and in secondary legislation, and the new legal acts required for these grants will shortly be adopted by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the reforms do, of course, constitute a process in which the Commission is constantly learning by practical experience and from what the Court of Auditors and Parliament recommend. So it is that further substantial improvements have been made to the procedure for drawing up the reports of the Directors-General, in particular for the sake of improved comparability. The President of the Court of Auditors has just mentioned the implementation of the internal audit standards, which he quite rightly described as being central and crucial elements in reform, with which we are again currently pressing ahead with some vigour, especially as regards the rotation of officials in sensitive positions, and, where this has not yet been done, precise deadlines have been laid down for it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are learning our lessons from the Eurostat experience, primarily, of course, within Eurostat itself, but also as regards OLAF and the relationship between the Directorates-General and the political level. What happened within Eurostat in the years leading up to 1999 is not evidence of the reform’s failure – on the contrary, it is evidence of how necessary the reform was and of the fact that the steps we took were the right ones. Where the existence of loopholes has become apparent, we are closing them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me again stress how far-reaching these reforms are. What they in fact do is introduce, at last, into every area of the management of this international authority, uniform rules and uniform standards. That amounts to a cultural revolution, in that the various cultures were previously bound by very diverse rules, most of which were not written down. In future, if I may quote Mr Fabra Vallés there will be no more ‘principalities’, but, instead, one administration, which must – and will – in every sphere, comply with demanding standards and be held to account for the way in which they do so. The presentation of the Court’s annual report marks the start of the budget discharge procedure. The Commission looks forward to good cooperation with the rapporteur, Mr Bayona de Perogordo, and with the Committee on Budgetary Control as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Any public budget largely devoted to the granting of subsidies, and that in what are now 15 Member States and will shortly be 25, will always have to defend its financial interests tooth and nail. The Commission has committed itself to the objective of doing so; far from being discouraged by setbacks, we will redouble our efforts, and the Court of Auditors gives us fresh courage as we pursue this goal.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Theato (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the European Court of Auditors, Commissioner, Members of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank you, Mr Fabra Vallés, for your presentation of the Court’s annual report for 2002, and all the more for your having already presented this important document to the Committee on Budgetary Control a fortnight ago. Today, we can shed further light on certain aspects of the annual report and discuss them with you, and this begins our work on the discharge for 2002, on the foundation of the Court’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">In considering the points that you yourself have raised, let me begin with the Statement of Assurance. You have described how the Court has refined its auditing techniques still further, and this is something we very much welcome. The fact remains, however, that, because of an error rate that may well have differed from the preceding year’s, but was still too high, no positive statement of assurance can be issued in respect of 2002 as a whole. In the areas of agriculture, the Structural Funds, internal and external policies, only the receipts have been certified, and you give a clean bill of health only to the administrative expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">So little was spent on pre-accession aid for the candidate countries that a positive statement of assurance does not say very much. Overall, I would say that this is an utterly deplorable result in terms of the quality of the Commission’s implementation of the Budget, even if much of the blame lies with the Member States. These aspects will certainly be reflected in Parliament’s discharge report.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is cause for gratitude that the Court has done what Parliament wanted and introduced a chapter summarising the implementation of the Budget and containing an overall view of the receipts and outgoings. Why, we ask ourselves, are there still such large surpluses in the 2002 Budget? They may well be only half the size of the previous year’s, but I regard EUR 7 billion in unused money not as a saving, but as a deficit resulting from action not taken and hence as a failure to meet the targets set. If, year after year, in the measures managed jointly by them and the Commission, the Member States over-estimate the funds required, the Commission has to be even more determined in taking counter-measures, something that it already does, albeit to an insufficient extent, but it could, for example, submit supplementary and amending budgets. The Court’s forthright advocacy of the idea that the administration of the Development Fund should be improved by including it in the general budget is precisely what Parliament has been demanding for some years now.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Mr Fabra Vallés, you spoke about the administrative reform and the internal audits, in which, in the light of the Eurostat affair, this House takes a particular interest. What you say sounds very positive but we doubt whether these reforms are really having any effect. Take the slogan ‘decentralising the way the Commission is run’, which, as such, I welcome. The activity reports and the guarantees given by the individual Directors-General are an improvement, but should they not also be signed by the office responsible for finance and personnel? Should there not be a clearer dividing line between the accountant and the authorising officer? Should the internal auditor, through his reports, also be in close contact with the internal audit service? The Court has devoted attention to the audit reports, but will it also cast an eye over administrative processes as a whole? The Committee on Budgetary Control will have other questions to ask about reform of the accounting and book-keeping system.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the next few weeks, our committee will have a lot of work to do in preparing the discharge for 2002. We are very grateful to you for supplying the documentation and information that we need and for the openness with which you and all the members of the Court of Auditors have cooperated with us. Let me just briefly say something in response to your closing remarks about the Intergovernmental Conference. You will be aware that Parliament – and, in this instance, the Committee on Budgetary Control, too – believes it to be of the utmost importance that the Court of Auditors should have equal status with the other institutions. That is why you will see from the documents that, as rapporteur, I appealed to the Intergovernmental Conference to add the Court of Auditors to the list of the various institutions, thus guaranteeing the Court its proper place and ensuring that the public can see that we have the instruments and agencies to watch over how the taxpayers’ money is handled.</p>

After nine years as an MEP – four and a half of them on the Committee on Budgetary Control – one imagines that there are no more particularly enlightening experiences in store. My belief that this is the case was disproved this week; I had a moment of clarity exactly two days ago when, in the Committee on Budgetary Control, a Commissioner who was already under pressure was faced with a situation in which the Commission apparatus had not yet supplied answers to four questions by a fellow-Member relating to the Eurostat case, even though those answers had been due since mid-October. What I found illuminating about this was that, for the first time and for just five minutes, I found myself obliged to appreciate what an enormous achievement this was on the part of the Commission’s apparatus and what this says about the depth of its loyalty to a Commissioner. I am bringing my political problem not to you personally, Commissioner, but, so to speak, to the Commission as a college of Commissioners. I have started to feel tempted to stop directing political criticism at the Commissioners and to start feeling nothing but pity for them. If, in the months in office remaining to them, they cannot manage to give their apparatus some sort of structure, so that their officials go in fear of their masters and acquire a minimal amount of loyalty to their political leaders, then we are in for lot of fun and games in the coming months. If the present Commission does not at last get that message, then heaven help their successors in the next one. If there is no change in this state of affairs, then nor will there be even the slightest change in the public’s perception of the Commission; it will, if anything get even worse. The time has come for this to be said out loud, and I believe it is necessary that it should be.</p>

<p class="contents">We are now on the eve of new elections, and I can only look back on the debate which we had here four or five years ago when we were in the heat of the discussion about the financial difficulties that the Santer Commission was having at the time. I promised the electorate then that financial control in the new European Commission would be considerably enhanced. We are now four years down the line and what strikes us most of all is that – even after nine years of working on Statements of Assurance – the Court of Auditors has still not managed to issue a positive Statement of Assurance. That is quite clear to every citizen in Europe and the lack of success in this respect is very regrettable. This is offset by the fact that the Court of Auditors has concluded that the Commission is on the right track and if I may quote the President: 'The reform plan is concrete and coherent and must be supported'. Things are therefore moving in the right direction, but the big question is that of how much longer we can wait – particularly as enlargement is imminent and it will be extremely difficult to tell those countries what to do if we ourselves are not even able to implement this in our old Member States. That is, in my view, the crucial discussion. It has been said before, the main centre of gravity lies with the Member States themselves, but it is always the Commission that is responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of this year, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party took an initiative proposal for agricultural expenditure, which is this year once again meeting with strong criticism. This proposal stated that if it is the case that a Member State continues to mismanage agricultural funds, the Commission should stop making advance payments to those Member States. That worked in our opinion. That report has received unanimous support by Parliament and, according to Mr Fischler, it has also been supported by the Commission. In response to a written question from me, the Member States have rejected it. What instruments of power are left to this Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, even after this report, we do not know how much things have changed for the better or for the worse. According to the Court of Auditors, things are improving. The word 'indicators' is being bandied about. Is it possible to develop indicators? The Court of Auditors has said that they are unable to do this, but that the Directors-General should do this. Is the Commission thinking about starting with this? Can we say that things are improving every year by a certain percentage, until such time as 100% may be reached at some stage, sooner – it is to be hoped – rather than later? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are forced once again to observe that the Court of Auditors is very keenly critical of the way in which the Commission conducted itself during the previous budget year. There are such large areas of doubt and such major errors that, in practice, the Court of Auditors is giving the thumbs down to quite crucial areas of the EU budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that it is difficult to judge whether the trend is for the better or for the worse. It would have been desirable if, as in previous years, the Court of Auditors had been able to quote a percentage figure for the funds it considers to have been wrongly expended. Now that we are no longer being given this percentage figure, it is difficult to decide whether the trend really is in the right direction, as it is often maintained to be.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors again sets out a general reservation concerning the accounting system itself, which is obviously the most serious point on which we have to adopt a position. This means that there are doubts hanging over a very great many of the figures. We do not know whether we can fully rely upon them.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been promised thorough reform by 2005, but we have today heard again that the Court of Auditors doubts that it will be possible to implement this reform adequately by 2005. There is therefore still a danger of new scandals, for the Commission clearly has no general view of the way in which the budget is implemented. That is shown with all the clarity one could wish for by, in particular, the Eurostat scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">I also intended to say a few words about the European Development Fund, for I am the rapporteur when it comes to discharging it of liability this year. It has emerged that funds from the European Development Fund have been misused by the same firms that are involved in the Eurostat scandal. Money from the European Development Fund has been used to finance contracts between Comesa (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa) and CESD, the firm that defrauded Eurostat of at least EUR 3 million. The internal auditing service concludes that there is a large risk of errors having been made, of there having been double payments and of there being conflicts of interest and so on. The Directorate-General Development entered into a contract with this firm as recently as in April 2001, a contract valid for 33 months. I should like to ask the Commission whether this contract has now been terminated.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main proposals by the Court of Auditors regarding the European Development Fund is that this be incorporated into the ordinary budget. I am totally convinced that such a measure would facilitate reform and make it easier to obtain control in this area, in which a lot is at present unclear, especially when it comes, for example, to the control of direct budget aid to different countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rühle (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I want, today, to express my gratitude to the Court of Auditors for the outstanding quality and considerable quantity of its work. Its numerous individual reports, and now its comprehensive annual report, give us a clear picture of the European Union’s defects and strengths, of its problems and of the attempts made to resolve them. This being the year before the European elections, I would like to reaffirm that the Court’s work can help to qualify the widespread suspicion of the European institutions. Where mistakes have been made, they must be brought to light and corrected. The Eurostat case, in particular, demonstrates how we need greater transparency and less bureaucracy in the European institutions, but your report goes further, using important issues to show the challenges that the European Union faces. Enlargement is one example. The enlargement programmes such as Sapard, are meant to help with the proper functioning, post-enlargement, of the agricultural programmes, the structural programmes and the administrative structures. It is unfortunate that backlogs persist; Sapard’s implementation rate, for example, was higher than in the previous year, but 2% is still a disgracefully low figure.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fabra Vallés, your report, however, also makes reference to structural problems and errors in the European Union’s policies. Let me take the common agricultural policy as an example and quote what your report has to say, which strikes me as very instructive. On the subject of the greening of the common agricultural policy, the Court came to the conclusion that more intensive agricultural production methods had led to environmental problems that were a cause for concern. That is in fact the precise opposite of what we were meant to be achieving by the use of our resources. There are many defects that have to be removed – in the Council Directive and in the environmental criteria – for taxpayers have every right to expect not only a lack of possibilities for fraud, but also that their money will be invested wisely. Responsibility for this lies not only with the Commission and Parliament, but, primarily, with the Council. I would like to refer to an example that you mentioned and which strikes me as highly illuminating, namely the issue of artificially dried animal fodder. Let me quote: ‘The rate of aid paid for artificially dried fodder is almost double that paid for sun-dried fodder. This encouraged producers to switch from sun-drying and to produce artificially dried fodder to the maximum extent possible. EU production has continued to increase since 1995 and the MGQ has been exceeded since 1998/99’. I think that is a scandal that has to be highlighted, and something must be done to ensure that the position changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example, one that I see as equally important, is that of cotton. Generally speaking, the aid arrangements for producers of cotton are intended to support the production of cotton and to make it possible for producers of it to enjoy an adequate standard of living. Although this is a proper objective and one that we can support, it would, I believe, constitute a misuse of funds if the result were to be an increase in cotton production without its effects on the environment being monitored at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to consider not only fraud and irregularities, but also the proper use of our money. Let me give another example, that of export refunds, which, in 2002, totalled some EUR 3 622 million, money that I do not think has been used properly, for we keep learning on a daily basis how export refunds lead to irregularities and fraud, quite apart from which, such export refunds are also unjust, because they destroy markets in the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">I take the view that, if the European taxpayer is to become willing to keep on making his contribution to the European Union, then the EU’s policies have to be discussed in far greater depth. This not only involves fighting fraud and irregularities, but also this House thoroughly getting to grips with the question of what services we get in return for the money we invest. We have to redefine our objectives, and we have to delve far more deeply in order to evaluate what is being done with these funds in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is of course unnecessary to repeat in this House all the views so excellently expressed by my fellow MEPs. I shall be content to state that we are faced with two problems. The first is the number of impossible administrative systems, and the second is low morale in the administration. As Mr Sjöstedt said in this House, it is of course entirely true that the repeated signing of contracts with companies that have behaved quite unacceptably is inadmissible and that the Commission should simply have avoided having anything to do with such companies. Like my fellow MEP, Mr Kuhne, I must also say that one’s strongest emotion is really one of sympathy with the Commission. When, time after time, I listen to the Commissioners in the Committee on Budgetary Control, I think of a man armed only with a driving licence, sitting alone six miles above the ground in the cockpit of a Boeing 767 with no idea of how to land it.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at the problems we confront now that the EU has existed for 46 years, we cannot but observe that the whole problem lies in the attempt to solve problems that simply should not be solved. Agricultural policy in the 15 countries is quite harmful, as well as being superfluous. All the 15 countries are so rich that we could easily provide the necessary subsidies ourselves. The same applies to structural fund policy and, as the Swedish Prime Minister recently said, it is in fact meaningless for highly taxed countries to deduct tax from the ordinary man in the street when there are countries that will not tax their citizens, even the richest of them, and that subsequently redistribute these funds via the EU. For each euro we send to the EU, we therefore receive, on average, 80% of it back. That is of course a completely absurd policy, and one we can completely revise. We could fulfil all of the EU’s tasks with 10% of the budget, whereupon we should only have 10% of the fraud we see today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the whole Court for its ongoing work. The Committee on Budgetary Control depends on this work to allow it to discharge its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">We find it very useful indeed to be able to study and analyse the reports forwarded to us by the Court of Auditors. The annual report presented to the House today is of particular importance.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus on specific issues in that report. These include reform of the Commission, the responsibilities of the authorising officers, internal control and the introduction of a service of internal auditing. I believe they are key to improving the functioning of the European Commission and to better implementation of its budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Internal control and following up reform are the most vital of the aforementioned issues. I shall come back to them later. I also believe that all the analysis of enlargement is very significant. This includes an account of the remaining deficiencies in the structures and in the implementation of the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>. Nonetheless, some progress has been made in this regard. Shortcomings in the implementation of pre-accession instruments are also detailed. Once again, significant improvement has been recorded but the overall situation remains most unsatisfactory. Indeed, many of the shortcomings and deficiencies we are confronted with in those countries could perhaps have been avoided had there been a greater commitment to those instruments and had there been a greater effort to ensure that they functioned more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to budgetary management. The surplus remains considerable. It is less than it was, which represents some progress, but the fact that such a sizeable surplus still has to be dealt with is cause for considerable concern. As has been stated in the House, this may well prove to be the responsibility of the Member States. Nonetheless, the European Commission should exercise greater control to prevent such a situation arising. It represents an obstacle to effective implementation of Community programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">All this relates to one of the issues considered in greater detail in the Court’s report for this year. I refer to shared management with the Member States, and in particular to the EAGGF and the Structural Funds. Failure to implement has been most marked in these areas. I believe this calls for particular attention and I hope it will receive it both throughout this year and in the course of our current deliberations on discharge for the year 2002. Controls by the Member States must improve, as should the percentage of expenditure. We have stressed this on a number of occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise the need for a more detailed study of the reform. A more careful study must also be made of how it stands at present, of its possible shortcomings and of appropriate changes, should any prove necessary. Reform is essential if management of the European Commission is to become more flexible. Serious shortcomings have been noted. They are due to the longstanding in-house culture. As has been apparent today, a particular attitude prevails amongst officials. This means Commissioners are sometimes required to assume responsibility. Obviously, in the fullness of time Commissioners reach the end of their mandate and are succeeded by others full of good intentions and ideas. It should be understood that structural change and full and complete implementation of the reform are essential to capitalise on the good will and good intentions of these Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">As I conclude, I should also like to mention that bringing the European Development Fund under the Commission’s control and management would be a significant step forward. It would also be helpful to have it within the scope of this committee’s budgetary control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is clear from the report that there are still problems. The secretarial allowance rules still contain loopholes, which mean that the money is not always spent on staff, as it should be. Despite earlier warnings from the Court of Justice, the rules on the funding of political groups still show shortcomings. There was evidence of that this week when an OLAF report showed that a former political group in this Parliament had misused funds. Finally, the pension fund still lacks a proper legal basis and does not even have sufficient funds to cover all its liabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, as we all know, is always very good at criticising other institutions – we have done so today, but we also have to put our own House in order. Yesterday, a coalition of the selfish, the naïve and the greedy once again blocked a proposal to reform the system of pay and expenses for MEPs, which would have solved this problem once and for all. Opposition to this was led by Mr Schulz and Mr Nassauer. They are the same people who wrote to you, Mr President, asking for reform of the system of travel expenses because a German newspaper published their pictures and shamed them into action. The Bureau, as I understand it, postponed that debate. I hope that the German proposal will be taken up even though the SPD, the CDU and the CSU – not the Greens – have made it clear, privately, that they hope it will not be taken up.</p>
<p class="contents">The best evidence of this hypocrisy came last night, when the Bureau discussed reform of the secretarial allowance as mandated by the Court of Auditors. I am told that Mr Friedrich’s first reaction was to ask whether MEPs could still employ their relatives if the new rules were adopted! I am not against MEPs employing relatives <span class="italic">per se</span> if it is done in an honest and transparent manner, even though I personally do not think it is a wise move. However, Mr Friedrich’s reaction demonstrates that, unfortunately, for some MEPs on both sides of the House, the only purpose of their membership of this Parliament is self-enrichment and deceit.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, there are many MEPs, including colleagues such as Mr Kuhne, who want to reform our system of expenses. This question will be at the heart of my report on the discharge for the European Parliament for the 2002 financial year. 2004 is an election year; we cannot afford to embark upon this election with the current system, which is morally corrupt. If necessary, we must publicly shame our House into action.</p>

At the same time, it is a good thing that, for the first time, the Court of Auditors has not discovered material errors in connection with implementing the pre-accession aid for the candidate countries. Finally, it is also worth noting that the Court of Auditors has approved the 2002 accounts for the European Development Fund, even if there are critical remarks concerning their inspection. I wish to emphasise that we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party fully support the Court of Auditors’ proposal that the European Development Fund be integrated into the general budget.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is extremely worrying that the Court of Auditors cannot again approve the really big budget items such as the expenditure on agricultural aid, structural funds and internal policies, that is to say items constituting approximately 80% of the EU budget. In this area, we must be aware of the fact that administration and control of these budget items is, to a large degree, taken care of by the Member States themselves. There are also these budget items that, year after year, completely miss the mark in budgeting terms. This year, total under-use amounted to EUR 7.4 billion, or EUR 7 400 million, and that is extremely unsatisfactory. That is money that should and could have been used to fulfil the political objectives, and, had it not been used for those purposes, it could have been used in other of the EU’s budget areas, for example research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">I think these problems should lead to reflection upon the structures for exercising control in the area of the budget, with competence shared between the Commission and the Member States. In the first instance, I think that efforts should be made to coordinate and upgrade the Member States’ control of EU funds. A working party could be set up, consisting of representatives from the Member States’ respective control bodies. Of course, the Court of Auditors must have a seat on the working party, and the objective must be to develop a uniform control standard on the ‘best practice’ model. In the longer term, it should be considered whether the incentive for the efficient control of EU funds is simply too weak in the Member States. If that proves to be the case, top priority should be given to setting up a common European prosecution service.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I have a practical question for Mr Fabra Vallés. In connection with the publication of the report, and also in this House today, you have said that the Commission’s deadline for reforming the accounting system, namely January 2005, is very optimistic. I should like to ask what considerations form the basis of this statement, for I have noticed that the Court of Auditors has not evaluated the accounting reforms in the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dell’Alba (NI).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, after the speech by my friend Mr Van Hulten, I am no longer certain whether we are talking about the Court of Auditors’ report or the report of the Bureau meeting. If we are talking about the Court of Auditors’ report, there is no problem, because that was the debate for which I put my name down.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to praise the work of the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Fabra Vallés, and the work of the Court as a whole. I believe that, once again, the Court of Auditors has given us a document that deserves and requires our full attention. Unfortunately, I do not believe that this document will be widely read outside our institution, for example by national governments, by people in the Council and in the Ecofin Council, who think that it is quite all right to take power away from the European Parliament, whereas they ought first of all to look at and check their own accounts and take seriously the point raised by the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Hulten was right when he said that the Court of Auditors has drawn attention to a certain number of things that this House also needs to put in order. It is unfortunate that we sometimes tend to contemplate our own navels too much. We can see straight away those things in Parliament that are not working properly, and it is quite right that we should, and yet, for years, the Court of Auditors has been telling us that 80% of our expenditure, which is controlled by the Member States, contains an improbable number of errors, false allocations and problems which the Court itself has not been able to identify specifically.</p>
<p class="contents">So I ask myself when we are going to clear things up and finally put this system in order. It is our duty to be fastidious, and to pay attention to what the Commission and the other institutions do. As you know, Mrs Schreyer and Mr Fabra Vallés, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control have submitted two hundred questions to the Commission – perhaps even more – based on the Court of Auditors’ report. Unfortunately, though, we did not put any to the Member States, because we are not able to do so. I believe that this is a real problem. We must find a way of coming up with a solution, and of making the Court of Auditors’ report binding not only on the Commission, which will be asked to produce accounts, but also with regard to the accounts of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The other problem is how to follow up the recommendations that the Court of Auditors has made. For years now, the Court of Auditors has not carried out specific audits or surveys, for example of Eurostat. Yet for years it has been highlighting a certain number of problems that have never been taken seriously. For example, on the issue of export refunds, the Court of Auditors had for years identified a problem which had never been taken seriously, and the result of that was that we ended up with the scandal of which we are only too well aware.</p>
<p class="contents">If this exercise is not to be a pointless one, I believe that it must be given a more specific content, at any rate as regards the following two points: the way in which follow-up measures are organised at Member State level, and the reason why the Commission, and we ourselves, do not take sufficient account of the report’s conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad a number of the Court’s officials are accompanying Mr Fabra Vallés and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them also for the work accomplished.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot fail to emphasise once again the pedagogical aspect of the report before us. A conscious effort was made to include initial definitions of each of the areas. There is also an account of previous observations, proposed observations and of the Commission’s responses. Consequently, the document amounts to an encyclopaedia of Community financial management. It should prove most useful to all who have the pleasure of reading and studying it.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view it should also be stressed that this is a transitional report, insofar as it is part of the ongoing reform of the Commission, which is a significant administrative reform. I welcome the fact that whenever it referred to that reform, the Court of Auditors focused on improvements within the Commission. The Court highlighted plans launched or proposed by the Commission, indicating that the latter is taking reform seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">It would not actually make sense for the Commission to drag its feet over undertaking its own reform. After all, the initiative for reform came from the Commission itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Much does certainly remain to be done. Nonetheless, there is movement towards greater cooperation. I therefore believe the observation made by Mr Fabra Vallés concerning the desirability of revising the timetable is most opportune. The estimates may prove overly optimistic.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning assurance of the accounts, I should emphasise that the reservations expressed are specific and can be overcome. These are not reservations on the substance, nor are they reservations on the principles. These reservations can therefore be dealt with, despite their significance.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, some of the issues dealt with in the report, such as under-use, shared management and the reform process will be dealt with in the report on discharge for the financial year 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Written in clear language, which does not give way to hyperbole or the bureaucratic metaphysics that we unfortunately still find in some of the Court’s texts, they repeat a diagnosis originally made in 1990. The export refund system is extremely complex and highly open to fraud, as it does not follow the most elementary rules of transparency. In thirteen years, nothing has essentially changed in the way this scheme is run; it involves a very small number of interests and companies, which the Commission refuses to name. Commissioners come and go, reforms pass, but export refunds are still here and pose a challenge to everything and everybody. Three years after the network that falsified tens of thousands of tonnes of butter throughout Europe was exposed, and after it was called on to protect Europe’s financial interests as well as citizens’ and farmers’ rights, the Commission still refuses to take any action against any of the offenders and in fact affords privileged treatment to large dairy product companies involved in this scandal compared with the treatment it reserves for any farmers whose milk production exceeds their quota.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the practices and the realities which it is essential to combat, and it is useful to see them effectively and diligently examined, as has happened with these Court of Auditors reports on export subsidies. My heartiest congratulations once again, therefore, to the Court of Auditors on the work it has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps you should make your reports a bit clearer. Perhaps you could just state that the Statement of Assurance is absent or that you do not believe that reforms will be in place by the time promised, or perhaps you could just report that, where agriculture is concerned there has been no preparation for enlargement to speak of.</p>
<p class="contents">If one can talk in terms of only 2% funds getting to their intended recipients, then this policy has proved to be a non-starter. That is the simple view taken by our fellow-citizens. I cannot see any way of putting a cosmetic gloss on these things. If reform is the issue, then we have our own indicators. I am not talking about the time before 1999, but about the present day, when I say that, when we are told by a Commission that the report will be produced a year later, in contravention of the law it exists to guard and uphold, then something has not happened, that something being a learning process within the Commission. When one has to wait months to get a reply to questions relating what is currently going on in Eurostat – that is, questions relating not to the distant past but to the mistakes being made right now and to the continued waste of taxpayers’ money – then nothing has happened. When we are told that, if we want reforms and proposals for legislation by the end of December, we will get them in January, then, again, someone has failed to learn anything. It is by these criteria that we judge whether a reform has happened and has been successful. As you will by now have gathered, we are highly sceptical. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are looking at the reform of a massive multinational administration and it is not going to be easy to turn it around overnight. There is a recognition in the Court's report, however, that things are heading in the right direction and we are pleased to see that. There are still major problems with accountancy and we wish to see those efforts speeded up within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the publication of this report, we in the United Kingdom have been treated to screaming headlines about the fraud that goes on within the EU. It is the ninth time the Court of Auditors has not given the nod to the accuracy of the figures in the largest areas of expenditure. We must always remember that 80% of the money is spent within the Member States, and until there is more responsibility on the part of the Member States, the Commission cannot possibly account for every euro.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue I should like to concentrate on is the massive amount spent on invalidity pensions to institution staff. EUR 74 000 million are spent every year on people who are sick within the institutions. Of course, we have a responsibility to look after people who are sick, but the efforts made to help staff back to work are absolutely pitiful, especially those suffering psychological problems. 50% of staff said that there was no enquiry about their state of health or the possibility of them returning to work while on sick leave. In grades C and D, 62% of people retired on invalidity pensions while 21% retired on retirement pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ask both the Court and the Court of Auditors whether they will be pressing for Member States to sign declarations of assurance – both for the Structural Funds and in the agricultural domain – in the forthcoming reforms. Until we get that we are not going to see an improvement on the whole issue of accountancy, or of the Structural Funds, or of where the responsibility lies. If we stand firm on this issue we will try and hold up the process within the European Parliament until the Member States start taking their responsibility. Are you going to be pressing for the Member States to sign declarations of assurance? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several speakers referred to it indirectly, though no specific questions were posed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court has never undertaken a full audit of Eurostat, the statistics office. The Committee on Budgetary Control was informed of this on a number of occasions. Nonetheless, the Court has considered programmes implemented by Eurostat in the context of other audits. The results of these audits were included in the Court’s annual reports for the years 1993, 1998 and 1999. This last report was published in November 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court’s observations on Eurostat management related to inadequate procedures for the award of certain contracts. They also related to poor use of technical assistance offices, known as TAOs. It should be mentioned that the Court had already commented on the TAOs further to other audits. The Commission followed up these comments and reviewed procedures for awarding contracts and use of the TAOs in 1999. It also put in place new standards for management and control in these two areas. In addition, OLAF launched an internal investigation into Eurostat in mid-2000. In the light of the introduction of these new measures and of the ongoing internal investigation of OLAF, it would have inappropriate to initiate an audit of Eurostat at this juncture</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth stressing that in principle, the Court refrains from conducting audits in departments and areas under investigation by OLAF. This is in order to avoid interference or activity liable to prejudice anti-fraud investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court will take the lessons of the Eurostat affair into account when undertaking its risk analysis for the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mr Kuhne for his contribution, but I must say that I do not believe there were any questions for the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mulder stated we are on the right track, but wondered how long this would last. In my view, if we are on the right track we should stay on it. As to the time period, that depends on the organisation or institution. It depends on how complex or extensive it is. The Commission’s size and geographical dimension must be borne in mind. It should also be remembered that the Commission is not the only player involved. Each of the changes it makes has implications at national level. The Commission is therefore bound to be in constant contact with the various Member States. Consequently, it cannot always maintain the cruising speed set at a particular time. It should also be borne in mind that the reforms under way do not relate to the next five years only. We feel this is this is a longer-term venture.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we are on the right track. In addition, Parliament is there to play its part. It is for Parliament to keep nudging the Commission into action and to ensure this reform is taken forward as an ongoing and continuous process. It also has to be said that a favourable DAS has been granted since 1994, despite a number of shortcomings in the accounting system.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why in December 2002 the Commission decided to reform the accounting system. The intention was for the new system to come into operation in 2005. I still believe this deadline is optimistic. I do not wish to enter into a debate with the Commission on this. I simply mention it so that the House is not disappointed if it should turn out that the reform is not fully complete by 2005. The Court of Auditors feels that the time allowed is too short. We believe it is best to proceed slowly but surely. Each step forward should only be taken after due consideration, to ensure that decisions are sustainable. Adopting Penelope’s approach to reform is not helpful. Progress cannot be achieved through constant doing and undoing.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of reform, I believe it is important not to allow it to be jeopardised by the Eurostat case. The latter has been a blow to all Europeans, coming as it did just when it was thought that the TAOs and other situations had finally been dealt with. The clear conclusion to be drawn from this situation is the urgency of pursuing the reform and concluding it at the earliest opportunity. That is how things stand.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulty lies in quantifying the improvement. The House will be aware that the Court has never favoured references to the rate of error. The reason is that this leads to error, and that therefore nothing is gained. Nonetheless, the Court is working with standards. I am convinced that the standards presented this year will allow standards to be raised in subsequent years. It is to be hoped that within Parliament, the Commission and the Court of Auditors agreement can be reached on what constitutes a spade and what does not. That would be the best way of reaching an understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sjöstedt stated that we are referring to a general improvement. Ladies and gentlemen, it is important to establish whether or not improvement has taken place, and if so, to measure it. Hence the reference to standards, to allow you to make comparisons. I can assure you that there has indeed been some improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Rühle spoke of eliminating mistrust and increasing transparency. She also called for more democracy. Subsequently she referred to agriculture. My response on this is also directed to Mr Sørensen. The difficulty with agriculture is that too many faulty payments are still being made. That is the problem. We have established most of the errors relate to payments made outside the Integrated Administrative and Control System.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, this involves a significant proportion of the budget. It actually relates to more than 40% of the budget. When compared with the agricultural sector as a whole, the final beneficiary’s sum may seem small. Nonetheless, 40% is a large slice of the budget, and minor errors cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be borne in mind that 80% of the Community budget goes through the national budgets. The question then arises as to how far improvement of the Commission can go without the help of control by the Member States. I should inform you that we organise seminars throughout the year. Invitations were extended to parliamentarians, other institutions and members of national Courts of Auditors. They were invited to come to Luxembourg and get to know us. It is one way of building good relations. We were able to provide them with information and begin to gradually harmonise procedures. Bear in mind that we do not all use the same system. There is the Anglo-Saxon system and the European system. We are working to harmonise them.</p>
<p class="contents">A phrase from the Bible comes to mind, namely ‘go forth and preach’. I can assure you that all members of the Court do go forth and preach. We have all recently been in our home countries to do some explanatory work. Our task is the same in this House, in the national states and in the Court of Auditors. Our aim is to ensure that the Member States understand just how much we need their assistance and cooperation when it comes to controlling Community funds.</p>
<p class="contents">To save time, I shall reply to Messrs Camre, Bayona, Van Hulten, Dell'Alba, Casaca, Bösch and to Mrs Aviles and Mrs Morgan in writing.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention. Please be assured that we remain entirely at your disposal at all times.</p>
