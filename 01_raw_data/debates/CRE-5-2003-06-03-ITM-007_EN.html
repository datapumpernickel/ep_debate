The Commission has taken a proactive and leading role in responding to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). As recently stated by the Council on SARS on 6 May 2003, this has been undertaken through the EU network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community, working in the framework of Decision No 2119/1998/EC. This has provided a very effective basis for the rapid exchange of information within the EU and for a coordinated response in which EFTA and candidate countries have fully participated in collaboration with the WHO.</p>
<p class="contents">At its extraordinary meeting on SARS, the Council broadly agreed the orientation developed by the Commission with the assistance of the Network Committee. Although the application of health protection measures falls to the authorities of the Member States, the orientation for immediate and future actions will focus on the following issues: rapid detection of all suspect cases of SARS through good surveillance; protection of those at risk of infection through effective isolation of SARS patients in hospitals, including measures to protect carers; particular attention to be paid to air travel, which has been an important factor in the spread of SARS, notably to standardised screening of passengers leaving affected areas; on-board advice to passengers and effective information at ports of entry from affected areas; raising awareness among professionals and the public and the timely and accurate reporting and sharing of information with other countries, in particular EEA and EFTA countries, acceding and candidate countries, and with the WHO. Cooperation should also be developed with other partners such as airline companies, and the organising bodies of mass gatherings.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also took note of the Commission's intention to submit a proposal to create a European centre for disease prevention and control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Violation of human rights in Cuba</span></p>
<p class="contents">In March this year, 78 opposition figures were imprisoned in Cuba. Summary trials with no chance of a proper defence or the presence of independent individuals were held in April, followed by sentences of 15 and 28 years. The prisoners are now serving their sentences under inhuman conditions, in solitary confinement or together with hardened criminals, most often so far from home as to make visits by relatives impossible. These conditions are clearly a violation of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the Commission has recently opened an office in Havana and that the Cotonou agreement makes certain stipulations regarding human rights, what does the Commission intend to do to secure the release of political prisoners in Cuba? What is the Commission doing to ensure that the treatment of the Cuban prisoners improves and that they are moved nearer to home? What steps will the Commission take to support the prisoners and their relatives? </p>

The recent large-scale arrest of dissidents, the unfair trials and the arbitrary and excessive sentences imposed on them, as well as the execution of three Cuban citizens convicted of highjacking a Cuban ferry, have had a prompt, firm and sustained reaction from the European Union. The Commission has fully and actively supported the actions that have been taken in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, together with the Member States, has strongly condemned such arrests in a declaration published on 26 March 2003, which was followed up by an EU <span class="italic">démarche</span> in Havana to urge the Cuban authorities to allow the prisoners' immediate release.</p>
<p class="contents">A second EU démarche in Havana took place on 18 April, following the Foreign Ministers' statement issued on 14 April. Further measures have recently been agreed, including limits to high-level visits. The Commission decided on 30 April to defer the examination of the Cuban application for accession to the Cotonou Agreement, signalling that these recent developments are not conducive to cooperation between the European Union and Cuba. The Cuban authorities decided on 16 May to withdraw their application.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is concerned about the treatment of prisoners and believes that the Cuban authorities should invite the International Red Cross to visit them to ensure that they are treated humanely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Approximately 60 of the 75 people sentenced and imprisoned in Cuba following summary trials have received prison sentences of more than 20 years. They feel, quite simply, that their lives are threatened. Sentences as tough as these have not been handed down in Cuba for several decades.</p>
<p class="contents">My follow-up question to the Commissioner is about how we might follow up the protests in terms of practical politics. Can we act within the world community – within the UN – by trying to persuade the Red Cross to take action? Can we act through churches or in some other way? By means of various types of sanctions, can we put pressure on the Cuban regime? We are concerned here with people who have had to pay a very high price for the sake of democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question is interesting in any case because the barriers to parallel trade in pharmaceutical products have for some time been a source of concern to the Commission, which has already prepared many cases for trial in this field in the past and continues do so now. In particular, a large number of cases are currently under investigation in the competition sector, at the request of both pharmaceutical laboratories and complainants. The matter is also, as I said, highly topical.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the Commission has two legal instruments under which it can take action: Articles 81 and 82. With regard to Article 81, just a few days ago, Mr Tizzano, the Advocate General of the Court of Justice, presented his conclusions on the Bayer case, relating to parallel trade in one of the company’s products. I do not want to go into the details of this case or the conclusions of the Advocate General, which concern a matter of highly specific legal practice. The conclusions do not, however, endorse the lines taken by the Commission on the case. The Court’s judgment will be issued in a few month’s time but will not, in any case, compromise the Commission’s other decisions on issues different from the matters addressed in the Bayer case, such as, for instance, the decision adopted by the Commission on 8 May 2001 on the dual pricing system employed by the company, <span class="italic">Glaxo</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Article 82 is concerned, the Commission is currently working along precisely these lines. That raises a number of new questions, especially with regard to the definition of markets and abusive practices. Moreover, last February, the Court of Justice received a preliminary question from the Greek Competition Committee, which is the Greek authority responsible for competition. This preliminary question seeks to establish to what extent the refusal by a pharmaceutical company in a dominant position to supply a wholesaler with a view to stopping parallel trade can be deemed to be abuse prohibited by Article 82 of the EC Treaty. The Commission will, as usual, be called upon to express its opinion to the Court in the coming weeks, but the Court is not due to issue its judgment for many months yet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we mean by a regional or minority language is, and I quote, a language ‘traditionally used within a given territory of a state by nationals of that state who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the state’s population, and different from the official language(s) of that state’. This definition therefore encompasses many languages that are minority languages in one country but majority languages in another.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the promotion of minority and regional languages within the Union, the Commission finances the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages as well as the Mercator research centres. Their 2003-2004 work programme includes measures to provide information on European policy in the areas in question to the future members of the Union. Meetings are held on this issue, such as the Bolzano Conference of 26 and 27 May on the topic ‘Best practice in promoting linguistic diversity in an enlarged Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages has also begun to work on the establishment in the new Member States of national committees representing linguistic minorities, along the lines of similar committees existing in the current 15 Member States of the Union. It must be said that the future members already have the same opportunities as the Fifteen as regards minority and regional languages, namely the funding of initiatives through the existing programmes. Some of the programmes involved – Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci – are also open to all of the candidate countries. Finally, the Euromosaic study on the production and reproduction of the minority language groups in the European Union will be extended to the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States have also been invited to participate in public consultations that have been launched by the Commission as part of the preparations for an action plan for language diversity and learning, which will be presented to the Council and Parliament in July, in the context of the analysis of the new generation of Leonardo, Socrates and Youth programmes. All linguistic minorities, including those whose language is a majority language in other Member States of the enlarged Union, have been able to take part in these consultations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully support the notion of providing financial assistance to minority and lesser-spoken languages, and like many colleagues I am familiar with the educational programmes and the work of the Bureau. As the Commissioner knows, respect for someone else's language, respect for that person and his or her culture and customs, helps support the integration of those communities.</p>
<p class="contents">In that vein, can I ask the Commissioner to at least consider, perhaps by means of a study or a survey, giving support for re-defining the definition and including other languages perhaps non-European in origin, but still spoken and understood by many people, languages understood across many EU states – Urdu, Hindi, Bengali and Tamil, to name but a few.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that this is a significant suggestion, but my fear is that if we do not at least consider this, we will be sending a very divisive message to many ethnic minority communities at a key time of integration. In effect we will be saying that languages spoken by a few hundred people in some cases, and I agree with the support of those languages, are more important to the EU than others spoken by hundreds of thousands. I wonder whether the Commissioner would be prepared to consider that? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, during the European Year of Languages, we not only gave the official languages their say; we also facilitated the provision of funding for languages which are actually spoken in the territory, if that was what associations or citizens wanted. We must be vigilant in monitoring what is happening through our schools and in society in general. In our schools, it is inevitable that the mother tongue is the official language, the first language. I have always demanded that we should endeavour to teach two foreign languages in addition to the base language, and this is something that our heads of state and government have accepted. That is one point. The other point is respect for multiculturalism, for cultural diversity in our society, and I do believe that in some regions, languages spoken by migrants are also part of this cultural environment. That is the reality, and it must be taken into account when analyses are carried out and language diversity is subjected to academic study. Nonetheless, the priority, in my view, will continue to be supporting traditional languages and promoting multilingualism in our schools. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The subject of violence at football grounds is addressed in the Council Decision of 25 April 2002 concerning security in connection with football matches with an international dimension (2002/348/JHA<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>) and Parliament's resolution of 9 April 2002 on the same subject (<a href="/doceo/document/TA-5-2002-0148_EN.html">P5_TA(2002)0148</a>), which legitimises the existence of different teams from different nations within a state: (4a) National football teams do not necessarily represent the same entities as Member States, and regard should be had for the different footballing traditions and cultures existent within those Member States which are represented in international football by more than one national team; (4b) Whilst the maintenance of public order in relation to football matches with an international dimension is paramount, football supporters of one national team of a Member State should not be discriminated against on the basis of the behaviour of supporters of another national team of that Member State. Parliament's approach is a recognition of the fact that sport is an expression of the culture, way of life and personality of the citizens of a given society, and that consequently it needs to exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission not believe that, in connection with the problem of violence at football grounds, the fact that some teams represent different cultural identities within one and the same state might help to reduce tensions at football grounds? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, the inclusion of a Community competence in the field of sport is currently being considered by the Commission for its draft constitutional Treaty. Following the proposal by the Praesidium of the Convention to introduce such a competence under the areas of supporting actions, the Commission, through its representatives, Mr Barnier and Mr Vitorino, took the initiative of submitting a draft article to the Convention, to which my services and myself made a significant contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft constitutional Treaty, as it currently stands, incorporates the principles of the Commission’s draft and includes competence for sport in Part III, Chapter V of the Treaty, areas where the Union may take coordinating, supplementary or supporting action: education, vocational training, youth and sport. Sport is therefore added. In this article, paragraphs 1 and 2 are specifically dedicated to sport, and I am very happy with this proposal, as with this article, the Union encourages the educational and social functions of sport without harmonising the laws and regulations of the Member States. Therefore, this new article, if included at last in the final Treaty, would also provide the response to the previous questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part of the question relates to the new World Anti-Doping Code. As you know, the Commission welcomes all efforts to combat doping. However, there is no unique or miraculous solution that would enable us to resolve this problem. The World Anti-Doping Code will help to combat this scourge, but other measures are needed too.</p>
<p class="contents">The Code is a preventive instrument, targeted at high-level sport. Nonetheless, it is important to be aware that the fight against doping should also cover the amateur sector and encompass issues of prevention, education and research. The Commission wants to emphasise that the issues covered by the Code are not directly within its remit, but it is following these developments very closely and will continue to keep a close eye on them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States support the Code, and the Commission, which does not have an official position as this is an intergovernmental matter, is, instead, stepping up its efforts in the areas of education, prevention and legislation on sports foods. We have therefore established a form of complementarity: we help the Member States to reach agreement. Moreover – before the major meeting in Copenhagen on doping – a meeting of Sports Ministers was organised by the Commission in Brussels with a view to enabling Europe to speak with one voice.

It seemed very difficult, but all indications are that it will be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I am reassured by the information you have given me, because I had seen certain proposals from international sporting organisations which really did not reassure me very much in terms of the inclusion of sport in the future Treaty, amongst other things, because, being rather difficult, we ran the risk of achieving nothing in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to combating doping, my feeling is that, since the World Anti-Doping Agency was created, there is almost less control in this area then there was before. I would like to hear the Commissioner’s opinion on this and on whether she believes it is necessary to rather reinvigorate the fight against doping at European level and, if possible, at world level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been talking about the social dimension and educational dimensions of sport for years. It is these dimensions which have been included in the draft treaty, not, I am glad to say, the excessive demands of certain sporting bodies. The wisdom of the Convention members has therefore prevailed over the demands of certain sporting organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I should like to thank all the sportsmen and sportswomen and all the sporting organisations, including the President of the International Olympic Committee, who have been helping us for years in our aim of getting this article included in the treaty. I should also like to thank the Convention members, the Members of the European Parliament and all the national politicians who have contributed to this effort.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, it poses a few small problems, since among other things it is not based on international law and, therefore, neither are its proposals. The Agency is a body under private law, which does not make things any easier.</p>
<p class="contents">As for controls, I do not know whether there are fewer now than before. Just about everybody tells me that there are too many, and that everyone is carrying out overlapping and contradictory controls, and that it would be better to concentrate them and to act logically and in accordance with Member States’ laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Many problems still have to be sorted out before a final solution is achieved. A World Anti-Doping Agency code is not enough. We need a change in, or an adaptation of, Member States’ laws. Imagine a situation in which a sportsman is given a two-year suspension and appeals before a national court, and it turns out that the law of that State is not in accordance with the World Anti-Doping Agency code. The sportsman would be acquitted and we would find ourselves in complete chaos, and with even more uncertainty than before.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must decide, at last, to endeavour to strike a balance, to reform Member States’ laws on doping and to obtain from the Union an assurance that it is committed to complementary action in the form of educational and preventive measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the issue of doping, I have a very specific question: time and again, when doping cases occur, it is pointed out that the athletes were not clear about the content of the products. A fairly simple measure which could be adopted – although it is admittedly not absolutely watertight in its effect – is to identify doping products on the label, perhaps by including a red dot or a red line on the packaging, in order to draw specific attention to the content and the risks associated with doping. Could the Commissioner take steps in this direction? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are responsible for the labelling of medicinal products. I have already spoken to my fellow-Commissioner Mr Byrne about ways in which we can label medicines in order to prevent such substances entering the body by chance – although as we know, something like that does not happen entirely by chance. However, we also know that it is not just medicinal products that are causing the problems, but also food additives, so this whole issue is fairly complex. However, if we want to control doping in Europe, we need a comprehensive list of the medicines and additives concerned, and this list must then be distributed – in collaboration with the sports associations – to the sportsmen and sportswomen themselves. Therefore I believe that providing information both to sports doctors and to athletes is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want, however, to point out that we do not just have a problem with professional athletes. For example, we carried out a study on fitness centres which revealed that even teenagers – primarily young men between 15 and 17 years of age – are taking banned substances because they have seen the older ones doing so and because these substances are freely available in some of these fitness centres. We are clearly dealing with a public health issue here, and in this respect, I believe that more political action is needed than we have seen to date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Implementation of Council Directive 1999/70/EC by Greece</span></p>
<p class="contents">Presidential Decree 81/2003 transposes Directive 1999/70/EC<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> into Greek law nine months after the transposition deadline.

<p class="contents">These exemptions, particularly that of the public sector, have met with opposition from the social partners (Opinion 79/2002 from the Economic and Social Committee) on the grounds that they clearly run counter to the directive’s sphere of application and certainly do not prevent the abuse of fixed term contracts. In view of this, does the Commission consider that the above ‘paragraph’ of Article 5 of the presidential decree complies with the letter and spirit of Directive 1999/70? Does it intend to initiate infringement proceedings against Greece for incorrect implementation of Directive 1999/70/EC, under Article 126 of the Treaty? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is currently in the process of evaluating the transposition and will take a decision following a careful examination of the dossier. However, it is perfectly clear that, under clause 5 of the directive, the Member States must establish a framework to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive gives the Member States a number of options as regards the application of this clause. They must introduce at least one of the following measures: objective reasons justifying the renewal of fixed-term contracts, maximum total duration of the contracts and number of renewals. A first reading of the presidential decree shows that article 5 makes provision for the above and that it expressly stipulates that the renewal of fixed-term contracts of employment is allowed if justified by an objective reason and examples of objective reasons are given. Of course, the Member States themselves determine what is meant by the term 'objective reasons'. However, the measures introduced must be adequate measures to prevent abuse. For example, the argument that work in the public sector per se is an objective reason for unlimited successive fixed-term contracts is unacceptable. There must be objective grounds based on the nature of the object.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, as I said, intends to arrive at an evaluation of the transposition of the implementing legislation and to proceed to take any subsequent action required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission's recommendation at the time concerned the possibility of access for senior citizens to all resources provided by decision of the Member States to their own senior citizens, from museums and cultural activities to free subsidised transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the technical obstacles to the introduction of this card proved to be quite considerable. To date three cost/benefit studies have been carried out, describing the systems which exist and the limitations to which they are subject, together with the obstacles which exist in numerous Member States.

We should demonstrate which kind of best-practice reforms have achieved the target most effectively.

They are consumers. We know that there is a very large section of the European population who are pensioners and well-off pensioners. These people really do have mobility at European level and participate in consumption, but the question was very specific and concerned the need for a card. It is a nice idea. I agree with you that this sort of card would facilitate the mobility of pensioners even more, but an idea also has to be adopted by those who will be called on to apply it and by those who will be called on to enjoy its advantages. At this precise moment, we see that there is no inclination either on the part of the Member States or on the part of senior citizens' organisations. Obviously, if there is any movement, we too shall act accordingly for our part, but I do not think that the Commission has any possibility of acting at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Youth unemployment</span></p>
<p class="contents">Youth unemployment is a phenomenon deserving of serious attention and is indeed dealt with accordingly in the European Union; even greater significance will, however, need to be attached to it as a result of the accession of ten new countries as part of enlargement to the East. The Member States will in future be confronted with an influx of young people seeking work from the new Member States which will boost their own rates of unemployment.</p>

<p class="contents">The first point concerns the fear of waves of immigrants. Usually, it is the youngest workers who move. Studies which we have carried out show that mobility from the 10 future Member States to the present European Union of the 15 will be relatively limited. It is estimated that there will be an outbreak in the first years, which will reach 250 000 people per annum, half of whom will be manpower, but that this mobility of manpower will start to decline towards the end of the decade to fewer than 100 000 people.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, these studies always have a significant number of forecasts. However, they are fairly convincing if you think that they have taken account of all the prevailing conditions in each of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, previous experience of enlargement in Europe and studies into the phenomenon of immigration suggest that young migrant workers from the new Member States will tend to migrate towards the wealthier areas of their own countries, to large towns where unemployment rates are relatively lower and there are relatively good prospects of finding work. Young people in these countries tend to opt first for their own towns and their own areas which are better developed, rather than choosing to go to another country. So much for the study of the phenomenon of immigration flows.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns transitional arrangements for the free movement of workers decided at European level. As you know, there is an agreement on the free movement of workers during the first two years. Following accession, each Member State can decide on free movement, but it can also postpone it for five years. This is the 5 + 2 rule.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns the strategy on employment, the application of policies in which the European Union has an added value. Here we must say that there has been cooperation here for three years between the European Commission and each of the candidate Member States, where essentially we are trying to support the creation of individualised action plans to combat unemployment. Considerable efforts are being made to include reducing the drop-out rate from school, which is a serious problem in many of these countries, and to prepare them so that, with the new generation of Structural Funds, there will be optimum investment in human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, I repeat that my reply includes three basic categories of issues. Immigration flows and the study of the phenomenon with possible forecasts. The second is the institutional framework as configured at European level and the third is the application of policies on employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You specifically raised the issue of school drop-outs. I think it would be very important for the European Union to focus especially on education and training, so that young people in the accession countries have a chance to benefit from suitable job opportunities in their own countries. It would also be important in psychological terms, in terms of the basic attitude in these countries, for young people to see that they have a chance in Europe and that Europe guarantees them this chance. For this reason, I am wondering whether it is possible, in terms of funding, to launch special measures via the Structural Funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The discussion also relates to which areas funding from European resources should be directed at and to the priorities of the sectors which have to be financed. There is broad agreement that high priority needs to be given to human resources. Without significant investment in human resources, there will be a problem with the take-up of funds, even for the projects, even for business support. Thus, the discussion is being directed to a large extent towards the fact that the candidate countries, as they are already doing, will have to prepare those structures with which they will be able to fund the employment strategy, to fund the infrastructures of their education systems and the reforms needed, all of which are very important to their development. It is not my feeling that, with the agreement that already exists, significant resources will be safeguarded for the new countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I believe that the problem of unemployment amongst young people in Europe is almost a red herring since, if we are able to increase Europe’s economic growth, we will be providing employment and we will need many young people. Consequently, the young people from the countries now joining the Union, who will be able to compete on the labour market of the current fifteen, are an asset and not a problem. There could certainly be a problem in the countries they leave behind. To put it briefly: economic growth plays a crucial role in a country’s capacity to absorb young people and this growth and economic development must be of concern to everyone. Young immigrants are always an asset. Mr Bushill-Matthews is well aware that the contribution made by young Portuguese people and Portuguese immigrants has been crucial to the great prosperity that his country, Luxembourg, now enjoys. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to achieve the objective of full employment in 2010, we need to create 22 million jobs for the 25 new countries, so that we arrive at unemployment throughout Europe in the order of 3.5% – 4%. Is this feasible? As you quite rightly said, provided growth rates are achieved and the agreed reforms are applied, we have statistics from the past to show that we created 5 million jobs in the 15 countries alone over a four-year period. Thus a combination of growth and reform can indeed give the desired result.</p>

According to our information, the United Kingdom has now correctly transposed Directive 77/187/EEC into national legislation. Accordingly, disputes concerning incorrect application are, in principle, a matter for the national courts. Therefore the Commission services have stressed on several occasions over the years that the national courts constitute the appropriate legal framework for dealing with the issues raised in the case concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be recalled in this respect that the complainants have indeed addressed the national courts but without success.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the legally binding nature of collective agreements in the United Kingdom is concerned, I would like to point out that this is also a matter of interpretation of English law, often requiring a factual appreciation. The directive and, in particular Article 3(2), does not oblige a Member State to change the legal nature of collective agreements. Furthermore, even if, generally speaking, collective agreements are not legally binding in the United Kingdom, nothing prevents them from being legally binding if they are incorporated into an employment contract, thereby becoming part of the contractual terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether or not this is the case is often a complex issue requiring a factual appreciation. Contrary to the conclusion reached by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the complainants' case, a recent judgment concerned such a binding collective agreement applicable in the National Health Service. In its judgment, the European Court of Justice explicitly acknowledged that it is for the national courts to determine, if necessary, whether benefits arising from a collective agreement bind the transfer and thus also bind the transferee under Article 3(2).</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, a non-enforceable collective agreement before the transfer will continue to remain non-enforceable after the transfer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hear with interest what the Commissioner has to say, but she will know very well that there is no comfort in that response for many lecturers in the United Kingdom who assumed that they were going to be guaranteed the rights they had in their previous employment. They thought that under the Acquired Rights Directive they had some hope of protection of their rights. The result has been that those who chose to use those rights have seen ten years of pay freeze, ten years of a freeze on any chance of career promotion, and removal of pension rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commissioner say this afternoon whether she thinks they are right in concluding that the acquired rights directive – which they thought would give them protection – has been a totally worthless piece of European legislation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
