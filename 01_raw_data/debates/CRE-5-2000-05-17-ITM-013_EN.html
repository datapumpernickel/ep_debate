Man’s ability to launch space vehicles has extended our frontiers well beyond the Earth’s atmosphere and has afforded us a wealth of new knowledge on the solar system and the universe as a whole. At the same time, it has brought practical applications which have changed our lives. The use of artificial satellites in telecommunications, weather forecasting, Earth observation and navigation is so widespread that it is hard to imagine these activities continuing without the use of space. Moreover, the high technical standards required of space equipment have led to enormous technological breakthroughs, which have gradually filtered into our everyday lives. Finally, space has always had a strategic importance, since whoever controls space also controls the Earth. Space is the one sector in which international cooperation is particularly important. In Europe, the European Space Agency (ESA), an independent body comprising 14 European countries, 12 of which are members of the European Union, has played a critical role in fostering cooperation in space exploration, space applications and the development of research in space.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, the Commission and Parliament have all addressed the issue of space policy on a number of occasions in the past. The main political issue in the entire discussion concerned the development of a coherent approach to space and the promotion of collaboration between the European Union and the ESA on the basis of specific targets and within a clear framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s working document being examined today comes as a response to the Council’s resolution of 22 June 1998 calling on the Commission to take practical measures to promote cooperation between the European Union and the ESA. The text discusses aspects of the European Union’s space policy concerning practical applications, mainly in the fields of telecommunications, navigation and Earth observation, but makes no mention of space exploration or the use of space for scientific research. From this point of view, the document is somewhat limited in scope, since an overall policy for space cannot restrict itself merely to practical applications. The Commission has made it clear that a coherent approach is indispensable for the European Union. It has therefore set up a consultative structure for space and related matters with the active participation of the ESA. This structure comprises the Space Advisory Group and other high-level groups. The Commission’s document concludes that the European Union must find new means of implementing a space policy and proposes specific lines of approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy expresses a strong desire to see space used for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind as a whole. At the same time, it takes the view that space policy must not be wholly dominated by the market and that account must be taken of long-term assessments of the benefits and risks of exploiting space, not only from the point of view of the interests of industry, but also in terms of the welfare of mankind as a whole. It stresses the importance of international cooperation, the need for all Member States to participate in space activities and the importance of collaboration with third countries, and points out that the ESA has functioned efficiently and has played a leading role in space research and space applications in both Europe and worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry welcomes the European Commission’s intention of establishing a policy framework for future programmes and stresses that this framework must be developed after extensive and in-depth consultations between all the parties involved. It is in favour of the further development of launching systems, the development of new telecommunications systems and further European participation in the Alpha station programme and reiterates the European Parliament’s support for the development of the global satellite navigation system known as Galileo. It calls on the Commission, in collaboration with the Member States, to take all measures needed for effective use of space-based systems for monitoring the environment and for security, in order to protect citizens’ lives and natural resources, identify at an early stage, or even avert natural or man-made disasters and help combat fraud. I am convinced, fellow members, that today’s debate will help to develop space policy further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Radwan (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, first of all, I would like to say thank you very much to the Commission and to the rapporteur for the work they have done and for their excellent cooperation. Space exploration is, of course, a high technology field, which operates years ahead of its time in many areas and which is developing applications now that will only be available to the bulk of the population in ten or fifteen years’ time. Europe is in competition in this field with countries such as the USA, which is number one of course, but also with Asian countries and Russia. We must see that Europe strengthens its position in this strategic field and also takes a leading role. One positive example in this respect is of course the Airbus, with which we are all familiar, and which is responsible, on account of years of cooperation between the States and industries, for the fact that we now play a leading role in the construction of civilian aircraft and already have a market share of 50% in many segments.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, this is not just about space exploration itself but about how competitive Europe is going to be in the future. A number of examples have, in fact, been mentioned: earth observation, telecommunications, environmental protection, security. It is not just about practical applications but also, as you have already mentioned, about research.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight three points that I consider to be important. One is the future cooperation between the ESA, the European Union and also the Member States. We should, of course, give the Member States the latitude they need, in keeping with the terms of subsidiarity. However, there is also a case for improving coordination between the Member States, the ESA and the EU, precisely because the work undertaken in this sector is so capital-intensive. We also need to establish an opposite number for industry. Industry is undergoing a consolidation process. There are an ever-increasing number of public private partnerships in this sector. That is why there is an urgent need for industry to have a point of contact, someone with whom it can enter into dialogue, rather than running itself into the ground.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to future commercialisation. We must ensure that the products, the applications from space exploration, are also used in practical applications for consumers in the future. We must create new opportunities in this respect, so as to enable small- and medium-sized companies, and start-up companies, in particular, to practise innovation. GALILEO is a key word here. Of course, we are having to compete with the American GPS system, but I believe that if we do more to help commercialisation on its way, then we will see more innovation across the board.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The third important point relates to the WEU, external security. The Kosovo conflict brought home to us only too clearly the implications of not having our own information system. Hence we should keep this option open if the WEU is incorporated into the EU. Having our own foreign and security policy means having our own information facilities too. We should not foreclose this option but always keep it in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, in addition to this, it has, above all, generated incredible change in<span class="bold"> </span>our everyday lives. Satellites and telecommunications have been mentioned, and we could add the weather forecast. However, we must also acknowledge that space is a strategic issue: we have mentioned the terrible war between the United States and the USSR. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, although the United States and Russia still dominate this sector, the countries of Europe play a major and increasingly significant role. It is of paramount importance that we establish a European strategy if we want to lend more weight to the Union and this strategy must maintain a balance between the various uses made of space.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Space Agency has played a role which has been crucial for the cooperation between European countries in the field of the exploitation of space and research development. However, as the rapporteur suggests, it would appear necessary to extend its activities to projects launched within the Community framework. </p>
<p class="contents">We must also make up for the absence of a genuine European policy and a European strategy ensuring the effective use of space systems to monitor the environment and to provide security, protect natural resources, detect or forecast natural and man-made disasters and combat fraud. A large chunk of the practical applications involving space is already controlled by the market, and I feel that this is dangerous. The Commission must put forward measures to control what are genuine abuses. </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, together with many of my fellow Members, I am extremely pleased that the Galileo project met with such approval. It will ensure that Europe makes a substantial contribution to the establishment of a worldwide satellite navigation system. To sum up, the new approach to space policy must be based on a close partnership between the Member States, the European Union and the European Space Agency. This is the only way to achieve the consensus such a policy requires. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many smaller companies active which do not work together very well. In order to be able to compete on the global market, it is necessary to restructure the space industry, that is to say integrate various companies into one company or group of companies. There is, as such, plenty of work for the space advice group. Cooperation at Community and international level in space activities is imperative. </p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the position of the European satellite industry. Since the end of the cold war, the strategic importance of having our own satellite industry has been of commercial importance. The sector is growing by 10% annually and thus helping create employment. If the European Union does not want to miss the boat, the Commission and Member States need to promote the development of the industry. Satellite systems are the means to further develop information and communications technology. Unfortunately, the European satellite industry is very much dominated by governments. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why it works too much in isolation, without a great deal of interaction with the computer, network, software and peripheral equipment industry. As a result, the industry is increasingly losing its market share to the US. More cooperation and company mergers are needed, as well as more support in technology development, through the framework programme, among other things. </p>
<p class="contents">My Group is waiting with bated breath for the document the Commission has promised on a European space satellite in which, needless to say, the input of the European Space Agency is vital.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has already been said, there is no longer any competition between America and the Soviet bloc, and yet, for all its scientists and technical expertise, Europe is unable to launch itself into space and space research. </p>
<p class="contents">We need to increase funding and create a specific budget heading for space research. The European Union should manage national space research budgets, for space research is, by nature, one of the main activities of the European Union and would clearly not yield satisfactory results if carried out merely at individual State level. We need to create a European Union space body which is separate from the ESA: the ESA is something different. We need to organise the launching of low cost European Union satellites to serve European industries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that pensioners should somehow be included in this space research. How can this be? Well, in the United States, a famous pensioner, the astronaut John Glenn, went into space at the age of 69. I am 55 years old and in 15 years’ time I will be 69. I am already a politician: I could become an astronaut, the first pensioner astronaut of the European Union. I am booking my seat today!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I can assure you that we welcome this parliamentary resolution, in that it stresses the importance of politically consolidating the Commission’s analysis regarding, amongst other things, the strategic and economic role of space and the need to reinforce European investments and the status of the European space industry and to develop new approaches to space policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, on 2 December, the Council of Ministers for Research adopted a resolution calling upon the Commission to draw up a European space strategy together with the European Space Agency. This strategy will have to be submitted to the Council for evaluation before the end of the year. </p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, I sent a note to the Commission reviewing the progress of the work. You will remember that this work is carried out by a group made up of representatives of the Space Agency, representatives of the various Commission directorates concerned and also representatives of industry and the WEU. This group has already met several times and will meet again in July. The information memo which will be sent to you will inform you as to the state of progress of the work. The drawing up of a European space strategy is of universal relevance and it must serve as a basis for the decisions scheduled for the end of 2000 on the Galileo programme, more explicitly, and for the debate already underway on security and the environment, which should lead to initiatives whose importance is noted in the motion for a parliamentary resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the dialogue which we have embarked upon with the European Space Agency is fully in line with a wider-ranging communication which we are shortly to discuss in connection with another report, the dynamic of a European research area. In my opinion, the thrust of the two measures is very similar, for we are trying to achieve synergy between all of Europe’s potential so that it can take as full and extensive a place as possible in tomorrow’s world. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the debate which has just taken place, which, as I said before, lends political support to the Commission’s analysis. In the next few months, with the support of Parliament, the European Council and the ESA Council, for we want to work in tandem, we should have a benchmark for future space activities. As the report stressed, these are essential.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
