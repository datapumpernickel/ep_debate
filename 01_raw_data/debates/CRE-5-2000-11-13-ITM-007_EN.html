<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langenhagen (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, in two days’ time in this House we will be addressing another weighty matter, the Annual Report of the Court of Auditors on the 1999 budget year, the first budget which covers, at least in part, the term of office of the new Commission. While, with this annual report, the new Commission will quite clearly be held accountable and will need to be reminded of its duty, the FAIR Programme is, as it were, unfinished business from a bygone era. The FAIR Programme – Fisheries, Agriculture and Agro-Industrial Research – was part of the fourth Framework Programme which ran from 1994 to 1998. In that time, a total of EUR 660 million of Community funds was spent on the FAIR Programme, admittedly a small amount when compared with the overall budget of the fourth Framework Programme of over EUR 11.8 billion, but an amount which is, nonetheless, worthy of investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned that the FAIR Programme investigated in the Court of Auditors’ special report was unfinished business from the past. One could argue that there was no need at all for Parliament to deal with these outdated issues any more, because – so people say – the new Commission is of course doing everything better in any case. However, I cannot accept such an argument. After all, as representatives of the people of Europe, we have a supervisory role which we must exercise so as to remain credible. Part of this is, of course, also <span class="italic">ex post</span> evaluation, even if, in this case, it has definitely come rather late.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was drawing up my report, I held numerous conversations with both the Court of Auditors and the Commission, and I also brought all the parties together around one table. At this – what I would call – mini ‘trialogue’ there was an open and fair discussion. My questions were answered satisfactorily. All sides gave their honest opinions – in my view – without falling back on inflexible opposing positions. I observed a constructive atmosphere with the transparency and flexibility which is so often called for, and in no sense was it reminiscent of two armoured tortoises facing each other without saying a word. I believe that it is certainly possible to speak of a new culture of cooperation which was put into practice here for the first time. I would expressly thank the Court of Auditors and the Commission for this. The attitude of those being inspected towards their inspectors has taken a turn for the better. Inspections are, of course, not carried out for their own sake either, but to achieve an improvement. I would say that, at the end of the day, we are, of course, all acting in unison, the inspectors and those being inspected, and why? So as to ensure that European money is better deployed in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall then, this is a balanced and fairly argued report. Nevertheless, there are some points which are mentioned which I must criticise. However, at the same time, I would express the hope that the Commission will respect its commitments and that it has made the appropriate improvements in the fifth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">What are my main criticisms? Firstly, the length of the overall inspection procedure. As it stands at the moment it is unacceptable. I say this quite clearly and you are aware of this. It is simply impossible that two full years should go by between the investigation beginning and the report being submitted to Parliament. Surely some relevance to the present situation has to be retained. This has nothing to do with carrying out the controls themselves, they take time, but it is to do with the contradictory procedure and possibly also with publication. There is therefore a need for action to be taken. A procedure urgently needs to be identified which will allow the special report to be published within a reasonable period of time. My question to the Commission in this regard highlighted some possibilities, but unfortunately no usable result has yet emerged.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance of the research programme for agriculture and fisheries, it is regrettable that some problems were identified in connection with the organisation of the programme. For example, the descriptions of the selection criteria remain unclear and their application inconsistent, with the result that it was sometimes impossible to understand why projects had been selected for funding. In addition, there were mistakes in the certified expenditure and insufficient sanctions, as well as links between experts and some of the organisations involved in the research proposals which, in my view, need to be queried. Above all, however, it must be pointed out that the cooperation between the Directorates-General involved – Fisheries, Agriculture and Research – was unsatisfactory and needs to be more efficiently structured in the future. I nonetheless assume, not least with a view to my hobbyhorse of fisheries, that we will put pressure on all three of them together so that we can guarantee positive developments in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problems that arose in spending were not of too much concern to the Fisheries Committee; other areas were of greater concern. The Court of Auditors produced a constructive and reasonable report, but when we had the discussion in committee and teased out the problems and heard the explanations we were a bit more satisfied that the problems that arose were not foreseeable and were correctable. I remember that there was a very large number of projects involved. The amount of money is not insignificant – EUR 600 million – but, nevertheless, there were around 600 projects involved which spread the money quite thin and made it quite difficult for the limited staff and resources that the Commission had at the time to monitor carefully exactly what was going on.</p>
<p class="contents">Like so many other sections of the budget, something like 80% of the entire spending involved public bodies of one sort or another within the Member States. This money was not just being thrown out to industry, although some of it was. A lot of this spending was supervised by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that there is a change in the policy under the new programme, moving from giving the money into the care of the policy-making Directorate-General to giving it to people who are engaged in research. We can expect a more constructive approach to research when it is done by people interested in research rather than by people who administer the policies, as in the case of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, we thank the rapporteur for drawing attention to the problems involved and look forward to the re-organised programme being more effective and more satisfactory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors’ report on the FAIR Programme, from which the rapporteur’s report arises, was only published in March this year even though the sector letters regarding the audit were first sent to the Commission in December 1998 and February 1999. As the rapporteur suggested, this is simply unacceptable. It is too long a delay and undermines the relevance of Parliament’s work in considering such reports. This delay results from the contradictory procedure between the Court and the Commission which precedes the publication of every Court of Auditors’ report, whereby the Commission has the right to have its reply published at the same time as the report. As a result of the delay in this case the rapporteur quite rightly questions the continuation of the contradictory procedure in its current form. This is something I will certainly be exploring in the report I will be bringing to Parliament in December. It is sufficient to suggest that we need to look at the whole procedure again, not just in terms of the Court’s annual report which will be published tomorrow, but also in terms of special reports such as this one.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors’ report found a number of significant problems with the management of the FAIR Programme during 1994 to 1998, including a lack of quantified objectives for the programme, making it difficult to fully measure the results, insufficient transparency in selection and evaluation procedures and the management of measures under the programme by three DGs. This meant that the management of the programme lacked clarity and homogeneity. We hope that as a result of the reform of the Commission currently taking place we will see a huge correction of this in future. That we do not have clear targets, that we cannot measure output, is really unacceptable and would not happen in any other institution. This is very old hat. We know the change is coming, but we want to see it very quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">One problem which remains is the EUR 3.4 million still to be recovered, 92% of which is accounted for by three files which have been under examination by the Commission’s legal services since July 1996 and August 1997 and whose due dates have expired. It is vital that the Commission follows that and gets its money back. We will be following this report’s recommendations in future so we encourage the Commission to put things right as soon as possible, otherwise you will see reference to this and other special reports within discharge procedure reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that, in every way, Mrs Langenhagen has provided a clear description of the very major problems there have been in putting the FAIR Programmes into effect and, at the same time, in also checking up on how the programmes were operating. In that connection, I should like to make it clear that, in view of the very great degree of expertise possessed by the Commission, we cannot accept that so many of the things we adopted in the decisions have not been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I should like to call attention to a fairly small number of points. Before new programmes are put into effect, the previous programmes ought to be assessed. With the help of the scientific research which is, of course, an important part of our policies – in this case, fisheries policy – a prior assessment needs to be carried out of what is wanted and of how the resources are used, so that existing resources can continually be adapted to catch techniques and catch opportunities. Against the background of what has happened, those of us in the Committee on Fisheries also believe that, whenever three Directorates-General are to coordinate and direct actions, it ought to be completely clear which Directorate-General is ultimately in control, with responsibility for putting matters into effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it is very fair and very restrained and has turned out to be very balanced, and accordingly it did, of course, also receive the unanimous support of the Committee. I should just like to touch on a few points which are, in my opinion, decisive for the future work of monitoring research in general. In this regard, it seems to me important to listen to what our draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries said, which was that, at the end of the day, it is impossible to carry out a clear inspection in the interests of the taxpayers whom we represent and to monitor efficiency if no clear objectives are defined beforehand. This seems to me to be one of the main criticisms made in the Court of Auditors’ report. Quite simply, this makes it difficult to measure the efficiency of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the hierarchy of staff with powers of authorisation. Here, Commissioner, overlaps which are actually unacceptable have occurred. In Paragraph 59 in the Court of Auditors’ report, this is illustrated relatively clearly. If someone who is entitled to authorise payments and who has allocated 98% of the appropriations available in 1996 is made subordinate to the dossier manager, then this leads to an impossible situation. The Commission’s official reply to this in the file, that there was another Director-General involved, is extremely lame. After all, I do not believe that anyone who has anything to do with financial management and also with financial control would be able to accept an answer of this kind. I hope, Commissioner, that where the reform of the Commission is concerned, to which Mrs Morgan has already referred, we will not only attach importance to reforming the Financial Regulation, but also, and above all, to implementing the existing Financial Regulation in full. The Financial Regulation is very wisely conceived and it provides for everything to be kept wonderfully separate, but in practice they must not be mixed up, and this seems to have been the case here.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, in the near future – and then also with the work of the new Commission in mind – we will have to deal with further Court of Auditors’ reports or audit reports, such as the one on the Joint Research Centre, which has turned out to be very critical, but also the special audit report on a very unusual contract with a consultancy firm. I hope that we will then also see a desire to actually make improvements in the areas mentioned by Mrs Langenhagen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Busquin,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the importance that you have attached to the Court of Auditors’ special report on the FAIR Programme. I would particularly like to thank Mrs Langenhagen for her very constructive report, along with the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and of the Committee on Fisheries and notably the rapporteur, Mr Busk.</p>
<p class="contents">You have underscored, and I would thank you for this, the spirit underlying this report, in your dialogue with the Court of Auditors and the Commission’s services and in the value you attached to it. As you have also said, the FAIR Programme formed part of the Fourth Framework Programme. It had come to an end by the time I took up my duties as Commissioner, but it is the responsibility of the present Commission, and my responsibility as Commissioner, to ensure that the lessons learned from your work are turned to good account and to respond to the Court of Auditors’ recommendations on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The report will play its part in the appraisal of the way the situation is developing and of working practices. I must nevertheless emphasise that no instances of fraud or misappropriation have been detected. It is important to point this out, as these things can sometimes be misinterpreted. It is important to express ourselves clearly vis-à-vis the outside world. As you have emphasised, the FAIR Programme is financed to the tune of 739 million euros. It has given rise to over 3 300 proposals, more than 600 of which have received funding. The FAIR Programme was also swiftly called into action at the start of the ‘mad cow’ crisis and a European action plan on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies was launched in the very same year following a call for proposals. My point is that it has played a beneficial role in addressing a number of issues.</p>
<p class="contents">What were the questions asked, and what improvements have already been made? I would like to highlight some of the latter, which have already been incorporated into the Fifth Framework Programme, in line with the Court’s recommendations. First of all, you should know that responsibility for managing agricultural research has been transferred to the Agriculture DG and the Research DG, following the reorganisation of the Commission’s services, which has resulted in a degree of uniformity in the Agriculture DG’s research procedures. The same may not apply to research in the field of fisheries, but it has been the case with agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, to ensure smooth coordination, a management group has been set up to ensure better coordination between the implementation of research programmes and the relevant Directorates-General with responsibility for other policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission has adopted a common procedure for the evaluation of research proposals applicable to all the specific programmes, which can be consulted by the public in the common manual of evaluation procedures. A common, transparent database of experts has been established to evaluate proposals and special efforts have been made to ensure the independence of experts in respect of the evaluation of proposals. A common research database has been established. The new type of research contract now sets out in detail all the financial and administrative considerations, with more clearly-defined responsibilities for participants and a better-documented negotiation procedure. The Commission has also significantly increased the number of audits conducted, with this number rising by 25% annually over recent years. These are the measures that have been envisaged under the Fifth Framework Programme and which are to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as soon as I took up office, I also took an initiative to set up an informal working party which looked into the issue of simplifying and improving procedures, and I have already had an opportunity to talk about this before the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. This shows that the Commission has not been idle and that it is acting on the comments that you have made. One has to be aware of the way the situation is developing, and remain vigilant, because it is difficult to attain perfection in this matter. This is all the more true given that the report brought to light a number of issues that called for improvements, as you have emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take up on some of these issues, and let you have our opinion on these. With regard to the annual monitoring of research programmes, which provides an independent opinion on the stage reached in, and the quality of, the implementation of our programmes, we have developed several measures aimed at improvement: an analysis of research management practices within the context of national and European Union programmes, with a view to exchanges of good practices and the promotion of mutual learning; the financing of studies aimed at assessing the socio-economic impact of the framework programme and the launching of pilot schemes aimed at evaluating the impact of completed projects, as you have, moreover, just emphasised in speaking of the need to gauge this impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Commission, Parliament is of the opinion that joint responsibility for the implementation of the projects is closely akin to a joint financial responsibility. I would nevertheless like to stress one thing, which is that joint financial responsibility cannot, in a strict sense, be envisaged within the context of the framework programme, the aim of which is to set up consortia composed of various bodies, universities, SMEs, large companies, and public or private research institutes. These entities will not be able to take adequate financial precautions from among their own ranks, and in the case of the SMEs cannot necessarily be held liable for the insolvency of other members of the consortium.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that this consortium approach does not establish a duality in terms of joint financial responsibility. This is a complex matter and one of the issues for which we must clearly find a way of ensuring greater security, but we must avoid this resulting in the exclusion from the framework programme of SMEs and public institutions who are fearful of having to accept responsibilities that they are unable to assume. We thus need not only to strike the right balance in terms of joint financial responsibility but also, furthermore, to avoid scaring off potential<span class="bold"> </span>partners in a consortium, the only participants in which will therefore be established bodies, when what we want is to foster the participation of small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I share your views entirely on the need to minimise the risk of double financing. In this regard, you should know that in connection with point 74 of the White Paper on Reform, the Commission’s services are already in the process of introducing a central register of contracts concluded by the Commission, which will subsequently be linked to all the Commission’s financial information systems.</p>
<p class="contents">You have evidently raised other issues too, including the problem that Mrs Langenhagen referred to in her introduction: the time that has elapsed between the sector letters being sent and the report being debated in Parliament, the length of which can be attributed to the working relations between the Commission and the Court of Auditors. As you have emphasised, all this happened several years ago, but it is clear that lessons must be learned from this exercise. Since that time, measures have been taken regarding the internal organisation of our services in order to speed up, within the limits of the possible, the Court’s sector letter procedure. It is perfectly clear that these dialogues are necessary and there is clearly a joint responsibility here; it is also up to the Court to enter into these dialogues, but I can, in any case, assure you that both the Court and the Commission’s services, along with Parliament, share the same commitment to progress in terms of resolving these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the question that Mrs Morgan asked concerning the recovery of amounts. There are a total of 3.4 million euros outstanding. This may seem a substantial sum, but it in fact only represents 0.3% of total financing under<span class="bold"> </span>the programme. This does not mean, of course, that this sum should not be recovered, and we must strive to do so. I can tell you, in this respect, that the Commission’s services have done everything within their power to recover the amounts in question, but the services responsible embarked on the appropriate legal procedures two years ago. Legal proceedings have now begun concerning two of the three files examined by the Commission’s legal service, since these have been referred to the national courts. The process is therefore under way, but we are now entering the domain of Member State jurisdiction and cannot always dictate how long things will take. I would nevertheless stress that the three files that I have just mentioned represent 92% of the total amount. We have therefore worked very hard to recover the 3.4 million euros, and one could say that we are over 90% of the way there.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the question concerning fisheries, and the person responsible for their control, I have just been given an answer. It has been assigned to the most appropriate level. As far as the Agriculture DG is concerned, the problem has been resolved by transferring the relevant team to the Directorate-General for Research. This has made for a smoother coordination of policies.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the answers to your questions. There are still some new applications to put into practice, and I would like to take this opportunity to outline the guidelines on Community research that we would like to develop for the next framework programme, and which the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has already examined, since I sent a policy paper to this Parliamentary Committee on 4 October, and it is to draw up a report. There are several factors in these broad guidelines that will make for a considerable lightening of bureaucratic burdens: the switch from a project-based approach to a programme-based approach, the setting of minimum sizes for projects, the externalisation of a number of activities, such as exploratory premiums for small and medium-sized enterprises, mobility grants and, in general terms, a simplification of these procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Substantial changes must also be introduced into the next framework programme. We will see what the impact of the modifications made to the fifth Framework Programme has been and I would like to thank you for showing such commitment to improvement. The Commission shares this commitment, and I would like to hope that we can work in the best possible atmosphere to carry through this research programme, which is essential at European level, but which must be implemented in conformity with the most stringent of rules on efficiency and on financial control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
