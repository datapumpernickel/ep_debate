<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ries (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, it is certainly not presumptuous to say today that by 1 p.m. tomorrow we will have adopted the final version of this directive on the ecodesign requirements for Energy-Using Products.</p>
<p class="contents">This will give the European Union a new tool to promote innovation and protect the environment, because applying ecodesign requirements to domestic or construction products is the future. Over 80% of environmental pollution is caused during the manufacturing phase. It is therefore essential to act at the source, where the possibilities for technical improvements are the greatest.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Parliament has been in favour of this Commission proposal from the outset, and there are at least two reasons for this. The first is the very broad scope of application of the framework directive. It covers a wide range of products, that together are responsible for around 40% of CO2 emissions. These range from refrigerators to boilers and include computers, lights, lawnmower engines, and many more. All of the energy sources are covered and all of the sectors included.</p>
<p class="contents">The text’s flexibility is the second reason. It seeks to promote the ecodesign approach within companies by means of voluntary agreements, but also with legislation if this self-regulation is not possible or when it has failed.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore share, Commissioner, a desire to promote ecodesign, with a precise objective in mind: to improve the ecological quality of products without adversely affecting their working quality. There is of course no point in having a quieter washing machine if it consumes twice as much electricity or water, for example. That is why this directive is rightly based on an integrated approach, which consists of assessing the product from the cradle to the grave, because every product has an impact on the environment at some stage in its life cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">This multi-criteria and multi-stage environmental balance sheet must not, however, prevent us, as legislators, from setting ourselves one or more priorities, and that is clearly what we did when we said that energy efficiency was a priority thematic area in the fight against climate change. We are making a vital contribution to the efforts being made to respect the Kyoto target here. Indeed, the Commission puts the reduction that we could achieve by 2010 thanks to this directive at almost 200 million tonnes of CO2.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the agreement that we concluded last Monday after two marathon meetings with the Luxembourg Presidency, obviously in full cooperation with your services. This agreement has two major advantages, the first – not insignificant for the purses of our fellow citizens – being that we will avoid an expensive conciliation. The second, more fundamentally, is the fact that we now have a balanced compromise, which improves the Council’s common position on the essential points. To start with, as far as energy efficiency is concerned, it is provided that, in the next 24 months, even before the first work plan is drawn up, the Commission, after consulting the Consultation Forum, will adopt implementing measures for the categories of products where the potential for CO2 reductions is greatest, and as a priority for the seven categories of products cited in the European Climate Change Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Market surveillance is also a top priority. Since this directive seeks to extend CE marking to Energy-Using Products that comply with ecodesign requirements, it is important to have effective product checks throughout the Union. The agreement now includes a clear definition of the notion of producer as well as a very clear article on the responsibilities of the importer. Furthermore, it provides for checks on all the commercial players in the chain, which have to be able to justify by means of a declaration of conformity that any product sold in Europe meets the ambitious energy efficiency criteria that we want to put in place. Of course all of these measures have just one objective: to sanitise the market and protect consumers. It is now up to the Member States to act quickly and effectively so as to pursue the bad boys and free riders and to defend European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">A very brief comment on comitology: I welcome the fact that the Council has taken up our idea, expressed in Article 14, of setting up a Consultation Forum, whose powers are beefed up by this draft recommendation. This will make it possible for industry and the NGOs to monitor the situation carefully when it proves necessary to put implementing measures in place.</p>
<p class="contents">A further point: information should also be given to consumers and SMEs, two essential links in the economic chain, which have a crucial role to play in distributing these ecological products on the market. Consumers should be informed about the environmental performance of the products, and SMEs should be given financial and technical help to manufacture these more environmentally friendly products.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one final point, Mr Piebalgs, before I conclude. These are very early days as far as integrating the product life-cycle approach into company policy is concerned. We will therefore – and this is our opinion – need more than a Mr Ecodesign in your services if we are to make this project a success, and we have written to you stating this.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude, Madam President, by thanking – I think it is important to do so – the Council and in particular the Luxembourg Presidency. I should also like to thank the Commission for being a very wise arbitrator and all of my shadow rapporteurs, whose collaboration has been very valuable throughout these last 18 months. They have managed to keep Parliament united so that we could reach, or forge, this agreement, which puts the three pillars, the environmental, economic and social pillars, of sustainable development on an equal footing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe this directive will deliver long-lasting benefits to consumers, and to the environment, by lowering our energy consumption and by producing more environmentally-sound products. The eco-design directive will also help EU industry to face worldwide challenges related to the environmental improvement of its products.</p>
<p class="contents">Adding to what Parliament achieved with its first reading, the rapporteur, Mrs Ries, together with her colleagues and shadow rapporteurs, has negotiated a package of compromise amendments that, once accepted by the Council, will reshape the common position on essential issues. I refer in particular to the compromise amendments affecting Articles 12 and 13. These changes will assure a high level of environmental protection when setting eco-design requirements and introduce additional measures in favour of SMEs and to facilitate market surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly satisfied that suitable wording was found to put a focus on the need to improve the energy efficiency of products, while still taking account of the integrated approach promoted by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already made clear that energy efficiency is one of my main priorities. The eco-design framework is one of the most efficient tools we could use to reduce energy consumption and mitigate climate change. Obviously, Parliament wanted to be reassured that once the Commission had its mandate it would make good use of it. The common position amended by the package tabled will leave no ambiguity on that issue: the Commission will have to deliver and report back on its achievements. I can promise you that.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, and on a request from the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs during the most recent negotiations on the compromise package, I can also state that, without prejudice to the outcome of the ratification process of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which I am confident will take place, the Commission will examine the issue of the implementation of Articles 36 and 37 of the Constitution in relation to this framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the European Parliament, through the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs, has achieved a lot and this proposal should be supported by this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My thanks also go to Commissioner Piebalgs.</p>
<p class="contents">We have reached a positive outcome that will allow us to accomplish a great deal for the environment. Following consultations with industry representatives and environmental groups, the Commission has estimated that the directive could reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 180 million tonnes, which is equivalent to 53% of the European Union’s Kyoto target. During negotiations, we pushed for these reductions to be implemented to as great an extent as possible and without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party has always regarded this as an important directive, and we adopted a constructive approach from the very outset. At the same time, however, we tabled three key amendments that were adopted during the negotiations, and this is a source of some satisfaction to me. As a result of the first of these amendments, the directive will apply not only to producers in the European Union, but to all products that reach the European market, no matter where they have been manufactured. The second amendment will make importers subject to tighter checks and ensure that the fight against corruption is stepped up, in both instances to a greater degree than originally planned by the Commission and the Council. Our third amendment will result in the bureaucratic burden on businesses being reduced, with Annex I now being a great deal more business-friendly. This has earned us the thanks of small and medium-sized enterprises, and I have received a written statement from the latter expressing such sentiments.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact remains, however, that we have set ambitious goals for environmental protection, and I am particularly pleased that reducing stand-by losses has been identified as a top priority goal. An enormous amount of energy is being wasted through such losses, and it would be a simple matter to put a stop to them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to the Commission to get down to work without delay and to implement the directive. The Commissioner must also ensure that Commission officials have enough staff to do so promptly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were very conscious of the fact that the House must not allow itself to be intimidated by speeches given by certain Council members, and we were prepared to exercise our codecision rights and take the matter to the Conciliation Committee if it proved impossible to reach agreement beforehand in a civil manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ries has already said that a balanced compromise has been achieved, and we spent the same amount of time negotiating the issue around two weeks ago as we will spend debating it today. Needless to say, I am less than happy with this compromise from the point of view of my group, yet I believe that we have achieved the best that we could. We have obviously had to sacrifice some of our demands for the sake of compromise, but I am delighted that Parliament has made sure that the common position now gives clear priority to energy efficiency, rather than referring to it in very vague terms. In my opinion, this is essential in order for this directive to deliver results.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also delighted that my demands for more consumer information were met. Mrs Ries has already said that it is important to provide consumers with information, for example on how energy can be saved when operating energy-using products, and many more such examples can be found. We are all aware that this directive is an effective instrument in the fight against climate change, yet at the same time we know that rigorous and effective parliamentary checks will be necessary in future, in order to ensure that the instrument upon which we have pinned so much hope will in fact be able to meet the demands we make of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I do still have certain issues with this directive. In my opinion, there is no getting round the fact that the political course we are following in this directive will ultimately and primarily result in bureaucratic barriers to market entry rather than more environmentally friendly products, and in fewer businesses and jobs in the electronic and electrical engineering industries rather than greater environmental protection on the basis of reduced resource consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">We are continuing to rely on product and process management instead of formulating clear criteria that make sense in terms of the end product. What is stopping us from giving technicians and engineers a free hand to come up with creative ideas in the search for the best technological concepts? We will only find the best available technology, whether environment-related or otherwise, if we place no obstacles in the way of competition. The kind of product policy that has been proposed smacks to me of the targets set by the GDR’s planned economy, when decisions were taken at party conferences on how many colour televisions of a particular type would be produced within a certain space of time. Planned economies do not work, as was proven repeatedly during the 20th century, yet the Commission has apparently not yet caught on to this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive before us is not a million miles away from being the kind of instrument one would expect to find in a planned economy, and this is above all due to the ‘top runner’ approach, the preliminary product checks and the environmental audits. I believe one can regard as only a modest success removal, by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, of the provisions in the directive that made it obligatory for environmental audits to be drawn up for the entire life cycle of a product. Differing demands continue to be made of manufacturers and importers, and the resulting problem of market distortions has not yet been resolved either. Although we have made a great deal of progress with this compromise package, the directive is still a bureaucratic nightmare for small businesses. From what I can see, the oft-repeated demand for consideration to be given to the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises is being reduced to an empty phrase. It would be the height of absurdity to add to a legislative text an article stating that small businesses must be given help with its implementation, when that text will, in all likelihood, turn out to be unworkable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Looking at the result, I get the feeling that the Council has got its way on many points. I hope that it will soon come to regret this, for there is a real need for tougher energy-saving measures, in order, for example, to achieve the Kyoto objectives. Yesterday, research in the Netherlands showed that citizens could quite easily save EUR 400 of energy annually, much of which is being used by appliances on stand-by. As the Commission and the manufacturers should give this point the priority it deserves, I would urge the Commission to specify a date by which it will present the first implementing directives to Parliament so that we can get quick results with this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sustainable development and an ecological <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> are a necessary priority for the European Union and are absolutely in keeping with the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the difficulty of addressing such issues, which involve numerous commercial and financial activities, I wish to emphasise the following: the self-regulation procedure is a very positive solution for the faster application of the framework for ecodesign and could also help in improving the market response and in adopting legislation for energy-using products which need to be governed by very strict limits, so that companies are obliged, through creative and realistic procedures, to follow and apply it. The derogations for the benefit of Member States on matters relating to environmental aspects, which differ from one country to another, such as danger limits and environmental conduct, are necessary given the dissimilarities and differences in the individual environmental conditions in each country. Note is made of the need to verify products imported from third countries and identifying them will probably be difficult, as will effective verification. It is vital that we have an absolutely independent body of experts for verifying energy-using products and that it be independent of private economic interests. This body could also safeguard confidentiality for reasons of healthy competition, especially with high-technology products with a short commercial life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has started to symbolise an objective which threatens to slip out of the hands of the Europeans and become a mere illusion. Lisbon does not deserve it, just as Nice does not deserve to be the symbol of a bad compromise. At the moment, however, we have an opportunity to reach towards the strategic objectives of Lisbon. The draft for a directive on energy-using products, now for second reading, is a brilliant example of this opportunity either to promote the achievement of our objectives or to weaken the chances of having them realised.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest worry with respect to energy-using products is the switch of focus of production more and more in the direction of China and elsewhere in Asia. This development, which is unfavourable from the point of view of our industries and environment may even accelerate in the future, due to less demanding environmental and labour protection requirements in Asia. The same trend is very conspicuous in other sectors of our industry, for example in climate policy, where legislative solutions made are leading industry towards less restrictive norms and in this way weakening both the competitiveness of the EU and the state of our environment. It is important that Parliament should approve the report this week which would secure both environmentally-friendly methods of product design and the competitiveness of European business.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise solution now arrived at, and which we are voting on, has been a successful process for the EU institutions, and I have also actively supported the amendments. In this connection I would like to raise the two most important issues. When we talk about competitiveness, it is essential that the legal basis chosen for the directive under discussion is Article 95. The requirements for products must be similar throughout Europe so that energy-using products can move freely within the internal market. Another important decision was made with respect to the conformity verification requirement: it would unnecessarily delay the arrival of products on the market and would be particularly problematic in the electricity and electronic sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that together we have now found a compromise, in which, however, we do not have to make concessions with respect to targets we have set for the next five-year term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
