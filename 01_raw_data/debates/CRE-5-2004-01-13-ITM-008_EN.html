<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the magnitude of the Bam earthquake and the degree of devastation that it caused prompted an appeal from the Iranian authorities for international assistance and a massive international and European response within hours of the disaster occurring. The toll has now risen to 30 000 dead, with a similar number of people injured, 45 000 homeless, and 85% of Bam destroyed. The Commission has been active in providing emergency humanitarian assistance in coordinating the efforts of search-and-rescue teams from EU Member States and from the EEA, candidate and accession countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On Saturday 27 December 2003, the Commission, through its humanitarian aid office ECHO, adopted a primary emergency decision for EUR 2.3 million to address the most urgent needs arising from the earthquake. EUR 1 452 129 were granted to the Red Cross family – the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the Finnish Red Cross and the German Red Cross – to support the relief efforts of the Iranian Red Crescent Society with the provision of food parcels, tents, blankets, heaters, kitchen sets and hygienic kits, and to address health needs through the establishment of a field hospital and basic health units. Another EUR 813 577 were allocated to the <span class="italic">Comité d’Aide Médicale </span>and <span class="italic">Médecins du Monde </span>for health care and related activities, and finally EUR 34 294 were provided to <span class="italic">Télécoms Sans Frontières</span> to set up a satellite-based communication network to facilitate communication and coordination between the relief agencies working in the disaster region.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside the humanitarian aid response, the EU Civil Protection Monitoring and Information Centre, hosted by the Commission, had initiated, after agreement from the Iranian authorities, the dispatch of urgent response teams. Immediately after the earthquake, in the morning of 26 December, the EU Civil Protection Monitoring and Information Centre offered assistance to Iran and distributed an advance warning to its 30 Contact Points in countries participating in the Civil Protection Cooperation Mechanism. On 26 December, the first teams left their respective countries and by 27 December, the EU coordination of the search and rescue efforts, headed by the Italian civil protection unit, was operational in Bam. In total, 18 countries participated in this joint effort with assistance ranging from search and rescue teams – sniffer dogs, firefighters and other specialists – to the provision of relief items – field hospitals and other equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">As the search-and-rescue phase of the emergency response came to an end, the attention shifted to ensuring that the basic humanitarian needs of the survivors of the earthquake are covered in the next few months. On 8 January 2004, both the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs launched appeals to assist in the relief and recovery response in Bam. Following a first assessment mission which took place between 29 and 31 December, ECHO dispatched a second experts’ mission to Bam between 5 and 8 January to review the situation, assess further needs and coordinate with the other agencies present on the ground. As a result of this second assessment, a number of sectors stand out as priority areas for intervention: health; sanitation and hygiene; psychosocial support and tracing; and a focus on vulnerable groups, notably children and the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of its own assessments and of the UN and Red Cross Appeals, the Commission is considering taking a second decision in favour of the victims of the Bam earthquake in the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">By responding as we did, we were able to use the first EUR 2.3 million to cover all the requests that we had at the time and can now consider new requests. It is extremely important that the international community be able to do something that goes beyond the very immediate assistance required in situations such as this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The extent of the devastation and the resulting human suffering have deeply shocked us all. However, one positive thing has come out of this tragedy: the prompt, rapid and comprehensive assistance from all over the world, including the EU, its Member States and even the USA, which Iran accepted. Only the assistance offered by Israel was rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">This House wishes to express its gratitude to the Commission for acting so promptly on 27 December. This shows the Iranian Government, but above all the Iranian people, how much human solidarity there is with them in their present plight, regardless of the political relations with their country. I am convinced that this is also a response to Iran’s signing of the Additional Protocol to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, thus fulfilling the international community’s expectations on this key issue.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, there is still much cause for criticism on our part, especially on the human rights situation, although we welcome the fact that the EU/Iran human rights dialogue has commenced. I myself attended the last meeting in Brussels; it was an open dialogue, not only between the EU delegation and the Iranian side but also within the Iranian delegation itself. However, we in the European Parliament were already voicing our concerns back in autumn about the possibility of a crackdown on reformist parliamentarians in advance of the February elections. Sadly, that is exactly what happened this week: more than 80 parliamentarians and hundreds of candidates were disqualified by the Guardian Council, including the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Mirdamadi, the main interlocutor and host of a European Parliament delegation which visited in Iran, who was here with a delegation last year.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we should make it clear that just as we show human solidarity in response to natural disasters, we must also show political solidarity with the reformist movements in Iran which – within the limited parameters that currently exist there – are pressing for more democracy and freer elections. That is an important point and I assume that the High Representative, Mr Solana, who is currently in Iran, will find the words to make this position clear. I think it would send out the wrong signal if the European Union were to carry on regardless and adopt a business as usual<span class="italic"> </span>approach in this situation. That would be very discouraging for those who want to hold a relatively free election in February, which is just next month. What is needed now is not only solidarity with the victims in Bam but also solidarity with the reformers in Iran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This dreadful tragedy has not only destroyed a region and a city; it has also impacted on an entire country and its people. I am very gratified – and would like to state this very clearly to Commissioner Nielson – that the Commission, but also Europe as a whole, has displayed this solidarity and responded so swiftly and effectively to the tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think, however, that in light of this dreadful disaster, it is especially important for Iran to show that it is united and working towards the future. My group and I myself are very concerned that in advance of the polls, pre-election disqualifications have occurred which prevent voters from making their own choice. The whole point about democracy – and Iran is very proud of its democracy – is that the voters themselves choose who they want to represent them in parliament. I very much hope that there is still an opportunity for Iran to reverse this decision and confirm to the public which candidates will be standing for election. The choice must then be the Iranian people’s. This is neither the time nor the place to get involved in a discussion about reformist versus conservative movements; I just want to make it very clear, on behalf of my group, that the public must decide. I do not think that anyone in Iran should be alarmed about letting the people choose. The Iranian people are intelligent enough to make the decision for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to pay tribute to the fact that Iran – not least in response to the initiative by a number of European foreign ministers – has signed the Additional Protocol at the International Atomic Energy Agency. I do understand the fears in some quarters in Iran and the desire to possess the latest nuclear technology. After all, some countries in the vicinity already have nuclear weapons and have established nuclear technology research programmes. I am thinking particularly of India, Pakistan and Israel. However, the region will not become more secure if even more countries have nuclear weapons. After all, we are in favour of disarmament across the board in all these countries, and I think that Iran is doing the right thing by abandoning its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons and is instead developing a different, more rational and, one could argue, a European concept of security.</p>
<p class="contents">We will certainly be very willing to give our support to Iran in this context. I know that Iran is making very positive and constructive contributions to regional development; I know this is true of Lebanon and it also seems to be the case in Iraq. Naturally, I wish the same could be said of its stance on Israel and Palestine. As someone who is always criticising the Israeli Government, I still take the view that all countries in this region and beyond should make their contribution to peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I would like to conclude by reiterating my group’s solidarity with the Iranian people, but would also request and urge the Council to do more to encourage the development of democracy and human rights to their full capacity in Iran, in that country’s own interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Right in the middle of the Christmas holidays, the TV screens were filled with horrific pictures of dead and injured people and of thousands of people desperately searching for their relatives in a city in ruins. On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I wish to express our condolences to, and deepest sympathy with, the Iranian people at this difficult time. Naturally, the EU should continue its work with the Iranian authorities to help those affected obtain care, roofs over their heads and other necessities. We should also help with the reconstruction of the beautiful historic city.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern for, and solidarity with, the Iranian people also extends to their access to democracy and human rights. The Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very concerned about these areas. There is still a lot to be done, because the Iranian regime is anything but democratic. Serious attacks on women, minorities, opposition members and dissidents are unfortunately part of everyday life.</p>
<p class="contents">We are extremely concerned about the latest development and the Council of Guardians’ involvement in the forthcoming election. By not accepting thousands of candidates throughout the country – more than half of those who have put their names forward – Iran’s Council of Guardians is again showing its unwillingness to reform the Iranian system of government. Classifying the rejects as a bunch of criminals in view of the fact that they have had contacts with, for example, a number of groups disliked by the Council of Guardians rings hollow. On that logic, a quarter of the legislators already sitting would be criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">If Iran wants ever to be counted among the democratic states, it must accept that political legitimacy is obtained from the people in free elections, not through the ayatollahs’ capricious interpretation of the will of God.</p>
<p class="contents">Just like everyone else, the Iranian people wants democracy and human rights. We in the ELDR Group would call upon the Iranian leaders not to interfere in the election but to allow the candidates to stand so that the election is as fair and open as possible. In that connection, I want, like my fellow MEPs, to call upon the Commission to strengthen and develop the human rights dialogue with Iran. It must be something more than just polite chit-chat. If it is to be meaningful, it must be clear, persistent and consistent and also be evaluated on a regular basis. I hope that you, Commissioner Nielson, together with Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana, will be able to act in such a way as to inject new life into these discussions, partly in the light of the work on getting Iran to ratify and implement the Non-Proliferation Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During that visit we met the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mr Kharrazi, and other members of the government and parliament to discuss broader EU-Iranian relations at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Iranian Government and Iranian Parliament have expressed their gratitude to the EU and to the broader international community for the assistance they have been given to help in the reconstruction of Bam and to help the thousands of displaced persons in this region. Basically, the tragedy in Bam was totally horrific, with tens of thousands of people dead and the infrastructure of this very historical city destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">The bottom line with regard to the reconstruction of Iran from an EU perspective is the following: it is going to take months and years to reconstruct the city and help to rebuild the lives of thousands of people which have simply been destroyed by this horrific earthquake. I strongly urge EU governments and the European Commission to make available long-term financial assistance to help the Iranian Government with these difficult regeneration tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has committed over EUR 200 million in recent years to help rebuild Afghanistan, and the European Union must take the decision financially to support the Iranian Government for a number of years so as to ensure that the basic social infrastructural and educational needs are addressed in the reconstruction process of Bam. Short-term financial assistance simply is not enough. Longer-term financial assistance is required, and EU governments must take the political decisions to make these broader financial commitments available to the Iranian Government.</p>
<p class="contents">On a separate matter, I believe that political dialogue should recommence between the European Union and the Iranian Government. We are all aware of the difficulties that the international community has had with the Iranian Government concerning its compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, the Iranian Government has signed protocols to this treaty, measures which we welcome. Negotiations should restart between the Union and the Iranian Government in the context of a trade and cooperation agreement between us, and a structured political dialogue between our respective partners should also be set up.</p>
<p class="contents">In building close relations between the Union and Iran – which has a population of over 70 million people – it is best to build on the basis of dialogue and consultation rather than on the basis of political assumption, political prejudice and political coercion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I totally support paragraphs 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the resolution. It has come as a horrible shock to learn of the decision to prevent people from standing for election. We cannot accept that. I am sure that Ayatollah Khamenei will reverse the decision – as it should be – in favour of those who are trying to bring peace and reform to Iran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will begin by saying that we are astonished, we are shocked and that we want to fight against a majority of those elected to the current Iranian Parliament who were not – so to speak – previously banned and who have implemented a truly terrible policy since 1997, on the pretext of shortcomings due to the excess fundamentalist power of the Ayatollahs. The problem is that this Iran – of candidates and elected representatives who have not been banned – is an Iran that is second only to China in terms of the number of cases of capital punishment. President Khatami’s Iran is an Iran where, according to official data, not only do they continue to stone men and women to death, but where, on 3 February 2003, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi-Shahrudi said to Chris Patten that, at the moment, Iran does not provide for an alternative to stoning to death, and he said this to us!</p>
<p class="contents">Now, if you will allow me, it is of course a terrible outrage in terms of democracy to prevent these candidates, the afore-mentioned reformists<span class="bold">,</span> from being elected, but what concerns me is that, if they are elected, they will continue to live with stonings, unjustified death penalties, hypocritical moderatism. We in Europe are with Khatami, who acknowledges stonings and more, whilst we are shocked, ladies and gentlemen, that in Nigeria – where there is more than a hint of democracy – there was the real risk of just one woman being stoned; and no more have been stoned.</p>
<p class="contents">So, I would merely like to plead with those tabling this resolution to accept a type of oral amendment, inserting figures on death penalties and those executed, welcoming the fact that those condemned have not been executed. I hope that tomorrow we either gather 32 signatures or we accept the oral amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first, the earthquake in Bam, had 40 000 victims. The second, which was of a political nature, disqualifies more than 3 000 candidates from standing in the elections of 20 February. Is it improper to compare these two events, one of which is a natural disaster and the other, quite simply, a politico-religious attack? I do not think so.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bam disaster moved the entire world. The European Union has, for its part, already released humanitarian aid worth EUR 2.3 million and is planning further aid projects. We support these unreservedly, whatever happens, to ease the suffering of the victims and express our solidarity with all of the people of Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">The world is aghast, however, at the decision to ban 3 000 reformist candidates from standing in the next parliamentary elections. Europe, confident in the process of democratisation that had been put in place by the Iranian Government, had made progress in bilateral negotiations and agreements were coming into view. Admittedly, it is not for us to dictate policy to a country or to interfere in its domestic affairs, but we reserve the right to choose our friends, those with whom we wish to collaborate and who have our confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">If a fair solution is not found to the current crisis, one that is accepted by the Iranian people as a whole, it will not have an impact on the humanitarian aid, but it will have a profound and lasting effect on relations between Iran and the European Union. This would be another disaster with incalculable consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Criticisms of EU aid are frequently unfair, and all the reports from Iran suggest that the EUR 2.3 million deployed by the European Union within 72 hours using the primary emergency decision were both well received and well targeted. Despite the gravity of the losses, a thousand lives were saved by more than a thousand international search and rescue teams, and this Parliament should join with the head of the UN team in Bam who has described it as the best disaster response he has seen in 20 years. When we talk about south-south assistance we should at the same time congratulate the Iranian Red Crescent for mobilising more than 8 000 relief workers, and, despite what Robert Kilroy-Silk may say in the UK, Arab countries, who have offered 400 million for the reconstruction of Bam.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not surprising that a humanitarian disaster at Christmas time provoked such a huge public response amongst the peoples of Europe, but it is right in this debate that we draw attention to the neglected emergencies which have not commanded the same media or public attention – in Angola, for example, where the UN appeal has raised only half of the 300 million sought, or Mozambique, where the figure is 12% of just 1.6 million needed, or Zambia, where only 10% of the required amount has been raised. Commissioner, at the very least we need your assurance today that no money to benefit Iran is diverted from these countries, where human lives are just as much at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is right to include in our resolution a message to the Iranians that our international solidarity must be matched by their commitment to international human rights and standards of democracy. The procedure agreed by the Iranian Guardian Council for the screening of election candidates does not meet those standards. Of course, we in Europe do not seek to attach conditions to our help, but we do join with the many Iranians whose lives have been saved in wanting and expecting free and fair elections for their country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For ECHO, in administrative terms, this is not a dramatic or difficult situation to respond to.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken note of the political remarks made during the various speeches. Politically, I agree that there are other disasters. I am also encouraged by what has been said in a number of the contributions here. On balance, the attempt to step up dialogue makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that we continue to keep humanitarian assistance separate from politics. We will be discussing with the Iranian authorities how to secure access for all aid workers, issue visa waivers to the various NGOs working there both now and in the next few months, and ensure normal access for the benefit of victims and others in the country. Those are some of the points we will be raising as part of the process of delivering humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Political dialogue with Iran – the other part of this afternoon's debate – will be pursued and taken up in the various relevant frameworks. I would stress my remark about keeping the issues separate, in order to be consistent, because from time to time we are faced with even more difficult situations where it is even more important to keep to the humanitarian mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the remarks made in the course of the debate. Finally, as Mr Howitt correctly pointed out, this is one case which illustrates the ability we now have – given the changes made in recent years to the way in which the Commission handles administration – to respond very quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
