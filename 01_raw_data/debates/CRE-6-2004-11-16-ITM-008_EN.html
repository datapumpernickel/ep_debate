<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolaï,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the European Security and Defence Policy is on the brink of a historic step. The EU's first military crisis management operation, Operation ALTHEA, will start on 2 December. In the development of the ESDP, we have made great progress from concepts and capabilities to concrete actions. Like the first EU police mission, the first military operation will take place in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="contents">The preparations for the deployment of Operation ALTHEA after SFOR leaves Bosnia and Herzegovina are well advanced. An operational concept has been approved, force generation has taken place, and 11 third countries have been invited to contribute to the operation. A committee of contributors has had its first meeting and the operations plan has been approved by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Operation ALTHEA will be an EU-led operation, with the use of NATO assets and capabilities. Therefore, the Deputy SACEUR was appointed operation commander in early July. The operation's HQ has been established in Mons. In early October the force headquarters in Sarajevo reached initial operational capability with a view to reaching full operational capability by early December, when authority is transferred from SFOR.</p>
<p class="contents">People might consider the transfer of the operation from SFOR to the EU a big and risky step. They might have doubts about the capabilities of the EU mission. However they are wrong, if only because 80% of the SFOR forces have transferred to ALTHEA, while the departing 20%, which are US forces, will be replaced by additional European forces. All the EU Member States currently contributing to SFOR will continue their contributions in ALTHEA. However, ALTHEA is not just an EU operation. Third countries like Morocco, Bulgaria, Romania, Norway and Turkey will participate as well. I am very pleased about their participation, because it shows that it is not just the EU that cares about Bosnia and Herzegovina. As members of the committee of contributors, these countries will have the same rights and obligations as the EU Member States taking part in the operation in terms of its day-to-day management.</p>
<p class="contents">No effort has been spared in ensuring a smooth transition from NATO to the EU and that includes the delineation of tasks between ALTHEA and the remaining NATO headquarters in Sarajevo, arrangements on the availability and use of reserve forces and on the sharing of intelligence. The EURFOR commanding officer and the commander of the remaining NATO headquarters will be based at the same camp, ensuring operational coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">NATO itself also remains present in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We therefore have a NATO strategic reserve for support in emergencies. This can be used for both NATO and Operation ALTHEA. This is a good example of the pragmatic and efficient use of limited resources. It also emphasises the good cooperation between the EU and NATO. With the transition from NATO to the EU, the last phase of military presence will start. The accent will no longer be on the prevention of inter-ethnic fighting but on assisting civil and military reforms. After that, a military presence can be withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">With ALTHEA, we are contributing to the security and stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is important to the reforms in that country. At the same time, operation ALTHEA is – dare I say – the final element in a comprehensive European Union policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is also part of our broader strategy for the Balkans. The combined activities in the political, economic development and security fields mutually reinforce each other. The situation in the country has a direct impact on the region and on the EU. We therefore have a clear interest in its stability and prosperous development. EU involvement is not only in its interests but also in our own and, given our comprehensive and coherent approach, it is only logical that the EU has taken over the NATO operation.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate objective is to put Bosnia on track towards the EU and this will be achieved through the strengthened stabilisation and association process. The EU military mission, together with other EU activities such as the EU police mission, the EU monitoring mission and the CARDS development programme, will complement that process</p>
<p class="contents">A comprehensive approach reflects our belief that the future of Bosnia lies firmly in Europe. It exemplifies our long-term commitment. It is now up to the Bosnian people to make the vision come true. They will eventually have to decide whether to join the European political and economic union. Such a choice requires fundamental reforms of state, economic and judicial structures. Equally, they will have to confirm the decision to join the European community of values. Such a decision requires an environment of tolerance, dialogue, respect for religious freedoms and a tough stance in words and deeds against the impunity of war criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">The right political will and popular support by the Bosnians, combined with our comprehensive role, could and should lead Bosnia away from conflict into a stable and peaceful future, a future in which our special representative Lord Ashdown will play an ever more important role.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that Bosnia and Herzegovina is on the right track. Stability and security are increasing and, with its integration into Euro-Atlantic structures, the country is moving more and more from the area of Dayton to the area of Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">However, much remains to be done, because we are still concerned about the lack of cooperation with ICTY, particularly in the case of the Republika Srpska. ICTY cooperation is an important criterion for closer relations with the EU and NATO. Here Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to deliver. I hope the reforms of the defence and police apparatus, one of the key tasks of ALTHEA, will also bear fruit in that field. In that way operation ALTHEA will bring even more benefit to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina in their quest for a durable and just peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> I am extremely glad to have this opportunity to say a few words about Bosnia and Herzegovina, just two weeks before the handover to EUFOR on 2 December. The launching of the ALTHEA mission is an important event: important because it will be the first significant military operation undertaken under the European Security and Defence Policy. The transfer from NATO has required long and detailed discussions because it was crucial to get things right from the very start. My colleagues Mr Solana and Mr de Hoop Scheffer deserve a great deal of credit for securing a successful outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I know some will be concerned that a brand new military mission in Bosnia sends a signal that the country continues to suffer from significant instability. That would, in my judgement, be an entirely wrong conclusion to draw. Last Spring the North Atlantic Council Ministerial Meeting noted an 'improved security environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina'. As a result they decided to reduce the number of troops committed to SFOR from 12 000 to 7 000. I have been visiting Bosnia for several years and I can personally attest to the transformation which has come over the country during that period.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be the height of folly to take for granted the undoubted improvements which have occurred. All that is happening is that Europe is taking on more direct responsibility for its own continent – not before time, some might say. However, there will be a review of the operation every six months. This will take account of its duration, as well as its size and configuration. There is no question of keeping troops in Bosnia unnecessarily; as soon as conditions permit, the number of troops can be reduced and eventually the mission will come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important at this time to recognise that Bosnia’s European future will assume growing importance as the military presence continues to reduce in size. Bosnia, like all the countries of the Western Balkans, has a clear European perspective as a potential candidate country. Last November the Commission published a feasibility study setting out 16 points on which the country needed to make significant progress before a recommendation could be made to the European Council to start negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement. Although there has been progress since then, I am disappointed to end my mandate as Commissioner without being able to give Bosnia the green light. I very much hope that my successor, Commissioner Rehn, will be able to do so early in his new mandate. Once he did so, the Council would have to accept his assessment and a negotiating mandate would then have to be agreed. Only then could negotiations start. There is no reason why they could not do so some time during 2005. If Bosnia is to make progress on this timescale, a number of things are required.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the authorities have to make further progress on the legislation associated with the 16 points. Much has been done here, but there are continuing blockages in areas like VAT and public broadcasting.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, Bosnia has to recognise that passing laws has little utility if they are not implemented properly. There is still a great deal of work to be done here.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the Commission indicated in the feasibility study that it would expect proper cooperation with the High Representative in his reform agenda, as provided for in the Dayton Paris Peace Accords. One crucial area here is the question of police reform. I very much hope that, by the end of the year, Mr Wilfried Martens will be able to report agreement on the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the question of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia Herzegovina is a member of the United Nations and a signatory to Dayton. As I have made clear on a number of occasions, there can be no dilution of the absolute requirement for full cooperation with the Tribunal. This is fundamental to Bosnia’s prospects for further movement through the stabilisation and association process. It is a crucial test of Bosnia’s commitment to its international obligations and to the rule of law. It is also a fundamental part of the process of allowing the victims of the atrocities to let go of the past. Allowing those accused of terrible human rights abuses to remain free makes it impossible for the communities to be properly reconciled. Next week the Chief Prosecutor, Mrs Carla del Ponte, will be reporting to the United Nations Security Council on the cooperation of the countries of the Western Balkans with the Tribunal. Up until now, she has been quite clear that Republika Srpska has not been cooperating at all. It is indeed a disgraceful matter that not one indictee has been transferred by the Republika Srpska to The Hague, although there are reports today that some war crime suspects have been arrested by Republika Srpska for trial locally. This is welcome news, but Republika Srpska will be judged by the international community on its cooperation with the Tribunal on cases which fall under its jurisdiction. It is on that issue that Mrs del Ponte will be reporting to the Security Council. I have no reason to expect that her report will be positive on Republika Srpska. If that is indeed the case, Lord Ashdown will have to consider his response. Certainly, it is intolerable that the prospects for the whole country to make progress towards joining the European Union and NATO are being compromised in this way. I urge the political leadership of Republika Srpska to take action now to fulfil their obligations. If they do not, they will be responsible for any consequences which flow from their failure.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, the people of Bosnia Herzegovina suffered the most from the Balkan wars in the 1990s. Now they have emerged from that terrible period and have a clear chance of creating a real country with a genuine prospect of joining our European family. As I leave the Commission, I wish them every success and I look forward to hearing of their progress in the months to come.</p>

<p class="contents">What are we in this House now to do? Our task is to exercise democratic control, although, at this stage, I would prefer to speak of parliamentary guidance. There are, however, certain questions we must ask. Is the leadership structure the right one, and is it capable of doing the job? Will it stand the strain even in times of crisis? What about the equipment and weapons of the soldiers who are being sent there – are they mutually compatible? Do they meet the requirements?</p>
<p class="contents">It will also be very important to see how cooperation with NATO works in the aftermath of the ‘Berlin Plus’ negotiations, and particularly – in what is a speciality of the European Union and its security strategy – how well the civilian and military sides of this crisis management operation work together.</p>
<p class="contents">We also regard the issue of how this operation is funded as most especially important. Time and again, we have cause for concern about the emergence of shadow budgets capable of being monitored neither by the 25 national parliaments nor by the European Parliament. It is for that reason that the resolution we will be adopting includes the demand that the expenses incurred in this operation should – insofar as this is possible at this stage in the Constitution’s development – be borne by the European Budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite his sombre view of the stabilisation and association agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina, I do think that it is essentially a good thing that the European Union, after all these years, has achieved its ambition of mounting a major operation, and, remarkably enough, doing so in the former Yugoslavia. Following the Dayton accords in 1995, it was NATO that assumed responsibility as the stabilising power in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Now that the European Union’s Common Security and Defence Policy is taking shape, it is a logical progression that the European Union should take upon itself responsibility for stability in the heart of its own continent. So it augurs well that the European Union should, at the end of this year, be replacing NATO as the stabilising power in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ALTHEA is an important test of the European Union’s ambitions in the defence field. With an initial 7 000 troops, the operation is manifestly bigger than the European Union’s previous operations, such as Concordia in Macedonia and Artemis in the Congo. In operational terms, the mission is a continuation of SFOR. ALTHEA has the same solid mandate, which, as we see it, is the best possible guarantee of our soldiers’ safety. NATO’s experience in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be drawn on, but political responsibility lies with the European Union, so that it can demonstrate its ability to play a generally external role on a larger scale than before.</p>
<p class="contents">In my experience, people in Bosnia take a generally favourable view of this mission. Everyone I spoke to on my recent visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomed greater involvement by the European Union. At the same time, there are still tensions between the country’s various constituent parts, to which reference has just been made. While the Bosnian Croat federation is clearly drawing closer to Europe on its way to EU membership, Republika Srpska is still unwilling to cooperate with the tribunal in The Hague. The operation must help to further stabilise the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ALTHEA must, as best it can, help to build up the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the rule of law, police and the army and stable democratic structures, enabling the country to be integrated into European structures. The ultimate objective must be that Bosnia-Herzegovina becomes capable of standing on its own feet as a complete and integral state – and that, I believe, must be the European Union’s ambition.</p>
<p class="contents">No date has as yet been given for the EU’s mission to end, but it cannot be the intention that a military force should simply remain in place until such time as Bosnia is ready to join the European Union. For the time being, there is no realistic timeframe for this, but accession to the EU is, so to speak, a civil rather than a military operation. Only a functioning state, capable of guaranteeing its own security, can credibly apply for membership of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is that normalisation is the objective, and hence it is also necessary that the European Council, having resolved upon this mission, should also, and as soon as possible, devise some kind of exit strategy which might well be connected with the stabilisation and association process. Such an exit strategy will also require the EU to step up its involvement in developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Only if we are working towards withdrawal can ALTHEA make any substantial contributions towards achieving the ultimate objective, that being to prepare Bosnia and Herzegovina for stability as part of the European structure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The forthcoming operation will do much to bring Bosnia and Herzegovina closer to the European Union and will strengthen the Union’s role in the Western Balkans. The proposal before us is an excellent one, and Mr Wiersma has done a magnificent job. As shadow rapporteur on ALTHEA, I made some observations with regard to the basic proposal, and I am pleased that they were taken into consideration when the proposal was being drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that action is taken in Bosnia and Herzegovina to combat organised crime and trafficking in women. I wish to emphasise how important it is to ensure that there is a more balanced representation of ethnic groups when police forces are being assembled. This will increase confidence of all groups in the region and their commitment to maintaining order.</p>
<p class="contents">War criminals at liberty must be caught. The Dayton Agreement must be implemented. This is a matter of credibility, and is a task for NATO staff. This will be the first major EU-led military operation and we need to monitor its progress very closely. It will be important to attend to its operational aspects and consider clearly how responsibilities are to be divided.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must ensure that ALTHEA troops respect human rights in all their aspects. The EU is committed to respecting human rights, and that must be conspicuous in all action associated with the ALTHEA mission, whether it concerns the treatment of prisoners or those being detained, or any action. A parliamentary delegation will inspect the work of the ALTHEA mission next year, and, in addition to all its other responsibilities, it should also be given the opportunity to make an evaluation of respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it should turn out to be the case that this is the keystone to which you, Mr Nicolaï, referred, I would like us to take another step forward, politically speaking, by expressly calling on the Bosnian Government to invite us to undertake this mission.</p>
<p class="contents">We have every basis in law for doing this, provided by SFOR, that is, by the military intervention that made this advance, this stabilisation, possible after ten years. As we talk about how we see Bosnia’s future prospects in Europe, should we not strive to achieve what we achieved in Macedonia, with the Government asking us to be present in this window of transition? I believe that would be a triumph. Having concluded what is known as a SOFA – a status of forces agreement – with other states that have asked us for help, why should we not conclude one with Bosnia and Herzegovina too?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need these regular reports, and I hope that we will, tomorrow, make that a binding requirement. This House is committed, for we have all been committed for years. We are talking not only in terms of military intervention. Next year will see the tenth anniversary of the attack on Srebrenica, and the anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords, and I believe we are obliged to make this clear. I hope that we will do as Commissioner Patten wishes and give close attention to Bosnia’s future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to bring stability to what a German publication eloquently called the ‘restless Balkans’, help was needed from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. The bottom line is that NATO is not there for nothing. I am still to some degree reassured by the fact that NATO is still there, and still, too, involved in the European ALTHEA mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The fact is that this whole operation, which we call ‘European’, is founded upon trans-Atlantic cooperation on the basis of the ‘Berlin Plus’ accord between the European Union and NATO. What brings me to this conclusion is the letter of 9 November from the Dutch Presidency to the parliament of the Netherlands. If anything, the ALTHEA mission is something for Europe to be modest about. Moreover, I am convinced that it also puts another big question mark against the idea that a European security and defence policy is useful and necessary. Such an ambition for power can only eventually weaken or undermine NATO, and then, Mr Nicolaï, to use a Dutch expression, all of us in Europe are far from home. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a first for the Union; apart from the symbolic fact that it will allow the 7 000 soldiers already serving under the aegis of NATO now to wear the 12-star symbol on the sleeves of their uniforms, the mission does, in any event, mean a greater European presence and hence greater visibility for the Union in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">In the nineties, when bloody ethnic conflicts broke out one after the other in the region, people used to wonder where Europe was, and it was distressing that we were so absent. Today, however, we are witnessing a presence and attention on the part of our institutions that befits the circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The 7 000 soldiers will arrive in Bosnia in a strong position, and their strength derives not so much from their weapons as from their expertise, their humanity, and their willingness towards the local population. The people are mindful of the need for a military presence on their territory in this delicate phase of stabilising their country, and are therefore ready to welcome them warmly. These soldiers are not arriving alone in unknown territory. With them in Bosnia there are the institutions, the Commission, the High Representative of the Union, who for two and a half years has been working as a truly enlightened governor in Bosnia, in a far-from-easy attempt to ensure the establishment of the rule of law within a renewed framework of peaceful co-existence between the three major ethnic groups in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, through its delegation led by its indefatigable chairman, Mrs Pack, closely follows events in Bosnia, as shown, among other things, by the recent visit to that country. This visit brought home to members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Parliament the principles and routes through which they could have a closer relationship with the European Union. Today the perspective is that of a stabilisation and association agreement and tomorrow, at a time we cannot yet foresee, the prospect of future accession.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not allow ourselves to be deceived by all this, however. Important steps have been taken in Bosnia on the path to stabilisation. The desire for normalisation is palpable in many areas of the country and the wish to forget the past and to think of the future is shared by all its inhabitants. Of the sixteen points set out in the feasibility study, many have already been translated into law.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fitting and heartening to note this, but there is still much to do. The military peacekeeping mission under the aegis of the Union from 2 December is there for this purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have dedicated yourself in particular to the Western Balkans, where I would have preferred there to have been no need, ten years on from the wars in the Balkans, for the EU to mount further military backup operations. As Mr Solana once said, though many years ago, this is a front with which we will have to deal for some time to come, and it is in Europe, on our own doorstep. It is closer to us than other crisis regions, whether Sudan or the Côte d’Ivoire, regrettable though all of them are, and notwithstanding our responsibilities for all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">ALTHEA, though, is more than these; it is a test case for the EU’s visible role in Bosnia and Herzegovina, now that it is, for the first time, taking over duties from NATO. The mission is part of a coordinated and coherent approach including also the Stabilisation and Association Process, which will, I hope, make further progress in view of the disconcerting fact that 16 points are still outstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Bosnia and Herzegovina needs the European perspective, which ALTHEA is meant to help secure for them, what is essential is that there should be a clear line of command avoiding needless duplication between NATO and ALTHEA and making it as clear as possible who is giving orders to whom. Cooperation between ALTHEA and NATO is therefore also being put to the test. It is regrettable that financial provision is being made outside the normal EU Budget, and so the European Parliament is not as involved as it should be. All these things considered, I welcome the report and assure you that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not that long ago, the headlines were full of expulsions, murder and ethnic cleansing in the Western Balkans, in the heart of Europe, while the EU, as if paralysed, was incapable of taking any effective action to prevent these things. Painful the memory of Srebrenica, Mostar or of Banja Luka may be, but it is right to remember them; the former military presence under NATO command may have brought Bosnia and Herzegovina a certain stability, but we need to be aware of how fragile that stability is.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good thing that with this, its first major joint military mission with an extended mandate, the EU is taking on far greater responsibility in this part of Europe, and aiming in the long term to ensure that Bosnia and Herzegovina can be stable, at peace, multi-ethnic, and capable of cooperating at regional and international level. It will be a further touchstone for Europe, and also for the decisions in this area that will very probably have to be taken next year and will also affect Kosovo.</p>

The first is that, as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo), I am delighted that the military mission – which is still necessary – is now in European hands and backing up the EU’s great financial and civilian commitment under the leadership of Commissioner Patten.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that this changeover from SFOR to EUFOR is being welcomed in Bosnia and Herzegovina too. It does indeed highlight how closely intertwined are Bosnia and Herzegovina’s destiny and our own. The success of our mission – political, economic and military – is the litmus test for our foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, EUFOR’s tasks should be clearly set out. It should not involve itself unnecessarily in states’ prosecution of their own criminals. In these countries, the police and the justice systems have now become capable of pursuing ordinary criminals and imprisoning them. Apprehending war criminals such as Mladic and Karadzic should also still be a matter for the remaining NATO contingent, and, in particular, for the Serbs of Republika Srpska. Even though neither has so far demonstrated any enthusiasm for doing this, and Republika Srpska has even obstructed it, EUFOR should have other tasks to perform.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, how will cooperation between the police mission and EUFOR be organised?</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point has to do with an issue that has started to worry me in recent years, and that is whether the EUFOR troops have been advised about the problems with trafficking in women and forced prostitution. Is there an ethical context, and where, when and by whom are offences to be punished? Bosnia-Herzegovina is not just a transit country, but also – not least because of the international presence – a destination.</p>
<p class="contents">The sixth thing I want to say is that EUFOR is the right name. Why, then, call it ALTHEA, after a mythological woman associated with blood, retaliation and vengeance, and who ends up taking her own life? What did the person who thought up this name have in mind? They could have done with a bit of sensitivity. One might have expected something else in an area where we are working to counteract revenge and the settling of scores. Moreover, EUFOR is the name by which the mission is already being welcomed on great big posters in Sarajevo, so let us leave it at that and chuck ALTHEA out with the junk where it belongs! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As they were remarks rather than questions, I think I can be brief.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the Members who spoke agreed on the fact that the step we want to take in Bosnia and Herzegovina is an important step for the security and defence policy of the European Union. We also agree on the fact that it is important for them and also for the European Union because of the European perspective on Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mr von Wogau, Mr Wiersma and others were very clear on that.</p>
<p class="contents">There were questions, especially from Mr von Wogau, about the command structure. I shall explain. We have the Deputy SACEUR as commander of operations. He is supported by an EU operation which has its headquarters located within those of NATO in Mons, as I mentioned before. Under the Deputy SACEUR we have an EU command element in Naples where the regional NATO headquarters is located. This is in charge of the regional Balkans operation.</p>
<p class="contents">The field commander falls directly under this command element and hence there is a very thorough military structure. As with all European Union operations, the Political and Security Committee has political control and provides strategic direction. As regards armaments, as I said before it is the same people with the same equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mrs Poli Bortone and others that progress has been made but a lot remains to be done. In addition to the ICTY cooperation I have already mentioned and the internal reforms, I hope indeed Bosnia and Herzegovina will also become more active in regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia has made considerable progress and could be an example in a number of fields – except perhaps with regard to ICTY, as we will hear from the Chief Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, on 23 November.</p>
<p class="contents">I end with a short but important remark. On behalf of the presidency I would very much like to thank Commissioner Patten for the important role he played in the Balkans. As he said, we are all looking forward to the new Commission and the new Commissioner, on which this Parliament will decide on Thursday. Nevertheless we will miss Commissioner Patten.</p>

I asked you in what way soldiers have been prepared for this difficult task, particularly with regard to trafficking in women and forced prostitution, and I asked you how and where soldiers are sentenced or called to account, should the need arise. Secondly, I asked you whether you are considering phasing out the name ALTHEA, which is a terrible word and has caused problems in the region. These were two important questions, and I should like to receive an answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
