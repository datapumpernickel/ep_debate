<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the challenge to the Commission in drawing up the draft preliminary budget for 2002 was to provide financial cover for next year's long-term obligations, provide financial cover for next year's new and special priorities and cover the financial risks to the budget as the result of the BSE crisis and the foot-and-mouth crisis all within the framework of financial planning, i.e. while exercising budgetary prudence.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we have succeeded in this in the preliminary draft which the Commission adopted on 8 May. I should like to make a few brief comments on the basic figures in this preliminary draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The preliminary draft budget totals around EUR 100.3 billion, i.e. we have crossed the EUR 100 billion mark for the first time. This represents an increase of 3.5% in commitment appropriations compared with this year's budget and an increase of 4.8% in payments or, in absolute terms, EUR 97.8 billion. As far as commitment appropriations are concerned, we still have a EUR 500 million margin in comparison with the contributions set out in the financial perspectives and, as far as payment appropriations are concerned, we are EUR 2.5 billion below the ceiling. I think that these figures alone prove that the budgetary discipline decided by the Commission is geared to the principle of budgetary prudence.</p>
<p class="contents">The average increase in the plans announced by the Member States for the next budgetary year is around 3.8%. Even if we compare the EU budget to the Member States' budgets, we can demonstrate that we too are within these limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Expressed as a percentage of European GNP, the Commission's proposed budget represents 1.06%, i.e. it is below what we debated for the current budgetary year about a year ago. This is due mainly to the fact that growth rates in the European Union are relatively high and satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment briefly on the individual areas, starting with what is still the biggest individual area, namely agricultural policy, although I shall not go into the olive oil sector in detail now, because we have already covered that. The Commission proposal makes provision for an overall increase of 5% in the agricultural budget, a big jump which naturally requires explanation. The explanation is that this is the third year in which the reforms decided under Agenda 2000 need to be funded. These reforms entailed an increase in expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that the Commission proposes – and I am certain that we have Parliament's support here – to include in the budget the full estimate for heading 1B, rural development, as proposed in the financial perspectives. However, the most important and the hardest task of all was to deal with the unknown quantities caused by the BSE crisis and the foot-and-mouth crisis. The Commission proposal makes provision for an additional EUR 1.145 billion to deal with the BSE crisis in the organisation of the market in beef and veal for 2002. This is the amount needed in order to fund the seven-point plan proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We also propose EUR 250 million under veterinary measures in the budget 2002 in order to deal with the foot-and-mouth crisis, although I should point out that this sum will not be enough. Obviously, I need to explain this. Hopefully we shall be able, when the time comes, to fund some of the refunds to the Member States for the foot-and-mouth crisis this year, i.e. out of the budget 2001. It is important that the Commission's preliminary draft budget makes provision for a reserve of EUR 1 billion for 2002, which is earmarked for any further measures needed to deal with the BSE crisis and the foot-and-mouth crisis. We really must cover the risks properly here. That gives a below-the-line margin of EUR 365 million in the agricultural budget.</p>
<p class="contents">A brief word on Structural Fund resources: the estimates proposed for the Structural Funds run to a total of EUR 33.6 billion. That is a very large sum, but that is what was decided by the budgetary authority in the new financial perspectives. I also quote this figure so as to indicate once again that this is the most important instrument, the most important instrument financially for combating unemployment. It is the European Union's contribution to regional policy, one very basic objective of which is to combat unemployment. This contribution is often taken for granted by the Member States and no longer seen for what it is, i.e. the European Union's contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Commitment appropriations have been increased by a total of 4.1% for internal policies. This undercuts the ceilings decided in Berlin and in the Interinstitutional Agreement, leaving a margin of EUR 68 million. Briefly, the most important points in this category are: over EUR 4 billion for research and development and EUR 112 million for information and communications and various information campaigns. Funds have been earmarked for the new food authority and the two new air safety and maritime safety agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">For justice and home affairs – which as one of the priorities decided by Parliament in the guidelines for the budget 2002 also deserves comment – a total of EUR 81 million has been estimated for a variety of measures, especially for the European refugee fund, measures to combat violence against women and children and immigration policy measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Provision has been made to reduce budget resources for external policies because the Commission does not propose using the flexibility instrument in this area again next year. Nonetheless, funding for policy in the Balkans can be kept at almost the same level as this year. The very large sum of EUR 863 million has also been earmarked for the MEDA programme. I should point out once again here that we have taken pains to propose a very large increase in payment appropriations for this programme, in order to respond to justified criticism that a lot of promises were made in the foreign affairs area but that implementation is sometimes only very patchy, i.e. the programmes are not implemented. The Commission's proposal – I am addressing this now because it was addressed in discussions yesterday with the Committee on Budgets – would mean that the backlog in heading 4 on foreign policies would fall from 3.3 years to 2.8 years. To put it more clearly, if you calculate how many years are needed to clear the backlog of current payment obligations, it was 3.3 years at the end of 2000. I think that, if we can reduce this to 2.8 years, that is already something. But I must stress that this calls for appropriate administrative effort and also assumes that the means of payment will be available to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like briefly to mention one point which I also addressed yesterday, namely the problem which has arisen because the fisheries agreement with Morocco has fallen through. We now have to think what needs to be done in order to restructure the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets affected by the fact that the agreement has fallen through.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget contains an estimated EUR 3.3 billion in pre-accession aid, in line with the financial perspectives. The same applies here as to other external policies, i.e. provision has been made for a substantial increase in the means of payment so that the programmes really can be implemented on the ground. This should ensure that pre-accession aid is taken up to a greater extent in order to carry out the reforms needed with a view to enlarging the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Commission proposal, administrative expenditure will account for 1.5% of next year's overall budget. The Commission will be asking the budgetary authority to approve the second tranche of the additional posts needed for Commission work out of the 317 posts for the Commission. The Commission has also tabled proposals in its budget which are important for the purpose of enlargement, such as posts for codifying legal texts.</p>
<p class="contents">I am anticipating the debate on the Buitenweg report. You in turn stress how important it is for the purpose of enlargement to debate heading 5 straight away. Initial measures will be needed next year. We must also keep an eye on what is in store under heading 5 as the result of enlargement. I would stress here once again that the overall margin in heading 5 is tiny. Taking the proposals already made by the other institutions, the Council and Parliament alike, I have to concede that this will probably mean that the ceiling on heading 5 will be exceeded. This indicates the need for good cooperation in this area if we are to remain below the ceiling.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, I think that consultations on the budget 2002 will be no easy task, in other words, good cooperation will be needed. I can say quite clearly that, I for my part look forward to working with you on the budget 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Böge (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the chairman of the Committee on Budgets</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we acknowledge the Commission's preliminary draft budget and, as always, shall check very closely to ensure that sufficient account has been taken of the priorities set in advance by the European Parliament. By that I mean both new and traditional priorities. No doubt the rapporteur, Costa Neves, will have something to say about this now. We shall have to check that the Union's revenue is going to be used efficiently and for its intended purpose within the framework of our budgetary law, the financial regulation and the commitments entered into. And we shall have to look very closely to ensure that due account has been taken of the reforms announced, only some of which have just begun. Obviously, we too want a speedy and fair budgetary procedure without too much arm wrestling. The Council needs to heed that more than in previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to add the following in the wake of the discussions and votes in the Committee on Budgets this year: we shall oppose any suggestion which tries to trim or limit the budgetary powers of the European Parliament in any way, such as by amending the financial regulation or in some other wondrous manner. I also advise the Commission to take a constructive position which favours Parliament here on all these questions. That will be a help to all of us who so keenly refer to ourselves as allies in the European integration process.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is we have commitments of EUR 100 billion, payments of 97.8 billion, payments well below the ceiling or 1.06% of GNP or, to put it another way, EUR 265 per capita of the population, of which EUR 121 per capita is for agricultural for agricultural produce, policy and the countryside. That sounds solid enough. Taken overall, it is geared towards stability and certainly does not overburden the Member States, the taxpayers or consumers, as many official but emotional and one-sided accounts would have us believe. At the same time, however, it is the penultimate budget of the Union of the Fifteen. We need to bear that in mind at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to list a few points which will be important to us. It is good that the Commission intends to do more about clearing the backlog of payments. Commissioner Schreyer has just quoted a few figures here. But we also need a guarantee that payments for new commitments will be dealt with speedily so as to avoid another mountain of backlogs in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome thoughts of setting up an earmarked reserve in the agricultural area. The idea of creating a contingency reserve, given the imponderable nature of these markets, was originally Parliament's. I would add that the ad hoc procedure has proven to be an increasingly constructive procedure between the institutions over recent years. The actual figures will be available in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that the Commission has left room for manoeuvre in internal policy. Nonetheless, the reasons behind certain estimates require clarification. For example, –5.3% for culture and the audiovisual sector, below average rates of +1.8% in the area of social dimension and employment and –14.5% in the area of the labour market and technological innovation. These are examples of where there is a real need for consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">In foreign policy – which was addressed earlier – the question arises of how democratic control and discussion of operational expenditure under the common foreign and security policy will take place in future. Then there is the fact that Asia is down 2.2%, Latin America is down 6% and food aid is down 4.5%. The question is, has the necessary balance between traditional priorities and new tasks been duly safeguarded or might this positioning be construed as concentrating on Europe and its neighbours. That would be too little for me from a foreign policy point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I should like to address one final point: administration. I should like to remind you that Parliament stipulated that the second tranche of 317 posts was linked to the early retirement commitment, so as to bring about a bit more budgetary neutrality, and it is up to the institutions to achieve this. I remember the resolution passed in spring last year, in which we clearly stated that the second tranche was linked to very clear, precise considerations as to how measures to guarantee the ability of the European Union to act during the course of the enlargement process could be prepared while retaining the substance of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. I should like to remind you of this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, therefore, we shall all be called on to discuss the introduction of and introduce a realistic pre-accession and accession strategy as of this year, including in the administrative area, so that we have sufficient time left over to include this aspect in the budgetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I get the impression from all the discussions that resolving these questions will be more difficult and more complicated that resolving many agricultural and structural problems, which is why we intend to tackle these and other questions during the budgetary procedure.</p>

I must say that it did provide us with the information we needed. This is a further contribution to a positive climate for the debate on the proposed budget for 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">My initial reaction to the preliminary draft budget is that, overall, I welcome the proposal to increase appropriations for commitment by 3.4% and for payment by 4.8%. The difference between these figures seems insufficient, given the need to make good payments that are overdue. I would point out that one of the European Parliament’s priorities is precisely to eliminate quickly the difference between commitments given and payments that have actually been guaranteed. To confirm our fears, the reduction of unpaid commitments (RAL), will be in appearance only. The truth is that, if the increase in appropriations is insufficient, paying the commitments that have been outstanding the longest will delay the payment of new commitments. This would be the equivalent of rehashing the RAL and would not solve the problem. The solution lies in paying off old RAL, specifically in categories 3 (internal policy) and 4 (external action), not in creating further RAL. With regard to this matter, we shall carefully analyse the progress report that is to be presented to us at the end of June, as was agreed, and we will continue to do everything we can to improve the budget’s implementation rates. In other words, we want to contribute to a more effective discharge of the European Union’s commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted the fact that, despite the 4.8% increase proposed for payments, these will remain at a level of 1.06% of the European Union’s GDP, whereas the financial perspective would allow the figure to reach 1.10% in 2002. I must also stress that we shall be undertaking a thorough assessment of the Commission’s commitment to the priorities defined by Parliament which feature in the broad economic guidelines adopted in April.</p>
<p class="contents">In the agricultural sector in particular – category 1 – I have paid close attention to the impact of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises on the budget. It would be useful to have the precise figures as soon as possible. Nevertheless, the existence of a reserve of EUR 1 billion proposed by the Commission seems acceptable, given the unpredictable nature of these crises. I would state my view once again, however, that we consider a reserve always to be non-compulsory expenditure, as we want to be able to intervene in decisions on its use. We hope to find out, in the Letter of Amendment which is to be presented following first reading, if not before, exactly what the costs arising from BSE and foot-and-mouth disease are. In this context, I would remind you that we are counting on a Commission document on the direction to take with regard to the mid-term review of the last common agricultural policy reform, in which I hope to see consistency between the decisions taken on the crisis, and guidelines for the future. The broad economic guidelines give 15 September as the date for this document to be presented. The Letter of Amendment is another possibility to consider for the presentation of this document.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to fisheries and given the much-discussed failure of the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco and the consequent need to restructure our fleets, we must make a careful assessment of how this will be funded. In internal policies (category 3), the current margin is limited and the broad economic guidelines lay down clear priorities in this area, which must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">In external action (category 4), it is still difficult to guarantee the stability of the European Union’s action. Reprogrammings have been the rule and we are concerned about the possibility of once again facing reductions in appropriations in budget lines to which we attach great importance. I am referring here to Latin America, human rights and the fight against Aids, for example. In the meantime, in the Balkans, where the European Union has also made clear commitments, we are seeing, as I understand it, a reduction in budgetary resources. Everything indicates that account has not yet been taken of the report by the World Bank, which will give precise details of reconstruction needs. What will happen then? And what about the operational costs of our defence and security policy?</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of administration (category 5), to what extent are the appropriations proposed sufficient, when added together, to cope with the reform of the Commission, enlargement, the launch of new policies, an increase in the Council’s budget of around 10%, and the proposals of other institutions? It seems quite clear that the resources decided on in Berlin are insufficient. We shall see.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of pre-accession, (category 7), I would stress that Parliament came out in favour of reallocating unused appropriations, similarly to what is happening in category 2. Once again, I wish to state my hope that we can maintain a constructive approach to the debate that has now begun. Consensus with the Commission and the Council is both desirable and possible. We must therefore watch out for clouds on the horizon, and I am referring specifically to the fact that the Committee on Budgets today voted on its position on the financial regulation. I would stress that this position complies with the broad economic guidelines. These stated that Parliament will not hesitate to reconsider its position on such matters in its budgetary decisions. It is still possible to guarantee a real assessment of our position on the revision of the financial regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
