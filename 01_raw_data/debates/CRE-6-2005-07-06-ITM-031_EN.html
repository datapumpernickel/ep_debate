<p class="contents">This positive stance is made all the more important by the fact that the political processes required by Switzerland for these agreements to be ratified have now been completed, the most important stage in them having been, without doubt, the referendum held on 5 June.</p>
<p class="contents">We, too – and your House not least – should all make good use of this favourable response on the part of the Swiss in order to foster a positive attitude towards the European cause, and this will of course involve the completion of our own procedures with the minimum possible delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreements were signed on 26 October 2004 in Luxembourg and augur well for the continuing development of relations between the EU and Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">Swiss association with the Schengen Agreement will bring many practical benefits for EU citizens too, particularly for the many thousands of commuters and travellers, whether for business or other reasons, who are obliged to cross the border on a daily basis, for whom life will be made much easier once the agreement is implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the agreements relating to Schengen and Dublin also enhance security by means of cooperation in combating crime and in the exchange of data across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that it is so important that Parliament should endorse the conclusion of the agreements. It is, however, unfortunate that differing views are held on the procedure applicable to this end, by the Commission and the Council on the one hand and by Parliament on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Having once again examined its position, the Commission has come to the conclusion that it ought to be possible to agree on one point, namely that neither agreement is an association agreement within the meaning of the European Communities Treaty, even though the word ‘association’ occurs in their titles.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, though, the Commission does take the view that these agreements do not create any kind of specific institutional framework for the cooperation processes. The mere existence of a mixed committee is not sufficient to have that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The point I particularly want to make with reference to this is that the mixed committees’ sole function is to rule on whether or not the agreements should remain in force in the event of Switzerland failing to discharge its treaty obligations, specifically the transposition of the Schengen or Dublin <span class="italic">acquis</span> into domestic law.</p>
<p class="contents">It also has to be said that these mixed committees are entitled to exercise influence to a considerably lesser degree than the mixed committees already in existence, as established through other bilateral agreements with Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, the Commission regards the legal position as being that neither agreement requires assent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore sees no reason to amend its proposal for a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention; I look forward to the debate with interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am greatly honoured to have conduct of these matters. My respect for not only the institutions of Europe but also for the Swiss institutions and people knows no bounds. It was only because of the willingness of the Swiss people, through their referendum on 5 June, to see greater cooperation between Switzerland and the EU that I was able to proceed with my proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has already pointed out, these are good proposals. They are radical, particularly from a Swiss perspective, because although Switzerland retains its independence, if the report is adopted its borders will now effectively allow more movement of people. It will retain strong control over movements of goods but there will be greater movement of people, much better cooperation between law enforcement authorities and, through Switzerland's involvement in the Dublin <span class="italic">acquis</span>, close involvement in determining who is responsible in the case of difficult asylum applications.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all very good, progressive and acceptable developments. They could well be the start of many more agreements based on a similar approach, an approach that was adopted previously with both Norway and Iceland and is now being used with Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, I very much respect the decision of the Swiss people on 5 June and I am therefore happy to proceed. However, although I have heard the Commissioner's explanation on the mixed committees and hence the legal base, I still have considerable problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I look at this not so much as a lawyer myself, but on the basis of our legal advice, which appears to be ambivalent. From my point of view it indicates that the right procedure would have been the assent procedure rather than consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the basis on which I intend to proceed. I still hope that we might be able to reach an accommodation here, because the purpose of my two amendments to this report is to make sure that this is an assent and not a consultation procedure. Obviously there might be an ongoing dispute. I am disappointed in that part of the Commissioner’s speech, because she seems to indicate that she is happy that her legal advice is better than mine. I suppose you do not always have the same legal advice when you have two lawyers, any more than two economists ever agree on financial matters. Nevertheless, I feel very strongly that this is important, not only in this particular case but also for other matters and agreements that we might bring to Parliament for consideration in future. My committee is quite clear about this, having taken advice, and I too feel very strongly.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to be seen to be blocking progress or obstructing the will of the Swiss people, who are very interested in the outcome of our discussions and what I am doing here. However, it is in everybody’s interests that we make it clear that the European Parliament very much guards its right to be involved in assent procedures in the limited fields in which they apply. We feel very strongly about that.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commissioner will be able to reconsider. The Council is not present, but it had a similar view. I would like to see the matter reconsidered, because these freer relationships can only be to the benefit not only of the Swiss people but also of all of us in the European Union, especially its institutions, and in particular the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karl von Wogau, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I propose to start by raising a number of issues relating to the Schengen Agreement, for I have a very clear recollection of the circumstances surrounding its adoption, which was heralded by a number of things happening at borders, where customs checks were abolished and VAT was no longer to be levied; veterinary controls at borders were abolished, the collection of statistics at borders was consigned to the past, and checks on branded products came to an end. At the same time, export subsidies and import levies were done away with too, the effect being that the borders really were open. Last to go, and at the hands of the Schengen Agreement, were controls on persons.</p>
<p class="contents">The very opposite is the case in Switzerland, where all the things I have listed remain in place, and only controls on persons are to cease. I therefore want to raise the question of whether our Swiss neighbours have not managed to extract the only raisin from what I, in this House, have called this very dry bread, and, in these negotiations, they appear to have done just that. At any rate, that is the impression that the people in my electoral district on the Upper Rhine get; they are constantly pointing out the ways in which the things that the Swiss regard as important have actually been dealt with. There are, though, very serious problems – the noise made by planes at Zürich airport is one of them – that have been left untouched, even though they are bilateral in nature, affecting both Switzerland and Germany alike.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is no less important and has to do with farmers on this border. The very great difficulties that the German farmers face have to do with the fact that the Swiss pay much higher subsidies, so that the Swiss farmers are able to pay higher rents, and now they are going to get aid from the European Union too. It is enough to defy anyone’s powers of comprehension. If adequate account cannot be taken of these interests, then something has gone wrong with the negotiations at some point.</p>
<p class="contents">Our opinions differ as regards the legal basis. It is our belief – and our own Legal Affairs Committee confirms it – that these mixed committees really are institutional in character. That being so, I do not think this House is in a position to deliver a definitive opinion, and so we will have to go on discussing this. I do not therefore think that it will be possible for the European Union to ratify this agreement at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although I do not wish to say anything about the legal basis, on which I can do no other than agree with Mr Kirkhope, Members of this House are getting the impression that cooperation between the Member States on the one hand and the European Union – with which Switzerland has been in negotiations – on the other is not all that our constituents have a right to expect. I do believe, though, that, despite everything, this agreement adds up – bearing in mind the fact that the Agreement on the free movement of persons has to be added on 25 September – to an advance for those who live in our electoral district, for Schengen and Dublin are about closer and therefore better cooperation in the control of persons and are thus of benefit to internal security. It is not only the Swiss who stand to gain from this; so do our fellow-citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, though, because both the European Union and Switzerland must benefit from their mutual cooperation that I share the view that the Schengen Agreement and the Agreement on the free movement of persons must complement one another like two sides of a single coin. Particularly in view of the ongoing problems with borders, which we will be discussing with our Swiss opposite numbers at the meeting of the SINEEA delegation in Fribourg next week, it is right and proper that the Commission should tell them that we have to regard Schengen as inseparable from the Agreement on the free movement of persons, and this, as Mr von Wogau so rightly said, should not, if at all possible, be seen as the end, but rather as the beginning, of a process by which the Swiss will come to agree to other closer cooperative relationships. It is because I believe this to be in the interests of the people on the Upper Rhine that I regard Mr Kirkhope’s report as worthy of support, and, although it is not for me to give an opinion on the legal issues he has addressed, it has mine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to begin by commending Mr Kirkhope on his efforts to defend Parliament’s prerogatives. I wish to congratulate the Commission on the initiative and to say to the Commissioner that it is very important that Switzerland can become the third country from outside the EU, after Iceland and Norway, to be involved in the execution, implementation and development of the Schengen acquis and the Dublin/Eurodac system.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the Swiss people decided in a referendum, as mentioned by Mr Kirkhope, to have closer ties with the EU by integrating the Schengen area, which allows free movement, and by means of the Dublin Agreement, which covers asylum policy. I welcome Switzerland’s participation in these systems, which will eliminate certain obstacles to free movement and will strengthen cooperation; this is vital in view of the country’s geographical location. Switzerland stands to gain politically, in terms of greater stability in its geographical neighbourhood, and economically, in terms of the benefits of greater flow of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, Switzerland will have to accept and apply the Schengen acquis in its entirety, which is not true of all EU Member States, given that derogations are only provided for in relation to the future development of the Schengen acquis, a prerequisite seen as necessary for the conclusion of an agreement on taxation of savings.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second agreement, Switzerland will have to accept, implement and apply the current and future Dublin/Eurodac acquis with no exception. I should like to conclude by pointing out that these agreements mark a welcome shift towards closer relations between Switzerland and the EU. This also demonstrates to other countries that it is possible to strengthen ties, to pool efforts and to work closely together on policy with the EU, without necessarily formally becoming a Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we are all, when it comes down to it, glad that we now have these agreements, that one of them has already been approved by a referendum, and that we can embark on the process of ratification. As has already been said, that is very important, not only because it can be a model for other countries, but also because it will offer the Swiss people a chance to draw ever closer to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the legal issue has been mentioned, it is that in particular that I would like to revisit.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal services of both the Commission and the Council have given their opinions on this. Even though Mr Kirkhope has already done so, I would like now, again, to confirm the position.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 300 of the Treaty establishing the European Community specifies four instances in which the conclusion of an international agreement requires assent on the part of the European Parliament. The first is where the agreement is an association agreement within the meaning of Article 310 of the Treaty establishing the European Community; the second, agreements establishing a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures; the third, agreements having important budgetary implications for the Community, and the fourth, agreements entailing amendment of an act adopted under the procedure referred to in Articles 251 or 252 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In all other instances, Parliament can only give its opinion. The Commission’s legal service takes the view that this agreement cannot be seen as included among the instances enumerated above and that the mixed committees established by it have only limited powers, specifically in the field of dispute resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I have of course taken note of what you say, I must uphold this as being the Commission’s opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to briefly respond to the issues addressed by Mr von Wogau and also referred to by Mr Schwab. We are, I think, fully aware of the problems and issues that they have mentioned, which have to do with cooperation between areas, and, in particular, between regions. Although such issues as agriculture and aircraft noise are predominantly bilateral in character, I am aware of the connection, and while unable to put forward any solution right now, I can assure you that we are aware of the problems, which we can perhaps again put on the agenda for occasional discussions with the Swiss.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, at the present moment, nothing further to add, and ask your House to continue with the relevant procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
