<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carraro (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Mr President, the report begins by welcoming the Commission’s communication, seeking, first and foremost, to take full advantage of the last few years’ experience of the Internet, and hence of self-government through ICANN and its bodies. As well as experience of self-government, there has also been experience of self-regulation, which certainly represents an excellent example of the role the Internet has been able to play in the progress of communications and the world economy over the last few years. Even the criticism in the original outline of the report, on the need for all five continents to be represented on the governing body or on the ICANN board of directors, no longer applies, because at the very moment the initial draft appeared, the representative of the African continent was taking his seat on the ICANN board. That is why an amendment has been tabled to paragraph 6 and a split vote is requested on paragraph 7, as part of it is now superfluous.</p>
<p class="contents">The report expresses our full support as regards the role the European Commission can play in terms of organisation and management of the Internet, representing all the Member States of the Union. However, it also makes the clear recommendation that this should never take the form of interference by political authorities or, worse still, by the Commission and the European Union bureaucracies in the Internet’s governing and operational bodies, precisely because its positive experience of self-government and self-regulation must be fully respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather, the Commission is called upon to work alongside the US Government. In recent years, the US Department of Commerce has given substantial backing and encouragement to the process of ICANN’s progressive independence from the US Government. We therefore urge the Commission to cooperate with these positive tactics by the US Government in order to carry this process of independence and autonomy of the Internet and its governing bodies right through to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The key problem facing Europe, which must, of course, be dealt with by the competent party, is how to close the gap behind the United States in this sector and other more advanced parts of the world. We therefore fully support the proposal to create the EU domain in the sector and we recommend homogeneous standards at European level on registration, protection of domain names and action to combat fraud, cybersquatting, and so on. A homogeneous European market is no small aspiration, even for the Internet, but I think it is one of the essential conditions to guarantee development and attract investment, including investment in infrastructure which is still in deficit on the continent of Europe. In fact, we can only have a market large enough to be competitive with North America if we have a homogeneous market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – the last point made in the report – the process of telecommunications liberalisation needs to be accelerated and completed because that is obviously closely linked to the future and the progress of the Internet on the continent of Europe. I do not think it is necessary to say anything further on that because the Commission and Parliament have done a great deal of work in that direction in the last few months. I not only want to acknowledge the excellent work Commissioner Liikanen is carrying out in this field. I also want to express total faith and confidence in his and the Commission’s will to bring the process to a conclusion with consistency and determination, because it will constitute another decisive thrust not only for the development of telecommunications on the continent of Europe but also for the organisation, operational stability and development of the Internet in our Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It gets to the heart of the matter. It is very well analysed and I would also like to thank him on behalf of colleagues on my committee for being very open to us. We worked very closely together and I hope he feels that our committee added value to his own efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to focus on a number of key issues from the point of view of the Legal Affairs Committee. This whole issue of governance of what is becoming a crucial international resource is something that is of particular importance. We are at a very important transitional stage where the European Union needs to play a crucial balancing role in moving the system of Internet governance from one that has been traditionally dominated by interests in the United States to becoming a truly global organisation. The United States Government has played an important and benign role because the initial Internet developers and technologists came from a United States background. This report quite rightly draws attention to the very crucial role that the European Union has to play in achieving this transition.</p>
<p class="contents">The other important issue is the role of public authorities. Clearly there is an important role for public authorities but it must not become overbearing. International governance of the Internet owes its success so far to the fact that it is not based on complex international treaties. It has been the responsibility of a series of groups of experts. It is very much governed by the individuals and users who are operating the system. We should leave it that way but of course monitor it and make sure it works for the benefit of all the citizens that use it.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside that, the other crucial issue for the Legal Affairs Committee is the question of domain name registrations. This whole area is evolving very rapidly and with the development of the Internet, simple commodities like names, text, strings and characters have become very valuable. There needs to be a body of governance which is based on competition law, to make sure that allocation is carried out in a free way and ensure that world international copyright laws protect the legitimate rights of citizens who own those names to overcome the problem which has been picturesquely described as cyber-squatting.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would say that this is a very important report in an area which will become increasingly important to all of us. Those of us that use the Internet everyday take the basic plumbing behind it for granted. But we should not do that. We have to take a real interest in a commodity – a utility – that is going to be increasingly vital to all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new dotcom industry is in a real state of crisis and yet the markets have taken to it most enthusiastically. Data volumes are currently doubling every three months, meaning that, in theory at least, there are two conflicting currents. On the one hand the crash in share prices and a spate of bankruptcies in the industry and, on the other hand, a huge demand for and a huge fascination with this industry, which is extremely widely used.</p>
<p class="contents">Domain names have also proved to be valuable commodities. The first stock exchanges are being set up on which you can trade, auction and sell your own domain name, which is why the question of intellectual property arises here: what is being done about licensing? Will it be possible in future to grant compulsory licences if, for example, a compulsory link can simply be set up on one well-known web page to another web page? How will we settle disputes if it comes – and it will come – to intercontinental disputes? Will the WIPO alone have jurisdiction here or is this already a matter for the WTO? I think that questions of abuse and questions of criminality need to be looked at primarily in an international context.</p>
<p class="contents">We need consumer confidence in electronic commerce and that can only be achieved with fair and proper registration. In the final analysis, we can also signal acceptance of EU laws by creating an EU domain and this, in turn, will have enormous repercussions on e-commerce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This ICANN manoeuvres the Internet’s information channels and determines who has the use of addresses and how they might achieve this. Whole countries can fall foul of the organisation’s tyranny and be cut off from information if they do not agree to play the game. Companies’ profits can dive if a letter or dot is put in the wrong place. The organisation’s power now extends to copyright and consumer matters, and that power is growing all the time. But the organisation is supervised by no one and responsible to no one. This is a peculiar combination! Recently there was a vote to increase the Board of Directors to nineteen members. Of the three billion of those entitled to vote in the network vote, just seventy-six thousand did. It is a strange game! This is an incredibly undemocratic system in an incredibly important role.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has quite rightly taken action, and so it must. But we need something more. ICANN cannot be the administrative organ of the networked world or its nerve centre without having any responsibility, led by a random group of people. Surely somebody must be responsible for something. I would nevertheless like to thank the Commission and Mr Liikanen, who has worked hard to produce an excellent document for the Stockholm Summit at this serious point in time, which Mr Carraro, among others, referred to. It is an important contribution, and it will give hope to the IT sector in its proposal for measures that would make it easier for companies to function, increase employment and, as a result, boost European competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As early as 11 April 2000, the Commission submitted its communication on Internet policy 1998 – 2000 and we know that the ICANN meeting in Melbourne was concluded yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Paasilinna, the Commissioner and I have had the privilege of being able to read newspapers which have reported something of what has supposedly taken place in Melbourne. If you log on to ICANN's own home page, you find only scanty details of what has actually happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the putting of the domain names .bytes, .info and .pro into use been delayed? Is it true that a Norwegian company has got the top domain name? How are the negotiations going for the EU regarding our own top domain name?</p>
<p class="contents">Many such questions remain unanswered, and it is amazing that there is nothing to read on the matter on the net. The Commission and the rapporteur correctly stress that openness is required in the administration. Even Mr Paasilinna said that there could be cause for criticism in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wonder what allies the Commission had in Melbourne. Did we have any representatives at the meeting? How representative can ICANN be considered to be? The same question was asked by Mr Paasilinna.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that Parliament needs to take considerably greater advantage of the fact that the former Swedish Prime Minister, Carl Bildt, has been appointed to head a panel for the administration of ICANN. We therefore have good reason to be self-critical. We have reason to consider how, for one year, we have been able to delay the handling of this matter. We need to work more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The report raises many other important issues, including those that were debated in preparation for the summit in Stockholm. Here, I would like to express my agreement with the words of praise directed at the Commissioner for pointing out how to launch the <span class="italic">e</span>-Europe programme, while at the same time the Finance Ministers are snatching away the basis for the same programme. I am extremely grateful that the Commission and other Member States want to raise this serious issue in Stockholm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an important point but, unlike many of you, I am less concerned with EU location nationalism and more concerned with who can actually use Internet technology. It is a new technology and it is only a good new technology if a lot of people can use it. The digital divide mainly runs between north and south and this is a huge problem because in the south hardly anyone has access to the Internet. This is why I think it is important for the EU to make a commitment to limit the north/south digital divide, for us perhaps to launch a programme for the purpose and, above all, for us to invest in public access, for example in schools and libraries. Only then will as many people as possible be able to use the Internet in the south and only then shall we reach the point at which people can obtain information on their own initiative and develop their talents freely and without censorship, including on the Internet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What does that word evoke? For me it brings to mind the sea, which reminds me of Christopher Columbus. And that is because Christopher Columbus was, as you know, born in Genoa. He was Genoese, not Portuguese. The tie I am wearing this evening bears the emblem of the city of Genoa, so I could hardly refrain from speaking on such an important matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I have asked to speak, Mr President, to point out that there is also a social Internet, not just a commercial Internet. The social Internet means that, thanks to the computer and the Web, adults, older people and pensioners can continue to learn, be informed, and achieve that famous lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Internet provides an opportunity for disabled people to work. Someone who cannot walk can perfectly easily work on the Internet, and so overcome his disability.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, computers installed in rest homes and linked to the Internet make it possible for sick and elderly people who cannot move to talk with their families, their children and their friends, and go on living in the world, so to speak, even if they are unfortunately guests of a rest home.</p>
<p class="contents">So I hope this Internet board – and Europe too – will remember that, as well as the commercial Internet, there is also a social Internet for old people and pensioners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While we sit here discussing these issues until the witching hour, the Americans have already organised special senate hearings to look into the problems in detail. Even as an ICANN director, having been elected a few weeks ago, I am having trouble finding out exactly what ICANN does. We simply do not take time to stop and think about it.</p>
<p class="contents">A few technical points have been addressed. I completely fail to understand why this Commission does not publicly stand up for the fact that we have dot kids, we have dot sex, that we have detailed subdivisions which make everything we have discussed here possible, a clear division between e-commerce and the public sector. The decisive move will be to cut ICANN free from this American domination, not because it is dangerous per se, but because the management of the Internet is at stake and you must do here what you normally only talk of, Commissioner, and create openness and transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (FI) </span>Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur, Massimo Carraro, for an excellent report. It is full of technical detail, but Mr Carraro has managed splendidly to raise the economically and politically important questions. Malcolm Harbour also deserves our thanks for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. At the same time I wish to thank the members of Parliament for this debate. There will come a time when the Internet will be spoken about by day and the Chamber will be full. For that reason I congratulate you: you are an avant-garde group in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission began to monitor these matters closely in 1997, when discussions started in the United States regarding the future of the management of the Internet. The Internet’s revolutionary impact on communications generally and <span class="italic">e</span>commerce in particular later confirmed the importance of this area of policy. Numerous questions arose in connection with the development of the Domain Name System (DNS) with regard to competition, freedom of speech, consumer protection, trademarks, rights to names, the reliability and transparency of transactions, the protection of privacy, the protection of data, and so on. The Commission agrees fully with the view expressed in the parliamentary report that these matters of public interest must be solved in a consistent and effective manner, with regard to the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">At present the most important international forum, which has the powers and scope to begin discussions on these questions, is the ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), which is an intergovernmental organisation. The Commission and the Member States are involved in large-scale programmes of cooperation in this area. The main aims of the EU parties involved are to ensure that the globalisation of the management of the Internet will also continue during the term of the new American administration, and make the job of the GAC more effective in the debate on political questions.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Carraro said, relations with the USA in this field are important, when we take account of the fact that the US congress and a part of the private sector is inclined sometimes to deny or ignore the Internet’s global dimension. We shall maintain close contact in this matter with the new American administration and we intend to send Mr Evans, US Secretary of Commerce, as soon as Parliament has voted in the report, a letter in which I shall clearly explain the interests of the EU in this field, and I shall also make known to him the content of your report.</p>
<p class="contents">Last October, the Council of Ministers passed a resolution on this issue. In it the Commission was empowered to coordinate positions within the EU, pursue the EU’s interests in international contexts, and establish a private sector network to support the work of the EU in this field. It is most gratifying that Parliament’s report should be in agreement with this policy and that the Commission’s actions have the support of both Parliament and the Council. This is important from the point of view of how effective we can be in international arenas.</p>
<p class="contents">I would then like to make a few observations and comments with regard to Mr Carraro’s report and Mr Harbour’s opinion. The report highlights the importance of defining the EU’s role, and I am happy that it expresses the desire to accord the Commission a strong position in these matters. Similarly, I note the desire to restrict the intervention of governments in the international self-regulatory process. In this respect we must advance one step at a time and bear in mind that our goal is a truly international, balanced and impartial regulatory system. But we have to recognise that we have not yet achieved this aim. The US Government still has special powers and ICANN’s Board of Directors and staff are still not always necessarily aware of all the EU’s views. For this reason, the Commission will follow the situation closely and inform our partners immediately of any problems that may crop up, for example, in the area of competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also ready to accept the general aims with regard to the administration of the ICANN, which have been set out in paragraph 8 of Parliament’s resolution. In practice, however, it remains very much the task of those involved coming from the private sector and, in particular, the national ccTLD Registries, to express their views within the structure of the ICANN. This is one reason why the Commission, back in 1997, urged players in the European private sector to get involved directly in action that would later take the shape of the ICANN process. I have to say that this has produced some excellent results, of which it is worth mentioning Europe’s firm involvement today in ICANN’s Board of Directors and supporting organisations. Many European organisations and companies were represented at the meeting this week in Melbourne. Unfortunately, I still have not had access to any report on the meeting, but I will inform the members of it as soon as I do. The delegates will have come back from Melbourne by now, but there was still nothing about it on the Internet when I left my room.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 15 of Parliament’s resolution also refers to codes of conduct, best practice and legislation in this area. The Internet operators and users have a lot of work to do in these areas. The Commission obviously cannot do everything on its own. We can take appropriate action to promote and speed up the self-regulation process with the private sector and other governments, for example, within the framework of the Governmental Advisory Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also noticed that Parliament’s resolution expresses the will to allow Member States to take care of certain matters. The national registries and the principles they are based on are very largely within the competence of the Member States. The Commission, however, has sought, in unofficial working parties and in an advisory committee, to introduce jointly approved principles. If the need arises, the Commission is obviously prepared to use its powers, for example, in the areas of internal market legislation and competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I say that the Commission agrees with the rapporteur about the importance of liberalising the telecommunications industry and investing in the backbone Internet capacity both in Europe and internationally. We are actively seeking, with the help of a framework research programme, both to promote the development of the second generation Internet and strengthen cross-border and international links with regard to European research networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the .eu proposal, it is at present being discussed by the Council and Parliament. As soon as a legal basis is found for this, the Commission will take every practical step it can to ensure that European communities, companies and citizens have the use of this our own .eu facility, where the players will therefore obviously have to comply with European legislation, including the protection of privacy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will notify the Council and specialists in the field in the Member States of the contents of Parliament’s report. Thank you all once again! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
