<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patrick Gaubert (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I have worked a great deal over the last few months to draft a comprehensive and consistent report on some very sensitive topics: my report relates to legal and illegal immigration and integration policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Since time immemorial, humans have emigrated to escape poverty or persecution, in search of happiness, in pursuit of a better future. Today, with globalisation and the proliferation of transport options, migratory flows have become denser and more complex. They are the result of a new aspiration for men and women throughout the world, to go to work in other countries, to benefit from other experiences. They are also the result of inequalities that are present across the world, the result of poverty, the curse of too many regions in the world. In the context of national elections, in some Member States, immigration is a recurring theme in electoral campaigns. Some countries decide to seal their borders and adopt tough measures, while others regularise thousands of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union seems to be divided in relation to the issue of immigration. It is true that each Member State has the right to decide how many immigrants it intends to accept, but Europe no longer has internal borders. As a consequence, any national measure has significant direct repercussions on the other Member States. It is therefore now essential for the Member States to organise themselves at European level. The solution to many of the problems they face must be both European and national. Certain political parties systematically make use of election periods to draw prejudicial parallels between insecurity, terrorism and immigration, fostering in our fellow citizens a fear of immigrants and foreigners. This is, of course, unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital, firstly, to provide objective, transparent and regular information on immigration policy and, secondly, to launch information campaigns aimed at the population, in order to change people’s perceptions of immigrants as criminals. In my report, I wanted to take a responsible, balanced, comprehensive approach. Responsible, because we need to deal with these subjects with a greater sense of responsibility: we must not forget that we are dealing with men and women, not with goods! I also wanted to take a balanced approach: the Member States must not base their policies either entirely on security considerations or entirely on a spirit of liberalism. We therefore need to transcend national differences and take the heat out of the debate in order to develop a humane and effective European immigration policy. Finally, I wanted a comprehensive approach to increase consistency and effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to deal with a number of aspects that I have discussed in my report. Firstly, the need for an active policy of co-development to combat the basic causes of immigration. Secondly, combating illegal immigration by means of stricter controls at our external borders, dismantling human trafficking networks, harsher penalties, very harsh, for businesses that use clandestine workers. Thirdly, legal immigration: if the EU needs to open its borders to legal immigrants in response to the predicted decline in the active population, it must do so in an organised, concerted way. Finally, policy on the integration of immigrants: admission and integration policies are inseparable. The Member States must implement more proactive policies. For their part, immigrants must understand and respect the fundamental values of the host country: learning the language, civic education courses and better integration into the labour market are some of the important elements of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I think that immigration is a good thing for the country of origin, for the host country and for the immigrants themselves when it is controlled and co-managed. That is the principle of win-win immigration, controlled and managed jointly. Neither welcoming all comers nor setting as an objective the myth of zero immigration is a realistic or particularly responsible position. Each State must accept immigrants depending on its integration capability, its own interests and those of the country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of immigration is too sensitive, sometimes too tragic, to continue to make it the subject of political sparring matches. One vision must prevail when we discuss it: where are people in all this? Of course, we have to be realistic, but we must also take into consideration the undeniable human brotherhood and the solidarity that it entails. Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament must give a strong and unified signal to the Council and to the citizens of Europe so that rapid progress can be made in immigration and integration policies. I therefore hope that this report will be adopted tomorrow by a large majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Franco Frattini,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, first of all I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gaubert, on his report, which I feel is extremely balanced and well-structured. I believe that it makes an excellent contribution to a European immigration policy, highlighting, on the one hand, the added value of Europe, and, on the other, the importance of close cooperation with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I will express a number of opinions on the main points in the report. Firstly, with regard to establishing an early warning system, the Commission strongly supports this idea and is drafting a proposal. By summer, it intends to put forward a proposal for a Council decision on the development of a preliminary consultation procedure among the Member States for the adoption of measures in the area of asylum and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the connection between immigration and development policies, the Commission intends to present a draft communication, again by this summer, in order to develop practical ideas and proposals linking European migration policy with cooperation in the area of development. In this context, particularly sensitive subject-matter will without doubt be examined, such as the so-called ‘brain drain’, which is also an extremely delicate issue for the countries from which the flows of highly-qualified workers originate.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to measures against illegal immigration, moreover, the Commission obviously agrees with the rapporteur’s approach: our action is directed against any kind of trafficking in human beings, in which illegal immigrants are clearly only victims. We are examining proposals for common rules for the dissemination of best practice, with a view to tackling the trafficking in human beings more effectively, by possibly aiming for greater involvement from third countries and promoting closer cooperation between the third countries themselves and the Member States in order to protect maritime borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The European immigrant-return policy also deserves much attention. The Hague Programme expressly stipulates the need for European common rules on this matter. In all likelihood before September, the Commission intends to present a proposal for a directive incorporating common, transparent rules – which we will obviously examine together – on the immigrant-return policy, which will take full account of the need to respect the fundamental rights of every man and woman. When discussing fundamental rights, I do not believe that any distinction can be made between a legal immigrant and an illegal immigrant: the fundamental right of respect for human dignity applies indiscriminately to legal and illegal immigrants alike.</p>
<p class="contents">We now come to the important subject of legal migration for economic reasons: we are collecting a large number of proposals on the Green Paper issued by the Commission in January, with which you are all familiar. A public hearing will take place on 14 June, and on the basis of the outcome of that extensive consultation we will prepare a proposal before the end of the year. The proposal – as I have already had cause to confirm in this House – will precisely be the product of a large-scale European debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Another particularly important matter concerns the recruitment – and the facilitation of recruitment – of seasonal workers and workers employed on a temporary basis. The importance of economic migration is widely recognised: it can be said that, thanks to a genuine European economic migration policy, immigration can represent an opportunity for Europe and its labour market. In some sectors it is even reported that there is a need for certain professionals that cannot be fulfilled by the supply of European workers. As the rapporteur also points out, economic migration is without doubt an extremely sensitive subject for the Member States. I note with great satisfaction, however, that the European public debate on the Green Paper has in some way eased the reluctance of the Member States, which, in certain cases, absolutely refused in principle to tackle the issue of legal migration at European level, and which have now realised that only a policy of this type can bring about real added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to expand on the two extremely important topics of integration and the protection of immigrants. With regard to the first, you are all aware that the proposal that was drafted by myself and approved by the Commission gives particular prominence to integration. In my opinion, integration is an essential part of the European immigration policy. In the second half of 2005, I intend to present a communication on establishing a coherent European framework of integration policies. I am well aware that integration is essentially a national issue, that is to say, that it is incumbent on the Member States to take responsibility for the actual integration policies, but I believe that Europe must not stop encouraging the Member States and intervening to assist them in their integration policies. I believe that without integration, which requires education and access to social services, it is unlikely that we will have a genuinely effective European immigration policy. On this point, I call for Parliament’s vigorous support in order to overcome the difficulties that some Member States still have with the idea of tackling the issue of integration partly through European, and not exclusively national, action. I say this because later in the year we will discuss the Commission’s proposal regarding a European fund for supplementing, but not replacing, national policies on integration.</p>
<p class="contents">I have referred to the protection of immigrants because two aspects are involved. The first is the need to obtain reliable data and statistics on immigration. The Commission intends to present a proposal for a regulation laying down the criteria for obtaining statistical data that in many cases we do not currently have, making it extremely difficult to outline a European policy. The protection of immigrants will have to be aimed primarily at the innocent victims of the traffic in human beings, organised by criminal gangs: I am referring in particular to women and children. With regard to these two categories of particularly vulnerable victims of the traffic in human beings – as I have mentioned on other occasions, including in this House – the Commission will present specific protection and safeguard proposals, in order to stamp out trafficking in human beings, on the one hand, and to protect the victims, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will conclude by confirming my personal satisfaction with Mr Gaubert’s report, which demonstrates how important Parliament’s contribution can be. With regard to the subject-matter in question, Parliament has adopted a stronger and more incisive political approach than in the past. On this matter, I believe that Parliament will be able to be of very great assistance to the policies of the Commission, which will obviously take account of the voice of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want to send a clear signal in favour of a fair and equitable European immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">A common European immigration policy is necessary so that people arriving in Europe can be welcomed in a dignified and organised manner. This policy must take account of the needs and rights of the immigrants. That is why a common immigration policy cannot be envisaged without an active integration policy. I am delighted, in this regard, that we are finally discussing the creation of legal routes for immigration into Europe. However, I would take the liberty of warning that we do not want to take this debate in the wrong direction. Above all, legal immigration must make it possible to respond to the needs of everybody, primarily the immigrants. Under no circumstances must we reduce our considerations simply to the need for workers on the European labour market</p>
<p class="contents">European immigration policy must be comprehensive, and not sectoral. That is why we must take into account our relations with third countries. However, the discussion must be based on true dialogue and exchange. It would be unacceptable for us to reject our responsibilities with regard to managing migratory flows in third countries. Clauses on migratory flows and readmission agreements are not necessarily included in all the association agreements that the European Union concludes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add, finally, that immigration policy and integration policy cannot be separated. I call on the Member States to make it possible to implement minimum criteria for integration in Europe. These criteria should relate in particular to proper integration into the labour market, the right to training, access to education, access to social and health services and the integration of immigrants into social, political and cultural life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Sometimes we have a rather schizophrenic attitude to immigration. On the one hand we continuously stress the need for more economic integration, while at the same time we further tighten the rules on immigration. The result is illegal immigration, human trafficking and abuse of asylum policies. We have shameful scenes in Europe of misery, poverty, and even of people drowning on our shores. That is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to accept that Europe has become an immigration continent. We should actually be welcoming immigrants, people who are trying to improve their lot. Those people are not criminals, they are showing initiative. People like that have built the United States. They are dynamic and strong and we need them. These people are trying to improve their lives and that is not a crime.</p>
<p class="contents">We need proper European immigration policies with real possibilities for legal immigration. At the same time we need integration policies. Immigrants should be fully included in the community. They should be enabled to participate fully in social, cultural and political life, whether by actual voting rights or mechanisms for representation. My Group is very happy to support the report as it stands. It is balanced and will give the necessary support to the European Commission in setting up its policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the area of illegal immigration, too, the report calls for greater cooperation between the Member States, and for the sharing of models of best practice to include the sphere of integration. Discussing mass regularisations, the report argues that regularisation should remain a one-off event. There are, however, countries in the European Union that have never known one-off mass regularisations of this kind, my own country, the Federal Republic of Germany, being one of them. As you can see, there is still much to be done in Europe. This report calls on Member States to give their neighbours and other EU Member States early warning, and we have tabled an amendment to paragraph 29 to make explicit reference to the need for information on the introduction of restrictive immigration measures to be exchanged and notified within the European Union, in other words not just such measures as mass regularisations, but also the opposite: if restrictive action is taken, that information should be shared within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report expresses concern about Member States’ tendency to establish ‘preliminary reception centres’ in non-EU states; there has been frequent enough reference in the press to Libya as an example of a country’s inability to guarantee minimal standards for refugees. Turning to legal migration, the report stresses that, although this remains a matter for the nation states, these are less and less able to resolve the numerous problems without help from elsewhere. These have to do not only with the management of migration, but also with immigrants’ right to integration, and so we have also brought in an amendment to paragraph 51, calling, among other things, for local voting rights and participation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say how glad I am that this report makes explicit reference to honour killings, an issue that needs to be addressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first point is to increase the legal immigration channels; the second point calls on us to act on the causes of immigration and not to respond with repression, criminalisation and rejection; the third point demonstrates that the economic approach may not be the only one in the area of immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Gaubert report must contribute to the drafting of the Green Paper. I believe, moreover, that it is necessary to try to adopt the proposals put forward by our group, in particular with regard to residence permits for job seekers, the rejection of the Community priority – because there can be no difference in job seeking between citizens of the European Union and citizens of third countries – and, finally, the right to actively participate in political life and in elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by expressing a concern: Parliament is carrying out interesting work on immigration whilst the Justice and Home Affairs Council has recently approved closer cooperation for managing migratory flows with Libya, which has now become a privileged partner of ours in the area of immigration even though it continues to offer no guarantees with regard to respect for human rights and safeguarding the right to asylum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can assure you all that the British people do not want a common European immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the recent British general election, all the large pro-EU parties made impossible promises about containing immigration. Their pledges were incompatible with EU membership. The Commission itself said so with regard to the Conservative Party’s asylum proposals. But it is internal EU immigration that really demonstrates the futility of their promises. Over 130 000 people from Eastern European countries entered the UK between May and December 2004: ten times the maximum official predictions. We bear no ill-will to the people of the new Member States. But go to London and observe its creaking housing, transport and health systems: it cannot cope with such a large and sudden increase in population.</p>
<p class="contents">Now Spain intends to grant legal status to up to 700 000 illegal immigrants. These people will then be free to move to Britain if they wish. Spain’s selfish and irresponsible act demonstrates how Britain can have no independent immigration policy inside the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everybody attempts to dodge these issues, and this is undoubtedly why there has been no real follow-up to the 1999 Tampere Programme. One of the reasons behind the ‘no’ vote in the constitutional referendum in the Netherlands was the authorities’ failure to take the issue of immigration seriously. I therefore welcome this debate as an opportunity to hold a frank exchange of views, even though I disagree with a great deal of what is said in the report, and even though I fear that this debate will be anything but frank.</p>
<p class="contents">Politicians are too cowardly to deal properly with the issues of immigration and integration. It annoys me when people say that the EU is in favour of legal immigration but opposed to illegal immigration. This is entirely hypocritical. There is in fact no such thing as legal immigration, because in practice people can only immigrate illegally. As few as 5 000 of the 50 000 Poles working in Brussels live and work here legally. The figures are even more striking in the case of non-EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It annoys me to hear people declaring war on human traffickers, when we are in fact faced with a more pressing problem in the shape of the people arriving in Europe who are grateful to these traffickers for their services, which unfortunately come at a price. We should call a spade a spade, and adopt common European legislation on immigration. We should state in plain terms that for the most part there is no such thing as immigration into Europe, and that we believe Christians integrate better than Muslims. The truth hurts, but it is preferable to lies, and we should rid ourselves of feelings of colonial guilt. We should state the facts and our opinion of them quite openly, and wherever possible, we should provide assistance to the world’s poorer peoples in their own countries, within the framework of intergovernmental programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is complex because there are many factors to this problem which, unfortunately, has become an everyday problem –– illegal immigration –– and also combating it by means of legal mechanisms which respond to the legitimate hopes and desires of those who are seeking a better future in our territory.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary because the Union –– and this Parliament in particular –– must once and for all provide a clear response, a clear demonstration of our common commitment to resolve a problem which has been knocking on our door for too long without an appropriate response.</p>
<p class="contents">The promotion of legal migratory channels, the application of measures in favour of the proper integration of immigrants and, above all, the fight against illegal migratory flows, are the three axes upon which I believe the Union’s strategy must be based.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must promote legal immigration by means of responsible policies, and I would stress the word responsible, since the most recent experience, in my country at least, is a clear demonstration of the opposite; ordered immigration within an open society, with stable and flexible mechanisms to provide lasting solutions. We are talking about people, ladies and gentlemen, not figures.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must work for the full integration of immigrants, since that is the only way we can prevent rootlessness, marginalisation and the conflicts which, to an increasing degree and with greater frequency, are arising within our societies; an integration which has a dual meaning –– for the society of destination and for the migrants themselves –– but which, in any event, must be an integral and fundamental part of our common policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must combat illegal immigration, clandestine immigration and mafias, that is to say human suffering in general, since, as I said before, we cannot forget that we are talking about people.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I would appeal for a common political commitment which leaves behind all demagoguery and all unilateral and irresponsible measures which, simply for the sake of an easy vote and without considering the consequences, could jeopardise the progress we have made and are continuing to make in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question of immigration and integration of migrants has been the subject of decisions within the European institutions for a long time. Tampere and The Hague gave particular prominence to this set of issues and to compliance with the Geneva Convention, and in late 2003 this Parliament approved an epoch-making resolution in the report by Claude Moraes. The present draft – thanks to the sensitivity demonstrated by the rapporteur on this issue – treats illegal migration primarily as a security policy issue and analyses the dual nature of the determining factors of legal migration. People arriving from third countries need to be able to live a decent human life. Providing this is not just a human-rights obligation for EU Member States; it is also increasingly becoming sound economic sense.</p>
<p class="contents">This new approach to these issues is inevitable under the relaunched Lisbon process. It is to the credit of the rapporteur that he analyses economic migration not in a laboratory context, imprisoned by papers, but on the basis of the current economic and social situation here and now. Europe is ageing and additional sources of labour are declining; at the same time, meanwhile, unemployment and inactivity are high. The lessons from the French and Dutch referenda also indicate that the citizens of the old Member States perceive the presence of workers from the new Member States in their labour markets as a threat and xenophobia accompanied the debate from start to finish.</p>
<p class="contents">Even facts are weak in the face of emotions, however. Data from the German research institute DIW show a dynamic increase in the development of economies that did not impose restrictions on labour supply reinforcements arriving from the new Member States. It thus makes economic sense, too, if workers from the new Members States are no longer kept in quarantine for six years and if they are not put in some intermediate, second place between workers from the old Member States and those from third countries. It is to the credit of the rapporteur that the report avoids the temptation of opting for easy solutions, such as introducing a quota system or a sectoral basis for accepting immigrants. It proposes means for preventing human and economic conflict, improving foreign affairs work and providing effective information. It calls upon Member States to use appropriate statutory means to reduce the vulnerability of people making a living from atypical employment. For all these reasons, as someone who has been involved in working on the report, I wholeheartedly commend the report to you for adoption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Zero immigration and fortress Europe are dangerous and reprehensible utopias. Saying this, though, does not mean that we can just do anything. The acceptance of immigrants needs to be organised and prepared. In this matter, the EU must play its role, including by providing funding. I share the report’s hostility to the setting up of detention centres and to sifting immigrants within the EU or outside its borders. I experienced this, sadly, with the notorious camp at Sangatte. These centres do not solve anything, quite the contrary. They feed tensions of all kinds.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the report where it puts forward as a principal aim decisively and mercilessly attacking the people smugglers. The same pitiless suppression must be targeted at employers who exploit immigrants completely outside the law. On the other hand, I regret the fact that the report presents EU immigration policy as an adjustment variable for the labour market and as a way of pushing down wages. Good immigration policy involves a real will to support the sustainable development of emerging countries and not cynically viewing them as a democratic source of cheap labour for the needs of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality helped, with the opinion drafted by my honourable friend, Mrs Kratsa, to ensure that the question of the links between illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings, especially women and children, and the need for access to legal and social protection for the victims is emphasised in the report. The report, irrespective of whether immigration is legal or illegal, calls for the combating of discrimination and the application of programmes to integrate equal rights for men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">It is positive that, even with non-economic immigration, equal participation in education, training, work and family reunion is called for. The report also stresses the need for the Member States to address the continuation in the host country of inhumane traditions which even result in crimes of honour against women.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also positive that attention is paid to the temporary and illegal nature of jobs taken by immigrants, which is something which affects women in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">In the sixth century B.C., the ancient Greek poet Archilogos described abandoning one’s homeland and wandering abroad as one of the most unfortunate situations in which man can find himself. The virtue which is in greatest danger, the poet stresses, is not prosperity or health but the dignity of the immigrant and his family.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gaubert, and the Commissioner, Mr Frattini, for the humane note which they have introduced both in the report and in the intervention by the Commissioner; I think that it is positive for Europe that policies are being shaped which will help to maintain and support the dignity and integrity of immigrants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is linked to the combating of racism and xenophobia, to asylum policy, to the integration of immigrants, to the possibility of their obtaining legal employment in host countries and, above all, to trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has been addressing this issue since 1986, with the new Single European Act, and has issued a large number of directives and decisions. I repeat, therefore, what I said this morning. There is an urgent need for all these decisions and directives to be codified. Without codification, we are floating in a sea of documents and decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">It has, however, been observed that the Member States either do not implement binding decisions or they are late transposing them into their national legislation. This, however, undermines efforts to achieve a single European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be an oversight on my part if I failed to express my warm congratulations to Mr Gaubert on his report. This report takes a number of steps forward. First of all, it calls on the European Commission to strengthen solidarity and common policies at the level of information and the coordination of all structures involved in migration-flow management. However, more important is the highlighting in the report of the need for cooperation with countries of origin and through a proper information system with a view to identifying employment opportunities for persons wishing to migrate. Of course, this cooperation must not reach the point referred to by short-lived Commissioner Buttiglione during his hearing because, God forbid that we should create reception centres – I would say camps – in the countries left by migrants. It would be a crime which our society cannot accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are two major issues of very grave concern here. The first is that illegal immigrants themselves are risking their lives, and indeed hundreds are losing their lives, turning the Mediterranean sea into a graveyard and putting us all to shame. Even if they do reach Europe, whether in Malta or Italy, their ordeal is not yet over; indeed, it is just beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">The second grave concern is the significant toll that this problem is taking on the countries concerned, particularly on Malta and Italy. In the case of Malta the situation is even more precarious because of sheer numbers. Last week 56 immigrants landed in Malta, but 56 immigrants in Malta is proportionally equivalent to more than 5 600 immigrants landing in Italy. That is the scale of the problem that Malta is facing.</p>
<p class="contents">This year we have reason to be optimistic because for the first time we are seeing the European Union finally responding to our repeated calls for action. In particular, I want to refer to last week’s decision of the Council of Ministers to embark immediately on cooperation with Libya to stem the flow of immigrants and to prevent more deaths, not least with the setting-up of a taskforce to patrol the Mediterranean Sea. So finally the European Union is starting to move. Let us hope that it moves in time.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to Commissioner Frattini for his very genuine efforts, and on behalf of the people of Malta I would call upon him to act decisively and urgently. We are counting on you, Commissioner, to address our very serious concerns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can confirm that the work of the Commission will continue in the spirit that is also shared by this Parliament: a European approach that can combine firm action against the traffic in human beings and illegal immigration with strong action in the area of solidarity. Europe’s values are values of solidarity and respect for the fundamental rights of every man and woman. It is from balancing these two requirements that the added value of Europe can result, even in the sensitive area of migration policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
