This was the culmination of a political transitional process agreed in Bonn four years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I visited Afghanistan at the beginning of September to look at the election preparations and see for myself the practical impact our assistance is having on the ground. I was also able to discuss all the challenges ahead and the next phase of the stabilisation process with President Karzai and his ministers, as well as with Afghan civil society and the United Nations. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the elections, the preparations for the post-Bonn period and future EU-Afghanistan relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has supported Afghanistan’s recent election in a number of ways. It is no exaggeration to say that the election could not have taken place without the European Union, including contributions by the Member States. We funded 40% of the election budget, contributing EUR 159 million.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also sought to improve transparency by deploying an EU Election Observation Mission, headed by Mrs Emma Bonino who is present today. This has followed the process since July. It also benefited from the cooperation of an observer delegation from Parliament, led by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, who is here today as well. I think we can say that the EU EOM was the single largest international observer group in the country. Its presence was extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">In its preliminary statement, the EU EOM reported that the election day itself had been largely peaceful, the process up to that point had been generally well administered and the elections marked a step forward for Afghanistan’s democratic development. Nevertheless, it also noted a number of concerns, for instance with the whole campaign environment, the choice of voting system and the complaints mechanism. I understand that in some provinces fraud and irregularities have come to light during the counting phase. The Election Observation Mission has urged the electoral authorities to deal diligently with these concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mrs Bonino for her team’s excellent work so far. I look forward to the final report, which will include an overall assessment of the entire election process, as well as recommendations to improve the conduct of future elections. Mrs Bonino will be travelling to Kabul again before the end of the year to present the report to election stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">What comes next, after the Bonn process? Afghanistan has come a long way since the fall of the Taliban. I am proud that the European Commission’s assistance has had a tangible impact. We have pursued a combination of visible reconstruction, lasting capacity-building and improvements in the day-to-day lives of the Afghan people. We are on track to deliver the EUR 1 billion we pledged in Tokyo for the period 2002 to 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">If we think back to the chaos, devastation and repression in Afghanistan four years ago, it is clear that the country has made progress. Five million children are back in school, one-third of them girls. Eighty per cent of children have been vaccinated against measles and polio. Roads, schools and clinics are being built and many of them are already working.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the situation is still fragile and the improvements are not yet fully sustainable. It is clear that the country still has a long way to go. More work is needed, particularly on good governance, the rule of law, security, counter-narcotics and development. I therefore very much welcome the idea floated by the United Nations at the end of August of a major international conference, hopefully early in 2006, to draw up the ‘post-Bonn compact’ between Afghanistan and the international community. The European Union will again be an important participant in the conference.</p>
<p class="contents">What should the compact do? It should focus particularly on Afghan ownership and sustainability. Lasting stabilisation will not be possible unless the Afghan side is willing and able to take greater responsibility for the transition process and for making it sustainable. The Bonn Agreement showed the value of clear-cut targets and timetables to ensure momentum. So we should aim to incorporate clear benchmarks in the post-Bonn compact. Some form of joint Afghan-international monitoring of progress would also be useful. The post-Bonn compact should be a two-way street: it should contain clear-cut commitments from the Afghan side and commitments from the international community to stay engaged financially, politically and militarily.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I turn to the role of the European Union. The European Union and its Member States have been playing an important role in Afghanistan. Together we accounted for one-third of the USD 12.5 billion in grants pledged at the Tokyo and Bonn conferences. EU Member States are currently contributing 80% of the troops in ISAF. The EU Special Representative in Afghanistan, Francesc Vendrell, has been doing excellent work politically.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the auspices of the British Presidency, we are currently discussing with President Karzai’s Government a joint declaration on an EU-Afghan partnership. It would be an important political signal of continuing EU commitment to Afghanistan. It would also make clear our expectations, the kind of further progress we want to support in Afghanistan in fields such as governance, development and human rights. My hope is that this can be concluded in the weeks ahead so that it would be in place ahead of any post-Bonn conference and could help to shape discussions there.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that the European Union is both entitled and obliged to play a major part in ensuring the success of the post-Bonn compact. The Commission will, in any case, remain engaged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, on her positive and active commitment to the cause of democratic consolidation in Afghanistan; secondly, on having rightly sent an election observation mission to that country, which is experiencing very difficult circumstances. This has ensured the presence of the European Union, which is alive, despite the crisis we are experiencing and the debate we have held this evening, with the President-in-Office of the Council, the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair, and clearly demonstrates that we are not entirely wrapped up in our contemplation of our own problems, but that we are showing solidarity with the problems of other countries that are suffering and that have experienced extremely difficult circumstances, as in the case of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that the members of the European Parliament’s delegation are here in this debate. I can see Mr Evans, Mrs Scheele, my friend Philippe Morillon, Mrs Nicholson and Mr Schröder. I would like to take advantage of this debate in the plenum of our Parliament, as we did in the press conference that we held with Emma Bonino in Afghanistan, to pay tribute to the candidates who died in this electoral process, to the electoral agents, and, above all, to the European Union citizens who lost their lives in this noble task of contributing to the cause of democratic consolidation in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking of the French soldier who lost his life at the very time we were carrying out our mission and also the seventeen brave Spanish soldiers who died in a helicopter accident, in honour of whom we expressed our gratitude and recognition during our visit to Herat, the base where they had their general headquarters, and also our visit to the Governor, the President, the authorities of the United Nations, women candidates and the General Head of the NATO forces in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">From a general point of view, I would like to say that our mission of Members of the European Parliament fully agreed with the conclusions resulting from the extraordinary work carried out by Emma Bonino, and also, from a political point of view, we expressed our view of the priorities that the European Union should set for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe fundamentally in the democratic consolidation of that country, from an institutional point of view and in terms of respect for human rights and, in particular, the rights of women; because democratic development cannot be achieved in a country without the contribution of its men and women and their right to determine their own future.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the European Parliament’s delegation expressed its opinion that our Parliament should contribute to the post-Bonn Process, hosting and organising a broad conference with the participation of the Commission, of the Member States participating in the joint actions of NATO and, of course, of the new representatives in the Afghan Parliament, so that in this way they can go on defining and marking out their own future.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that it was important for the European Parliament to give its full support to the joint statement that the Commission is going to sign with the new authorities and with the Afghan Government, and to provide an institutional framework and a channel for the broad and generous cooperation our Parliament has been demonstrating.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we would call upon the Commission to consider whether in the future we should establish a broad association agreement which could provide and guide an institutional format for cooperation in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, we feel greatly reassured following the statement by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, in which she said that the European Union will continue to contribute to the dividends of peace, understanding, agreement and reconciliation in Afghanistan, which to date has suffered so much agony.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Madam President, by thanking Emma Bonino, with whom we have worked in magnificent harmony, for the hospitality and support she offered to the European Parliament’s delegation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, these were the first parliamentary elections to be held there since 1979. The turnout, greater than 50%, compares favourably with other electoral contests around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">There were problems, but those – not necessarily in this House – who want to criticise need to remember the starting point, and the Commissioner’s words ‘chaos’ and ‘devastation’ really summed it up. Whilst Afghanistan may now still be far from perfect, it has come a long way. We, as an election observation team, were very proud to witness not just women coming to the polling stations to vote – many choosing not to wear the burkha, as is their choice – but many women election officials and women standing as candidates. We know now that many women were elected. So Afghanistan, for all its problems, has come a long way.</p>
<p class="contents">On the list, one of the first names to be announced as elected was the women’s rights activist Malalai Joya. She will be one of 62 women members in the parliament, a major achievement and unthinkable a little while back. Some of them were elected in their own right, and some of them by virtue of the ‘25% women’ rule. However, some of the ghosts of Afghanistan’s brutal past have re-emerged as other results have trickled in.</p>
<p class="contents">When we were there observing the elections, President Karzai explained to us his choice, or <span class="italic">the</span> choice, of electoral system – to which the Commissioner has also referred – based on a single non-transferable vote. This entails no public political party support on the ballot papers but presents the voters with a list of quite literally hundreds of names from which to choose. Hidden in those lists of names are people who could best be described as having less than satisfactory records, some implicated by human rights groups in war crimes. Former Taliban governor Mawlawi Mohammadi, who, if not personally responsible, at least oversaw the destruction of the Buddha statues, was elected in one province on less than 10% of the vote, which arguably is a flaw in the system. Mullah Raketi, commander of a Taliban military unit, was elected in another.</p>
<p class="contents">So the task now facing President Karzai is not an easy one. It is to help those disparate forces form a useful, workable and effective legislative body. One of the challenges facing them, but a vital one, is to address the country’s serious drug problem, to which the Commissioner again referred. The army, the police and the law enforcement agencies need to work together with all the international bodies to look at alternatives for the poppy growers. Another is to address the frightening availability of weapons, which was very visible to us in Kabul and around Afghanistan.</p>

You will never see them but they do exist, and they were there under a European flag. I believe they did a good job in representing the support for democracy that is the common ground between us all and the fundamental value we wish to uphold.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mission, in short, will make public, after consulting the Commission, its final report on the elections; we shall also undertake, again after consultation, to draw up for the first time a report on democratisation and its future steps. Naturally, the whole electoral process had its awkward moments, which, moreover, we had already anticipated in the preliminary statement, but there were also moments of concern, for example the arrest of Mohaqui Nasab – a journalist who edits a weekly publication on women’s rights – which was declared illegal even by the representative of the Media Commission of the Afghan authorities. I believe that to be a cause for concern, and I hope that the European institutions will let it be known to our Afghan friends and the authorities of the country, or will remind them of the need to respect both the law and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, with regard, as you said, to future follow-up to the Bonn Conference, I would like to emphasise two things. Firstly, we have to be aware that this is at least a medium- to long-term commitment, whichever formula is adopted. Secondly, I would like to emphasise the regional dimension, which is so important to the whole success of Afghanistan. Whether one talks about security, or commerce, or economic development, the regional dimension is definitely an element to take into account.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true, though, that Afghanistan is one of the countries to which international commitment, particularly from Europe, can make a difference. Afghanistan is a country trapped between a possible future and a very outmoded past. In my opinion, though, it possesses the human resources to look to the future. When thousands of young girls can be seen coming out of school in black uniforms and white headscarves, with normal books in their pockets, I believe this is the future, even though it may yet be many years before it is fully realised. It is precisely in areas like this, however, that we can make a difference, though not on our own. Our American friends must also remain in the country at a time when there are still difficulties on the security front, while hopefully behaving more respectfully towards local traditions, which is something that does not always happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I remain convinced, though, that a future is possible. It depends on the Afghans, of course, but it also depends on us. I believe that this is the hope and commitment that motivated your visit to us, as well as the visit of the European delegation and our presence there over so many weeks, a presence which, in my opinion, also earned the respect and gratitude of the Afghan people themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As our fellow Members have said, I think that we can be very pleased with the course of the parliamentary elections in Afghanistan on 18 September 2005. Even though there has been some violence in recent months, especially against candidates and tellers, the elections themselves took place in a non-violent atmosphere. That is a good sign for the journey towards democracy and the rule of law in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, as Europeans, we need to clarify our commitments on the ground. We support an extension of the ISAF’s mission, because that mission is reconstruction and nation building. This mission is an important one, Commissioner, because it creates a favourable climate for the development of the country following decades of conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, one very important point must be stressed: we must not mix up the two missions, that of the ISAF and that of Operation Enduring Freedom. The latter, which is led by the United States, seeks to combat terrorism, in other words the Taliban. These are combat operations. If we mix up the two reconstruction missions, we will lose the trust of the population and tarnish the good reputation of this mission.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it will make the situation very difficult for the NGOs, which are currently cooperating with ISAF. We must also raise the issue, as you did, Commissioner, of drugs in the country. We need a plan that takes account of all aspects connected with this problem, which equally affects the agricultural and health sectors and the Afghan economy in general. Of course, this problem also affects neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one final important point. The current government of President Karzai has signed contracts for US troops to be stationed in Afghanistan indefinitely. We do not consider this to be a good thing for the stability of the region. Once the nation building has been completed, Afghanistan will be a sovereign state that will have no need for foreign troops. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am truly convinced that the changes underway in Afghanistan are concrete, effective and real. They are, however, slow, difficult and complicated. An example of the growth of democracy comes, in fact, from a girl, Malalaia Joya, a 26-year-old whom I got to know when she was an 18-year-old in Afghanistan, secretly involved in women’s education, and who has now been elected into a difficult province in Afghanistan. It was she who, amongst other things, said two years ago in the Loya Jirga, with great clarity: ‘The warlords are still here.’</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that a woman like this, with all the hardship and intimidation she must have suffered, can succeed in being elected – and I am sure she will contribute towards the building of democracy in Afghanistan – is an extraordinary fact, and why in my opinion these elections have been positive. I too would like to thank Mrs Bonino – whom I trust, even though we disagree on many issues, such as the Middle East, but in whose democratic nature I have total faith – for her presence in Afghanistan, and I am delighted that the European Union was able to play so positive a role.</p>
<p class="contents">If Malalaia Joya is an example of the new Afghanistan, so too is Omar, a boy I got to know when the Taliban were still there, and who said: ‘I want to live: it is not only for the women that I am fighting against the Taliban, it is also for myself, because I do not want to have a beard and I want to listen to music.’ He too has been elected, which represents, to my mind, another extremely positive fact.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, however, ignore the complex and difficult choices faced by President Karzai, who has not in fact chosen to punish the warlords, as Human Rights Watch, for example, would have him do, but rather has gone down what is perhaps the only road currently available to him, namely permitting the warlords to be elected as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, furthermore, that there is a serious problem with, for example, the International Security Assistance Force, which is undeniably playing an extremely positive role, though I personally am against all war and all military involvement. The role, however, carried out by the US forces is unhelpful to conflict resolution, reconciliation, and the development of Afghanistan. I am not just referring to the horror of seeing the two burnt Taliban bodies – or so-called Taliban, because in the end they are all considered such – but am referring to the absence of lawfulness and lack of rules, seen, for example, in the prison at Bagram, where the Taliban are being held with no system of checks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely because we need to reason, understand and change together that I believe we should not hide away from truths which, judging by the reactions of the Afghans that we have seen on television, may create conflict. In that regard, I believe the role played by the EU is very important in this matter. I wish to thank not only the Commissioner but also the whole European Union, which is working in an alternative way to ensure that Afghanistan is favourable towards democracy. In order to achieve this objective, however, we need to work very hard to support public institutions, so that both NGOs and civil society may somehow make themselves heard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That address was a backward state, which guarded a specific terrorist organisation, that was the Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban party. Thus, the democratic alliance was able to target its retaliatory blow at a defined geographical point that removed the tyranny of the Taliban and opened up the prospect of democracy to the Afghan people. Indeed, one could not fail to be moved by the sight of vast numbers of ordinary people, especially women from the countryside, going for the first time in their lives to vote for the hope of a better system, freedom and respect for all people. We will see that, although they may have supporters, following the removal of the Taliban, none of the terrorist organisations repeat the mistake of providing visiting cards with a specific address to be hit. They have forced others into a situation where all they can do is defend themselves and even more confusion is created when terrorists from Jordan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, who are active in Iraq, are called not invaders, but insurgents. However, Afghanistan, having become the first theatre of the global war on terror, is already creating a true democracy. Iraq is now the fatal front line of the fanatics' total war against the West, while Afghanistan is now almost behind the front. Nevertheless, the opportunity for democracy and human rights in Afghanistan is a great test for everybody. The European Union has made a significant contribution and the whole of Europe must lend a hand in the historic construction of this new state. I am proud that my country Lithuania is helping to do this by taking responsibility for one whole region. Lithuanians are helping to build the new Afghanistan. More European states could do the same. Success in Afghanistan will represent the first defeat of the front of global terrorists, as well as the hope that this new type of totalitarian aggression can be repelled. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As many of us have already, today, emphasised the importance of these elections as a stage in Afghanistan’s democratic process, I would now like to concentrate on the single issue of Afghan women’s involvement in political life. We did of course read a great deal, while the Taliban regime was in power, about the oppression of Afghan women, and it gives great joy to see from the election results that women make up 27% of the future members of parliament. The 25% quota for women has been very useful in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I have no desire to pass over the obvious fact that it will not be enough to have the quota in place and to keep the donor countries quiet if, in future, Afghan women are to participate more in political life and see their social position continue to improve. It is evident from the social indicators that the situation is still very difficult. It is significant that the leader of our delegation, Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, told a press conference in Afghanistan that the European Union will, in monitoring developments in Afghanistan, take a very close look at human rights, and the rights of women in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention must also be made of the conditions under which some non-governmental organisations are obliged to operate in Afghanistan. The Commission must make it abundantly clear that NGOs will always be our partners, in order that they may not be subject to repression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I personally found it a great honour to be a member of the team that was able to witness this momentous event. I want to thank very warmly our good colleague, Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, who led us so wonderfully well. This is the second time I have worked closely with him in an election; we were in Lebanon together just before that. I also want to thank my long-time colleague whom I have always admired, Mrs Bonino, who has been committed to Afghanistan for so long. She was brave enough to go there while the Taliban were in power. Very few women would have shown her courage and commitment, and she is continuing her work.</p>
<p class="contents">I chose to monitor the women-only polling stations. I saw thousands of women, most in burkhas with their faces shrouded. Of course, they rolled them back when they came into the women-only polling booths. They could not do a great deal once they were there. Some spent half an hour puzzling frantically, trying to understand what the piece of paper in front of them meant, what to do and how to make a mark. They had no education. Let us not forget that Afghanistan is one of the two poorest nations in the world. Its health statistics are comparable only to Somalia’s. We will be helping Afghanistan for years to come with education, preventive health care – the basics. It is right and proper that we should do so.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should also remember those from the European Union who have already given their lives for Afghanistan. Led by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, we witnessed a wonderful, moving tribute to the deaths of the 17 Spanish troops, whose names will be enshrined forever where they died. They sacrificed their lives for the future of the people of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot give up. The country is desperately poor. We shall be there for a very long time, but it is the sort of job to which the European Union is wonderfully suited.</p>

<p class="contents">This issue is one of extreme complexity. Afghanistan can look back on a proud history during which the Afghan highlanders fought against invaders. At the same time, however, there can be no question that in some senses the country could be said to export drugs to the rest of the world. I am glad that the European Union is not turning its back on Afghanistan, and that the European taxpayer, to put it quite bluntly, is funding measures to promote democracy in a country that would appear to have been forgotten by God and the world. It goes without saying that it would be nothing short of disastrous if the Americans were the only ones to take any interest in Afghanistan. Regardless of the cost, I am glad that the European Union is funding the arduous and long-winded process of democracy-building in Afghanistan, and that we provided genuine assistance during the recent elections. I believe that this was a turning point, although it remains to be seen how long the trend will continue.</p>
<p class="contents">We should obviously bear in mind the fact that a large number of countries exert an influence over Afghanistan, whether in political or economic terms. It is worth noting that the country is undoubtedly a focus of Iranian and also Pakistani interests, as well as of American interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention should also be made of the quite incredible fact that the vast majority of Afghanistan’s revenue comes from the drugs trade, with the state budget only covering one third of civil servants’ salaries. Without US and EU aid the country would quite simply not exist. We should ask ourselves a very straightforward question, namely whether Afghanistan would not export terrorism to the rest of the world to an even greater extent than it does now if we did not provide it with financial aid. I believe that it is worth lending our support to the process of democratisation in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a further point that needs to be made. It is a well-known fact that Europeans are more highly valued, or perhaps more accepted in Afghanistan than our American friends. This is a signal of sorts that the EU should concern itself more with Afghanistan, and that we should maintain our presence in the country. I should like to thank all the Members of the House who flew the European Union’s flag in Afghanistan, and showed the Afghan people that we want to help them.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this debate is proof of Parliament’s interest in this key issue. Afghanistan is not some far-off land, but a truly European problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To be sure, many things have gone wrong, and many more have yet to do so, but let us consider the history of Europe over the past century, that of my own country for example: even in the old Federal Republic, after the Second World War, many people with links to the old regime were accepted into the civil service and spent their careers in it. Recently, too, the West – to which we belong – has cosied up to the former Soviet <span class="italic">nomenklatura</span>; being on friendly terms with former KGB bosses has become something to be boasted about, and so on and so forth. I would warn against our constantly telling the Afghans, from a position such as our own, what they have to do.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of very good things are happening; I was most especially impressed by the high degree of open-mindedness and commitment shown by the young people. There were very many young people helping out in the polling stations, and, when we asked them what they wanted, they said, ‘We want education, education, education’.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by saying that I would very much like to see this House set up a delegation for relations with Afghanistan, for I believe that to be the best way for us to help the parliamentarians there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are a crucial step towards the establishment of democracy and peace in Afghanistan. Five thousand seven hundred candidates stood in the elections held on 18 September of this year to provincial councils and to the Wolesi Jirga, which is the Lower House of the National Assembly, and this figure included 575 women.</p>
<p class="contents">The scale of the problems faced in holding the elections can be gauged from the fact that 26 000 polling stations were opened throughout the country. The ballot paper for Kabul, to cite but one example, took up seven pages, and included 617 candidates standing for the 62 seats in the constituency. 30% of seats in the Wolesi Jirga and the provincial councils are reserved for women. While the number of women voting in the presidential elections in 2004 was over three million, over 7000 new female voters registered for this year’s elections, representing 44% of newly-registered voters.</p>
<p class="contents">This is only the first step towards democracy in Afghanistan. Parliament’s pre-election mission, which visited Afghanistan on 14-19 July of this year under the leadership of Mr Brok, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Mrs Morgantini, Chairman of the Committee on Development, held meetings with election candidates, women’s organisations, human rights groups and NGOs in Kabul, Herat and Bamiyan. The people we met were hopeful that democracy would be victorious, although they also expressed concerns about threats to this process.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, the key threats are the state of security in the country, violence against women and corruption. Many former military leaders accused of human rights violations or even crimes ran for election and gained seats. There is also a risk that criminal elements, above all drug barons and smugglers, will gain an influence over politics in the country. The European Union must do everything in its power to stabilise democracy and the re-emerging civil society in Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On each occasion, I have been struck by the desire for peace and reconciliation felt by the vast majority of the population, a population that has had enough of violence after 30 years of civil war and international war, a population, moreover, that has been vaccinated against any risk of Islamic fundamentalists returning to power, following their suffering under the regime of Mullah Omar.</p>
<p class="contents">At each new contact, I can also see how difficult the task of reconstruction still is and how necessary it therefore is for the European Union to continue to provide aid. I will only mention here one aspect of this aid, relating to the restoration of security, which is still too frequently under threat in some provinces. This aid is currently provided by the joint efforts of the national army of Afghanistan and international forces, which are themselves divided into two categories, with different mandates: the coalition, under US command, operating essentially around the border with Pakistan, and the ISAF which, as you said, has a large European majority and is gradually being deployed throughout the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">This duality is a source of inefficiency: I welcome the fact that NATO is now planning to bring the mission under a single command, under a new mandate from the United Nations. When it comes to discussing the terms for this, I would like, Commissioner, to act as an interpreter for the Afghan people themselves: they insist on the urgent need for protection from the interference of their neighbours in Pakistan and Iran, and believe that, once this is achieved, they will be able to solve their own problems between themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One such point is the question of human rights abusers who have been elected to parliament, because this is something that concerns us all.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Afghanistan has not embarked with any ease on a process to come to terms with its past, and I hope it will take its time. In such circumstances, it is deeply regrettable, but probably inevitable, that this first post-conflict election will result in some questionable individuals being elected to parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Politically, the key question is how much influence these individuals will have in parliament, and I think it is too early to judge, since the voting system, as many have mentioned, myself included, is very complicated. There are no clear party blocks. Parliament will certainly be very fragmented.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight some positive aspects about some of the people who were elected. There were courageous people with a record of standing up for justice and human rights in Afghanistan who also managed to get elected, including, as many of you mentioned, quite a significant number of women. I met some of the women candidates and, admittedly, I was really surprised and I very much appreciated their courage. When I met them, they said that they had been out working with many women, and I am sure they all said ‘we will get elected’. Ultimately, that has proved to be the case. That is a very positive development.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is also positive to note that, although a few Taliban were elected, many prominent Taliban were not successful in the elections. The former foreign minister, the former deputy interior minister and the former deputy justice minister were all defeated. I am sure that the voters knew whom they should not vote for.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a few words about drugs. We realise that the drug question is still a very important one. We have also discussed it with President Karzai and are working with the UK Presidency to see what we can do in the future to tackle this problem even more robustly on two fronts – the first of which is alternative plantations, the second being justice and law – which are to be reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, education is one of the key questions. I would like to put my finger on that issue for future programmes, not only because it applies to the whole of society, but specifically because, over many decades, women did not have any opportunities and we have to compensate for that in some way. In 2004 alone, we built 50 schools and childcare institutions. We also have a specific project for street children. I visited this project and, again, I must say that I saw how much courage and enthusiasm there is among the young children, the beautiful girls and really handsome boys who have a future. They want to get off the streets where they are normally selling vegetables and other small things. I agree that education and healthcare will be the key issues, and we will certainly continue to put our emphasis on those issues.</p>
