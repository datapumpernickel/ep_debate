<p class="contents">I thank the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent contributions, the Danish and Cyprus Presidencies for successfully concluding the trialogues and the administrators for their valuable assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, EU citizens today feel disappointed about the ongoing economic crisis, rising unemployment and the lack of effective solutions. Brussels seems far away; important decisions are taken for them without them; the lack of information and language problems remain persistent barriers preventing full enjoyment of Union citizenship within the EU and in cross-border situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the great disappointment, it is, however, encouraging that the vast majority of European citizens have not turned their backs on the EU. They still consider EU membership to be a good thing, according to the latest Eurobarometer survey of August 2012. A better and deeper Europe is, however, required.</p>
<p class="contents">Further discussions on European integration require strong democratic support. EU political leaders and institutions must endorse the concerns of 500 million European citizens, fulfil their expectations and regain their trust. At a time of economic, political, and social crisis only twenty months before the next European elections, putting Union citizenship and participative democracy at the centre of the political agenda is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">This is exactly the aim of the European Year of Citizens 2013: to mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of Union citizenship by the Treaty of Maastricht and to give a new momentum to the debate on Union citizenship. All EU citizens must be informed and enjoy without discrimination all the rights granted to them by Union law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, i.e. the right to move and reside freely within the EU, to vote and to stand as candidates in European and municipal elections; to enjoy protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of any Member State in a third country; to petition the European Parliament; to apply to the European Ombudsman; to address the institutions of the Union; to enjoy the free movement of goods and services, consumer protection, public health, equal opportunities, equal treatment, access to employment and social protection; to enjoy the new right of the European Citizens Initiative granted by the Lisbon Treaty, and to strengthen participative democracy through access to documents, information, good governance and administration.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, all the initiatives launched for the European Year of Citizens should enhance awareness of Union citizenship, improve understanding of European integration and enhance cooperation among Union citizens, institutions and Member States. As Members of the European Parliament – the only directly elected EU institution – we have a crucial role to play in promoting the aims of the European Year of Citizens 2013 by bridging the gap between Brussels and Member States, communicating the rights and benefits of EU citizenship, endorsing citizens’ concerns in formulating EU policies and promoting participative democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the forthcoming European elections, we must raise awareness of the legislative powers of the European Parliament and encourage citizens to vote so that their voice is heard clearly by EU decision-makers. A Union of growth, stability and solidarity can only be built with the active involvement of well-informed active citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andreas Mavroyiannis, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, I would like to begin my remarks this afternoon by welcoming the agreement reached between the Council and Parliament on this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The designation of 2013 as the European Year of Citizens is an important signal that we want to increase public awareness of the rights and responsibilities of citizens across the European Union. We hope, in particular, that it will highlight the rights of citizens to move and reside freely within the European Union. These issues are all the more important in the run-up to the European elections of 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">It was this Parliament which first proposed this initiative at the end of 2010. At that time you highlighted the need to stimulate discussion on Union citizenship and to inform Union citizens of their rights, in particular those resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. We are happy that the idea was taken up and moved forward by Commissioner Reding.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty on European Union first introduced the concept of citizenship of the Union, so next year will mark the 20th anniversary. It is therefore particularly appropriate that 2013 will be designated as the Year of Citizens. The Cyprus Presidency, building on the work of the Danish Presidency, was able to conclude negotiations on this proposal in the first few weeks of its term in office. I would like to thank in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Papadopoulou, for her enthusiasm for this initiative and for her willingness to negotiate in such a cooperative manner with the Council. I welcome the vote that will be taking place this week on this proposal and have no doubt that the initiative will be strongly endorsed by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The general objective of the European Year of Citizens in 2013 is to enhance awareness and knowledge of the rights – but also of the responsibilities – attached to Union citizenship. As is clear from the legal basis chosen by the Commission, the proposal aimed first and foremost to help citizens to make full use of their right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the context of free movement, the European Year will also provide an opportunity to promote other rights. The free movement of persons is one of the four basic freedoms, but at the same time there is clearly also a way to bridge the gap between what the rules state and how they operate in practice. Citizens still encounter difficulties when moving to another Member State, whether as workers, students, entrepreneurs, job seekers or consumers. It is therefore essential that all citizens are fully aware of their legal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative will also provide an opportunity to raise awareness of other rights related to free movement, such as the right to vote and stand as a candidate in elections to the European Parliament and in local elections in the Member State of residence, the right to petition the European Parliament, the right to apply to the European Ombudsman and the right to address EU institutions, as well as a wide range of other rights, such as the free movement of goods and services, consumer protection and public health, equal opportunities and equal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much hope that this proposal will play an important role in encouraging and empowering citizens to uphold their right to engage actively at European level, not least in view of the 2014 European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the European Year of Citizens is not a one-off event. It now needs to seek the launch of a longer-term process of building awareness and encouraging participation. I know this Parliament has a pivotal role in ensuring that this is the case. We also look forward to the 2013 European Union citizenship report, which will assess progress in this area and propose further initiatives to remove the obstacles which prevent citizens from fully enjoying their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important decision which serves the interest of all our citizens. All of us – this Parliament as well as our own national governments and parliaments – have a role in helping to increase awareness of what it means to be a citizen of the European Union. We are ready to play our role. I have no doubt that the European Parliament will be very active, not just in 2013 but also beyond, in highlighting this message.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Year of Citizens 2013 will take place in a very special context, as next year also marks the 20th anniversary of EU citizenship, as introduced by the Maastricht Treaty. This is an opportunity to illustrate, with concrete examples, the benefits of EU citizenship in the daily lives of students, residents, tourists, workers, private individuals and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is ready to provide the second so-called ‘citizenship report’ on how to remove the remaining obstacles and barriers which make it difficult, in daily life, for European citizens to move around Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The year also falls on the eve of the European elections. Therefore, it is a good opportunity to remind people that participation is legally possible wherever citizens may reside in the European Union. As mentioned already, this is a matter of raising awareness of the real value of citizenship, going beyond participation in the democratic life of the European Union, as already described on many occasions, to the rights to consular protection and to petition the European Parliament, address the Institutions and apply to the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, this is an opportunity to highlight the prerogatives of this assembly, which is an assembly of people elected by the people. I am happy now that we have a solid basis between the institutions, and I am sure that together we can make the European Year of Citizens a real success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nowadays, however, the fact remains that public opinion and the workers of various countries increasingly perceive the EU as an area of inequality, exploitation and wage slavery, in which the rights that people have conquered over centuries of struggle are being eroded.</p>
<p class="contents">Let’s be honest: rather than an area of free movement of persons, the European Union is, in fact, an area of free movement of capital and goods for the benefit of international monopolies. To talk about the free movement of persons nowadays is to talk primarily about the reality of millions of workers who are unable to remain in their own country and are forced to seek a livelihood for their families by emigrating.</p>
<p class="contents">In this very difficult context, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs draws attention to the need to defend workers’ social security and trade union rights without discrimination of any kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to say, ‘What a long way we have come!’, not least because our discussions with the Council, under the Danish Presidency, did not get off to a very good start. It has to be said that the initial proposal was unacceptable to Parliament. We could not allow a European Year of Citizens with no reference to citizenship, to the way in which citizens can become more involved in the operation of our institutions and in the definition of the EU policies which given them all their place. Moreover, we are aware that we still have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p class="contents">We could not allow people to say that, if a gulf was opening up between the European institutions and their citizens, it was only because those citizens failed to appreciate their rights as regards freedom of movement. We know how things stand.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizens cannot be regarded simply as consumers who fail to appreciate their rights, and who are given a chance to vote in the European elections every five years. Education and culture also have their place in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we are blazing a trail here, making a start on the great integration project that is European citizenship, at the same time, of course, respecting the competencies of each Member State. I have only one regret, and that is that we have not given ourselves the resources to enable us to do the job.</p>

<p class="contents">I hope that this initiative will become a reality and not remain mere rhetoric. As the Committee on Petitions, which I represent here, we are making proposals, and specifically stressing the right of every EU citizen and every natural and legal person to bring a petition before the European Parliament; this right contributes to the thorough examination of democratic institutions. We lay particular stress on the right of citizens to free movement, partly as a means of attaining the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and as such we believe that the movement of young people, particularly students, is of vital importance for the European Union. It is also important for citizens to be informed about their rights, specifically through the European e-Justice portal. However, Mr President, I would like to send a message, because we emphasise these major ideas, we applaud them, but in reality we undermine them. The economic crisis we are going through has ruptured relations with citizens. I hope that the European Union will be given the opportunity to rebuild these relations.

<p class="contents">In 2013 we will be celebrating the European Year of Citizens, 20 years after the concept of European citizenship arose, when it was accepted by the European Union. This is linked not only to the free movement of goods, services, people and capital, and mainly people, not only to cross-border relations and cooperation, but also to citizens’ rights as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon, for instance the citizens’ initiative and the right of consultation, which have enormous significance.</p>
<p class="contents">If today there is a drawback in the EU, it is precisely that many of its citizens only have a general and limited picture of the EU, but do not know who does what, what their responsibilities are and at what level they act. Since governments usually believe or say that anything good comes from national governments and, by contrast, anything unpleasant comes from Brussels, the European Year of Citizens could provide the opportunity for us to understand things better, for us to raise awareness among European citizens so that they perceive that it is possible to have both access to information and also participation. Of course, Mr President, the new report that is being prepared on the European political parties deals with providing access to and direct participation in the European political parties, and this will give great flexibility, help the national political parties and in general give citizens a better understanding of what the European Union is and where it is going. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this year will be truly successful if European citizens see that they actually can assert their rights, and that the institutions of the European Union take their own fundamental principles and values seriously. Can citizens actually exercise the right to work in another country and have their qualifications recognised? Does the right to non-discrimination actually apply to everyone, for example those who seek their fortune in another Member State as Roma? Does the European Union take the guarantee of democratic rights seriously, and will it speak out if democracy is violated in any Member State and people cannot enjoy their democratic rights?</p>
<p class="contents">They are curious to know whether they can enjoy their social rights, and whether the fundamental principle of solidarity works. Will those who have been hit hardest by the crisis receive help? Will solidarity also manifest itself in the budget after 2014? If we can make progress in these areas, I think this year will be a successful one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore a very symbolic year, even a very serious year, particularly in the present context.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the latest surveys show that, since autumn 2009, there has been a very worrying and very noticeable trend towards a serious and very substantial loss of confidence in Community actions and the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>, even, when it comes to rights and freedoms, within the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, the essential question has always been, and still is, the need to consolidate a European identity, to succeed in creating a common feeling of belonging, to make a real success of defining the shape of this European citizenship, a shape which will be applicable to all Europeans. There is no doubt that this objective which has been announced can be achieved in 2013, but only by means of more information, more dialogue, more meetings, more exchanges and more sharing.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I am delighted with the excellent quality of the text, I wish that our institutions, when making their choices and decisions, would show enough determination to give themselves the means of achieving their objectives, and would thereby demonstrate a strong political willingness to practice what they preach. Moreover, though of course I am happy about the results obtained in the negotiations, in particular by Ms Papadopoulou, who showed great determination, especially regarding the broadening of the scope of this European Year of Citizens in the decision-making process, the European civil dialogue, etc., I have strong reservations about the ridiculous budget allocated to this European Year, the smallest ever given to a European Year.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the task is so enormous, I am sorry that the Council and certain members of the Committee on Budgets have refused to grant resources for this Year, which is, without doubt, one of the most important and one which, in my opinion, should be regarded as the Union’s first priority, because without European citizens we have no Europe and we cannot integrate Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These rights do need to be better understood. We know that they are crucially important and that for many citizens they are seen as the key indicator of equality within an EU setting, along with coordination of social security rights – maybe this is why certain governments and parties feel that to help make the European Union less acceptable they have to call those rights into question at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">As our rapporteur says, the EU needs to be able to answer the bigger questions about what role citizens are playing in decision-making in the European Union. The current crisis certainly makes many feel that they are on the receiving end of decisions made elsewhere, and that decisions are being made to suit unaccountable markets rather than individuals and families living with the consequences. Maybe one of the outcomes we should be looking at for this European Year is to have a real citizens’ charter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We talk about a banking union, a monetary union, a political union, but none of that can become an enduring reality if we do not strengthen the identity associated with it. I believe that this is one of the purposes served by the year we have been discussing. </p>
<p class="contents">However, we have talked only about rights. In my opinion, it is time to begin discussing citizens’ responsibilities too. It is not just a question of freedom of movement; citizenship of any country carries with it responsibilities. One of these responsibilities – and also a privilege – is the duty to vote. In some countries, it is not uncommon for the turnout in parliamentary elections to be 20 to 25 % or 30 % of the electorate. I think that we need to focus on this issue, as there are people – I have met some of them – who are not even aware that they are entitled to vote in European Parliament elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Our budget for this year is obviously limited, but I think that we MEPs need to start thinking about how and what to communicate. We must begin to exchange best practice. It is here that we must forge the European identity that we will promote. This is not an issue that can be addressed for us by the institution or through programmes. It is we who, in our conversations with people, must deliver the message. I therefore call on Members to use their time here to exchange best practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union-related rights of citizens have expanded, but this is still not enough, in my view. What is needed above all for Union identity to become a reality is the trust of Union citizens. They must assert these rights, which are enshrined in the Treaties, in practice too. The institutions, chiefly the Commission and Parliament, must strive to engage in dialogue with citizens. We must ensure equal opportunities and rights for all citizens.</p>

Under any civil law contract, such a serious change – and let me remind you that the Treaties actually include a bail-out clause – would require the assent of all parties concerned. In this case, the parties most concerned are, without doubt, the citizens and taxpayers, not the governments, nor the Commission.

This is an umbrella calendar, with any organisation or individual initiative allowed to advertise in the European Year of Citizens calendar.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about interaction with the citizens, but there are also high-level Presidency plans: understandably an opening ceremony in Ireland, as it is the Irish Presidency that is coming up at the beginning of the year, and a closing event in Lithuania in December 2013.</p>

Following this, and as a first step, all institutions and stakeholders should cooperate in order to make the European Year of Citizens a success. Furthermore, the European Year should be the cornerstone, launching a long-term and interactive debate on European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">A distinguished speaker – I think it was Mr Helmer – mentioned that the European Union is not a demos. Maybe not yet, but let us think. Would it not be better if it were to become a demos through participation and appropriation by all?

This is essential, now more than ever, given the dire times we are going through, with negative consequences in the daily lives of people and where we need to prove through effectiveness and deeds that the European Union is part of the solution.</p>

We want a better Europe, and since, as a Cypriot, I feel that I am deprived of my right to free movement in my own country, because I cannot move freely from one end to the other as a result of the Turkish occupation of European territory (37 % of Cypriot territory), I believe in particular that Europe must be an area of freedom, and of free movement, not just of ideas and commodities, but of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, all the shadow rapporteurs and I, as rapporteur, worked hard, and with special interest, on this issue. I welcome the fact that the Cypriot Presidency was very positive in receiving our messages and in fact did a very good job in bringing this dossier to completion. I trust that we will soon have available to us the second report on European citizenship, which will contain specific actions to overcome the barriers faced by the 500 million European citizens, and I trust that the citizens’ charter will also be created, because we need it.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe in a better Europe, we will work to ensure that this year is a successful year, and I regret the fact that EUR 1 million is not enough. I trust that there will be second thoughts and that the amount will be increased, because we requested EUR 5 million and in the end I heard that only EUR 2 million would be approved. Other European years had EUR 11 million, and even more, available to them. I understand that this is a time of crisis, but nevertheless, if we want citizens to be at the heart of our policies and if we want more Europe and better Europe, then the right actions and good provision of information to citizens are needed.

Among the fundamental aims that the EU wants to achieve is an increase in European citizens’ awareness of their rights, freedoms and opportunities for political participation. I welcome this impulse and will support it through my activities in the European Parliament. I shall also highlight other areas covered by this Year of Citizens: access to information for all EU citizens, support of equal opportunities for women and development of citizens’ mutual respect and European awareness. Therefore, I consider it vital to support the education of citizens – both the younger and the older generations – in areas which help to strengthen European awareness and identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Initiatives in the regions of the individual Member States are very important, because it is precisely in the local sphere that political and civic activities originate. Citizens’ initiatives represent active citizens, and so require maximum support from the countries of the EU. Citizen participation is the key to preserving, further developing and building democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I belong to a political party founded by citizens conscious of their rights and objectives. Our sense of citizenship was so important to us that we named our party ‘Civic Platform’ [<span class="italic">Platforma Obywatelska</span>] (PO). I believe that citizens are aware of and appreciate the work accomplished by PO politicians. It is worth always bearing in mind that good politics must stem from judicious concern for the common good. It was in that spirit that we founded Civic Platform and we continue to be guided by it. In addition to being Polish citizens, we also feel and are European. As Europeans, too, we should show awareness and commitment. I am certain that, as a result of the European Year of Citizens, awareness of the rights associated with European citizenship will improve. Campaigns will be organised to explain the rights enjoyed by those who study, work, set up businesses or spend their retirement in other Member States. The year 2013 will mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of EU citizenship. The rights of every citizen are guaranteed by the European Treaties, including the right to move and settle within another Member State, to vote and stand in European and local elections and to petition the European Parliament. It is important to know about and exercise these rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Citizens are more and more facing fatigue from Europe and feeling politics at European level distancing itself from the people. In these crucial times in which we seek to deepen European integration, it is essential that our citizens understand and support the efforts of politicians and institutions. Citizens are the backbone of the EU and if we want to achieve true political and economic integration, we cannot bypass the people who would actually make it happen. We have to engage in meaningful dialogue and consultation with our citizens on European issues. Also, one year before the European elections, we need to step up our efforts to explain European-level politics and political parties. For the first time, European parties will be able to campaign, and this provides an excellent opportunity to have a real European debate at all levels across Europe. Our citizens need to feel that their opinion counts, that European elections matter and that Europe is our common home. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This European Year will enable the spotlight to be trained on the rights of European citizens so that everyone knows their rights and can then assert them anywhere in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to raise the awareness of citizens – and also of national and European institutions – but too often the talk is of rights which then prove difficult to apply because of red tape and obstacles that interfere with implementing them. Our commitment must be to ensuring that, today, it is really possible for a young person – or even a not so young person – to study or work in any of the 27 Member States without feeling like an outsider, without having to jump through endless hoops, and that they are able to make use of the qualifications they already have from study in their country of origin and, indeed, to benefit from social security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It cannot be denied that there has been progress on free market issues and the free movement of persons. However, for further progress to be made on European integration, it is vital to find a basis for European civic identity. This must be based on EU citizens’ sense of belonging and solidarity and on strengthening the democratic elements of its decision-making. As a matter of principle, the European Union must, in the framework of the European Year of Citizens (EYC 2013), strengthen knowledge about the existing rights of EU citizens. Awareness of EU citizens’ rights will create a generalised pressure on the representatives of Member States, facilitating a more intensive integration process. Therefore EYC 2013 is a very important initiative. All the European institutions, in co-operation with civil society, should try to improve the general level of knowledge about such fundamental matters. One especially important, responsible task is to create new stimuli for the section of European civil society that supports a more profound integration process. As the sole EU body elected by citizens, the European Parliament must play a leading role in that regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As direct representatives of our citizens we have an obligation to inform them to the best of our abilities of the work and legislation that is handled by us. I feel strongly that the dedicated year of 2013 should only be used as a springboard for our future efforts to incorporate the citizens of this Union. I consider this undertaking to be crucial in educating society and bring it together to learn more about EU integration, values and policies, about the impact that EU legislation has on their lives and to help make them a part of this legislation by taking greater roles in the development of the EU. The EU uses the Year of 2013 as an opportunity to involve citizens in constructing and developing the programme. It will use all possible information and dissemination tools to raise awareness of the EU and attract public and media attention all across Europe. These occasions will develop a greater sense of belonging to a European community among EU citizens. Only with great communication between the EU and ordinary citizens can we contribute to Europe’s success and its standing in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
