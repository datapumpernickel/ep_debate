<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carrilho (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, I think it has become increasingly clear that issues of cooperation and of development today lie at the heart of international policy. It is crucial that we achieve more effective cooperation and are more successful in the objective of the sustainable development of various parts of the world as the essential condition for a more secure and more peaceful future. It is within this strategy that the Union European must put its strengths to advantage in the field of external policy, not least because it is the only area in which the European Union can come out on top without necessarily causing victims. Decentralised cooperation could be considered to be one of those ideas, which appears discreetly, as part of a line of thought and of action that comes together in the approach I have just mentioned. It is a concept that needs greater clarification. It is, therefore, appropriate that this should be included in the Commission communication on civil society and development, which Commissioner Nielson promised us for the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, for its part, has always seen decentralised cooperation to be a development approach that deserves all our support. Nevertheless, the Cotonou agreement also emphasises the importance of the contribution of civil society to development and suggests that ‘it can be enhanced by strengthening community organisations and non-profit non-governmental organisations in all spheres of cooperation’. The initiatives and actions covered by the line of support to which this regulation refers are designed precisely to promote a more participatory form of development, the strengthening and greater diversification of civil society, as well as of various structures at grassroots level with a view to building democracy. These are, in fact, some of the main requirements for achieving an effective reduction in poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is now, in the words of the Commission's explanatory memorandum, ‘to move on from an experimental phase to one of consolidation of the concept on a larger scale in the context of official cooperation’. We fully agree with this objective. It is true that the issue deserves a debate with greater participation from us, not least because it deals with the codecision procedure, but the Commission submitted its proposal at a time when the regulation’s period in force was almost at an end, and if it is not adopted at first reading, a legal vacuum would be created that would damage precisely those that we are trying to support. Bearing this concern in mind, intense work was undertaken, in a spirit of mutual cooperation, that involved speakers from the NGOs and representatives of the Commission, the Council and the Spanish Presidency. Our contribution as the European Parliament focused on providing the regulation with greater coherence and cohesion. Some amendments were tabled, and in the explanatory statement I provide an account of our efforts to find an identity, if I can put it like that, for decentralised cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, if the proposals before us are adopted, we will have a regulation on decentralised cooperation that guarantees us the following: firstly, an instrument that is extended to 2003 with a financial framework of EUR 24 million; secondly, the commitment to consolidate decentralised cooperation as a guide for cooperation policy, which gives a more significant role to local players, thereby giving them an incentive to take greater responsibility in the process of developing the very societies in which they live and in their relationship with their Europeans partners; thirdly and lastly, the commitment to the future existence of decentralised cooperation as a method for strengthening the objectives stated by the Commission itself for the “appropriation by the partner countries of their own development strategies and of the widest possible participation by all sectors of society”. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that the negotiations with the Commission and the Council have not been easy and that, above all, the time available was very short, which brings me to my first point. I have the impression that the Commission and the Council, certainly since the European Parliament was granted codecision powers in Amsterdam in the field of development cooperation, have a tendency to try to rush proposals of this kind through Parliament. And due to lack of time, there is, in fact, little opportunity for us to discuss these matters in any great detail. And if you ask who will ultimately be responsible for how the money is spent, it is not the Council, nor the Commission, but we, the people’s representatives. It is thus regrettable that there is so little time available.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to the report on decentralised cooperation. As you know, to us, Christian Democrats, civil society is not just a hollow phrase. And we are pleased that other groups are also gradually beginning to recognise its importance. Needless to say, the involvement of NGOs and social organisations in granting aid to developing countries is of key significance. It is an important step on the road to greater independence and a higher level of self-sufficiency for the people in the affected areas. What we should bear in mind – and various NGOs with whom I have been in contact concerning the report remind me – is the importance of a well-defined framework for decentralised aid in order to prevent this aid from becoming fragmented. This brings me to the amendments I have tabled on behalf of our group. In order to provide targeted, decentralised aid, it is important for the Commission to give us the expected notification about civil society promptly. Mrs Carrilho made reference to this as well. The organisations on the ground, those who are actively involved in the countries themselves, would like to know where they stand. And the promise was that the Commission would have this notification ready under the Belgian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agreement of Cotonou underlines the role of civil society. However, it is important for non-ACP countries too for a preliminary debate to be held about this, so that decentralised cooperation can be placed in a more strategic framework and so that we gain more clarity concerning the future of this Regulation; in other words, on what is set to happen after 2003. This is why I wanted the Commission to be explicitly reminded of this promise in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all watching the events in Zimbabwe unfolding with sadness. We notice how a country which, to a large extent, relies on aid from the EU, treats all appeals from the same EU for fair and democratic elections with contempt, and even forces us to withdraw our observation mission. Is this not the ultimate proof that the traditional model of development cooperation does not work? Personally, I am convinced that development from the bottom up, which directly involves small groups of citizens, has a far more positive effect with an eye to the fair, democratic and self-sufficient society which we hope to build. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rod (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, the European Parliament was behind the creation of a budget heading for decentralised cooperation in the 1990s. The Lomé Convention Section 4a also incorporated this idea, thus departing from the principle of cooperation between States. Now, according to the Commission, the concept has gained ground and proved that it is valid and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore proposing that its application should be extended by two years. We can only approve that proposal, although we have reservations regarding its form. As well as the fact that it is transitory, the Regulation remains vague. It contains a little of everything: decentralised cooperation, civil society and NGOs. Could it be that there is a lack of Commission strategy in this area? In the same way, the Cotonou Agreement dedicates the participation of civil society in the ACP countries to the partnership, at the expense of decentralised cooperation, which seems to have disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication on civil society in developing countries promised by the Commission several months ago should have clarified these notions and set out a coordinated approach for the European Union in this area, but we are still awaiting it.</p>
<p class="contents">The two areas of ‘aid for decentralised cooperation’ and ‘aid for civil society’ go hand in hand. In both cases, the goal is to support local dynamics, avoiding the cumbersome nature and sometimes the lack of transparency of implementing national programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission appears to have realised this, as it plans to merge these two budget headings, but the limited adjustments that are being made, without consulting the European Parliament, are not sufficient. The transfers of funds from one budgetary heading to another demonstrate a lack of an overall perspective and show little consideration for the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, of course, in favour of direct aid to projects on the ground. But we are somewhat irritated with last minute action. This reform of the budget can only be done as part of a thorough review of the concept of decentralised cooperation and of relations with the NGOs of the North and the South. These two extra years should therefore be used for in-depth discussion on the European Union’s cooperation with local players in developing countries and their contribution to sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">We should look at the definitions: what is decentralised cooperation, cooperation between sub-national entities in the North and South or aid to local and regional authorities in developing countries? What is civil society? This question is becoming increasingly urgent with the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement. The real question is in fact the more general one of governance and democracy. In order for the countries of the South to develop they will have to become democratic, which means that citizens need to become involved in directing the country.</p>
<p class="contents">They can take part in several ways: by voting for local, regional or national governments. In this respect, support for elections and increasing institutional capacity at the different levels of decision-making and administration are essential. They can also take an economic and social role in companies or associations. Direct aid to NGOs and SMEs is therefore equally important.</p>
<p class="contents">These two aspects are not contradictory but do in fact complement each other. The Commission must continue the debate and continue to push it forward as it is high time that we provided the local populations with the resources for development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The objective of our proposal was simply to extend the legal basis for the decentralised cooperation budget line for an additional period of two years. This will ensure the continuity of the budget line and give time for a thorough discussion with all the partners concerned on the role the budget line should play in the strengthening of local actors in the South. In his speech, Mr Rod suggested that we have not been engaging in proper consultation, but the fact is that by doing what we are doing, we are, in fact, ensuring that consultation takes place. The outcome of this discussion should then provide the basis for a revision of the strategic guidelines for the decentralised cooperation instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand Parliament's concern that the various instruments to strengthen local actors should be integrated into a coherent strategy on the involvement of civil society in the South in development cooperation. I agree that there is a need to have a debate on this. A communication on a strategy to support civil society in developing countries is planned for the second half of this year. As has been mentioned, we had promised this communication earlier, but we started out on too narrow a basis, which did not offer a global perspective. And has been said here, we have systems which vary quite a lot among the ACP countries and the rest of our partner countries. We expect the debate on civil society involvement to feed into the discussion on the continued promotion of decentralised cooperation and the future of a specific budget line in this area. I would like to make one more comment on this: the support we can give to NGOs and non-governmental actors in the future in ACP countries is something that goes far beyond the power and potential of this budget line. For countries outside the ACP, the situation is different and much more dependent on the individual strategy that we agree with each country. This does not rule out the possibility of similar action if it is agreed with the partner country.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there is broad agreement on the benefit of urging European NGOs to work in partnership in the South. This was, in fact, the main idea behind this special cofinancing budget line. In a sense, this budget line could be deemed a phenomenal success because we have brought it into the ACP philosophy and we are now also urging NGOs in general to engage directly with partners in the South. This is the background against which we think it useful to have a broader and more open discussion about the virtues of a specific budget line for this item, but my own decision is that we need a broad, open discussion and should give ourselves enough time to allow everybody to participate in the discussion. This is exactly what is being made possible by the report we are discussing at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed amendments are mainly intended to ensure compliance with the latest comitology procedures and coherence with other recently adopted regulations in the area of development cooperation. They also clarify the eligibility of some civil society actors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is happy to agree with all these amendments. They reflect well the fruitful discussions between the rapporteur, the Council working group and the Commission services.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Council will also agree to all Parliament's amendments and that the regulation can thus be adopted as soon as possible in terms reflecting this first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
