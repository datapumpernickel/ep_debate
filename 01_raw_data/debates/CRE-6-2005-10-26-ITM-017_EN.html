Let me add my words of welcome to our colleagues from Ukraine. If we should ever feel lacking in confidence about Europe and its values, then the interest of people such as our Ukrainian friends should tell us that the values of Europe are strong and are much envied by so much of the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My purpose in coming here today is to report back on what we intend over these coming weeks to be the basis of the UK Presidency. I have with me Douglas Alexander, who is our Europe Minister, and after I have left he will stay to answer more questions – especially the difficult questions!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">However, I shall be here I am pleased to say for at least an hour and a half to hear both your comments and to answer some of those questions myself.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to explain at the very outset how we want to take forward the Presidency over these coming weeks. On 23 June in Brussels, we set out an essential vision of how we should combat the challenge of globalisation. I think it is agreed generally in Europe that we need to get Europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction. The question is how we do that.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have an opportunity, both in the informal summit, which is tomorrow, and then in the formal summit in December, to set out that direction and put in place the specific policies to match it. So, over these two summits, our idea is first to agree on the right direction for Europe economically, then, secondly, to set out some new priority areas for European action and then, thirdly, on the basis and in the context of that, to get a budget deal in December at the formal Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall first of all come to the informal summit. This is what I want to come out of this informal summit. The first thing is that I want to get that informal summit to agree effectively on the Commission paper presented by President Barroso and the European Commission. That Commission paper is an analysis of the challenge of globalisation and how we meet it, both as Member States and as the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that it is a stark analysis, but it is the right analysis. It shows just how great a competitive challenge we have from the emerging economies such as China and India, never mind the United States and others. It shows how important it is we deal with the almost 20 million unemployed people in the European Union. It shows how we must make our labour markets less restrictive, how we have to make sure, in the field of research and development, innovation and other areas, that we catch up with the best practice in the world. It shows how in areas like energy – where after all we are going to be importing within the next few years something like 90% of our oil and gas needs – Europe has to up its game considerably, and it shows also the enormous demographic challenge that we will face, with fewer people of working age, more people in retirement, and more people therefore needing to work. As a result, issues such as work/life balance and how we allow people both to raise their families and to work in the workplace are all the more crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing we want to do at the informal summit is to get that paper agreed and make that the basis for the discussion we then have about Europe, its social model and its economic future. However, we also want to add some specific areas of future priorities for European work. I should like to mention some of those.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of these areas of future work, we are also, as the Presidency, publishing some papers today from academics within the European Union on certain aspects of the challenge we face in each of those areas. Those will be published and available to Members of Parliament and people attending the summit tomorrow. But what are the new priority areas we should be thinking of?</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is research and development, and innovation. We need to make sure that more of the European budget is spent on those priority areas, because those are the future areas for the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We also need to coordinate better the way in which we work in these areas. We propose specifically a European research council that is the equivalent of the American National Science Foundation, that will support the funding of research and development projects and give us the chance in Europe to be forming the world-beating companies in the technologies of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">So, one major area for future priority work is research and development. The second area is energy and energy policy. I believe it is time to develop within Europe a common European energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For far too long we have been in the situation where, in a haphazard and random way, energy needs and energy priorities are simply determined by each country according to its needs, but without any sense of the collective power that we could have in Europe, if we were prepared to pool our energy and our resources. That policy should focus not on new regulatory barriers, but rather on obtaining a genuinely open energy market. It should deal with, for example, a properly integrated European Union grid. Already this is done on a bilateral basis between countries. Think of how much greater economic power and competitiveness we could have, if we were prepared to make sure that it was integrated on a Europe-wide basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we, like other major countries in the world, should be prepared to enter into dialogue at European level with key suppliers of energy, to use our collective weight to make our voice heard. Thirdly, we need to be developing clean technologies, energy efficiency and coming to some common views at least about the possibilities and perspectives on issues related to areas such as nuclear power.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I thought certain things might get a mixed reception.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">These are areas we need to work on in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area concerns universities. Let us be clear about the situation in Europe today. Our university sector is not competing in the way it needs to with America. China and India are developing their university sector in an extraordinary way. Looking not just at the spending of our tertiary education sector, but also where we are getting the value-added in the connection between business and university, we do not have anything like the same possibilities in Europe that they have in other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal is that we task the Commission specifically to report back to the European Council next year on the challenge facing European universities, how we compete with the United States, how we get more public-private partnership into sustaining them and more graduate schools linking business and the academic world across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a fourth area I would like to suggest for priority work, and that is how we control migration, but also use it to boost the effectiveness and competitiveness of the European economy. We need both to make sure that we have the proper controls on illegal immigration at the same time as recognising that controlled migration can actually bring a benefit to our European economies.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">One of the papers that we published today is a paper from a French academic, Patrick Weil, who has also been an adviser to politicians in France, which points out how, ironically, those countries that have opened their labour market to those from the accession countries – the accession ten – have actually benefited economically from that opening up. We need to take those lessons further.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The fifth area concerns the need to make far greater progress on what I might call the demographic or work/life balance issues. Now here it is not appropriate for the European Union to be engaged in substantial bouts of extra regulation and so on, but here is where the open method of coordination could work properly, in things like work/life balance, childcare and provision for people to be able to raise their family and work at the same time, in how we get the best practice in pension and social security systems across Europe. This would be sensible if we are looking at how we can modernise the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The final area of priority work concerns what was called by the European Commission the globalisation fund. I just want to make one thing very clear about this idea. The important thing about the globalisation fund is that it should not be a fund that protects companies that need to restructure, or failing companies, or one that bails out companies that cannot succeed. What it should do, however, is protect and help people in circumstances where restructuring has made them redundant or left them facing difficulties within the labour market. To take an example from the UK recently, where thousands of people were made redundant at the Rover works: we did not stop the restructuring, because, I’m afraid, it was economically necessary, even though tragic for the individuals involved. However, we provided real help with retraining, re-skilling and finding new jobs for the workforce in order to protect not the job but the individual. Such a fund, if it is done in the proper way, will help rather than hinder us in meeting the challenge of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What we want to propose at the informal Council tomorrow is that we should agree the basic direction in the Commission paper and then, in the six areas of work I have just outlined, that we should set out how we can make progress in each of those areas in order to enhance the competitiveness of the European Union and also its social solidarity in helping people adjust to the challenge of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, tomorrow, arising out of the special Council that we had on 13 July, we want to propose measures for a counter-terrorism strategy in order to get agreement to those measures at the December Council. Those should focus on things like the radicalisation of people inside the European Union, the protection of our infrastructure and, in particular, how we exchange information and protection more effectively, how we retain that, how we get cooperation between the different security and police services inside the European Union in order to protect our people better and, as the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, said to you when he was here in the European Parliament, we are happy to deal with this under the first pillar, so that it can be part of the codecision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If we can agree that tomorrow, then I believe that we have the beginnings, at least, of the right context in which we can get a financing deal.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these other issues, there are outstanding dossiers, and let me just say a word about those now. On the working time directive, I hope we can reach agreement under the United Kingdom presidency – we will certainly try to do that. In respect of the services directive, we know the position taken by the European Parliament; I still, however, hope that it is possible to get political agreement on the right way forward, because – and I say this in all sincerity – the services directive is a necessary part of completing the single market and it is important for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I decided to come to the European Parliament today and was unable to attend the British Parliament – this is a sort of reminder, so thank you for that!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like specifically to say – and this may get me into further trouble – to the President of the Commission, whom I congratulate on the work that he has done over the past few months, that Commissioner Verheugen’s proposals on deregulation are an important indicator that Europe is prepared to regulate where it is in the interests of its citizens, but prepared also to deregulate where it is necessary for our competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This will be giving our Ukrainian colleagues an excellent example of what a modern democracy is all about!</p>
<p class="contents">When we come to the December Council, it is our intention to do our level best to reach a financing deal. I want to make it quite clear and I know from conversations I have had with Members from the accession countries that for all of us the European budget is important. As we know in Britain, there are major issues that arise in connection with it. However, we should remember – that is, we, the 15 Members of the European Union as was, some time ago – that for the ten accession countries, this is of fundamental importance to them. I acknowledge our responsibility, as the Presidency, to do our level best to reach agreement. I hope we can do that, whatever the particular level of the budget may be.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make one other point. If we are to get a budget agreement – and I know that people want it in the European Parliament and they want it in the European Council, too – we will be in a better position to do so if we have agreed an economic direction and new priorities for work, and if those can then influence the outcome of that budget debate. That budget debate has to make a start in this financing deal, in reordering the priorities, and it has to be able – through the review process – to give us a forward perspective of a more rational way to spend the European budget in today’s world.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want our economy to meet the future challenges, at some point we have got to make sure that the budget is aligned with the economic priorities of our citizens and of our business and of our workforce.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on external relations, in respect of climate change you will know that we had successful agreements with China and India, as well as Russia, on the issue of how to take forward a proper dialogue on climate change. In particular, I would commend to you the coal demonstration plant with near-zero emissions that we have agreed with China for Europe to build. That could be an important signal for the future. I am perfectly happy, in response to questions, to say more about climate change in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we hope we can get agreement at the December Council on an Africa strategy. Europe can be proud of what we have done in respect of development, but the truth is we need to do more. We also, incidentally, for these reasons hope to secure a successful outcome to the WTO negotiations in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of defence, it is just worth pointing out that, when we began the process of European defence, people were very sceptical. Today we have nine different European missions around the world undertaken by European forces and that shows that European defence can indeed work. Of course, we have had the accession negotiations with Turkey and Croatia opening. Our aim therefore is to get the following things done: agreement on a new economic direction; new priorities for European work in areas like research and development, energy, universities, migration, demography and so on; and a future financing deal that is fair, begins to address those priorities and gives the future prospect of being able substantially to reorder the European budget. We also want a set of conclusions in the area of justice and home affairs that allows us to combat terrorism and illegal immigration, whilst taking the benefits of proper managed migration. We want to take forward our defence, particularly the common defence policy, in areas like strategic airlift and air-to-air refuelling.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to get clear conclusions in December on a development strategy for Europe in respect of Africa and to make sure that we keep to a strong process of change in order to combat greenhouse gas emissions and the environmental challenge we face.</p>
<p class="contents">We came to the point a few months ago where, as a result of the ‘no’ votes in the referendums, there was a sense that Europe was in paralysis. If we want to get Europe moving again and in the correct direction, then we have to agree both what that direction is and the specific measures to get us there.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are able, in the course of these next few weeks, to offer at least some explanation and answers to our citizens on how we meet the challenge of globalisation, how we provide greater security in an era of global terrorism and mass migration, and how we can have a foreign policy that uses Europe’s collective weight for the benefit of the citizens of Europe, then we will at least have made a start on putting Europe back together again, on the right track and moving forward.</p>
<p class="contents">No one Presidency can achieve all of that, but if we can achieve what we set out here, I think it will be significant.</p>
<p class="contents">I came here today in order to report back both on what we had done and what we intend to do over the next few weeks. I can tell you we intend to report back again and make sure you are kept constantly in touch with the deliberations within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may end on this point, it is important that we make sure that, in addressing these challenges, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council work together and work together closely. That is our desire. As is obvious from the debates you have and the debates we have with you, we are not always in agreement. But to return to the point I made at the very beginning, it is also obvious from those up in the gallery watching our proceedings that Europe has an immense amount to be proud of and it is time we showed our citizens that the next fifty years can be as good as the last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Mr Blair, ladies and gentlemen, the informal meeting at Hampton Court will, I hope, be an opportunity to hold a genuine debate on the economic and social challenges confronting Europe. I hope that it will not only be a debate, but also – as the President of the Council, Mr Blair, has just said – an opportunity to make decisions about the path to follow in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, in Brussels, I presented to you the decisions that had been taken that very day by the Commission for the benefit of the Hampton Court Summit. I will not go back over that presentation. I will just point out that, in addition to a document on the economic and social challenges linked to globalisation, the Commission has also approved an initiative aimed at restarting negotiations on the financial perspectives and has contributed to a political agreement that we consider to be necessary and urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank you for the support you have given to the document prepared by the Commission and I want to reaffirm in this Chamber, before you and Mr Blair, that we want to help find a solution to the budget issue, because if we truly want to show that Europe is moving forward, then we need to have a decision on the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, as we know, there have historically been high levels of prosperity, social cohesion and environmental protection, and a high quality of life, compared with other regions in the world. However, it is also true that there is a lack of social justice. Today, there are 19 million unemployed in the Member States of the Union. The gap between rich and poor is too great.</p>
<p class="contents">In many of our large towns, we have serious problems relating to integration, which require emergency measures. The truth is that this situation is in danger of worsening in the face of the simultaneous challenges of an ageing population and of globalisation. Without doubt, globalisation creates great opportunities, but it also threatens certain sectors of our Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is certain: maintaining the status quo is not an option. There is an urgent need for reforms to be undertaken and for Europe to be modernised. If we want to retain our European values, then we have to modernise our policies. That is why we are proposing ambitious reforms by emphasising the need to avert two dangers.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, there is the danger arising from those who believe that Europe is only, or principally, a market. They are mistaken, because an enlarged Europe – the Europe of 25, and more than that in the future – has to rely on a structure of social cohesion and political coherence, both internally and towards the outside world, if we want to support this project. We must never take for granted our great European project, but we must fight each day to strengthen it.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there is the danger arising from those who believe that it is possible to make Europe a power at the same time as there are 25 micro markets for energy and 25 micro markets for services. If we want to make Europe a genuine power, then we have to fully implement the internal market. Our competitiveness in the globalised world depends on our doing so.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span> </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union has a central role to play in pushing forward these ambitious reforms and the modernisation of our social systems. Success depends on getting the right combination of action at European and national levels. We need to make full use of all the instruments at our disposal: legislation, as Prime Minister Blair said, and we are pushing for better regulation. There are cases where we need more legislation and others where we need less bureaucracy and less legislation. We cannot deliver the future European Union budget without the instruments, along with multilateral surveillance, shared experience, and all the mechanisms that we have at our disposal. The Commission’s executive powers, the right of initiative of the Commission, the effective use of competition rules: we have the instruments to complement and to add value to – not to replace – what we do at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">At international level, too, Europe is the right level for action. Let us be frank: even the biggest Member States in our Community do not have the leverage to manage globalisation or to speak exactly on the same footing with other global powers. We are a successful example of globalisation on a regional scale. Our deep integration, our common policies and our shared values give us an added strength that no individual Member State can claim.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, in order to tackle poverty around the world, to project European values worldwide and to negotiate in the interests of our Member States, it is better to reaffirm clearly that we need a strong European dimension. I state very clearly: we need now, more than ever, a strong European Union in this globalised world.</p>
<p class="contents">These instruments are mutually reinforcing; they depend on each other for success. In the paper that the Commission prepared for the informal summit, we put forward some lines of action. Let me underline some of those aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the creation of the globalisation adjustment fund to cope with the consequences of globalisation on those people who, for instance, are affected by restructuring. As Prime Minister Blair said – and it is precisely the original idea of the Commission as well – the purpose of this fund is not to protect firms that are not competitive or not economically viable, but to help people. At the same time as we are in favour of opening our economies, we should show that we also care about people. People are not statistics. We have to have an active policy to meet their concerns and aspirations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very thankful to Prime Minister Blair for the support he has given to this fund.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have also identified some areas where the partnership between the Commission and the Member States can be further explored and strengthened – areas which primarily fall within the Member States’ domain, but where the Commission can play a major role, either as an honest broker, a catalyst or as a focal point of benchmarking, of mutual surveillance, of collective action. For instance, as the Prime Minster said, and as we have said in our paper, we are in favour of a common approach at European level on energy. I will add just one more to the very good examples he gave: the important area of bioenergy. I believe we can do much more in that area, bringing together the fields of environment, agriculture, research and the funds we already have at our disposal. So there is a possibility of work between the European institutions and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area is research and development, and we hope to get the funding necessary for that to have some action at European level because we need that dimension. We need to ask ourselves why the best minds in Europe, and also in China, in India and in many parts of the world, go to study in the United States when we know that the best universities were founded here. Universities are a European creation, so why are they going elsewhere when they could be here? We also need to complement action at national level with a European action for universities, for research and for innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission is ready to present to the European Council a roadmap setting out the path to a modern Europe capable of delivering economic prosperity and social justice.</p>
<p class="contents">So my message to the summit will be clear: if we want to keep our European values, we must modernise our policies, and it is better if we do that together. We should call for a personal commitment from all European Union leaders. We, the European institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – have to do it together. Also the Member States, regional and local authorities and the social partners – we have to work for this change. I know change is never easy, but let me tell you: inaction is much worse and much more costly. If we do nothing it will be much more painful than if we change now with our values and with our determination.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I think that Hampton Court should also provide a positive message to our citizens on the role Europe can play in the world in terms of security and the projection of our values, be it in terms of development aid or the management of globalisation. It is important that we also define this new role of Europe in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that our discussions tomorrow will allow a consensus to emerge on the scale and urgency of the challenges we face and the need to move ahead. I think this consensus, this common vision, is necessary. This new consensus is necessary to reconnect Europe with its citizens and also to prepare the ground for further progress in our European project.</p>
<p class="contents">This consensus and this sense of urgency are necessary to reach agreement on the budget and the Financial Perspective, hopefully, by the end of this year. I thank Prime Minister Blair for the renewed personal commitment he gave to these goals here today. It is difficult, but it is possible and it is necessary. The task of responsible politicians is to make possible what is necessary. That is why we are now working very hard. We have been working very closely and very intensively with the UK Presidency. I want to thank Prime Minister Blair and all his staff for the very competent work they are doing and I want to reaffirm to you, the European Parliament, and to Prime Minister Blair, that we will be working hard to ensure the success, not only of tomorrow’s summit, but also of the December summit, so that we have Europe on the move again.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hans-Gert Poettering, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I address you, Mr President of the European Council, quite deliberately as such and not as ‘Prime Minister’. While it is thanks to the office of Prime Minister that you hold the presidency of the European Union, you are there not to defend British interests alone, but rather those of Europe as a whole, and it is by the way you do that over the coming weeks and months that we shall judge you.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This debate is being held at the right time and in the right place. Tomorrow, you and the Heads of State or Government will be meeting in a palace, in – as befits such as they are – distinguished surroundings. I hope that the name of Henry VIII is not a bad omen and will not have a baleful influence on the future of Europe. While it is common knowledge, Mr President of the European Council, that neither you, as Prime Minister, nor your party, belong to my – our – political family, I would like to give you a great deal of credit for being here today, here in the European Parliament, among the representatives of the European people. It is tomorrow, then, that the Council of Heads of State and of Government meet, and that gets the sequence of events right: first, the European Parliament in Strasbourg and then Hampton Court Palace on the outskirts of London.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We wish you success, Mr President of the European Council, in re-establishing trust among the 25 Heads of State or Government. Your presence here today does indeed help to build trust, for all three European institutions are present. I will also say by way of appreciation that, tomorrow, the President of the European Parliament will be present throughout the day, and that too is something new. It ought, in future, to be taken as read that the President of the European Parliament should take part in all the meetings of the European Council. If you can make this a well-founded tradition, then you will be doing European democracy some good.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish you success in making clear, tomorrow, our desire for a strong Europe in one world, by which I mean that we may not detach Europe from the world; on the contrary, this Europe of ours must help respond to the great problems of the world. One thing, though, is clear, and that is that we would be able to cope with none of these major problems were it not for the European Union. Europe may well not be the solution to all the great problems, but we will be able to solve none of them without the concerted action of Europeans in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation affects not only the economy, although that is what everyone talks about. Globalisation is, of course, an economic process, but, at its heart, it is about the fact that we are one world, and that represents a challenge – intellectually, morally, culturally, politically and, of course, in economic terms as well. If handled in the right way, globalisation has something very positive about it. What we are and what we do is underpinned by human rights and human dignity. Countries like Cuba or the People’s Republic of China will, in future, no longer be able to say that what they do – if anything – about human rights is a merely domestic matter. On the contrary, what globalisation signifies is human dignity for everyone on this planet, whether they be Americans, Europeans, Chinese or Cubans. Human dignity is shared by all; that too is part of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Nowadays, everything is interconnected. This morning, a colleague told me that the Commission, which already works very well with the WTO, could well become even more involved in it in terms of its presence on its committees. I cannot pass judgment on that, but that is what I have been told. The fact is, though, that what goes on in the WTO is not just about economics, and I would like to give an example of what I mean by that. I have made many visits to Morocco. If you walk through the streets of a Moroccan city, you will see a lot of young people, and that is of course a very good thing, but, if these young Moroccans are denied opportunities, if we do not open up our market, even to agricultural products – that can be done only step by step rather than overnight – then these young people have no opportunities in their own country, and they start knocking on the doors of Europe, as we see them doing in Ceuta and Melilla. That is why the World Trade Agreement is a profoundly human issue rather than just an economic one, and in addressing it we must take our political and moral responsibilities seriously.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause, heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is now talk of a fund, and our group asks that we take another, very careful, look at that. At a time, many years ago, when I was involved in the Committee of the Regions, there was restructuring going on in the steel sector, and Europe helped with that – not by means of maintenance subsidies, but by means of educational measures. It is of course possible to envisage something similar being done for those industries that find themselves in difficulties as a result of deregulation and globalisation, which would involve these funds being used to run retraining schemes. The money to do this is already there in the European Regional Fund, and it is for that reason that I ask that we take another, closer, look at this option.</p>
<p class="contents">That there is a need for flexible labour markets is not a matter of doubt. There is also a need for bureaucracy to be reduced. Thank you, Mr President of the Commission, for putting before us a good proposal as to how this might be done. </p>
<p class="contents">I ask you, Prime Minister – not in your capacity as Prime Minister but as President-in-Office of the European Council – whatever you decide tomorrow, not to take any formal decisions. But, whatever you might prepare to decide, in working groups for instance, you must include the European Commission. We will not allow an intergovernmental process to decide the future of Europe; we want the institutions of Europe to be involved in the whole process of the development of Europe. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> I regret to say that my speaking time is up. You are a good communicator – everyone knows that. If the results of your presidency at the end of 2005 are equal, in terms of quality, to your communications skills, then we will be very satisfied. We will then give our final answer in December or January. I wish you much success, which, if you achieve it, will be success for us all.</p>

<p class="contents">The 7 July attacks in London were attacks on European civil society. They were attacks on the British people, but they were more than that; they were attacks on all of us. That is why your response – not only as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but also as the President of the Council – was a response on behalf of us all. The Labour government’s response, with an appropriate combination of rigour in public security and dialogue with the people, was the right one. It was one of the successes of the British Presidency of the Council, and one for which I want to thank you.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">When, though, tomorrow, you discuss the European social model, you and the Heads of State or Government will be discussing a social model that has been developed progressively in Europe over a period of 50 years since the end of the Second World War. At the heart of this development was the consistent coupling together, for the first time in economic history, of economic and technical advances with social progress. All economic and social growth went hand in hand with more social rights and greater social stability. That is the formula that has made the European social model such a success.</p>
<p class="contents">Now there are more and more so-called economists, even at governmental level, who have been telling us for years that further economic and social progress is conditional upon the destruction of social cohesion, with lower wages, longer working hours, and fewer rights for workers and trade unions. To that we say ‘no’, for it destroys the European social model. That is the path that Commissioner McCreevy has mapped out, and we ask you, tomorrow, to close it off.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You are right to say, Mr President, that the European internal market and its development present us with a great opportunity. Yes, of course, we want the free movement of services, but what we do not want is the free movement of social dumping in Europe. If the country of origin principle is to be used as a means of wrecking social standards, then that is not the services directive that we want to see.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Vigorous applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The market produces many things, but solidarity is not one of them; that we have to create for ourselves, and it is above all a task for the states. We, here in the European Parliament, must help them to do that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That, too, is what those who elected you expect. While Mr Poettering has had something to say about a lot of things, he has not had much to say about the summit that awaits you tomorrow. With that summit in mind, Mr President of the Council, I have something to ask of you: it is that you should ensure that the summit focuses on what the Commission has given us as its theme, on the fact that the fundamental precondition for a successful economy in Europe is not the destruction of social cohesion, but rather the truth that the profits that businesses make are a good thing because that is what businesses are there for, but that those, namely the workers, whose labour earns the profits, must benefit from them and keep decent jobs with decent incomes, from which they can feed their families. If that is the goal of the European Union, Mr President of the Council, then we Social Democrats stand side by side with Labour.</p>

Yet, six months on, as your reception here has demonstrated, many cannot, or will not, think beyond the terms of Liberal Europe versus Social Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear. Over 90 % of the eurozone’s GDP is from countries whose social costs are too high. This poses a danger to our economic future. Yesterday’s solutions are no longer an option.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to realise that globalisation is not for tomorrow but today. It harbingers huge opportunities for wealth creation and intercultural exchange, but also cross-border challenges like migration, climate change and internationally organised crime. It challenges our social welfare state, and the German model, which seemed to work 20 years ago, no longer does. As my German friends tell me, it is <span class="italic">kaputt</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union is to prosper in a global community, we must combine reform of expensive social models with a new determination to build a single market for goods, services, capital and labour. With more invested in research, innovation and education, the single market delivers the wealth which pays for our social policy. It is not an economic and social Shangri-La, sheltered from all the pressures of the world, but it caters for a common response to a common challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us go on to build the common policies in energy and home affairs of which you speak. The United Kingdom opposed these in the European Convention, and we welcome your change of heart. Many on the Left, particularly in this Chamber, perceive reform of welfare systems and market-opening as threats. But, as my colleague Bernard Lehideux pointed out last week, a free market economy and social solidarity can go hand in hand. Indeed, if economic Liberalism is complemented by Social Liberalism, we can offer our citizens the security, prosperity and opportunity they expect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is neither the American way nor the Gallic way. It is, perhaps, the Third Way, which Social Democrats seek but have not found. Because, as Richard Crossman warned you years ago, the problem with too many on the Left is not that they lack ideological maps for the new territory they are crossing, it is that their leaders believe that experienced travellers no longer need such maps.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office, I do not envy your task at Hampton Court. But do not give up. The European Union is not only capable of reform: it yearns for reform. What it needs from the Presidency is leadership. Leadership must consist of more than the occasional good speech, as the British Conservatives may soon come ruefully to reflect.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come to lead from the front. The success or otherwise of the UK Presidency will only be fully assessed in December. You must convince the doubters that under your leadership Europe can live up to the high expectations you set for us.</p>
<p class="contents">That means high ideals. What are your ideals for Europe, Mr Blair? Abandoning ideology and trusting focus groups to get a government re-elected is not leadership. It is followership. Ideology gives us the moral fibre to take difficult decisions at home and stand up to thugs on issues of human rights abroad, giving us a foreign policy we can be proud of, not ashamed of; making us proud to be Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Your difficulty, I suspect, is that some Member States doubt Britain’s solidarity. They see the UK like that explorer in the jungle who, when the band of explorers froze at the sight of a tiger ready to pounce on them, slowly took off his jungle boots and slipped on a pair of running shoes. To the colleague who whispered, ‘you must be mad, you’ll never outrun a tiger!’ he replied, ‘my friends, it’s not the tiger I have to outrun.’</p>
<p class="contents">If Britain were in the euro and fully in Schengen to show solidarity, its authority and influence would be greater.</p>

<p class="contents">These skills of yours do not, however, make up for the fact that the great Summit on reviving the European social dimension now seems to have been downgraded to an amicable chat among friends on the most disparate subjects, particularly economic reform and competitiveness. Conversely, you still do not want to discuss the common energy policy, which is already contained in the Constitution, although its only use now seems to be to revive the old nuclear debate. I think you could have chosen something better to bring Europe closer to the people. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear, if you drop the country of origin business, I think we can have a deal, or at least we can start to discuss it and have a deal. If you want to do that, let us try to discuss it. If you do not want to drop it, I think it would be very difficult to find an agreement with this Parliament. I believe that in any case, even if you are trying to get a political agreement in December, you might have to wait a bit before claiming victory since we do not vote until January. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Mr Blair, ladies and gentlemen, it is not enough to say that we need more research and more innovation, but in my view we need to determine the subjects and direction of this research. Mr Blair, we should really like you to tell us what feasible concrete proposals you have to enhance Europe’s competitive potential in the fields of renewable energies, environmental technologies and energy efficiency – other than nuclear power or protecting the chemical industry giants, of course. That would help us to achieve a real synergy between the strategic economic benefits and the environmental challenges posed by globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">In your speech and the Commission’s we noticed a lack of any clear proposals on the international dimension of the battle for the European social model, or a strategy to promote on a global level those values of solidarity, democracy, human rights and health that everybody says they want to uphold.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blair, we do not believe that there is a plan D or a plan B that can work. The real, true turning point for social Europe – and for Europe plain and simple – would actually be when you abandon the terrible idea that the European project can be revived by cutting the Union’s budget. It is on that point that we really would like you to change your mind.</p>

Everything is fine up to that point.</p>
<p class="contents">On the last point – the social model – the British Prime Minister even appeared to have a recommendation to make to the whole of Europe, which he himself embodies in his own country. Is it not the case that unemployment in the United Kingdom has been reduced to 5% of the active population? Such a success story deserved to be examined in more depth. What is therefore so special about this Blair model, given that the priorities of the UK Presidency are in perfect harmony with those of the entire Union? What could be more Blair-like, in actual fact, than the action plan of the Lisbon Agenda, revised in 2005?</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the fact is that, in the United Kingdom, unlike in other Member States, the majority of these reforms have already been, or are due to be, carried out in full. It therefore seemed a good idea to my group, before the extraordinary meeting at Hampton Court takes place, to discover how this pilot experiment carried out by a 21st century liberal Europe is assessed by those it affects most – the British themselves. We therefore listened for two whole days last week in London to what members of the main trade unions, members of feminist movements, members of Parliament from the Labour Party and employees of British universities had to say. The least that can be said is that what we learned does not lead us to believe that this type of model might enable the Union to overcome the peoples’ disaffection with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning our attention, now, to the matter of employment. Our speakers listed the numerous devices used to bring down unemployment figures. Hence, the United Kingdom has more than two million people classed as suffering from long term illness and others classed as being unable to work. As if by chance, only 2% of people are classed as unable to work in a well-off town in the south of England, while in the poor region of South Wales, the equivalent figure is 32%. Our speakers also told us that there is a enormous lack of job security, particularly for women, three-fifths of whom work part-time in underpaid jobs with no prospects, while the men suffer some of the longest working hours in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The extent of poverty was another aspect of the situation highlighted by our British friends. In addition to a large number of unemployed and working poor, one female pensioner in four lives in poverty in the United Kingdom. Child poverty has even reached the staggering figure of 54% in inner city London.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of public services: although no one denied the increase in spending that has taken place over the last three years, we were told – and I quote – that the benefits offered, and methods used, in the public sector have been modelled on those of the private sector, with profitability as a concern. Ten thousand hospital beds have thus been done away with in the last eight years. Summing up the general feeling, one researcher told us that, in our society, citizens are all too often left to their own devices, faced with market forces. Go on, laugh, ladies and gentlemen, I am talking about what the representatives of the social forces in the United Kingdom told us. Go on, laugh.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, a wonderful breath of fresh air of humanity came to us from our meeting with the trade unionists who organised an illegal solidarity strike this summer at British Airways involving the 800 male and female immigrant employees of the US sub-contractor Gate Gourmet, all of whom had just been made redundant so that their jobs might be filled by other, less costly, employees. Together they fought back and won, and dignity too prevailed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is our conviction that the notion of the European social model is too precious to be tarnished. It does not sit well with the cold and detached laws of the market. When people finally sit up and take note of this obvious fact, then, and only then, will Europe fare better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You said that the people were blowing the trumpets around the city walls, that unemployment was 20 million and that productivity rates were falling behind the US, and you pledged to peel back bureaucracy, which was music to eurosceptic ears.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps that is why you have chosen Hampton Court for the summit tomorrow: Henry VIII was, after all, the first English eurosceptic. So what has happened since? Well, the Commission announced it was going to stop 68 new laws, and then yesterday we were told that a further 200 pieces of legislation would be repealed over the course of the next three years. So it all looks rather encouraging. However, the truth is that it is all window dressing; it is a game of smoke and mirrors and the clue was Commissioner Verheugen’s comment that better regulation is not deregulation. The European Commission will not give up its power; there will be no real economic reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1497 the British Parliament has made 25 000 laws. Since you became the European Council President, no fewer than 2 500 legislative instruments have been passed. Unless you can find your way out of that maze at Hampton Court tomorrow, this will be your legacy and proof that Europe is not working!</p>

I would also like to thank the President of the Commission for being with us.</p>
<p class="contents">Having listened to some of the contributions from both the Prime Minister and some of my colleagues as presidents of groups, the situation could be summed up in words such as ‘meeting the challenge of globalisation’ and ‘exploiting the opportunities that it brings’. In reality, when we look at what we have to deal with at the forthcoming European Council informal summit, there should be four guiding principles towards that: solidarity, generosity, responsibility and capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">The solidarity in question is to ensure that there is protection not only of the social model, as we see it, with the basic tenets of what that social model should contain, but also that there is solidarity with our fellow Member States and those who require the most income now and the most transfer of wealth to assist them in the redevelopment and upgrading of their infrastructure, systems and markets.</p>
<p class="contents">There should be generosity, by the richer and larger Member States, towards the smaller States to ensure that they are protected and are given the opportunity to exploit these new advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">There should be capacity, to ensure that we can deliver on behalf of our citizens, because whatever ideology you speak of, whatever ‘-ism’ you want to put to it, the real test of political work, the real test of new legislation, is about improving people’s lives on a daily basis, making sure that the lives of the ordinary man and woman on the street are better, that they have employment, social security, a proper health service and a proper education service. These are the real issues that should face us as we go forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should put the negotiations on the financial perspectives into a smaller context, because – whatever the percentages involved – the responsibility, the capacity, the generosity and the solidarity that I spoke of are equally as important in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us not overturn an agreement on the common agricultural policy that was made in 2002. Let us ensure that we do not drive against one section of society for the so-called benefit of other sections of society. Farmers and agricultural workers have had a difficult enough time up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to you, Mr Blair: Be strong, be firm, be true, but most importantly of all, be not afraid. To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw: some men see things as they are and wonder why; I dream things as they should be and say, why not? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is good to see you, Sir.</p>
<p class="contents">Like your predecessors, John Major and Margaret Thatcher, you came to power determined to set aside the legacy of British ambivalence towards the EU. Yet, like them, you soon came up against the hard knocks of reality. Like them, you were forced to realise that the aspirations and ambitions of the EU are entirely contrary to British interests.</p>
<p class="contents">You were welcomed in 1997 by European leaders, who believed that you were the man, finally, to bring Britain into the heart of Europe. Yet you never dared to face down the hostility of the British people towards the euro and now you never will.</p>
<p class="contents">Your offer of a referendum on the EU Constitution torpedoed the whole project; it led directly to the French referendum and to the ‘No’ votes in France and Holland.</p>
<p class="contents">Last June you made a very successful speech in this Chamber, yet your Presidency has run into the sand. You have little or nothing to show for it. You are here to survey the shattered wreckage of your broken European dreams. Your own Labour MEPs have opposed your modernisation agenda at every turn, notably on the working time directive. It may be New Labour in Westminster, but it is old Labour in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">So I should like to offer you a positive and constructive suggestion: depending on the outcome of the current Conservative leadership contest, it seems very likely that Conservative MEPs will leave the Group of the European People’s Party, perhaps as early as Christmas. It is too leftist and federalist for most Conservatives. For your part, you must be sick to death of the old-fashioned Socialists of the PSE Group, so why not pull your troops out from the PSE Group and apply to join the PPE Group? I am sure that the PPE leader, Mr Poettering, will look very favourably on your application. After all, Mr Poettering is about as New Labour as they come!</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Tony Blair, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Thank you very much, Mr Helmer, for those constructive thoughts. If indeed you are the future of the UK Conservative Party, we look forward to a long term in office!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter and applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me try and respond to the points that have been made, and, as Henry VIII said to his wives, ‘I will not keep you long’!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If I can begin, first of all, by welcoming very much what President Barroso said; obviously I agree strongly with it. The Presidency and the European Commission have been working carefully on the Commission paper that is the subject of our meeting tomorrow. I shall try to deal with some specific points and then come to one general point.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to what Mr Poettering was saying, I agree entirely with the point on the WTO; it is very important, and everyone understands we cannot get immediate change fundamentally to the common agricultural policy, but it is important we get a forward perspective of change. In respect of the fund, I think we are in agreement: if this fund is about helping people cope with the consequences of globalisation, that is a good thing. If it is simply about propping up companies that have failed, that is obviously not something we want to do. But it is very much the former and not the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in relation to what Mr Schulz was saying: first of all, can I thank you very much for those words about 7 July and the terrorist attacks in the UK. It means a lot to my country to have you say that; thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the social model, I hope I can answer some of those points in a moment, but I would say again, right at the outset, that we should never destroy social solidarity. What we should always do is make it relevant for today’s world. That is the purpose of what we are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of the point that Mr Watson was making: I agree that I do not think it is choice between a liberalised Europe and a social Europe in that stark sense. I hope that the Commission paper and the new areas of work that we are proposing can get people out of feeling that they have to choose so starkly between the two.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Frassoni, <span class="italic">molte grazie</span> – that is about the limit I am afraid! You asked at an earlier meeting and again today about the areas in which we would cooperate in research and development. I said to you then that biotechnology is one very clear area. This is a major area for the whole development of healthcare and for business in the future. Europe should be a leader in biotechnology, and if we are not careful we are going to be overtaken even by countries like India.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental technology is another area. I want to give one example that I think people would have been deeply sceptical about 20 or 30 years ago. It took some imagination from people at that time to put the concept of Airbus together. Over these past few years, we have gone from a position where Boeing was literally completely dominant in the market to a situation where Airbus today is a European venture of which we can be proud and which is competing with the very best anywhere in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes it helps if we pool together in Europe our research, our development and our innovation across Europe in order to get the scale of challenge that we need implemented. If we are able to do that, and if we are able to meet the scale of the challenge in the way I have suggested, I think, in other areas, too, we can develop world-beating companies across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wurtz, I do not know who your interlocutors were in the UK, but I will give you some new ones when you come next time, if you do not mind! Let me just say to you, in respect of unemployment, that we have two million more jobs in the UK. The New Deal for the Unemployed is the biggest programme of any country in Europe to tackle unemployment. We were the government that introduced for the first time, in the teeth of Conservative opposition, a statutory minimum wage. We have the working families’ tax credit and other help for the low paid. We have lifted 700 000 children out of poverty and two million pensioners out of acute hardship, and our public services have meant that we have the best school results, and falling hospital waiting lists, for the first time in 20 years. That is a very good social record.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have to say to you that it has always been my experience in politics that at a certain point there are parts of the Left that join forces with the Right to decry modern progressive governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Farage, you talked about Commissioner Verheugen’s agenda for getting rid of redundant legislation and, as far as I can make out, you actually applauded what he was doing but thought that he had used the wrong terminology. I do not really care what terminology he uses, but it is important, when the European Commission is getting rid of unnecessary regulation, that there is a place, as I said to you in our meeting earlier, both for better regulation and deregulation. Sometimes, Europe needs to regulate, and then it is the correct thing for Europe to do. But Europe should only regulate where it is necessary and Europe should not interfere in areas where it is unnecessary. I think that is the right position for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Crowley, I heard what you said on the common agricultural policy. Again, I understand. Of course we are not saying we can change the whole system overnight; what we are saying is that we should in the future have a different perspective for reform.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to finish on this point: there is a responsibility on the UK Presidency and the Council; there is a responsibility, of course, on the European Commission. There is a responsibility also on this body, on Parliament, and our common responsibility is this: at the present time, the real danger that we face in Europe is that our citizens and our people are increasingly perceiving globalisation as a threat. However, globalisation, if we are intelligent about how we handle its consequences, is not a threat: it is an opportunity for us.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yes, it is true that, when you go to China and India, you are struck by the sheer size of the scaling-up of their industry and their business. Incidentally, it is no longer true that China, India and other countries like them are competing on the low-value-added goods and services. They are now competing at the top end of the market as well – it is true. That does not just apply to China and India, incidentally. There are countries such as Vietnam, for example, that a few years ago people thought of in a completely different context, but today it is an emerging economy. All of this is true. It poses a huge competitive challenge, but it also poses a huge competitive opportunity for us because those countries are going to need financial services; those countries are going to need technology; those countries are going to be importing goods as well as exporting goods.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to have the confidence in the European Union to overcome that competitive challenge. It is not a question of abandoning social solidarity. If we end up having the debate in those terms, it will lead absolutely nowhere. No one is going to believe that it is right for the European Union to abandon its social dimension. I support the social dimension in Europe, but it has got to be one that enhances our competitive challenge for today’s world. Why? Because, if our businesses are not succeeding, if our workforce is not competitive, if we do not put people back into jobs, what is the social dimension? It can only be a true social dimension if it enhances the prosperity, the living standards and economic future of our people. That is what this debate is about.</p>
<p class="contents">So, of course, in the modern world, with the single market being completed, it is true that there will be competitive challenges as our markets open up, but there will also be opportunities. Yes, it is true in today’s world that there will be delocalisation; that will happen. However, we can re-train, re-skill. We can give people support in finding new jobs. We can, for example in areas such as work/life balance and the social security systems, find new and better ways of supporting people.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a process about abandoning the social dimension of Europe; it is a process that is about change. And change, after all, is what the European Union has always been about. The European Union should be the institution, above all, that can be confident about changing. It was change that led to the European Union. It was change that led Europe, in the wreckage of war, to decide that its future was going to be different to its past. Look what we have today: countries living and working together in solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The answer to anybody – British Euro-sceptic or Euro-sceptics from other countries – is ‘look at this Parliament today, the different countries that are here, the accession countries freed from tyranny and dictatorship, here, as part of this Parliament’. Why should we not be confident?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mr Matsakis held up a placard which read: ‘Cyprus is still a British colony’)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yes Sir, and your country is now in the European Union thanks to the strength of Europe!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we can make this competitive challenge work for us. We, in Europe, who have managed to overcome war and disease, who have created 50 years of prosperity – are we really incapable of modernising our social model in the way that we want? Of course not! We can do it, and we can do it if we have confidence. We can do it if we are prepared to face up to challenges in a realistic way. And we can do it if we listen to our people.</p>
<p class="contents">What our people are saying to us today is something very simple about Europe. They are not saying – which is why I disagree with Euro-sceptics – ‘we do not want Europe’. They are saying ‘let Europe answer the concerns we have. We are worried about globalisation, we are worried about security and terrorism, we are worried about the threat to our environment’. Let Europe be relevant on these issues. That is how we rebuild support for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I said to you when I came to this Parliament back in June that the first vote I ever had was in the referendum on Europe. I voted ‘yes’ and I have never regretted it. I am a pro-European, I have always been one and I will remain one. But it is the pro-Europeans that need to lead the case for modernisation and change.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Do you believe that the Euro-sceptics want change? They would delight if Europe did not change since it would allow them to replay what is essentially a narrow nationalist argument within the frame of making Europe more effective.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is up to us to take these measures forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, we will have the informal summit. Let us agree the Commission paper. Then, let the action follow, not just from the Council and the Commission, but from here in this Parliament too. Let us act together and make a Europe relevant to its citizens a reality. We can do it. We can do it if we have the confidence, the belief in ourselves and the courage to make the changes our citizens want. That is what I say and that is what we shall do.</p>

But, speaking, as I do, for the real and responsible Conservative delegation of MEPs who believe in constructive engagement in this House and in Europe, I want to thank the Presidency for the Prime Minister’s statement. He gave us a shopping list in June, but he has not informed us today of the safe delivery of the items on the list. Instead, he has produced another shopping list for us, merit worthy though it may be, and I want to know – and I am sure his minister will answer this – when delivery will take place. A common energy policy was referred to by the Prime Minister. It seems to me that is a reversal of a previous position and I would like some clarification on that.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Prime Minister was here previously, he stated in this Parliament: ‘The people of Europe are speaking to us. They are posing the questions. They are wanting our leadership. It is time we gave it to them.’ I very much welcomed those comments but I am bound to say that they seem to have failed their test. Indeed, the Prime Minister is reported to have said that his own Presidency has stalled. Others across the political spectrum have lined up to express disappointment with the lack of progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the agreement on proceeding with care in accession negotiations with Turkey, and it is important that we send a signal to the people of that country, but the rest of the agenda seems to be stuck in a rut. The Council will discuss economic reform and the challenges that the EU faces with globalisation tomorrow, but where are the concrete proposals from the Presidency? Where is the answer to the real challenge that Europe faces from India and China? Where is the leadership on the Doha Round? The Prime Minister says that it is progress on liberalising world trade that we need, but the process seems to be bogged down in a failure of political will on the part of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Where is the leadership on the future financing of the EU? Surely, it must be understood that the United Kingdom and others have vital interests. Is the Prime Minister prepared to defend those? Could he or his minister tell us what the position is? Does he agree with the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Prescott, when he said that Britain was ready to do a deal with the British rebate without any fundamental reform of the CAP? Where is the leadership on the future of Europe? We thought that, during the ‘pause for reflection on the Constitution’, we might have had some answers, but we have not.</p>
<p class="contents">I said at the outset of the Presidency that it should be judged not by rhetoric, but by results. There are two summits to come on the Prime Minister’s watch, so there is time to make real progress between now and the end. We had hoped that the rhetoric of his speech in June would now be matched by some solid progress. Sweeping difficult problems under the carpet for future presidencies to grapple with is not the kind of leadership we have been led to expect from the Prime Minister.</p>
<p class="contents">Time is short, winter approaches. We wait for some real results.</p>

They now believe that Europe is not really protecting them against the worst effects of international competition and sometimes even that these policies are attacking their social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hampton Court summit must respond to these concerns; it must send a clear signal that the European people are determined to defend their social model and therefore to stop setting it in opposition to competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">No, contrary to what the Prime Minister claimed before this Parliament in Brussels four months ago, it is not the European social model that is responsible for the 20 million unemployed in Europe, it is the weak growth in the large countries in the Eurozone, the lack of coordination between the budgetary and monetary policies, which do not support internal demand and investment, and the lack of investment in research and innovation. On this latter point, I see that we are in agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I also note, however, that you have given up on this rhetoric, which was supposed to be a boost to your presidency but which has instead lead to stagnation, to a degree of isolation and to the risk of getting bogged down. Indeed, it is not by destroying the social model that we will restore the competitiveness of our economies and create confidence in Europe, but rather by placing the emphasis on Europe’s strengths, on the quality of its infrastructure, including the communication and energy infrastructure, as you mentioned, on the skills of the workforce, on better coordination between research centres and universities, on a common industrial policy in the sectors of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we would prefer to emulate the policies pursued by the Nordic countries: more investment in research, more rights to life-long training, maintenance of a high level of solidarity and redistribution, and high-quality public services. Their success shows that there is, in terms of competitiveness, an alternative to the destruction of collective protection systems and a reduction in the level of solidarity. They show that reform is not necessarily synonymous with regression. Reform and modernisation of our social systems will only be accepted and understood by the citizens if they bring new protection, new opportunities and new weapons for all to face competition, change and globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">If reform and modernisation mean aligning our social systems and our economies with the harshest market economies, this will contribute neither to the confidence of the citizens nor to support for the reforms. That is why it is vital to negotiate them with the social partners, and to relaunch the social dialogue, with the aims of harmonising rights to the highest level and ruling out social dumping between Member States, and that is why we are in favour of an internal market in services, but against the Bolkestein directive, which is aimed less at an internal market in services than at a weakening of the social model and of services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there will be no dynamic Europe without an ambitious financial perspective. It is vital to reach an agreement within the Council without further delay, particularly for the Member States, and we are delighted at the announcement of an agreement on a number of directives adopted by Parliament at first reading and now blocked: the Working Time Directive - but we hope that this agreement takes the same direction as the European Parliament’s vote at first reading, in other words abolishes the opt-out, and I am sure you will tell us if this is the case – the Temporary Agency Workers Directive, the revision of the European Work Councils Directive to increase employees’ rights when faced with restructuring, and, finally, the drafting of a framework directive on services of general interest. With regard to deregulation measures ...</p>

I am obliged to him for saying this. Even though this reflected both reality and the way the public feel, it was a bold thing to say, and the reactions of the other Heads of Government are evidence of that. I do ask you, though, to keep to your priorities; they are vital to our future, and when people like Gerhard Schröder criticise, remember that he has been voted out of office and no longer has a mandate to speak for Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the MEPs belonging to the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcomed Tony Blair with placards bidding him ‘make EU laws in public’. In so doing, we are responding to another of his announcements, which was that he intended to make the Council’s sessions open to the public. We ask him to make that announcement, too, reality.

When the Prime Minister spoke to us in Brussels in June, he said that the UK Presidency wanted to resolve difficulties with the services directive, the working time directive, and to take forward a budget deal. Today he said exactly the same about these very difficult issues.</p>
<p class="contents">At this late stage in the UK Presidency, it seems an empty presidency. We have zero progress and continuing uncertainty. Still no budget for 2007 and it is not only in the accession states that this is a major concern. The UK Government proposals would lose Scotland one billion pounds in structural funds and lose Objective 1 funding for Wales. We have uncertainty in our rural communities because the UK has suddenly withdrawn support for the agricultural funding package only recently agreed. We have uncertainty, too, about what will take the place of the now dead Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Zero progress. What a contrast with the recent presidencies of Ireland and of Luxembourg: small, successful, independent nations whose achievements in their six months in office were immense and excellent examples of the independent status which I believe would be best for Scotland and which my Welsh and Catalan colleagues also aspire to for their countries. Zero progress, it seems, until the December summit. It seems to me that to store up so many difficult unresolved issues for one formal summit agenda is a recipe for potential disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, may I just say that the final act of the UK Presidency will be to chair the Fisheries Council in December. Can I make a plea that for once – just once – the UK Government makes the survival of Scotland’s coastal and island communities an economical and social priority, not something to be sacrificed at the negotiating table? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you offer the whole of the British rebate, you will not get a budget compromise by December. There will be no feather in your cap from the old Brussels centralists and champions of agricultural subsidies. For them, you are too modern. For us, you are not modern enough.</p>
<p class="contents">What we miss hearing is a declaration on your part that the Constitution is dead and buried and a statement calling on us to start afresh and to allow supporters and opponents of the Constitution to draw up a common discussion paper. We should then directly elect a new Convention which would draw up either one or two proposals which would then be voted on in referenda in all the countries simultaneously. In that way, the voters would decide our common future, and we should obtain that distribution of power between Member States and the EU that the voters want to see. You could then use your last months as EU President to guarantee transparency in Council meetings and to ensure that elected representatives have access, upon demand, to all the documents from the 300 secret working parties in the Council of Ministers which adopt 85% of all legislation behind closed doors. You could also compel the Commission to publish the names of the members of the 3 000 secret working parties that prepare our laws. Give the elected representatives some insight into the laws and into the work that goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">Two hundred out of a possible 220 members of the European Convention endorsed making everything open unless it was closed, in contrast to the present situation in which everything is closed unless it is opened up. All the elected representatives put their names to this, as did 23 out of 28 governments, but not Great Britain’s, even though Peter Hain would have liked to have appended his signature. He was unable to do so on behalf of Mr Blair’s Foreign Ministry. As EU President, Mr Blair can cut straight to the chase. Only a simple majority is required to change the Rules of Procedure in the Council so that, in the future, everything is open unless a qualified majority decides on an exemption. It is a very simple proposal, signed by 20 of the present 25 countries. Have you the will to put the proposal to the vote? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we have heard clear statements on strategic sectors for reviving the European economy, including energy, research and infrastructure. However, they are just words, because everything depends on agreement on the financial perspectives. In that respect – despite the reassuring statements – we are not convinced that there is the determination needed to bring the talks to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, too little was said about the new European social model, particularly on the eve of a Summit that is supposed to be dealing precisely with that. Above all, we are not convinced by Tony Blair’s enthusiasm for reviewing the working time directive, which runs the risk of becoming a tool for contractual blackmail against a growing mass of atypical, temporary workers. Nor are we convinced by his enthusiasm for the so-called Bolkestein directive, which in its current form just threatens the rights of workers and consumers while creating a mere 600 000 jobs in the best-case scenario: an elephant giving birth to a mouse!</p>

<p class="contents">The reason why I announced that he had gone astray was that I think he is too reticent, too self-effacing, in his approach to public European debate, to the seeking of answers to the questions the public ask and to the problems that we face.

Although I think the one he gave on 23 June was better, we have, today, heard him deliver his second good speech, with the right analyses, vague suggestions and plenty of announcements. I have to tell you, Mr President, that you are now well over half way through your presidency, and your record to date is not one of success; you still have much to do to make your presidency of the Council a successful one. To do that, fine rhetoric and polished speeches will not be enough.</p>

You know that this will have repercussions for the policy of economic growth, for solidarity with the new Member States, for investment in innovatory policies and for the strengthening of social justice and competitiveness within the context of globalisation. Not for agriculture, since that must be paid religiously, being an obligatory expense.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate you, however, because we have returned to something essential from a previous era, a principle that was used during the era of the so-called ‘Jacques Delors’ financial packages. First we define and agree on the European Union’s political priorities ― we would like to do both at the same time ― and then, as the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Blair, has pointed out, we agree on the necessary financial package. But this will remain nothing more than words if we carry on with the straitjacket of a percentage, because the accounts will not square with all the priorities that have been mentioned. It should perhaps be deduced from Mr Blair’s words that the figures that have so far been bandied about in the Council are going to be renegotiated. I believe that we must act consistently with what we advocate and provide the necessary financial instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">In June, this Parliament carried out its duty as budgetary authority. I believe that you now have the serious responsibility to do yours and to seek a common position within the European Council, because the saying is true: ‘What is not in the budget is not in the world’. Unless all of our words and priorities are accompanied at the same time by a political will and by the necessary funding, they will be of no use whatsoever.</p>

You prevented an agreement being reached on the Financial Perspective in June, and it seems, so far, that the only achievement of your Presidency of the Council will be the opening of negotiations with Turkey, as if vision has been replaced by a headlong rush into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, you will not resolve this crisis without reaching agreement on the budget of the EU. You will not resolve this crisis without the prospect of strong, democratic institutions. You will not resolve this crisis with less Europe. Above all, you will not resolve this crisis by giving the impression that Europe can be limited to economic agreements or to one large market. Europe is primarily a political project. Mr President, Europe is expected, within the Union by all those who know that it is the only possible response to globalisation, and outside the Union by all those who aspire to a better balance of power in the world.

I should like to make two points in response to the questions raised in the letter sent by Prime Minister Blair to his guests. In order to create more jobs and growth in Europe, all we need to do is to deliver on the prosaic promises we made 50 years ago. By this I mean equal access to an open labour and services market. I propose that such issues should be dealt with first, before moving on to Europe’s hazy political future.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it possible for us to achieve more together? The answer to this question is a resounding yes, but our achievements will depend on the extent to which we believe in the European project. This belief is inextricably linked to the existence of an open labour and services market to which everyone has equal access, and to the old Member States demonstrating solidarity with the new EU Member States in budgetary terms. Reluctance to complete the common market or to adopt a budget based on solidarity will undermine belief in the European project in those countries where such belief is currently strongest, for example in countries such as Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">Please remind Mr Blair of this link, Mr Alexander, and ask him to keep it in mind and make it clear to other guests at Hampton Court, even though some might regard this as blackmail.</p>

After all, with its mass regularisation policy, the Socialist Government in Spain is responsible for the dreadful events around the Spanish enclaves in Morocco and it has to be said, in all honesty, that both countries’ immigration policies have failed.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need, therefore, is the simple confirmation that our continent is not an immigration area, that our Member States today are already being affected by enormous problems as a result of the presence on our territory of millions of immigrants who cannot be assimilated.</p>

In reality, it has taken Mr Blair four months to present us with proposals, proposals with which we cannot fail to agree because, in any event, they are already part of our own plans.</p>
<p class="contents">When he talks about research and development, energy, training, immigration controls and the challenge of democracy, there is nothing new in Mr Blair’s proposals. It is nothing but empty rhetoric. From one grand speech to another, Europe in crisis is slowing down, while the world is moving very quickly. Thank you Mr Blair! Mr Blair’s Presidency is an absent one, a Presidency that makes no proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in concrete terms, what progress has been made since July? I have looked everywhere, but I have not yet found any measures that respond to the expectations of the citizens. There has, it is true, been the opening of negotiations with Turkey, but the citizens of Europe did not really want that ...</p>
<p class="contents">In June, Mr Blair lamented the fact that only two of the top 20 universities in the world are in Europe, but what has he done in practice to change that? Mr Blair stated that research was the cornerstone for remaining competitive. We totally agree, but what are his specific proposals? What is he actually going to do to stop the brain drain?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally Mr Blair, what have you done to make Europe more popular? We do not want Europe to be sacrificed on the altar of government stinginess! A budget on the cheap will never be accepted in this Parliament; and it is not a question of exchanging the British rebate for the CAP, but of finally giving Europe the means to match its strategy. We cannot build the European Union with nothing but dreams and grand speeches. I am afraid that Mr Blair has paid too much attention to Shakespeare who said that ‘ambition … rather makes choice of loss than gain which darkens him’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I, however, would like to welcome much of the progress made by the Presidency, particularly its involvement with Parliament and the constant attention by ministers to the wishes of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the progress that has been made on justice and home affairs and the very personal commitment by the British Home Secretary to involving Parliament on data retention and making this a first-pillar issue, which is a huge step forward for relations between the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the progress made on Africa; the progress made on better regulation, particularly continuing the six-Presidency programme in relation to that, and the first commitment of the Presidency to work with the European Commission. I welcome the progress on enlargement, particularly opening negotiations with Turkey. We know that was a very difficult decision, that there are many Member States with genuine concerns, and it is a great credit to the British Foreign Secretary that he was able to keep that process on schedule. It would have been a disaster for Europe if it had faded away. We have opened negotiations with Croatia, and I notice that the British Deputy Prime Minister is there today furthering those negotiations, and we are making progress in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, I welcome what the President-in-Office has said today, particularly about energy policy because, as the acting President will recall, it was something I made reference to at the Labour Party conference. It is our failure to get the single market fully completed that is important, as well as transport infrastructure and energy infrastructure. What is missing in Europe is that we have a delivery deficit. Governments have got to put their money where their mouth is and deliver on their promises. I hope that will happen at the summit.

<p class="contents">There are increasing indications that the outcome of the British Presidency will be bad news for the European Union.

Firstly, because it was a highly political speech and we need political speeches in the European Parliament, because they make a change from our routine and because at the same time they undoubtedly have the capacity for renewal and regeneration, which is something I believe we must not underestimate. We could go on to say many things but we must not in any way undervalue or play down the importance of Mr Blair’s speech this afternoon, nor the speech he made on 23 June of this same year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that, above all, I welcome the fact that he identifies certain priorities, certain problems and, at the same time, he indicates what leadership means, that is to say, the capacity to chose, to synthesise and to concentrate the political efforts that the European Union must make.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, what we need is for that list of problems not just to be accepted by Mr Blair, but also by the Council that will take place this weekend in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it should be stressed — and this is what I felt was most lacking in Mr Blair’s speech — that, between the significance of the orientations he has indicated and the actions to be taken, there is an element which he has not mentioned: he must make an effort to define the political role that the European Union must play in relation to these issues, as my colleague Mr Karas pointed out a few minutes ago. Orientations are not enough and actions are not enough. There is an intermediate stage: to define the European Union’s role in the fight against terrorism, in immigration and in universities. And that means an effort by the Council, and the European Council must urge the European Union to give up some of its competences, some of its sovereignty, so that the European Union and its institutions can play the role that unquestionably fall to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is my hope that this excellent speech, which I do not undervalue, will not end in just one more frustration at the end of this six-month Presidency of the European Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we want to move forward, as the President-in-Office of the Council has proposed, we need a motor, which is the euro ― and we must remember that the most competitive country in the world, since we are talking about the economy, is Finland, which is in the euro ― we also need a fuel, which is the budgetary agreement on the Financial Perspective and, furthermore, we need a chassis that works, which is fundamentally the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the areas that Prime Minister Blair has raised, research and development and innovation, they are in the perspective, and, in these fields, the greatest cut has been made; energy policy, this can be moved forward, since it is not a Community field; the universities, they are not; Erasmus, yes, can also be increased; and immigration, which is very important: we must promote the European Borders Agency, re-admission agreements and assistance for Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the fight against terrorism, there has been a change of position since 7 July; Minister Clarke said here that if the Constitution were to move it to the first pillar that would be an important step.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the British Presidency has a great opportunity to present proposals aimed at making these objectives a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The demographic rate and working population of Europe are falling in an alarming way and, according to figures published only yesterday by Eurostat, the only way to overcome this deficit is through immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">The birth rate of 1.5 children per couple is well below the natural replacement level of two children for two parents. The working population in 2020 will be 20.7% less than in 1980, which is the equivalent of 20 million fewer workers. The population of Europe is growing older: in 2020 there will be 19.1% more elderly people than in 1980. All that has a negative effect not only on health, pensions and public finances, but also on the prospects of growth in Europe, because we are losing dynamism.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons are many, but among them surely is the failure to safeguard and promote the family, the fundamental building block of society and a fundamental value of European civilisation. We are finding out that disregarding our values has not only a social, but also an extremely negative, economic impact. Such conditions would appear to make the Lisbon objectives difficult to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, should we do? We need to return to the values that inspired the founding fathers of Europe to realise a dream that is in danger of being shattered just as it is about to come true. That is why, if we truly wish to create a new European social model, each institution must rely on the central importance of the individual. This social model should take as its inspiration the principles of the social market economy in which competitiveness, competition and the role of free initiative and of entrepreneurialism as a whole should have as their main aims full employment and the welfare of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Much must be done to create balanced growth, including the need to review – and I agree with Mr Blair here – our energy choices, and to devise financial and project instruments. In the coming weeks, the Council, the Commission and Parliament will have to face difficult issues: the liberalisation of services, the Financial Perspective and agriculture. If they set out, however, without a strategic plan based on the values on which our society is founded, then all their efforts will be in vain. Mr Blair is right when he says that we have a great legacy to uphold. Let us do so in a way that does not destroy it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was not convinced there was any prospect of delivery. What the Union needs is not beautiful words, but concrete delivery and for that a multiannual budget is a burning and immediate need.</p>
<p class="contents">Two-thirds of the way through this invisible Presidency, we are still where we were in June. Hopes rose in the new Member States. Today they are disappointed and worried because of the gap between promise and performance. Lack of budgetary perspective hampers their efforts and long-term economic programming, and deprives them of the benefits of membership. The 2004 enlargement needs to be equipped with the financial tools to bridge the gap and to sustain social and economic cohesion, based on the principle of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In June we heard about political leadership. The expectation of many was that there would be such leadership on budgetary questions. Are we any closer to a satisfactory solution? We heard about a confident Europe looking at enlargement as an historic opportunity to build a greater Union. Can we really have more Europe with less money, if any money at all? Why is the budget not on the agenda at Hampton Court? The EU’s credibility is at stake here. The deadlock needs to be broken. We are running out of time. How to face the challenges of globalisation and the social model? You intend to discuss in Hampton Court whether the Union is equipped with the proper financial instruments. That is putting the cart before the horse. Instead of delivery we have vision. Vision without real content is an illusion, and not much use to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two months left, President-in-Office, to fulfil the promise to take us forward to the budget deal. Our appeal to you is to use all the skills of the Presidency to deliver a budgetary perspective. There is a Polish proverb: he who gives quickly, gives twice. The European Parliament has delivered a decent, reasonable, bigger budget. This is not ideal but good, better than what the Council is able to deliver, if it can deliver at all. Why can the Council not take it up and approve it? Please think it over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will be delighted if the Financial Perspective itself reflects this new consensus in European politics regarding priority tasks. However, as a representative of the new countries, including Slovenia, I feel it is my duty, to emphasise that attempts to formulate new priority tasks in the budget should not be used as an excuse for postponing the adoption of the Financial Perspective in December. Indeed it is essential, particularly for the new countries, that the budget be adopted as soon as possible, since otherwise we cannot properly draft our own budget programmes for the successful securing of finances from European funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Not least because of the timing of this afternoon’s debate and discussion, it has been, I would argue, both a timely and a useful debate on the strategic issues facing Europe in the years ahead. These are issues that go to the very heart of how Europe faces up to globalisation and, as our Prime Minister concluded, both the threats posed by globalisation and, just as significantly, the opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom Presidency, be clear, is keen to find a consensus on that future direction of Europe and to see that the views expressed here today by Members of this House are reflected in proposals in this area. I pay tribute to the leaders of all the political groupings we have heard from today for setting out their views so clearly and directly. I should also like to thank President Barroso for his contribution to the discussion. The substance of his input, together with the Commission paper to which he referred – the paper on European values in a globalised world – are testament to the extent to which Member States and the Commission share a common vision and, indeed, a common sense of urgency with regard to the important issues facing us today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask Parliament’s understanding if I do not respond to every specific point raised during the course of this long but important debate. Instead, let me try to address the main themes that were raised by as many of the speakers as time allows.</p>
<p class="contents">With the greatest of respect, I fear that Mr Kirkhope’s remarks reflect the risks of writing a speech in reply to a speech that you have not yet heard, in the sense that he was questioning the commitment of the Presidency in terms of the specifics that would be taken forward. Our Prime Minister made very clear, on behalf of the Presidency, not just the significant achievement relating to Turkish accession – about which I will say more in a moment – but also the importance of sequencing the debate about the future of Europe with the issue related to future financing of Europe. On his specific query as to where that would leave Britain’s national interest, I would simply tell this Parliament that the challenge facing Britain is the same as any Presidency, that we need to seek consensus across Europe, as I have suggested, but that consensus will necessarily and appropriately include the British national interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Désir raised important issues in relation to energy infrastructure and universities. I certainly noted with interest the points raised in relation to the services directive. Those are just some of the contributions that will inform our ongoing discussion of that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Koch-Mehrin, who appears to have left her place in the Chamber, talked of the importance of other priorities alongside R&amp;D and in particular the issue of transparency, which has been raised both within this Chamber and in a number of other fora involving our Prime Minister today. Again, I would report to this House that there was a formal discussion amongst the Permanent Representatives of the issue of transparency on 19 October. We made clear at the outset of our Presidency that we were keen to seek to make some progress on this issue, and that progress is ongoing. However, the discussions have already begun, as was shown by the debate held at COREPER on 19 October.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hudghton raised, in the characteristically warm style for which he is famed, the claim that the British Presidency had made no progress whatsoever. I will merely point out that the prospect of Turkish accession has been held out to the Turkish people for 42 years. It ill behoves anybody in this Chamber, whether they are for or against Turkish accession, to undermine the historical significance of what was achieved back in Luxembourg. Given my responsibilities in answering for the Presidency today, I will resist the very great temptation to engage with him on the range of issues that, as a Scottish nationalist, he sought to bring to the attention of Parliament today. I would simply say – and I do so as a fellow, proud Scot – that the contribution he made to this debate today would not easily be confused with a ray of sunshine.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Bonde, I hope that I have addressed his point about transparency already. In relation to Ms Angelilli’s point, questioning whether there is enough commitment to seek a deal on future financing, I would simply reiterate the points that our own Prime Minister made earlier in our discussions today, making it clear that we believe both that it is necessary to have the discussion on the future of Europe at Hampton Court tomorrow, and that this discussion is an essential prerequisite for the progress that we are determined to try and make in relation to future financing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mote, who appears to have left the Chamber – perhaps that was a reflection on how I have sought to answer his questions in the past – raised the very specific question of corruption. The Presidency is working with the Commission and other Member States on the Commission’s paper ‘Roadmap towards a positive statement of assurance’, a package of measures to reform the Commission’s accounting system, making it easier for the Court of Auditors to give the accounts a clean bill of health. Our hope is to see agreement at the November meeting of Ecofin.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Karas sought an ‘open and public debate’. I would argue that what we saw today in Parliament was exactly that: a frank debate on the importance of a range of issues ahead of the Hampton Court meeting. On other issues, specifically competence over universities and future financing, I listened with care to the very specific points that he was making from his own group’s point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Dührkop Dührkop recognised the need for discussion on direction with reference to the issue of future financing, but again I would simply reiterate that we are very clearly of the view that the right sequence is to have the direction of Europe set before the future financing issue is addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I sense some scepticism from colleagues in Parliament as to the viability of that process. Again, I would simply recollect a previous British Presidency in 1992, where Presidency proposals on future financing were tabled in the November prior to a deal being agreed in December. Mrs De Sarnez raised the same question. She claimed that it would be very difficult for us to resolve the budgetary issue. I would simply reiterate that, if we are not able to resolve the question of the future direction of Europe, it makes the challenge of resolving the future financing of Europe commensurately more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Mrs Lambert’s points, specifically on climate change, let me be very direct in terms of the progress that we wish to see. We wish to build consensus around the threat of climate change and the need for urgent action to tackle it. That is why on 17 October the Environment Council, under our Presidency, agreed an initial European Union position for the United Nations climate change negotiations in December. We are keen to provide a solid foundation of work for the European Union’s medium- and long-term climate change strategy, and a range of Council formations and the European Union’s external summits are contributing to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we seek agreement on the need for cost-effective, flexible solutions to tackle emissions from EU aviation and, as the Presidency, we welcomed the recent study commissioned by the Commission, which recommends emissions trading as the best solution. We are planning an initial discussion at the December Environment Council on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Piotrowski and Mr Szymański both spoke about the challenge of globalisation and raised important issues that I think will inform the discussions taking place with Heads of Government tomorrow at Hampton Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Hecke raised points on Turkey with which, with the greatest of respect, I simply disagree. I speak not only on behalf of the Presidency, but I am glad to say a unanimous General Affairs Council, which was consistent with the previous undertakings agreed at the December 2004 European Heads of Government meeting and was able to open those accession talks for full membership of Turkey back on 3 October. Mrs Grossetête acknowledged, I am glad to say, the precise historic significance of that point and of the opening of accession talks with Turkey. But in seeking, I sensed, to criticise the British Presidency, she said: ‘We cannot put Europe together with dreams’. I would respectfully suggest that we have much more hope of building Europe in the direction we would wish if we do so on the basis of our hopes and dreams, rather than simply our memories and our past achievements.</p>
<p class="contents">As our Prime Minister very eloquently put it in his summation of today’s debate, if you look at the future challenges that Europe faces, whether on the issue of climate change or the issue of securing prosperity and sustaining social protection in the face of the challenge of globalisation, it is not difficult to make a case for the importance of Europe’s work over the coming 50 years. I therefore do not think it is inimical to the interests of Europe to consciously assert the future challenges that we face. I would argue that it is a surer foundation on which to build popular support for Europe than a simple recitation of past achievements.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Titley generously recognised and acknowledged the work of the Presidency with Parliament. I am not sure whether the current attendance in Parliament is a reflection on the relative interest in the Prime Minister’s remarks and those of Britain’s Europe Minister, but nonetheless I am grateful and will pass back to my fellow ministers his kind words. Equally, I am grateful to him for recognising the point I have sought to make already in my contribution, which is the truly historic significance of the opening of accession talks with Turkey. I was also very glad and grateful to hear the honourable Member raise the broader issue of Africa and the important work that has been taken forward under the British Presidency in relation to that issue of major international concern.</p>
<p class="contents">In that regard, I would emphasise the importance that the Presidency, alongside the Commission, attaches to the important work that still has to be done in relation to development issues at the vital World Trade Organization talks in Hong Kong in December, towards the end of the British Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us who during the British Presidency have worked so hard to secure further action on both debt relief and on aid payments now see this as being a vital and important opportunity which must be grasped if we are to make progress on the third vital area for development, which is of course the issue of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Geremek also raised the issue of future financing and let me say very directly that, in the light of what our Prime Minister has reiterated today, I do not think it is the appropriate stage for us to be discussing the compensation being offered to new accession countries, the so-called A 10, given the failure to reach agreement on future financing. Now is the opportunity to rededicate ourselves and commit ourselves to the genuine endeavour of securing agreement on future financing, which of course is important to the country holding the Presidency and indeed every Member State. But I recognise that it is particularly important to those Member States that have joined the European Union recently.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mayor Oreja asked broad questions about Europe’s future role and, specifically on the question of terrorism, wondered whether we would be able to translate the broader areas of work set out by our Prime Minister into action. Again, I would suggest to Members of this House that is exactly why we have commissioned the paper – in order to translate those broad areas of work into concrete achievement in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón Crespo raised the question of the constitutional treaty, which provides me with the opportunity of reinforcing one of the original ideas behind the Hampton Court meeting, which this discussion anticipates. We were very clearly of the view, in the light of the decisions reached by the voters in France and the Netherlands, that it would be the wrong response simply to mechanistically continue a discussion of institutional architecture, when in fact probably the most accurate description of the vote – certainly in France and I would respectfully suggest also in the Netherlands – was that it related to both the text and the context. It would be wrong for us therefore simply to have addressed the question of the text when there is the broader question of how Europe is engaging with globalisation, to which our citizens are demanding an answer. That remains the inspiration and the intention behind the meeting that will take place tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Tajani raised a number of important points, as did Mrs Roure. Let me end, however, by reiterating the importance of the point made by Mr Saryusz-Wolski, namely, the issue of future financing. As I say, I have sought to make clear on the floor of this House today the importance that we attach to finding agreement on future financing if we can at the December Council.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in support of that contention let me also mention the letter our Prime Minister, as President of the European Union, sent to his colleagues inviting them to join him at Hampton Court tomorrow. He said, and I quote: ‘I know that a number of colleagues are concerned to know how the Presidency plans to take forward the future financing negotiations. We have consulted widely and I believe there is a collective will to reach agreement in December. President Barroso has issued some new ideas on how to kick forward that work’.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the letter sent by Prime Minister Blair to his fellow Heads of Government makes very clear the sincerity of our commitment to reach agreement if we can and also the importance of the sequencing that I have suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am grateful once again for the opportunity to respond to this important and timely debate. I feel sure that tomorrow’s meeting at Hampton Court will be a real and important opportunity for Member States to send a message of both unity and collective endeavour and to demonstrate the European Union’s key role in responding to the challenges about which we have heard so much today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I found this an interesting two-and-a-half-hour debate on the challenges which lie ahead of us. Of course we could find elements of disagreement, but we could also find broad agreement on a number of issues, including the need to establish a budget as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="contents">The Presidency is right to have focussed this debate not on the treaty text, but on its context. Instead of proposing to re-write treaty articles, discussions have focused on the future of Europe’s social model (with the special European Council), on the economy, on re-shaping the budget, on enlargement and on how best to achieve a single market in services.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress on these points will create a new context in which we can then decide what to do about the text. There are a wide range of scenarios, ranging from abandoning all reform to asking the French and Dutch to vote again. In practice, something between these two extremes is likely. But whether it is clarifying the current text, adding to it, modifying it, re-writing it, or drafting a new text, one thing is clear: the need for reform has not gone away. The issues that lead all 25 governments to conclude that a new, constitutional treaty is necessary remain on the table and will have to be addressed.</p>

In this context, the emphasis on research, development and innovation is always presented as a means of creating the right conditions for business and not as a much-needed response to questions of better health for all, higher levels of public education and the creation of high quality jobs with rights. Mr Blair, the President-in-Office of the Council, thus placed the accent on the need for greater flexibility in the labour market and on mobility and support for restructuring, which leads to job cuts, and in turn to more unemployment and a more precarious labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">He also reiterated support for the proposed directive on the creation of an internal market for services and on working time. On this evidence, it is clear that what is in store is an emphasis on liberalisation, which would exacerbate existing economic and social problems, would only serve the interests of the economic and financial groups in the EU and would pander to the agenda of the Union of Industrial and Employers’ Confederations of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The simple fact that this meeting, despite its political and budgetary consequences, has been shortened to just one day is worrying in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">What is worse, the solution has already been found, if we are to believe Gordon Brown, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. According to him, we must put an end to the impasse of protectionism. Where, though, has Mr Brown seen protectionism in Europe? It is the most open market in the world, and the one that complies most closely with the WTO’s rules. Our competitors, on the other hand, are shamelessly wielding the weapons of dumping, trade barriers, hidden subsidies, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, for its part, is proposing a globalisation adjustment fund of a princely EUR 500 million – EUR 1 per person! – to help people made unemployed by its policies to look for work. How very cynical!</p>
<p class="contents">As long as you persist in trying to adapt our social models to globalisation, there will continue to be more unemployment, more poverty and more uncertainty. We need to do exactly the opposite: adopt only those aspects of globalisation that do not run counter to the political objectives of prosperity and full employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Where there was a clear agenda to be seized, post enlargement, to achieve real reform rather than just talk about it, the UK's entrenched position and poor style have alienated rather than enthused. Had the UK come up with meaningful proposals then I believe this Chamber would have been a useful ally. Instead we have seen yet more hot air, on all sides, while the people of Europe walk further and further away from us. We have not learned the lessons of the Dutch and French votes, and now this Presidency has no time to do anything useful and it is a sorely missed opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
