The report is somewhat like the curate's egg – it is good in parts and not so good in parts; in fact, it is lousy in some parts. I hope that tomorrow we will be able to rectify the bad bits and remove them.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I want to concentrate on one or two of the good bits. The report recognises that the Solvit project is up and running. It recognises that there is a need for a consistent and correct application of the CE mark. It supports the work of the Competitiveness Council. It recognises that the internal market is about creating more and better jobs; it is about creating wealth, not just for businesses; and it is about social cohesion. It also recognises the benchmarking of existing liberalised services, based on a broad set of criteria, some of which are social. There is also the consultation with our social partners. It also encourages Member States' parliaments to address the whole problem of gold plating. These are the good bits in this report. Unfortunately they are only the icing on the cake. Once we get into the cake we find the bad bits. That is where this report goes wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Reading the Commission's document, step-by-step, there is a clear agenda. The Commission argues that many of the Member State economies are in a downturn at the moment and that in order to give them a boost and to help those flagging economies we must look at more structural reform. What does it mean by structural reform? You read on and it starts talking about liberalising more of our public services. It argues that because the electricity and gas sectors are smaller than the water sector and have been liberalised, we should liberalise the water sector. Taking that argument even further, in Europe our health and education sectors are bigger than the water sector is today. If you go down the road of liberalising our water sector then you go down the road of liberalising our health and education sectors. That is not what I am about.</p>
<p class="contents">I have looked at this report. This is not what Europe is about. We have had liberalisation of certain industries in Europe. I only need to look at British Rail to see what a disaster that has been. Before we go down the road of further liberalisation of any services we have to take stock of what has happened so far.</p>
<p class="contents">We have talked about the Lisbon agenda. That features strongly in the internal market report from the Commission. However, when we look at the Lisbon agenda, what comes up time and time again is the economic criteria. There is another side to the Lisbon agenda – a social side. That never gets mentioned these days. We always forget about workers' rights when we talk about the Lisbon agenda. Instead, it is market, market, market. It is high time that we moved away from that.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the internal market is about workers; it is about workers' rights; it is about health and safety; it is about living conditions; it is about elderly people; it is about young people; it is about disabled people; it is about employment and unemployment; it is about the training of young, old and unemployed people. It is not only about profit for major companies. Tomorrow we will vote on one of the most important issues that faces European citizens: whether we give the green light to the Commission to go down the road of looking at the liberalisation of our water sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that water is an internal market issue. I do not think that it should be in this report, but it is. I hope that we will remove that tomorrow. Our citizens do not want a liberalised water sector. Europe has a soul. If we sell out our social agenda, which is part of the internal market agenda, part of the Lisbon agenda, then we are lost forever. We cannot let down our citizens. Tomorrow we must support all the amendments that reject further liberalisation.</p>

I am here wearing two hats. First of all I have had the pleasure to shadow Mr Miller on this report in my own committee, as well as producing the report from the Committee on Industry, during which time we have undertaken the job that we were asked to do, which was to comment on the Commission's strategy document.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Miller produced a very interesting report, with much of which I disagreed. I am pleased to say that the committee shared my view and therefore we have substantially improved it in committee. I very much hope and indeed encourage the House to approve our version of the report tomorrow because it addresses a number of the issues that the Commission asked us to address and it was not intended as the forerunner of the PSE Group's manifesto for the forthcoming elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pick up one or two points, but first I must respond briefly to what Mr Miller said. The internal market has been one of the biggest successes of the European Union. I had the privilege of speaking when Mr Bolkestein produced the ten-year report on the single market last year, and we have seen the figures on that which, I am pleased to say, were included in my report to this committee. They were challenged by some people who do not accept the fact that markets deliver jobs, deliver economic prosperity and therefore deliver the sort of social benefits that Mr Miller was advocating so eloquently earlier on.</p>
<p class="contents">The core of European social policy is having a thriving and active economy. This is because we made the single market work, because we have stimulated competition and, yes, because we have liberated those privatised sleeping giants of state industries and subjected them to competition, which has expanded choice and reduced costs to consumers. Mr Miller and colleagues need only look at the report from the Commission, look at what has happened to energy costs and to telecommunications costs, to see what can be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to get too hung up on water. I am interested to see that this is a tremendous preoccupation of colleagues on the other side of the House. It is referred to here but actually the Commission makes it absolutely clear that policy on ownership is not an issue. Yet there is no doubt at all that there is a lot of scope for improving the efficiency and delivery of water services. You only have to look at the immense discrepancy in the cost of water to communities across the European Union to see that something needs to be done about it. That is all we are asking for and that is what we, by way of my Amendment No 1, hope colleagues will support tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In my concluding remarks I would like to comment on one or two points. I would like to congratulate the Commission on producing for the first time a three-year perspective with a clear view forward and a series of important and coherent policies to make the single market work better. I would like to congratulate it on putting a higher priority on delivering what we have, on enforcing the measures in the single market, on improving mutual recognition, which I agree with the Commission is entirely at the foundation and the heart of the single market project. That is going to give us an important perspective. I hope, with colleagues in the next Parliament, we will be here to revisit it.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, this is an excellent report. I want to thank the Commissioner for taking on board so much of the previous internal market committee report, for which I had the privilege of being a rapporteur. I am pleased to say that colleagues in my committee have agreed with the amendments and we have adjusted the report to reflect a continuation of what I did before, not the retrogressive views of the rapporteur in this instance. Thank you for this report. We look forward to working with you to deliver the continued benefits for all citizens in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, I was unable to attend this presentation, Commissioner, but I should like to congratulate you on it all the same. This evening, I should like to consider the limits to the Commissioner's urge for liberalisation, which appear to be non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to extend warm thanks to Mr Miller for the good working relationship. It is not his fault that the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has produced a somewhat distorted report. As I understand it, Mr Harbour is taking on the blame for this. As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am naturally very disappointed that only three of my amendments have been adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. My group has re-submitted the other amendments and we hope that the Christian Democrats and Liberals will be supporting those tomorrow with their Socialist hats on.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the urge for liberalisation is concerned, I can put Mr Bolkestein's mind at rest. Unlike some of my colleagues here on the left, I am not by definition against liberalisation, but I am opposed to market fundamentalism and to pushing through liberalisation at all costs, if the conditions and public guarantees are not yet in place by a long way and liberalisation is loss-making on all fronts, except for the private monopolies and their adherents who can seize on their chances in this. It is high time that we in Europe put a brake on liberalisation of that kind and that a framework directive was put in place for services of general interest, thus providing a counterweight for the dominance of the competition rules. I can see the Commissioner hesitating in that respect, and he is palming us off with one excuse after the other.</p>
<p class="contents">One final remark about the new directive on the internal market for services: that really seems to me to be a case of extreme madness, because it undermines everything that we have laid down in Europe in the area of subsidiarity and the precedence of the rules of the country where the services are performed. The new proposal for a directive is throwing the existing regulation into utter confusion and threatens drastically to restrict the Member States' policy room to determine conditions on the basis of general interest, monitoring the quality of society and the environment and guaranteeing fundamental rights. In my view, some elements are even inconsistent with the corresponding guiding principles in the Treaty. It is beyond me why you want to get this through Parliament before your departure, and I am pleased that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has in any case decided not to proceed too hastily in this matter. In the Miller report, my group urges that no final decisions should yet be taken, about this new directive among other things, until such time as the discussion about the legal framework for services of general interest is complete. This does not strike me as being unreasonable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Miller, and his colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for all their hard work in raising the profile of the internal market over the last few years. Indeed, they can claim credit for some of the measures in the Commission's internal market strategy, as these were originally their ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market is one of Europe's finest achievements. Since 1993 it has helped to create more than 2.5 million extra jobs and has added nearly EUR 900 billion, cumulatively, to our collective prosperity. There is much more to come! There are still major gaps in the legal framework, such as on services and taxation. Furthermore, in a Union of 25 Member States or more, we need to strengthen the foundations on which the internal market is built.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market strategy 2003-2006 sets out exactly what needs to be done by whom and by when. It is a ten-point plan for making Europe better off. There is no time now to go into all the details of Parliament's reports or, indeed, of the internal market strategy. Therefore, I will focus on a few key issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Parliament's support for strengthening the mutual recognition principle. I know that views differ on where the balance needs to be struck between mutual recognition and harmonisation. The benefits of mutual recognition are that it respects national traditions and avoids further regulation at the level of the European Union. We all know that negotiating harmonising directives will be no sinecure with 25 Member States around the table. Therefore, if we can avoid more legislation, so much the better.</p>
<p class="contents">The point, however, is not to impose mutual recognition at all costs. By getting Member States to notify cases where mutual recognition cannot be relied upon we shall be much better placed to propose a targeted solution which does not go beyond what is necessary to kick-start free movement again.</p>
<p class="contents">I share Parliament's concern over the slow implementation of internal market directives. Late transposition creates legal insecurity and can cause significant harm to businesses and citizens from other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult to understand why Member States that fulfil their obligations do not hold to task other Member States that are consistently late in doing so. The Commission, of course, takes immediate legal action where Member States fail to transpose on time. Nor do we shy away from hanging Member States' dirty linen out to dry. Public embarrassment often has more impact than a pile of infringement proceedings in the post.</p>
<p class="contents">Late transposition, however, is only a symptom of a larger problem. The bottom line is that we shall not have a fully functioning internal market as long as Member States treat the internal market like a rented car that they do not need to wash or maintain. I am therefore attracted by Parliament's suggestion that Member States should establish internal market offices that would be responsible for good internal market behaviour and to which people could apply if they have a problem. We shall certainly pursue this line of thinking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the internal market is to work efficiently there needs to be genuine commitment at supranational level with regard to setting internal market objectives and at national level with regard to the implementation of decisions. Although the objectives are in place and the necessary laws have now been enacted at EU level, the extent to which they have been brought into effect in many Member States is truly shameful. The Commission should invest more time in monitoring the implementation of the decisions taken. I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Miller, that Member States in breach of their obligations should be condemned more frequently, expeditiously and severely than is now the case, by imposing fines, for example. Furthermore, the impact and effectiveness of EU legislation should be continually assessed, as unnecessary laws are something we do not need.</p>
<p class="contents">A viable internal market is an excellent way of creating jobs and wealth. One of the most harmful barriers to the proper functioning of the internal market is restricted mobility of the workforce and inflexibility of the labour market. The decision by many Member States, including Finland, not to allow the free movement of the workforce from the new Member States is nothing less than blatant discrimination against the nationals of those countries. So far only Ireland and Great Britain have said they will open up their borders on 1 May to the workforce arriving from the Central European countries that are joining the Union. Other old Member States are using the opportunity to keep their borders closed, even though one of the pillars of the EU is the free movement of the workforce. The new Member States certainly could not have expected the decisions that were made owing to pressure by the trade union movement. The restrictions might even have been accepted if the new Member States had been aware of them at Copenhagen, when the membership agreements were just being signed. It is short-sighted and pointless on the part of the current Member States to fear change in this way and be unwilling to implement essential structural solutions, and it undermines the prospects of economic growth in both the current and the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The opening of the market for net-based industries has delivered significant benefits for consumers, businesses and society. Competition has increased, prices have fallen, and there is more innovation and choice. To boost international competitiveness, it is important to address all the problems that are troubling the internal market. Removing the cross-border barriers to trade in services in the service industry is the most crucial of these. I hope the directive on services makes swift progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus, it is rightly considered that the strategy for the market, together with the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines, are one of the three means for promoting the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives. Consequently, proper operation of the market presupposes acceptance of this basic political objective. If the Lisbon strategy failed to bring about the results we were expecting, this is due to ambiguity about its real content. We believe that, in the same way as competitiveness of the market is being proposed, the social dimension of the strategy for it should also be jointly evaluated without fear. Thus, competitiveness, in the sense of ‘competitiveness based on quality’ rather than ‘competitiveness based on eroding labour costs’, as well as being a governing principle for economic relations, will also become a general principle for all social relations. Only thus will it be possible for the European model to be exported and to play a leading role in the global market. If this strategic objective is accepted unreservedly, we can resolve the individual problems of malfunctions on the internal market more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Our first concern is for the Member States to be convinced at long last that an internal market cannot function without advanced harmonisation of its legislation, including the lifting of tax barriers, and without increased responsibility for the application of the agreed rules without delay and without distortion.</p>
<p class="contents">The current regime for monitoring the application of Community rules has failed and radical reform is needed. The second concern is to address the phenomena of the development of the internal market by just one section of the companies and the active population. Unless small- and medium-sized enterprises and consumers are brought on board, any decisions we take at European level will have limited results.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, above all, we must see what it is that makes the man in the street opposed to the internal market and how we can link its future with the vision of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to impose your views, you tend to use the cutlass method.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take my turn to say that the directive on services represents a real danger, a poison for the European Union. You want liberalisation in all areas, while in January 2004 Parliament again rejected the liberalisation of the education, health, social services and water sectors. You want to remove the exclusive rights for services of general economic interest and impose the rules of public markets, while Parliament has asked for these services to have a legal codecision framework and given its opinion in favour of a right of autoproduction for public organisations. You want to extend the principle of mutual recognition and the application of the law of the supplier’s country of origin across the board. This can only cause ill-feeling and disputes. The only method that can unite Europeans would involve establishing common positive criteria in the different sectors of the internal market by codecision, which would produce harmonisation rules in accordance with our social model.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also highlight the lack of consultation of civil society in your practice. This is largely responsible for the bad quality of texts and for the large number of disputes. The Lamfalussy method for financial services is much more participative than the one that you use in other areas where you seek to obtain a blank cheque to eliminate regulatory barriers. Nevertheless, the Lamfalussy method is handicapped by many inadequacies that we wish to overcome: the lack of a right of call-back for Parliament, insufficient economic analyses and consultations that are still largely limited to professionals.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I beseech my colleagues – and I have already written to them all to this effect – to re-establish the political line in Parliament in favour of the social market economy. This line was sacrificed at the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. In order to re-establish it, we need to adopt the amendments tabled by Messrs Miller and Ortega. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be a very illiberal doctrine to say that liberalisation should be pursued in an inflexible way, insensitive to local realities. We ought to look at, for example, the case of remoter parts of the European Union. We should therefore, for example, welcome the flexibility in relation to local transport services indicated by the recent Altmark judgment. Unfortunately, however, the Commission has said that this cannot possibly apply to ferries. Buses are not ferries – indeed they are not – but transport is transport, by sea and by land.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Miller mentioned the problem of Railtrack in the United Kingdom. Split the ownership of the rails from the ownership of the trains and you get a crazy situation. In Scotland it seems that we are about to split the ownership of the ships from the ownership of the companies that sail them. Railtrack by sea! This is liberalisation pursued in an extreme and inflexible way. Mr Bolkestein is a frequent and always welcome visitor to Scotland. I hope that on his next visit to the Hebrides he does not have to travel under an assumed name to hide his responsibility for the fiasco which is about to be wished upon us! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the few seconds that I have available, I do, however, want to focus on the much-discussed issue of water. The water, or water services, sector is, and will be, crucial in Europe too. I believe that it would be unreasonable, especially in this sector, to forego the efficiency that can derive from liberalisation and competition. The ownership of water is not at stake, contrary to what someone, not in this House, has said. Nor are we concerned here with the privatisation of water, but merely with opening up the water services market, which is often managed in an inefficient way by public, local and national monopolies. To those who say ‘come and look at the railways in Great Britain’, I would say, ‘come and see the public water mains in Italy, including the major ones, together with the waste of water resources and of public money’. I am not saying that there has to be a dogma, but I believe that opening up public services to competition and the market is actually a move towards a social Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me clarify what I mean by reference to our water. In January, we expressed our opposition to the unrestrained privatisation of basic services such as water and sewerage, as well as health services and education. We set down in writing our recognition that decisions on these things have to be taken, if at all possible, close to the citizen in towns and communities. Services of general interest are the business of the people who use them; they are not to be the plaything of an unrestricted market.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the point that Mr Miller reiterated in his report on the Internal Market Strategy, using persuasive examples to warn of the dangers that ensue if, for example, we make our precious water nothing more than an ordinary item of merchandise. It was apparent from the deliberations in the committee, though, that there are powerful conservative and liberal elements who believe that there are more, and quicker, profits to be made out of the public services. This is meant to be Mr Miller’s report; we must make sure that it really is by, in the plenary, stopping them in their tracks. The amendments needed to make good the fudge for which the committee is responsible have been tabled. I ask you all to help ensure that our towns and communities are not stabbed in the back, which is what this unholy alliance between conservatives and liberals wants to happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I shall certainly do that under my own name and not under any assumed name. I hope Sir Neil would agree to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall address two points that appeared to be important in this debate. Firstly, the question of whether the internal market strategy takes enough account of social, employment and environmental concerns. I must stress that the main aim of the internal market strategy is to strengthen the application of the key principles on which the internal market is based, especially as the Union expands and enlarges to take in ten more Member States. Hence the focus on the free movement of goods and services, mutual recognition, taxation obstacles, implementation and enforcement, and the simplification of rules.</p>
<p class="contents">That does not mean that social or environmental aspects are not important. However, there are other instruments which are much better placed to address those concerns, such as, for example, the employment guidelines. Not every document the Commission produces should deal with each and every issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I disagree with the view that the internal market is not socially or environmentally friendly. More than 2.5 million jobs have been created since 1993 because of the internal market. Nearly EUR 900 billion cumulatively has been added to our combined gross domestic product – money that supports our social security system, pensions, healthcare and education. Costs of baskets of services and goods include jobs, leaving more money in people's pockets. The internal market has promoted innovation and the adoption of clean-air technology. Therefore, the internal market is a good social and environmental policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the matter of liberalisation, firstly, I must stress that privatisation is not the Commission's concern. In fact, Article 295 of the Treaty prohibits the European Commission from dealing with ownership. Liberalisation and competition are the Commission's concern, but not privatisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the services of general economic interest, the Commission makes no apology for its actions to open up the network industries to further competition. Industry and citizens have generally benefited, as demonstrated by the results of performance and evaluation measurement. Quality and user satisfaction are higher than before market opening and prices are often lower. Further market opening is desirable. For example, the Commission has just proposed further steps in the railway sector and we are also looking at ways of injecting more competition into the water sector.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is not about deregulation but re-regulation. The quality of service and respect for general interests remain critical requirements. However, I disagree that public monopolies are the natural guarantor of such standards. Competition is the consumer's best friend. It will always be up to governments to lay down the conditions that services of general interest – public or private – will have to fulfil. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
