<p class="contents">On Tuesday 12 June the Council announced that the operation of Europol was being investigated. One of the central questions concerns the origins of the information technology on which Europol’s Eurint and Europolis systems are based. Europol may well be using pirated information technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Council confirm that the patented Polygon technology from the Munich-based Polygenesys company provides the IT base for Europol’s Eurint and Europolis systems or has been incorporated into them? If so, since when has Europol been using that technology, and how did it acquire it and/or the user rights to it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the Council acknowledges that it bears responsibility for Europol in a general sense. The execution of contracts, however, is a matter which, in the first instance, falls under the competent services of Europol. The question is therefore being dealt with at the moment by the director of Europol, under the supervision of the board of management.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council has information that all contracts entered into by Europol at the time are now being examined by an independent external bureau as a result of a decision by Europol’s board of management. The inquiry into the supposed theft of software and its possible use has been forwarded for further investigation to the public prosecutor in The Hague. A parallel judicial inquiry has opened in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore await the results of the judicial inquiry before we can provide further details. I should like to point out to the honourable Member that the discovery of fraudulent practices was the result of the nonetheless efficient operation of the existing present monitoring structures, since this is how they were brought to light. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should, however, also like to approach the matter from a political perspective. Mrs Neyts may say that the present cases of fraud were discovered through internal monitoring. Nevertheless there is a perception on the part of the public and by a large part of the political world that there is insufficient democratic control of Europol, and various avenues are being explored to intensify that control.</p>
<p class="contents">Among other things under consideration are a modification of the OLAF Regulation and in the Belgian parliament the idea is circulating of setting up a Committee P and a Committee I on the Belgian model for the supervision of police forces and intelligence services for Europol too.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Minister see any chance of a debate on this subject being held within the Council and within European institutions, so that we can reassure citizens regarding democratic monitoring of what is, after all, an important police service, although still in an embryonic state? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The outcome was a serious case of discrimination affecting, in particular, the Spanish (and especially the Galician) fleet, which would be required to withdraw hundreds of vessels from service whilst hundreds of French and Irish vessels would be exempted. What justifies the fact that the Spanish (including the Galician) fleet is constantly subject to measures which restrict its activity on a pretext of resource conservation which does not apply to other countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, on the basis of the critical state of the cod and hake stocks outlined in the Commission’s communication of 12 June and on the rebuilding of cod and hake stocks which was presented to the Council, and I quote: “The Commission adopted an emergency regulation on 14 June establishing measures for the recovery of the northern hake stock. Article 2(2) of the Commission Regulation provides for a derogation for vessels of less than 12 metres overall length using a mesh size of less than 100 mm from a maximum share of 20% of hake in the retained catch, provided that the vessels – not the catch – return to port within 24 hours.” On 22 June Spain asked the Council to amend this provision.

This discrimination manifests itself in the application of the principle of relative stability which, for example, grants a country from northern Europe 40% of catches taken in Community waters, whilst Spain and Galicia receive only 6%.

<p class="contents">The Commission has told us in the Committee on Fisheries that this discrimination is for social reasons in favour of Great Britain and France, and that that is the reason for the exception.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, my question is why does the Commission, and in this case the Council, by a majority and for social reasons, not defend Spain, and specifically a region such as Galicia, which is an Objective One region and is therefore more needy, and whose fishermen traditionally fished in those waters which are now common. These fishermen, for social reasons, do not sleep at home, owing to the enormous distance they have to travel.</p>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 3 by Herman Schmid (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0599_EN.html">H-0599/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: The EU’s rapid reaction force in Sweden</span></p>
<p class="contents">In response to the chaotic situation which arose in Göteborg during the EU summit in June, when police and demonstrators clashed, it has been suggested in various Member States that it ought to be possible for the EU’s rapid reaction force to be deployed to control riots and civil disturbances. Anders Mellbourn, the head of the Swedish Foreign Policy Institute, for example, wrote in Dagens Nyheter on 24 June:</p>
<p class="contents">‘This probably means that the police will have to be supplemented by some kind of riot police units which possess a combination of police and military training. This is hardly the kind of task to entrust to conscripts: it calls for professional soldiers or else police with military training. Operational cooperation between the police forces and the military of several EU countries is required […] It is not easy for the EU to bring together a standing force of 5 000 police officers for civil crisis management. Dialogue to prevent conflict needs to be supplemented by increased intelligence activity. All this is also needed in order to be able to contribute to effective conflict- and crisis-management in the Balkans or the Middle East. But it is also needed – albeit, one hopes, rarely – to cope with certain domestic crises in Sweden or neighbouring EU countries.’</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council agree that in future it ought to be possible for the EU’s rapid reaction force to be deployed within the Union itself when situations such as that in Göteborg arise?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 4 by Alexandros Alavanos (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0676_EN.html">H-0676/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: The G8 meeting and security at summit meetings and other conferences of equivalent importance</span></p>
<p class="contents">A few days before the deplorable events which unfolded in Genoa during the G8 meeting, the 15 Foreign Ministers unanimously endorsed the decisions by the Interior Ministers on security at EU summit meetings and other conferences of equivalent importance. Will the Council say: did the Italian authorities call for the setting-up of a team of police officers or intelligence service officials to act as liaison officers who could be seconded from the Member States from which groups of troublemakers originate (Article 1(b)) and for all the legal technical means to be deployed to achieve a more structured exchange of information concerning troublemakers on the basis of files held in the various Member States? (Article 2(d)). If so, which governments of the 15 Member States have responded?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 5 by Ioannis Patakis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0678_EN.html">H-0678/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Violation of basic democratic freedoms and human rights in Genoa</span></p>
<p class="contents">The unanimous Council decisions on taking repressive measures ahead of the Genoa Summit provided the political backing the Italian government needed for the events that took place there. Once again, a summit has been marred by the excessive use of force and savage repression. After the bloodshed in Göteborg, more blood has been shed in Genoa: the Italian police and army launched an even more savage attack against peaceful demonstrators protesting about globalisation and expressing their opposition to decisions taken without, and at the expense of, the peoples of the G7+1, the EU and other political and economic organisations. The outcome of this summit is: a number of deaths, dozens of injuries, mass expulsions and arrests and the brutal violation of democratic freedoms and even of the Community principle of freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this summit was attended by the leaders of the four largest and dominant States in the EU and since the statements both by the Belgian Presidency and the other governments of the EU on the events at Genoa suggest that there will be a more violent and bloody response to demonstrations at future summit meetings, starting with Laeken, will the Council say whether it is aware of the very onerous political responsibility it bears for its decisions of 13 and 16 July to take repressive measures and whether it intends to revoke them, given that they are in flagrant breach of democratic freedoms and human rights, such as freedom of movement, of assembly and of expression, which were brutally violated in Genoa?</p>

<p class="contents">Following the disturbances which marked the EU’s Göteborg Summit and the G8 summit in Genoa, and taking particular account of the moves to have EU summits held exclusively in Belgium in the future, what implications does the Council foresee for summit meetings of this kind?

I would like to remind Members of the unanimous position taken by the Council and the representatives of Member State governments on the question of security at European Council meetings and at other events that are likely to have a similar impact.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council reiterated that one of the European Union’s objectives is to maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice. In such an area, citizens must enjoy the right to freely express their opinions and to assemble in a peaceful manner. They must do so, however, in conditions where there is not a threat to their own security or to that of other citizens or properties. On 13 July this year, the Council and the representatives of the Member State governments therefore deplored the actions of those who abuse these democratic rights by initiating, planning and carrying out acts of violence to coincide with public demonstrations.</p>
<p class="contents">For the purpose of ensuring that these principles can also be applied in the context of important meetings, the Council and the representatives emphasised the need to establish a dialogue with non-governmental organisations, social partners and civil society, and also that we must build on and we shall build on the possibilities offered by existing legal instruments and bodies set up within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mr Vitorino before me, let me lay particular emphasis on the provisions of the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement and the joint action of 26 May 1997 on cooperation on law and order and security. The idea is that the task force of European Union chiefs of police should make a significant contribution to the practical implementation of cooperation between the law enforcement authorities of the Member States. Incidentally, this task force has absolutely nothing to do with what the author of one question described as a joint police unit in the context of an EU-led crisis-management action.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the two questions put, respectively, by Mr Krarup and Mr Korakas, during Question Time at Parliament’s last part session in July 2001, I had an opportunity, speaking on behalf of the Council, to detail the measures taken by the Swedish government during the Gothenburg Summit. In the same way, by letter of 11 July 2001, the Italian government informed us, under the procedures in force, of the measures it had taken under the second sentence of Article 2(2) of the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Council meeting of 16 July 2001, the ministers declared themselves in favour of closer international cooperation to safeguard the exercise of freedom of expression on the one hand and, on the other, to ensure that public demonstrations of this kind can and do take place in a peaceful manner. Nonetheless, we must admit that responsibility for the maintenance of law and order on the territory of the EU Member States falls within the remit of their own national authorities. The Council is not authorised to comment on a matter that does not fall within the area of competence conferred on it by the Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My question, which I would like the President-in-Office to answer, is this: were the plans to set up teams of policemen or intelligence service officers to operate as links between the Fifteen and were the plans to exchange information in files on people classified as troublemakers implemented before Genoa or not?

<p class="contents">In regard to your second question, I will have to check this and obtain information before I can reply. All I know is that in the fight against what is called ‘hooliganism’ at major sporting events, the police authorities have clearly begun to cooperate on exchanging information on individuals who have repeatedly been proven responsible for disturbances or worse at major sporting events. That is something I know. In answer to the question whether there was any cooperation of the kind to anticipate or prevent possible trouble during the meetings of European Union bodies: I do not think so, but I will have to check this and will do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since then the Council agencies have reached complete agreement on the draft, subject to the legal and linguistic amendment of the text and, as I have already said, the withdrawal of parliamentary reservations. The text of the draft decision, doc. 10483/01, is, by the way, on the Council’s website. That draft provides for the setting up of an observation and information centre that can collate requests for aid and centralise the aid offered and that will be linked with contact points specified by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">That centre can alert evaluation and/or coordination as well as intervention teams, which have been specified beforehand and hence assigned the necessary personnel in advance. The draft also provides for training programmes, the pooling of information on serums and vaccines and the promotion of the use of new technologies. Contrary to what the honourable Member believes, there are no plans for collecting the aid material in one place, since that will be delivered directly by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of this mechanism will be entrusted to the Commission, supported by a committee. It is therefore up to the Commission to decide where the observation and information centre and the other services necessary for the implementation of the mechanism will be located. This question will therefore have to be put to the Committee at the appropriate time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The specific point that I raised in my question, which I thought would be self-evident, was that because of sudden downturns in the economy in America and other parts of the world, there is increasing pressure being put on small and medium-sized enterprises in a very strict and rigorously competitive market.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I was somewhat heartened by the daring-to-risk-going-bust attitude of the conference because that would give us experience to know the main reasons why small and medium-size enterprises fail, whilst at the same time recognising that they are the biggest engine of growth within the overall European Union economy, creating something like 82% of employment and representing 74% of all manufacturing.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence my question to the President-in-Office about the Council’s position: what actions can be taken to ensure the continuance of this very strong sector? In particular how can entrepreneurs learn from mistakes and failures, and if they fail once, be encouraged to continue and learn from those mistakes? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is stated that the contamination arose during a normal manufacturing process, a process that also includes the refining of the oil. During the burning process caused by the drying of the olive residue, benzopyrene is released. At present Community legislation does not contain an upper limit for the PAC content in foodstuffs. The Scientific Committee on Human Nutrition, which falls under the remit of the Commission, is, however, at present evaluating the impact of PACs on health, in order to determine the maximum admissible level of the intake of those substances via human food. Since the competent services are still heavily involved in the research, the honourable Member will undoubtedly agree that the Council is not the appropriate body to deal with this question.

We are therefore talking about 8% of production and a product which is consumed very little.</p>
<p class="contents">As you rightly said, Madam President, the problem has arisen as a result of the method of extracting olive residue oil, and therefore traces of benzopyrene were found in the olive residue oil and, given the lack, as you also said, of a European regulation setting the limits, the Spanish Ministry of Health proceeded, applying the precautionary principle, to withdraw this oil from circulation. Today the extraction techniques have been modified and oil can be obtained which is free of benzopyrene. At the moment they are having the same problem in Italy, for the same reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would like to ask the Council whether it is in any way going to promote the filling of this loophole in the law, so that there may be permissible limits in human food, because, as the saying goes, ‘the poison is the dose, not the substance in itself’ and that is the basic principle of toxicology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, as I pointed out, the Scientific Council attached to the Commission is currently carrying out studies to determine the maximum admissible rates of what are known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Information of Greek citizens about the euro</span></p>
<p class="contents">A mere few months before the official introduction of the euro, a survey carried out by Eurobarometer in Greece in late March and early April 2001 revealed that 47.8% of Greeks felt that they knew ‘very little or little’ about the euro, while 25.5% said that they knew nothing about the subject. The lowest figures were among people aged over 55, 36% of whom know nothing about the new currency, and only 16% saying they were adequately informed. It is also notable that 42% of Greeks on low incomes appear to be completely uninformed about the euro, while 4 out of 10 Greeks are unaware that Greece is a member of the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Council’s assessment of the results of this survey? What are the corresponding figures for the other countries in the euro zone? What conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of the information campaign on the new currency conducted by the Greek government and the other 11 governments? What are the negative effects ensuing from such apparently inadequate preparation for the acceptance of the euro in the public’s mind, and how are cohesion and monetary stability put at risk by the lack of practical information and organisational preparation, particularly in the case of small and medium-sized businesses?</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very broad question and I trust that the President-in-Office of the Council will be able to summarise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the meeting held on 4 June, the ministers, the Presidents of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner responsible considered the preparations being made for the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January 2002. They welcomed the encouraging progress made in this area, and particularly the fact that consumer awareness is increasing. They also recalled their intention to step up information campaigns during the second half of the year to help smooth the currency changeover.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the ministers reiterated their desire to ensure that the conversion of all prices, tariffs and charges coming under their governments’ authority would not have any effect on prices or would have only a minimum impact on consumers. The ministers called on retailers to implement their commitment to respect the good practice that they had included in the joint declaration of European consumer and business associations adopted on 2 April 2001, and to do everything in their power to guarantee the overall stability of their prices when converting to the euro and to give a clear signal of this commitment to their customers.</p>
<p class="contents">The ministers also noted that several Member States had stepped up their price monitoring and that the relevant agencies had been vigilant about price conversion issues. The ministers considered that dual pricing throughout the entire dual circulation period was vital to allow consumers to check prices both in euros and in their national currency. They also encouraged consumers to familiarise themselves more with prices labelled in euros and to continue to carefully compare competitors’ prices, particularly between now and the end of the year and during the dual circulation period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wanted to say that the statistics in my question were compiled a long time before her answer and that things are changing for the better. However, according to the latest EUROSTAT figures, there is a growing fear that a lot of people will use this opportunity to increase the prices of goods and services and that this will mainly hit the most vulnerable groups of consumers such as the elderly, the young, the poorly educated, immigrants and the mentally handicapped. Especially as, in Greece at least, 1 euro is worth 340.75 drachmas, meaning that it is very hard to make the sort of quick calculation needed every hour of every day. That is why I want to know if, even at the eleventh hour, the Council is giving any thought to the easiest solution all round, i.e. for each Member State to order and distribute cheap pocket calculators which convert each country’s currency into euros, so that even the most poorly informed or disabled citizen can immediately calculate what they are paying, what they are being paid and who is trying to rob them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All that I know is that those ministers that are members of Ecofin, and especially those that belong to the euro group, decided to launch a very intensive campaign which is to be stepped up with effect from now, because they decided that if they had started during the summer there was a risk of the impact being lost during that period so that it would have been necessary to start all over again. A campaign is therefore to be launched. I also believe that it will be a two-level campaign, that is an EU-level campaign that will be backed up by campaigns run by the Member States and the various national governments. I am not sure if the pocket calculators are part of the campaign at euro group level. They form part of a number of national campaigns, but perhaps you should try to do something along these lines in your own country if they have not been provided for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Legislation on ‘sects’ and its impact on respect for religious freedom in Europe</span></p>
<p class="contents">One of the Member States, France, has a much criticised law on religion in which the term ‘sect’, as applied to smaller churches and religious groups, plays a key role.</p>
<p class="contents">By leaving broad scope for the courts’ free interpretation and discretion, the law has proved to be a blunt instrument and created legal uncertainty. The Catholic and Protestant Churches in France together with the European Commission of Human Rights have criticised the law as restricting very fundamental freedoms and rights such as religious freedom and freedom of association.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the Nice Charter of Fundamental Rights, what is the Council’s view of the French legislation, particularly in a situation where several applicant countries, the Czech Republic for example, are using this law as a model for drafting their own laws on religion? Are we not at risk of diminishing respect for the public’s choice of life philosophy and religious faith, with greater intolerance as a result, if an increasing number of Member States adopt legislation which outlaws or actively oversees some forms of church and religious groups, and should not the good work and idealism which are characteristic of those organisations be held up as examples rather than banned? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent Amnesty International report describes the suffering of thousands of people who are tortured, abused, sexually assaulted and coerced into medical or psychiatric treatment.

The second paragraph of the same article says the Union shall respect fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and, as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, Article 3 of that European Convention says that “No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”, whilst Article 14 of the Convention stipulates that the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any grounds, and in particular on the grounds of sex.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Union says that within the limits of the powers conferred by it upon the Community, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may take appropriate action to combat any discrimination, particularly discrimination based on sex or sexual orientation. With a view to ensuring more vigorous and concerted action at national, regional and international level, in April of this year the European Union adopted guidelines for its policy towards third countries on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments or treatment, thus confirming the central role of this issue in its human rights policy. These guidelines give the Union an instrument for intervening in cases involving torture and a means of stepping up its efforts to secure greater respect for international rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until that date, requests from citizens for Council documents will be dealt with as previously on the basis of Decision 93/731/EC regarding public access to Council documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Each of the three institutions involved is at present taking measures to ensure that the new Regulation is actually applied from 3 December next. According to Article 15 of the Regulation, they are required to set up an interinstitutional committee, which will investigate the best practice, deal with any disputes and discuss future developments relating to public access to documents. As regards the Council, the competent services are at present holding discussions on the measures to be taken and on the timeframe for their introduction, in order to facilitate citizens’ exercising of the rights that they have now been assigned more clearly on the basis of the new Regulation. The necessary measures will be taken to be able to meet the deadline of 3 December.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the various types of documents that may be consulted by the public, I can inform the honourable Member that at present, on the basis of Decision 93/731/EC of 20 December 1993 relating to public access to Council documents, all Council documents can be requested by the public. Depending on their content and in particularly in the light of the exceptional regulations – that is, Article 4 of the Decision – a decision is taken as to whether or not they can be released to the applicant, after a full case-by-case investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Article 1, paragraph 1 of Decision 93/731/EC, amended by Council Decision 2000/527/EC of 14 August last year, stipulated that if a request for access relates to a document marked highly secret, secret or confidential in the sense of the decision of the Secretary-General of the Council of 27 July 2000, that in addition refers to the security and defence affairs of the Union or of one or more of its Member States or to military or non-military crisis management, the applicant shall be informed that the document concerned does not fall within the scope of Decision 93/731/EC.</p>
<p class="contents">I would draw your attention to the fact that this provision was not included in the previously mentioned Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 that comes into effect on 3 December next.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Article 9 of the Regulation stipulates that requests for access to the sensitive documents described in it will be dealt with separately. For example, people may only deal with such requests where they themselves are authorised to take cognisance of these documents. Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 is based on the same general principle as the Decision of 1993, namely that every document request is definitely looked at separately. Access can only be possibly denied in the light of the exceptional regulation provided for in Article 4.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Council decided in its Decision of 9 April this year on the classification of certain categories of Council documents, to place a whole series of documents, especially documents that fall under legislative activities, directly in the public domain via the Internet. In this, the Council anticipated the coming into force of the Regulation as regards Article 12, paragraph 3. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the truth is that I do not understand the reasons why you do not clarify this point which is still outstanding, because I do not actually understand what that point may be.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time, in the regulation on designs and models, when it came to the directive, certain points were controversial, for example the reparation clause, but once, with the very direct participation of the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, a compromise was reached on that clause, which has been reflected in the Commission’s proposal and accepted as such by the European Parliament I do not understand what the controversial point can be.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither do I understand, as has been said, why there may be other controversial points which, at the time, delayed the approval of the Regulation on markings, such as those relating to language, procedure or the location of the office for the harmonisation of the internal market, because that was resolved with the Regulation on markings. And now, as regards this proposed regulation on design, the procedure rules, the procedure languages and the competence of the office for harmonisation of the internal markets are issues which have already been resolved.</p>
