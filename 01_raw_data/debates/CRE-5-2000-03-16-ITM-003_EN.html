We have made a quick check here and the Portuguese text seems to have the same meaning as the French text, implying that the majority of this House believes fundamental rights can be violated if the European Parliament agrees to it. I do not know if this is a language problem or a political problem, given the speeches we have heard here about Austrian political rights. However, this is a very sensitive issue, and I want to raise it with the Bureau, so that the matter can be clarified, because if that is what we are supposed to have voted for, I think an extremely grave political precedent has been created.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we change the English version as well, Mr President, we will have to start the debate afresh and, seeing as your plane leaves at 4.30 this afternoon, this does not seem appropriate. Maybe it would be better to stop at the comma, after “physical and psychological abuse and all kinds of discrimination”. We could then deal with the behaviour of young people who commit offences later on, in one of the many other reports which are churned out by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to ask you and those others who preside over these sessions to be much more strict about points of order. We lost nearly half-an-hour this morning and many of the points of order that were raised then, and are often raised here, are things that Members have just thought of that they would like to share with others. That hardly constitutes a point of order.</p>

If the Members had been prepared to wait half an hour longer before eating, this would not appear to have been too great a sacrifice. Effectively, it does cause problems when you randomly move important measures to a Friday sitting. For example, we voted on drugs, which is a highly disputed issue, on a Friday. We will vote on these measures either this evening or on Friday. This appears to us to be a political manoeuvre to influence the majorities in this Chamber. You arrange our agenda and our timetable according to whether you want a particular measure to be adopted. Mr President, in order to be completely fair, you should have called for one intervention for the decision to suspend the sitting or continue and adhere to the scheduled voting time and one intervention against. Once again, the wishes of the Chamber have been disregarded. Democracy only exists on paper: it is not applied within this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That has most recently been demonstrated in an Amnesty report from December 1999 which draws attention to, among other things, the serious problems in the Chiapas region. We think it is splendid that the trade agreement has had built into it a demand to promote democracy in Mexico – including the observance of human rights – but, as long as this demand is not followed up by concrete action, it is merely a case of empty words. A democracy clause was also built into the old trade agreement with Mexico, but this was not complied with. Pressure must therefore be exerted upon Mexico through international organisations such as the UN and via individual nations.

<p class="contents">Never before has Mexico made so many concessions to a much stronger trading partner as it is now making to the European Union. The impact on Mexico cannot be quantified, although the NAFTA agreement has already resulted in the impoverishment of large sections of the Mexican population and the demise of small undertakings. The rules of the agreement on which we have voted go even further than those of the NAFTA agreement. For example, the liberalisation of investments which is championed covers all sectors of the economy. In other words it is a mini-MAI. The drop in the standard of living and the inequalities between the European Union and Mexico which already exist will be exacerbated yet further. Whereas Mexico has been required to make numerous concessions to Europe (such as in the agricultural, investment and public procurement sectors), the EU has included derogations and restrictions for itself in order to keep competition at bay.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that the European side, especially Europe’s large corporate groups, will profit from the agreement with Mexico. It is a gift to large-scale European industry. However, it will do nothing to improve the living and working conditions of the Mexicans, on the contrary. There is no mention in the agreement of employee rights or social standards. It contradicts development policy objectives and for this reason among others Mexican NGOs and other parties have asked their Senate not to sign this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is trying to use individual agreements with developing and newly-industrialised countries in order to implement what it failed to achieve at the WTO conference of ministers in Seattle, partly due to the resistance of developing countries. Its main objective in the present case is to gain access to the lucrative NAFTA area via Mexico. The living conditions of the people have been disregarded.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement does not bring about the progress needed in relations between Europe and Mexico, nor is it a suitable model for similar agreements to be concluded in the future, for example with Mercosur. Agreements with developing countries must serve their interests first and foremost, not the interests of European corporate groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the conditions under which this initiative was put forward tend more to reflect contempt for the life of the citizens and give us cause for serious concern about what will happen next. First of all, a few months ago, we discovered, tucked away in the Cologne conclusions, in paragraphs 44 and 45, the decision to start drafting a Charter of Fundamental Rights. Who was consulted beforehand? No one, and certainly not the national parliaments, who had never heard of it. All the same, however, we must remember that basically fundamental rights come within the remit of the national parliaments and, as a whole, of the various peoples of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, some people will say this was merely a new formulation of existing rights, but it is clear that this operation will go much further, with the European Parliament already calling for an innovative Charter. In any case, whatever its final form, the national parliaments should not have been sidelined.</p>
<p class="contents">They are now involved in the Convention to draft the Charter, but only as one partner among others, which will guarantee an imperfect job. Worse still, they will not even be involved in the final stage, since the Cologne conclusions provide that the Charter will be proclaimed jointly by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission. Yes, I did say “the Commission”.</p>
<p class="contents">So the national parliaments find themselves sidelined and replaced by a body of officials who will ‘proclaim the Charter’. That is quite ludicrous! Democracy is sidelined, supposedly for the good of the citizens. But then is that not how Europe usually works? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This does not apply to similar amendments tabled by the TDI Group, although I completely share the criticism expressed therein regarding the fact that national parliaments are being overlooked, the lack of referenda, and the attempts to turn the European Union into a superstate. If the parties of the TDI Group had taken a consistent line on the equivalence of all people and on democracy, I would certainly have supported their amendments. However, I had to consider their view of the world in my deliberations. Of all the groups represented here, it is their view that takes least account of equivalence, democracy and human rights.

We are in favour of the drawing up of a Charter of Fundamental Rights in the form of a political document. In this period of reforms of the EU, including its enlargement, it is important to focus upon the fact that the EU’s <span class="italic">raison d’être</span> is to protect individual citizens. A Charter could make a positive contribution to this. In drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights, there is always a certain danger of citizens’ viewing it simply as a meaningless piece of paper, to be waved on state occasions but destined to disappoint. A majority of the European Parliament is therefore calling for the Charter to be of binding effect and to be incorporated into the Treaty, in other words for the agenda of the current Intergovernmental Conference to be extended. </p>
<p class="contents">In connection with previous votes on this subject, we have clearly expressed our view that there should be no more issues on the agenda than it will be possible to resolve at the Nice Summit in December. We have already emphasised that no more obstacles should be put in the way of enlargement of the Union. Drawing up a set of binding, fundamental rights would raise a series of very difficult questions of principle, in terms both of the content of these rights and of their relationship to other sets of fundamental rights, for example the European Convention on Human Rights. It is therefore unrealistic to expect the issues to have been resolved by December. For that reason alone, we do not think that fundamental rights should be on the agenda of the current Intergovernmental Conference. We have made this known in the individual votes en route to the report. If we nonetheless choose to vote in favour of the whole report, that is because we believe that fundamental human rights are one of the foundations upon which the EU is built and because we want a Charter concerning these to be drawn up in the form of a political document. Whether it is subsequently to be incorporated into the Treaty in a form that is binding will depend upon an assessment of whether the content of the Charter would provide citizens with better protection than that which they have at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This way of thinking is fundamentally different from our own vision of a European Community. The Union is, and should remain, a union of States. It must therefore be ensured that the Charter does not in any way interfere with the Member States’ national constitutions or equivalent arrangements for establishing fundamental rights. This is not to support the view that those in power can do as they like within a given country’s borders, but an expression of the view that human rights are nothing less than universal and require universal tools by way of protection. Moreover, we do not wish to see two sets of rights on the European continent – one for citizens of EU countries and another for citizens of non-EU countries. It is therefore crucial for any EU Charter not to affect existing international conventions and declarations of rights, but merely to require that EU countries sign these. </p>
<p class="contents">Growing problems arise when the EU acquires more and more powers as a State but cannot be bound in relation to, for example, the European Convention on Human Rights. We do not, however, see it as a solution for the EU to accede to the Convention on Human Rights as a juristic “person”, since we do not share the view that the EU is, or should be, identified as having the status of a separate politico-governmental body. Nor do we support the constitutional process of which the adoption of a Charter is an integral part. We prefer the Treaty to state that the EU’s authorities respect the competence and decisions of the Court of Human Rights. Legal practice of this kind makes it possible to condemn an aspect of Community law which is open to criticism and which has arisen through a Member State’s use of that law. The European Court of Justice should not have jurisdiction over areas already covered by the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg or by other international bodies. If the existing conventions are found to be inadequate, for example, because bio-technological developments give rise to new problems, then this is an international problem to which international solutions should be sought. It is not solely a concern of the EU, and we must seek international and global consensus in international forums. We are therefore voting against the whole report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That Charter will be a vital step towards the political deepening of the European Union, under the appropriate conditions. It will, in fact, enable us to make up for shortcomings that have existed ever since the growth in the powers of the European Union and the European Community, with the European institutions taking decisions that affect the life of the people of Europe more and more directly. These people need a document to which they can refer when they take their case before the European Court of Justice. So we must provide for direct resort to that Court in accordance with certain procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter will also help define a ‘collective patrimony of values and principles and a shared system of fundamental rights which bind citizens together and underpin the Union’s internal policies’, a patrimony we must constantly defend against the racist and xenophobic tendencies that have, alas, not disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">As the representative of the people of the European Union, our Parliament must take a very careful look at the contents of this document. The people of Europe expect us to take a very bold approach here. Our demands are quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter must have fully binding legal status by being incorporated in the Treaty. To that end, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs calls on the Council to put the Charter on the ICG agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Any amendment of the Charter must come under the same procedure as its original drafting procedure, which means it would require the assent of the European Parliament. The European Parliament must approve any secondary legislation that might have a bearing on these fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The indivisibility of these fundamental rights must be recognised by making the Charter applicable to all the European Union’s institutions and bodies and all its policies, including those contained in the second and third pillars, in the context of the powers and functions conferred upon it by the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter must be binding upon the Member States when applying or transposing provisions of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the actual content of the Charter, it would seem advisable to divide up these rights into three categories. The Charter would enshrine the <span class="bold">civil rights</span> directly related to European citizenship, such as the right to vote, the right of petition, the right to appeal to the ombudsman; the <span class="bold">rights of the individual</span>, i.e. all the rights protected by the various international organisations and the new rights (bioethics, protection of personal data); and the <span class="bold">social rights</span>, i.e. the right to a minimum wage, the right to strike, the right to unemployment benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that this Charter must form the key component of a process leading to the drafting of a European Union constitution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, the significance of this document is obvious if it is regarded as a potential preamble to a European constitution; conversely, it would be redundant in those Member States that already include these rights in their own constitution and legal traditions and confirm them by ratifying international texts such as the European Convention and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy enough to think of ways to improve the application of the existing texts; but the technocratic nature of the process of European integration becomes quite obvious again today from the decision to draft an additional document, which could hardly be anything but repetitive.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet what worries me most is the content that is to be given to these rights. Indeed, at this same part-session we are discussing reports by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms which reflect a libertarian vision of society. Their aim is not so much to defend and promote human rights as to make a clean sweep of all the points of reference on which our societies are founded and replace them with an individualist jumble ‘with neither lord nor master’. This kind of Europe is based on a new totalitarianism in which man finds himself alone facing a Community administration that is as remote as it is impersonal, in which the intermediate structures – and in particular the most vital one of all, the family – have been gradually destroyed. Our society will no longer have a common destiny; instead it will be based on a juxtaposition of ‘minorities’ which each have their own rights but no common obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion I draw from these texts is that the just fight for human rights has become the ideological plaything of irresponsible and selfish individuals. What they are proposing to us today spells the death of the common good and, over and above that, of the very meaning of life; for they are concerned only with human rights and have forgotten what man is first and foremost, and what his roots and aspirations are.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These rights are the backbone of the Constitutions of all the countries of the Union, guaranteeing protection of European citizens from attack or abuse in any of the Member States, and they are applied to the different situations in individual States through the interpretation of the case law of the European Court of Justice.</p>

<p class="contents">However, I feel that the drafting of a Union Charter of Rights which is binding upon the institutions and also, indirectly, upon the relations of Member States with their citizens, could confuse the relationship between the Member States and the Union, let subsidiarity in by the back door and give rise to an overlap between the national and European levels at which fundamental rights and the protection they guarantee operate, generating dangerous confusion and opening the way for multiple interpretations of a single principle.</p>

In my view, a declaration would be more appropriate. The European Convention on Human Rights is an excellent tool for protecting human rights in Europe. It involves enforcing these rights on the basis of judgements given by the Court of Human Rights, which has developed considerable expertise in this area, as well as extensive case law. The Convention also has the advantage of not being limited in scope to the area of the EU but of operating in relation to almost the whole of the European continent. At the same time, it is the European Court of Justice’s practice to take account of the national fundamental rights applicable in the Member States. This practice could be affected if the EU were to obtain its own set of fundamental and human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the Commissioner, in a response to the debate, said she would not be stopping approval of key funding programmes.

There is no other explanation as to why the Commission gave way yesterday and suddenly decided to reinterpret the Structural Funds regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Having given itself real teeth last year and called in notifications of FFH areas for the joint “Natura 2000” project which had been overdue for years, the Commission has now tripped itself up by accepting that notifications can be submitted ex-post.</p>
<p class="contents">That was unnecessary in that the regulation fully covered the Commission’s demand for FFH lists to be submitted together with the plans at the latest and per se leaves the Commission no room for manoeuvre here. The Structural Funds Regulation – decided unanimously last year by all the Member States – clearly states that the ex-ante evaluation is a prerequisite to the programme and the planning documents which the Member States submit to the Commission for approval.</p>
<p class="contents">The Structural Funds regulation also states that this ex-ante evaluation should include an assessment of the environmental situation, especially in areas which might be influenced by Structural Fund intervention. The Commission is therefore duty bound to ensure that the documents notify it of potential areas subject to European nature conservation before it approves the plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Submitting FFH lists once plans have been approved makes no sense from the point of view of content, because the protected areas will be reduced and adjusted to planned investments (rather than representing the framework, as required under the regulation), nor does it make any legal sense from a legal point of view because then, of course, exactly what the Commission wished to avoid will happen, i.e. planning conflicts will result in long-winded disputes. The Commission is deluding itself if it thinks that it can use Article 39 to recoup what it has failed to obtain during ex-ante evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">How can the Commission be credible vis-à-vis the European citizens if it is unable to implement its own requirements? By giving in, the Commission has lost the confidence of many who see sustainable development as a chance for the next generation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only result of this kind of overload is to paralyse the economic players a little more each day and to hold back freedom of enterprise. This happened, for instance, with the CTEs which are designed to turn our farmers into environmental officers, rewarded not by the fruit of their labours but by subsidies paid in return for their submission to the Gosplan of Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore categorically reject Mrs Jackson’s proposal to link payments from the Structural Funds to the transposing by Member States of EU environmental legislation. That would be a very dangerous mixture of unrelated things and would pave the way to the generalised practice of financial blackmail, a blackmail that is all the more inadmissible in that, as we must remember, the money from the Structural Funds remains above all the product of the contributions the Member States pay into the EU budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, the EU’s international action to promote and protect human rights is based on several instruments, including the CFSP and development cooperation. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has become more visible on the international stage thanks to the appointment of a CFSP High Representative, in the person of Javier Solana. The Treaty of Amsterdam has made respect for human rights one of the main objectives of the EU’s common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has many instruments available in this field. There are the common strategies (a new instrument created since the Treaty of Amsterdam and designed to enhance the overall coherence of EU action at international level), the common positions (which define the EU’s approach to a particular matter) and the common actions (which relate to certain specific situations and involve immediate reactions, on the model of humanitarian aid). There are also specific and horizontal actions relating to a given policy. They include, in particular, the fight to abolish the death penalty. Finally, what is known as the ‘human rights’ clause, which has been incorporated into most cooperation and development agreements with third countries since the 1990s, enables the EU to keep up the pressure, in respect of human rights, on the countries with which it is linked. This clause does not change the fundamental nature of these agreements but does enable both parties to reaffirm respect for certain common values and principles as the precondition for any form of cooperation, economic or other.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the rapporteur feels that the current European human rights policy is fragmented and needs to be replaced by a coherent common strategy marked by closer interinstitutional cooperation. Obviously I agree with that. I think initiatives such as establishing an advisory group to discuss the strategic aspects of human rights activities, comprising representatives of the EU institutions and the Member States, together with human rights specialists, would lead to greater coherence and therefore effectiveness. In the same context, the proposals that the EU should develop its own indicators to gauge respect for human rights, that a special European Parliament envoy should be nominated for prisoners of conscience and that a human rights website should be launched on the Europarl site on the Internet, are well worth considering.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also emphasises that the EU strategy must give priority to systematically abolishing the discrimination suffered by women. I want to express my unconditional support for that demand! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While there is much in the Malmström resolution that we can support, unfortunately there are significant elements that have been included which we find unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, we do not share the enthusiasm for an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. We are sceptical about demands for substantial increases in expenditure and bureaucratic activity and in the role of EC-funded NGOs. We are concerned that it is minority differences that are stimulated, with little emphasis on integration. We are concerned at the extension of the concept of human rights to include, for example, domestic violence, which is properly a matter to be handled under other legal instruments. We are opposed to the introduction of sweeping new categories of eligibility for asylum, which would be open to abuse. Many of us do not support the abolition of capital punishment in principle. And we are suspicious about proposals to impose further codes of conduct on business.</p>
<p class="contents">While we value the role of the EU in supporting human rights, we believe that human rights regulation and legislation, as in so many areas dealing with the relationship between the citizen and the state, is a matter for national governments, and we do not welcome an extension of EU intervention in this area.</p>

However, I and a majority in my Group voted against the report because points 52 – 56 contain quite controversial social policy requirements which may well be supported by the left wing of this House but which have nothing to do with human rights. The German constitution offers marriage and the family special protection and that has nothing to do with the violation of human rights. On the contrary, it is a guarantee of human rights. Marriage and the family form the basis for human rights, as does the right to life. I therefore believe that these points should have been left out of the human rights report.

At last we have before us a report which duly deals with the subject, the stated period and enforceable rights. Hence our support in principle. We voted against it, however, because two points were accepted by the majority of the House; I refer to points 53 and 54, which tackle the issue of the family and the excessive support or special support for all alternative types of partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European People’s Party see the family as a value per se, as the cornerstone of society, if you like, as the heart of society, and cannot accept that alternative life styles should be specially fostered and set above the family, which we see as the nucleus of our society. However, with these points and the majority decision by Parliament, we now have a situation in points 53 and 54 in which alternative lifestyles enjoy special favour and are placed above the family, as a result of which we find it impossible to vote for the report as a whole.</p>

The executive committee of the <span class="italic">Nationalrat</span> (National Assembly) has passed a resolution unanimously adopting the motion for the executive committee to reach an agreement under paragraph 2 of the Law of 3 April 1919 on the resolution by the Federal government of 26 March 1996 and to consider the declarations of renunciation by Felix Habsburg-Lothringen and Karl Ludwig Habsburg-Lothringen as adequate, so that nothing now stands in the way of their being issued with passports which will allow them to enter Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore able to tell the House that both Felix Habsburg-Lothringen and Karl Ludwig Habsburg-Lothringen have valid passports without any form of restriction. Neither signed the declarations of renunciation required by the constitutional office, because they have distanced themselves from the house of Habsburg; instead they merely entered the following statement on their passport applications: “In order to avoid misunderstandings, let it be noted in this connection that I, the applicant, have not and do not question the republican form of government of Austria nor have I ever considered making any manner of claim to sovereignty”.

Among others, it is calling for equal rights of all kinds between same-sex couples and the traditional family, together with lowering the age of consent for same-sex relations.</p>
<p class="contents">May I just remind you that Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State”. That same article defines the family in terms of the marriage between a man and a woman. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights repeats the same idea by declaring, in Article 10, that “The widest possible protection and assistance should be accorded to the family, which is the natural and fundamental group unit of society”.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why the traditional family is entitled to this state protection is because it provides a service without price: the renewal of the generations, the perpetuation of society, the education of children and the transmission of values. That service is a very good reason for granting the family special advantages, reserved to it alone.</p>

However, we oppose the annual report on human rights being used to promote further integration within the EU. We are not in favour of the new institutional arrangements proposed in the report or in favour of the proposal that the EU should establish a common legal framework and a common policy on refugees and asylum seekers. We believe that human rights problems should be combated locally and by means of the international human rights institutions and forums which already exist and which are designed for this purpose, for example, the UN and the Council of Europe. Nor do we support the view that the EU should draw up a new, legally binding EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Rather, we are of the opinion that such a Charter would create conflicts in relation to the European Convention on Human Rights. An EU Charter of Fundamental Rights would not in itself help improve the human situation, either at European or international level. We have, however, chosen to vote in favour of the report in spite of what I have just said, for we think it is extremely important to fight for improved human rights in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me remind you that this report replaces the traditional memorandum on EU activities in this field which the Council used to present to the European Parliament every year to inform it of EU action on human rights in the world over the past year. This report aims to explain the EU’s motives and the institutional structures and instruments available to it for conducting an active policy of respect for human rights. </p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, the report points out that the Treaty of Amsterdam has introduced new human rights provisions in order to underpin EU action in this field, especially in the context of the CFSP. We must grasp these new opportunities. Thus the Treaty has established respect for fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the Council of Europe’s Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as a principle. That means the European Union is ‘founding’ its action on the principles of democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />With enlargement, the European Union has clearly announced to all candidate countries that respect for democracy, the law, human rights and minorities is a basic accession criterion. Our European Parliament has a vital role to play in the formulation and practical application of EU human rights policy. Our powers have gradually increased so that this Parliament has now become a forum for discussion of human rights, a recognised forum as our debate today proves.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we are discussing points out that, although the European Union claims to export its model to third countries, the situation at home is not flawless either. In fact the 1999 Amnesty International Yearbook singles out eleven of the fifteen Member States for criticism, reproaching them with more or less serious human rights offences.</p>
<p class="contents">Aside from any criticisms, the rapporteur puts forward practical proposals, which I support, such as extending the right of all non-EU nationals to vote and stand for local and European elections provided they have resided in the EU for more than five years.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find other proposals on improving the right of asylum most interesting; they need to be quickly put into in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">On the situation of candidate countries, much progress remains to be made, especially in relation to respect for the rights of minorities. The European Parliament must, therefore, remain vigilant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support the general philosophy underlying the document, which aims to consolidate European policy with regard to civil and political rights, but also to the economic, social and cultural rights of EU residents.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet I would also like to draw my colleagues’ attention to two requests made in the report, which I find problematic. Paragraph 19 of the report, concerning the protection of national minorities, and paragraph 20, calling for the ratification of the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, pose real problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly understand the spirit of the rapporteur’s observations on the need to protect national minorities: it sends out a strong message to some of the candidate countries, especially the Eastern European ones, whose nationals do not all enjoy fundamental rights. Parliament firmly rejects abuses of fundamental freedoms throughout Europe, as the Haarder report emphasises. But we regret that it alludes to the rights of ‘national minorities’, an expression that is far more restrictive than the universal concept of ‘human rights’.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we support the idea of an indivisible political community, within which ethnic origin is not eclipsed but regarded as being of secondary importance. The Republic cannot recognise <span class="italic">specific</span> ‘minorities’ or ‘communities’: in its view there are only autonomous and free citizens with equal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of our convictions we must also express strong reservations about paragraph 20 of the report, which refers to the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. Everyone is free to use one or several languages of his or her choice in addition to the language of the Republic and everyone has the right to learn them at school.<span class="italic"> But the fact remains that this is a choice and not an obligation</span>. The Charter is too vague in this respect, which entails the risk of encouraging the formation of regional communities; that would pose a threat to the unity of the Republic but also, in the long run, to the cohesion of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I will, nevertheless, vote for Mr Haarder’s report because of its quality and its underlying philosophy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are particularly worried by the proposals for greater consideration to be given to human rights in the Union’s foreign policy, not because we underestimate their importance or the need to promote and safeguard them but because experience shows that they are being used selectively. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union turns a blind eye to situations in which human rights are being savagely violated in order to protect its imperialistic interests. Its attitude towards the Turkish regime is a blatant example. </p>
<p class="contents">Elsewhere, the particularly sensitive issue of human rights is being used as an excuse for intervention, even military intervention, so as to impose specific policies and particular courses of action. </p>
<p class="contents">The recent and continuing invasions in Kosovo, using the rights of minorities as a pretext, and the unbelievable demands being made on Yugoslavia are a typical example of how military intervention is being advanced as a general principle of international law at the expense of the principle of national sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">The very policy which the EU and its Member States are pursuing from<span class="bold"> </span>within<span class="bold"> </span>is leading to human rights being subverted and becoming dead letter.

We can get an initial sketchy idea from reading the Ludford and Haarder reports: this is a project for a libertarian society, based on rights without obligations, on freedom without responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom is not something that can be decreed. But those who are building Europe seem unaware of that fact: they not only want to bring happiness to the people <span class="italic">ex nihilo</span>, regardless of their differences and their aspirations, but, on top of that, they want to establish a society without points of reference, without distinction between what can and cannot be done, a society that believes in hedonism or the culture of death.</p>

<p class="contents">Paragraph 19 urges Belgium to sign the Convention for national minorities. Flanders does not seek to prevent Belgium from ratifying this Convention for national minorities, but it would like to add the proviso that this should be done outside the Belgian constitutional context. In the Belgian federation, the federal states are equal pursuant to the rules in the constitution. Not one of them constitutes an actual minority. Because the Convention does not clearly define the term “national minority”, according to Flanders, it does not apply to the periphery. For Flanders, “national minority” in such a context can only refer to a minority which has been established within a certain area for centuries, whilst the French-speakers only moved to the periphery some three centuries ago and have since refused to integrate, which is to be expected in the normal course of events (compare this with the Flemish migration to Wallonia and their perfectly integrated descendants). Moreover, French-speakers living in the periphery, which boasts the language facilities, can count on protection, which is mostly unavailable to real minorities. </p>
<p class="contents">So, whoever tries to change the situation in the Brussels periphery using this convention will implicitly put the future of the Belgian constitutional equilibrium at risk and illustrate once again that a European lack of insight into our federal system can lead one to think that we would be better off as the separate Member States of Flanders and Wallonia, rather than as a federal Member State of Belgium. </p>
<p class="contents">Without a doubt, French-speaking Belgian MEPs will again use this vote to play political games in Belgium. We do not wish to participate in this and would emphatically disassociate ourselves from this kind of practice. Moreover, we regret that in paragraph 5 of the Ludford report, the same text was adopted for racism and xenophobia. </p>
<p class="contents">In the same light, Flanders would like to make it clear that the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, as referred to in paragraph 20 of the Haarder report, does not pertain to French in the periphery but, for example, to the Limburg dialect (recognised in the application of this Charter in the Netherlands) or to the Arel German dialect in the Province of Luxembourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two of the provisions in that text call on a number of countries, including France, to ratify the European Framework Convention for the protection of national minorities and the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I really must dispel a misunderstanding that is tainting the whole debate about regional languages; the purpose is certainly not to forbid whomsoever it be from speaking, teaching or promoting a minority or regional language of whatever kind. Insofar as learning or using these languages remains a personal choice, I, for my part, am in favour of any measure to promote their conservation and transmission, since they form part of the cultural heritage of the nations.</p>
<p class="contents">I have voted against the Haarder report because, in calling for the ratification of the European Framework Convention for the protection of national minorities and the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, it is seeking to promote a concept of European integration that is based on a vision to which I cannot subscribe. According to that concept, the individual has particular rights based on his membership of a territorial, ethnic or religious entity, while the community constitutes the key means of mediating between the individual and the right he is claiming.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst, at first sight, recognition of the community may seem a factor that protects the integration of minorities, in fact, however, it is a strong factor of social segregation and regression (you need only think of the situation of young Turkish or Maghreb girls, who are excluded from the emancipating benefits of ethnically mixed schooling, who are held back by archaic rules on the status of women).</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, while recognition of a special status for these communities may seem to protect the weakest and most destitute, on the contrary, it in fact produces a social compartmentalisation which the triumphant march of liberalism can turn to its advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, while it is true that enlargement of the European Union means we must take account of the special situation of certain national minorities, nonetheless the community-based solution offers no future prospects whatsoever for population groups who are under threat or oppressed. On the contrary, recent history has shown how the exacerbation of the sense of belonging to a particular community can trigger the resurgence of ancient ethnic disputes and lead to fratricidal conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than this concept, I prefer the universalist vision of a republican Europe in which each individual as such fully and actively exercises his rights and freedoms. I prefer a Europe which offers a chance of integration to all those who subscribe to its common values, whether they proclaim their religious identity or practise no religion, whether they speak the language of their ancestors or have chosen to transcend their roots.</p>
<p class="contents">That Europe affirms the primacy of a principle not found in the Haarder report, the secular principle, which contains and synthesises all the other freedoms: right to respect for private life, freedom of conscience and religion, freedom of expression and association.</p>
<p class="contents">The Republic of Europe remains to be built: let us hope that the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is still at the drafting stage, will constitute the first act and the cornerstone of that Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For the same reasons, I abstained on the report on the fight against racism and xenophobia in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In solemn speeches and addresses, such as that given this week in the European Parliament by the Prime Minister of the country currently holding the presidency of the Union, Portugal, the wealth of Europe’s different cultures, traditions, languages and national identities has been emphasised time after time. </p>
<p class="contents">To then state that the family’s – and, therefore indirectly, children’s – legal position should be standardised throughout Europe, as proposed in paragraphs 53 and 54 of the present resolution, constitutes a basic offence against the national right to legislate and against the EU’s own subsidiarity principle, as formulated in the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">In our capacity as Swedish Christian Democrats, we shall, of course, be continuing our work in the Swedish Parliament aimed at establishing a basic legal position where the family and marriage between men and women are concerned. This is with a view to making our country’s legislation more friendly to families and children and out of an active desire to support stable and long-term parental relationships which can meet children’s needs for security, care and socialisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The champions of the libertarian ideology never miss the chance to list a whole series of demands, each more ludicrous than the next, all wrapped up in proper sentiments. Perhaps that is what this whole exercise demands. Alas, the 2000 vintage still goes along with this curious tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing has been left out, from the right of non-EU nationals to vote and stand in municipal and European elections, to guaranteeing ‘same-sex couples rights equal to those enjoyed by traditional couples and families’, to the standardisation of the procedure governing the right of asylum within the European Union, all inspired by the eternal resolve to glean new powers for Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights, I shall confine myself to emphasising the equality between men and women on the one hand, and the importance of the family on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">While the persistence of discrimination between men and women, with regard to pay for example, is unacceptable, to set men against women, as some feminist organisations do, would be sterile and put social cohesion at risk. We therefore categorically reject any policy of quotas or positive discrimination, those pet themes of political correctness. As we put it in Brussels on 1 March, that kind of policy would reflect a profound contempt for women: women should gain access to political or administrative posts not through the mechanical workings of some form of quota but through the recognition of their merits and abilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Women have a specific role to play in society: they have a vital family role to play in the procreation of the new generations that are essential to the survival of society, a role to play in educating the young; they have an economic role, as mother of the family, but also a role within family enterprises (family holdings, businesses, SMEs). This role has been downgraded for far too long, although it is a key role.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, that implies giving the wives of self-employed workers who play a part in the family business a stable status and, on the other hand, recognising the economic and social role of the mother. It also implies enabling women to reconcile family life with working life, giving all women the chance to make a genuine choice: how many women have been forced by economic constraints only to have two children when they would have liked three? How many of them have been forced to devote more time to their professional life than they would have wished?</p>
<p class="contents">That kind of policy would mean giving the family its due place. But this report is an extremely dangerous all-out attack on the family. It calls for equal rights for same-sex couples and traditional couples and families, forgetting the vital role the family plays in social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us make no mistake: everyone leads the private life they want; there can be no question of secret policing. However, same-sex couples as such are of no use to society, they are sterile and can only lead to a sterile society; so society does not have to recognise them and grant them rights: it should ignore them. The family, on the contrary, is the community on which society is based and that ensures its stability. Its utility resides in the fact that it provides the most stable framework possible for creating new generations, for their education, and therefore for the continuity of mankind.</p>
<p class="contents">Even now, with the strong backing of certain European resolutions and under pressure from action groups, there are some who are preparing to recognise the right of same-sex couples to adopt children. Just imagine the psychological future of children with two fathers and no mother, or two mothers and no father! If it is to fulfil its potential, a child needs a father and a mother, a stable family.</p>
<p class="contents">In face of the culture of death, it is our duty to stand up for the culture of life. We believe in an exalted idea of the dignity of man, whoever he may be, without discrimination, from the moment of conception to his natural death. That means breaking with the materialistic and individualistic view of man and believing that there is something sacred in each individual, which is the foundation of human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Only then can we effectively and consistently ban human cloning or discrimination on the basis of genetic inheritance, a discrimination suffered far too often by, for instance, Down’s syndrome babies, in the name of what seem to be the best of intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only at that price that we can reject the unacceptable hypocrisy of chatting peacefully about human rights while closing our eyes to an economic and commercial system which, in the name of the dogma of free trade, encourages child exploitation in many third world countries.</p>
<p class="contents">And then we will be able to move away from a policy of minorities, the legacy of an individualist thinking that is a threat to a peaceful society, away from an ideology of minorities that is a new expression of the class war, that disregards the profound unity of the human family and seeks to establish superficial divisions based on race, sexual mores, age or ethnicity and demand specific rights for each of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Man is neither a social security number nor a pawn on a social and economic chessboard to be manipulated at will and discarded when no longer of use. He is worth much more than that: every man is a sacred history.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
