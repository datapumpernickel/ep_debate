<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, during the last exchange we had in this House in February on the conduct of the Duma and presidential elections in Russia, we shared our concerns about the irregularities and violations of the electoral process and about the violence against demonstrators and their detention.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we welcomed the political awakening of Russian civil society. We saw Russian civil society ready to engage in dialogue with the government and to play an active role in the development of political institutions in the country. We saw some signs of cautious but real dialogue between government and citizens emerging.</p>
<p class="contents">We had been encouraging the then newly-elected President Putin to pursue the political and economic reforms that were started by President Medvedev. We also offered our support in working on our shared modernisation agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been some important developments in that respect. First and foremost, let me mention Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation on 22 August. By joining the WTO, Russia took a major step forward in its ongoing integration into the international rules-based trade system. We strongly supported that process and now expect Russia to fully implement all the related agreements, so as to reap the maximum benefit of membership of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">There had been some encouraging initial steps in the spring towards further development of Russia’s democratic institutions, notably the easing of party registration rules and requirements for presidential candidates, as well as direct elections of regional governors. However, these have been the only positive political reforms this year so far. To allow for a truly pluralistic parliamentary system, without undue obstacles to the work of a viable opposition, much more needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Upon President Putin’s return to the Kremlin, we encouraged him to engage in a constructive dialogue with citizens and civil society to find the best way forward and ensure a good future for Russia. Since May, however, we have been seeing less and less dialogue and openness on the side of the authorities, and rather more intolerance of any expression of dissenting views. Instead of stronger safeguards for the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms, we have seen a string of measures that chip away at them.</p>
<p class="contents">At least four major pieces of new legislation went through the Duma at unusual – some would say unconstitutional – speed, before the summer recess. Their common aim seems to have been to further reduce the available space for independent civil and political activity in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Immediately after the inauguration of the new President on 7 May, a number of opposition leaders and activists who organised and participated in the 6 May demonstrations were arrested and fined. Many face serious criminal charges. Soon after, on 8 June, President Putin signed into law restrictive amendments effectively limiting the scope for demonstrations.</p>
<p class="contents">I reacted to these developments with a public statement. I stressed that the government should, including via legislation, guarantee freedom of assembly for citizens. I also cautioned that strong measures to curtail this right were likely to prove counterproductive.</p>
<p class="contents">A few weeks later, another law was passed forcing Russian NGOs receiving foreign funding to present themselves as ‘foreign agents’ in all their activities. Given the history of such a term, foreign funding is thus considered by law to turn its recipients into ‘spies’.</p>
<p class="contents">I reiterated my serious concerns over these developments as well as the overall worsening situation for civil society in Russia. Grassroots civil society movements, be it human rights NGOs or election monitoring organisations such as Golos, are important components of democratic society. They do an essential job in Russia today and they are key to Russia’s modernisation. In the interests of Russia, they should be allowed to work freely and have the means to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have supported some NGOs in their activities and will continue to offer our support to their contribution to the modernisation of Russia. We do so because the European Union has a strong interest in a stable, prosperous and democratic Russia. We have been offering our support to those in Russia who share this goal. But by doing it, we neither impose our objectives on these Russian organisations, nor do we aim in any way to control their activities. In no way do these Russian organisations become our, or anybody else’s, agents; let me state this very clearly. All Russian NGOs I know would undoubtedly prefer to receive Russian funding, but there is barely any public funding available for activities that could potentially be perceived as being critical of the authorities, nor do many businessmen dare to offer support.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not go into the details now of the laws on libel and Internet freedom. The key issue is how they will be interpreted and applied. We will pay attention to that.</p>
<p class="contents">As honourable Members know, most recently, on 17 August, three young women, members of the punk band ‘Pussy Riot’, were sentenced to two years in prison each for a peaceful, less-than-one-minute long performance. We all understand that this provocative stunt in the Christ-the-Saviour cathedral hurt religious feelings. But it was a non-violent expression of political opinion. Under Russian law, it should have been sanctioned as a minor offence, not as a serious crime. On the same day, I issued a statement to express my deep disappointment with the disproportionate sentence and recalled Russia’s commitments to respect its obligations to ensure fair, transparent and independent legal process. Serious irregularities in the trial have been reported, including the conditions of pre-trial detention.</p>
<p class="contents">Taken together, the package of legislation limiting the freedom of assembly, restricting NGOs, curtailing the freedom of the Internet, the Pussy Riot case, an upsurge in prosecution of activists, including Alexey Navalny, and the sentencing of Ms Osipova, the dismissal of an opposition-minded Duma deputy and a continued lack of progress on the Magnitsky case, constitute a trend of great concern to us.</p>
<p class="contents">This trend raises serious questions on the state of the rule of law and, in particular, the use of legal and law enforcement structures and other instruments for political purposes, which should be used to safeguard and protect the rights and freedoms of the citizens of Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to stress again the importance of having an economically successful, modern, and democratic Russia at the border of the European Union. Russia is sometimes a challenging neighbour, but it remains an important partner of the European Union on many issues and in many fields.</p>
<p class="contents">We remain ready to work with Russia in all the positive reform efforts, to work closely together on the Partnership for Modernisation, the integration of the international rules-based system, and the development of citizens’ rights and freedoms: that has to be the basis for stability and prosperity. We will continue to work closely with the government and ministries on these goals but we should not shy away from our responsibilities as a partner to express our concerns with recent developments. We worry that the government sets the country on the wrong path and wastes an opportunity for effective modernisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the European Parliament for working continuously and consistently with me and the EEAS services on both these strands. Let me take my opportunity to express my gratitude to Parliament, in particular, for your strong support for civil society cooperation between the EU and Russia, including, of course, in financial terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are also reflected in the resolution we negotiated today.</p>
<p class="contents">We are both incredibly critical about Russia’s democratic development. We also know that that country has never had a real democracy and that this is a learning process which Russia needs to go through. However, whilst at one point, with the inauguration of President Medvedev, we thought we would be able to cherish hope and confidence that the situation would take a turn for the better, it is now actually heading in the opposite direction. We agree with you that Russia’s modernisation means that it will become more prosperous and that that will lead, in particular, to a democratisation of Russian society.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just we Europeans who recognise that things are not going well, that the situation is stagnating; the Russians see it too. Ten days ago, an EU delegation visited Russia and we spoke in St Petersburg about civil society. We also discussed there all the laws that you have just mentioned. The problem is that we never know where we stand with Russia’s vague and very broad interpretation of civil society. As a result of this, an orderly functioning of civil society is absolutely impossible, as organisations no longer know over which point they could be taken to trial.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we going to do together to ensure that Russia abides by the rule of law? That is the only way to modernise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This was recognised 25 years ago by Mikhail Gorbachev when he talked about the human factor. He knew, and the reformers knew, that they could only move Russia forward if they mobilised the free will of the people. This will of the people, this energy of the Russian people, has to be based on the observation of human rights, civil rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in this regard, we are also very distressed with the situation that has been developing since May, not only with the harsh sentencing of the rock band ‘Pussy Riot’, but also with cases such as moves to strip a freely-elected deputy, Gennady Gudkov, of his mandate. The same applies to Mr Ponomarev.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the Socialists and Democrats, want dialogue with Russia. We are willing to talk to our Russian partners. Russia is also a member of the OECD and of the Council of Europe. Therefore, I think that it is in Russia’s interest and in our interest to develop a dialogue not only on strategic partnership, economic cooperation and energy, but also on human and civil rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only in our interest, it is, above all, in Russia’s interest, because without us, the Russian economy, Russian society and the Russian state cannot develop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is expressed in the series of resolutions. However, are words enough to protect Russia’s democratic development? The fates of Politkovskaya, Khodorkovsky and Magnitsky demonstrate clearly that the Russian authorities have not kept their promise to implement the rule of law. Now we face a dilemma. Do we continue with the same strategy, increasing the level of verbal pleas? Should our thoughts not be accompanied by concrete gestures? We are deeply moved by the fate of three young political activists of the Pussy Riot group, which represents the desire for political freedom held by the new generation in Russia. The state’s response was a continuation of all of the draconian measures previously taken against any real political activities that the Kremlin did not like.</p>
<p class="contents">For Russian civil society, for the new generation of Russians, we need to live the truth. Words are not enough. We need a gesture, an act that proves our commitment to all those who hope for freedom in Russia. A law is needed to encourage the establishment of the rule of law. The ‘Magnitsky law’ is designed to be a carefully targeted reaction against all those who are responsible for human rights abuses and those who are corrupt. It is a gesture of solidarity with Russian civil society. There is no time to lose. We must act now. Support the ‘Magnitsky law’! Support freedom for Russia! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should finally and honestly take stock of the situation and stop pretending to ourselves. For years we have been making efforts to bring about a strategic partnership, but we do not yet have one. In fact, this goal is still a long way off. Our policy of integration and appeasement has reached its limits. The conflicts in Syria and Iran, which we have just been discussing, demonstrate that we do not have common interests and that we are pursuing diametrically opposed objectives. The despotic and autocratic regimes in Asia are closer to the Kremlin than the liberal West. This is made clear by the ambitious project to set up a Eurasian Union, which lacks a convincing political and economic base. The modernisation agreement has got no further than declarations of intent and the new government has not exactly shown itself to be committed to modernisation. Quite the contrary.</p>
<p class="contents">The laws recently passed by the Duma, which still has no legitimacy, are taking Russia back into the past. They are tendentious and have deliberately vague wording in order to open the door to arbitrary justice. This is demonstrated by the dreadful trials of Mr Khodorkovsky and Pussy Riot and by the criminal prosecution and appalling death of Sergei Magnitsky. In Russia, the prosecution of crimes depends not on the acts themselves, but on whether the legal proceedings meet the ruling elites’ political requirements or are useful to them. Russia is no longer on the way to becoming a state under the rule of law. Instead, it is moving in the opposite direction. Our one-sided efforts to bring about cooperation and modernisation seem more like attempts to introduce change by ingratiating ourselves with the Russian regime. The Kremlin sees this as an acknowledgement of the political line it is taking. Therefore, we must show that we have the determination to put these questions to the test. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to all the matters that you raised, to the new issues that you discussed, to the new laws that restrict human rights and freedoms, I would like to add another matter, which you did not mention, namely, the situation of Ms Osipova – I am sure you are aware of her situation – who has been convicted for alleged drug possession.

The Russian police and prosecution service still have not been able to find and try the killers of Anna Politkovskaya or Natalia Estemirova, for example. There are very worrying reports about the Russian organisation ‘Golos’, which monitors elections. A court in Moscow imposed a fine of RUB 30 000 on this organisation. Also worrying is the proposal according to which the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation is to gain the right to block implementation of decisions by the European Court of Human Rights. In the light of these events, the fundamental question arises: how has the European External Action Service responded to the abovementioned instances, which are illegal and detrimental for the rule of law? In the context of these events, the conviction of the members of Pussy Riot, whose vulgar performance also offended thousands of Christians around the world, can only be judged from the point of view of severity rather than whether the penalty was justified. One cannot base arguments concerning the failure of the rule of law and the totalitarian nature of the Kremlin regime on this particular judgment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although it is very important, trade is not everything that we here in Europe, in the European Parliament or, increasingly, Russian inhabitants themselves, expect from Russia. I had an opportunity to meet and talk to them during two visits to St Petersburg while on holiday.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we expect from Russo-European relations? We have the right to expect and we do expect Russia to become not just an increasingly liberal economy, but also that it should become more democratic and European and this also applies to civil liberties. Unfortunately, we are sorry to see that recent events do not appear to be following this trend. The situation in Russia is going in the opposite direction, a negative direction. Repressive acts against opposition activists, to name only Mr Navalny and Mr Kasparov, restrictive laws on non-governmental organisations, restrictions on Internet freedom and the disproportionate sentences handed down to the punk singers – these are just the most recent events showing how badly things are going in Russia. In addition, instances such as the strange case against Mr Khodorkovsky call for justice, as does the unexplained death of Mr Magnitsky. It is time for discussion with Russia to be not just about trade but also about respect for human rights and civil liberties. It is time for a Magnitsky list, that is, a visa ban on persons involved in the death of that brave lawyer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You probably cannot tell this from looking at me, but I am not a fan of punk music. We are now all familiar with one punk group and that is Pussy Riot. I see the situation slightly differently from Baroness Ashton, but the subject of whether this was a civil protest or simply hooliganism which caused deep offence to other people is open to discussion. We can perhaps even discuss what the penalty for this sort of behaviour should be. We all agree that a two-year sentence is far too long. However, what should concern us and, most importantly, what should concern the Russians in their own country is the clear indication that this trial is once again an example of the political system exerting influence on the judicial system. That is totally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the NGO act, which, as has already been said, has deliberately vague wording so that it can be interpreted as required. We need to set clear boundaries. The best thing to do would be to put this act where it belongs, in other words, in the rubbish bin. However, ladies and gentlemen, there is one thing you cannot say to me, which is that we must now evaluate everything we do together with Russia. I am firmly convinced, and we discussed this 10 days ago with our Russian colleagues in St Petersburg, that the only sensible way forward is to continue to talk to them and to Russian civil society, in order to get things moving. I am not one of those who believe that a discussion of resolutions by less than 3% of the Members of the European Parliament has better prospects for success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, Russian civil society has been wide awake for a long time. It is the governments of the majority of Member States of the European Union which are asleep. Therefore, I am very grateful to Baroness Ashton for the clear analysis of the situation that she has given us here today. However, we now need to move on from analysis to action.</p>
<p class="contents">The name Khodorkovsky, just like that of Magnitsky and many others that have been mentioned today, represents a reversal of the ineffectual moves towards the rule of law in Russia. As a devout Christian, I would like to say that I think Pussy Riot are much more Christian than many of the high-level representatives of the church. They have clearly said, and this is the quintessential point of their message, that the patriarch should listen more closely to God than to Putin. We do not need a church by the grace of Putin or an economy, a Duma or the pretence of the rule of law by the grace of Putin. If we continue to pursue an appeasement policy of this kind, and Mr Schulz is absolutely right in this respect, we will have a European Union by the grace of Putin. This is why I would like to make it very clear that we must focus on the rule of law in our discussions with Russia. Mr Fleckenstein is right. We must talk to Russia, but not in the way that he has described here. Instead, we must use the clear language that the European Parliament has always spoken when it comes to human rights. We cannot let the big countries off the hook and only speak out to the small ones.</p>

Nine months in custody for an act that it is very difficult to classify as a criminal act.</p>
<p class="contents">If I take this into account and think back to the old days of communism in Czechoslovakia, I do not remember the legal system being so politically abused in communist Czechoslovakia in the eighties.

<p class="contents">Since Mr Putin started his third presidential term, the human rights situation has deteriorated markedly, and Russia is heading away from the rule of law. Now the question remains: what must be done? Unless we continue to express our disappointment, we do not really help Russian civil society or our friends there, about whom we are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is time to set a threshold, with a warning that if Russia continues so blatantly to ignore its own commitments, there can be no further progress in our relations. The first and perfectly justified step is to establish a new EU common list of Russian officials responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky, and to deny them entry visas. This could be followed by similar restrictive measures towards other civil servants and politicians responsible for concrete acts of political repression. Only then, I think, will things begin to change. It is up to us to act or just to react. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It graphically reveals the repressive nature of the Putin regime, which will brook no opposition, but it also demonstrates the fear that the regime has not only of Pussy Riot, but of the mass demonstrations that have taken place against the election-rigging and also the threat of a Russian winter. That is because all of the promises made to the people of Russia at the time of the collapse of Stalinism have been proven to be false. They were promised economic growth and the benefits of that growth have gone only to the oligarchs while working people suffer. They were promised democracy. They got only rigged elections and an absence of any real democratic rights, the right to freedom of speech, the right to protest.</p>
<p class="contents">In her closing statement at the trial, one of the members of Pussy Riot, Yekaterina Samutsevich, accurately summed up the situation: ‘Compared to the judicial machine, we are nobodies and we have lost. On the other hand, we have won. The whole world now sees that the criminal case against us has been fabricated’. The system cannot conceal the repressive nature of this trial. It is nobodies like them who, with a mass movement in Russia armed with a socialist programme, can overthrow the Putin regime and bring about democratic and socialist change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the views of Members have been coherent and consistent in saying two or three things with which I agree.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we need to continue, and to step up, our work with civil society in Russia and to be as supportive as possible of all those who seek a democratic future for their country. We also need to be clear of the importance of Russia in terms of how we work with Russia in our activities across the world. I have already pointed to examples of that, but I would again refer to the Iran talks, where Russia is an important and key partner with us in trying to address the nature of the nuclear programme of Iran. I would not wish honourable Members to be under any illusion that Russia plays anything but an incredibly important role in that. So, too, does the Partnership for Modernisation, but we have to do more to push forward on this. It is important. It is an area of work, both in terms of economic life and in terms of political life, where we can do something.</p>
<p class="contents">But the concerns that have been raised have been well said. The concerns about individuals and about what is happening in terms of the basis of this debate, which is the political use of justice, have been well noted. I thank you for the support for what we are doing and look forward to continuing to work with you on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The story of the three members of the punk group comes at just the right time to shake up the constraints of a totally rigid Russian society. The three seeds of rebellion are, above all, three seeds that are putting pressure on Vladimir Putin’s apparatus of power. Activists, resistance fighters, agitators, militants: the photo of these women locked up in a glass cage was beamed around the world, reflecting the rejection of a judicial system that is reminiscent of the dark times of Stalinist trials. At that time, it took a great deal of courage to dare criticise the dictator in the Kremlin. The Russian poet Osip Mandelstam did not lack any such courage when he wrote, in 1934, an epigram against Stalin, a text that resulted in the writer being exiled to Siberia, where he died in 1938. The band members have received two years’ hard labour for having protested against the authorities. We should probably be more vigilant about respect for human rights when signing trade agreements that are binding on Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
