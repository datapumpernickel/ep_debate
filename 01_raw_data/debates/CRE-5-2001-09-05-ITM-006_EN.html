We saw demonstrators from far and wide gather at the Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation, IMP and World Bank meetings and the meeting of the World Economic Forum at Davos.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the end of last year, the summits of the European Council have also become the subject of massive protest campaigns. Nice and Gothenburg spring to mind. The recent G8 Summit in Genoa was the latest cause for massive protest. If these manifestations were conducted without any violence, we would be able to focus on responses to questions and concerns expressed by the demonstrators and those who support them. Unfortunately, the protests in Nice, Gothenburg and Genoa were attended by a high level of violence despite the fact that the organisers of the protests had dissociated themselves from the violence. Alongside the disruption for the people living in the cities where the summits and protests took place, and the material damage to houses and goods, the clashes have unfortunately also taken their human toll: a number of wounded and – what is worse – two fatalities.</p>
<p class="contents">We are willing to establish a constructive dialogue with civil society, with the NGOs and with all those who give peaceful expression to their concern about globalisation, but we reject and condemn the violence which has more than marred the latest protests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union must respond in two ways to the events I have just described.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it must prevent violence, whatever form it takes, in order to safeguard the area of freedom, security and justice that the Union represents, not just in law but also in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above that vital concern, it must also respond to the anxieties and questions of all the protesters. As you no doubt are aware, the Justice and Home Affairs Council considered the first aspect at its 13 July meeting, while the General Affairs Council considered the second one on 16 July.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers called for close international cooperation based on the existing legal instruments and the use of instruments such as the provisions of the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement and the joint action of 26 May 1997 on cooperation in the field of law and order and security.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, responsibility for the maintenance of law and order on the territory of EU Member States always remains within the sole remit of each state’s national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council does not have the power to adopt a position on a matter for which the Treaty has not given it competence. Let me assure Parliament that my country will be guided by the desire to prevent rather than the resolve to repress.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council emphasised, and I quote, ‘the need for the European Union and its democratically elected governments to make every effort to interpret the political dimension of globalisation and to address the concerns which globalisation is giving rise to in our societies, so as to properly manage the structural changes under way with the aim of contributing to the international community’s political, social and economic progress’.</p>
<p class="contents">‘In this context’, and I am still quoting, ‘the ministers feel it would be useful to continue a constructive dialogue on globalisation and its consequences with the social partners, the NGOs and the other representatives of civil society. Parliaments should be involved in this dialogue. The Commission and the Council will publish a detailed rationale of the already very positive role played by the European Union in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council considers that the political debate on globalisation and the dialogue with European civil society is a task which the European Union must carry out in the coming years so that it can influence its repercussions and fully benefit from its advantages. The Council emphasises the need to enter into a deeper dialogue with the developing countries so as to take into account their concerns vis-à-vis globalisation.’</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the presidency of the Union is particularly interested in these issues and over the coming weeks the Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt will publish his personal views in an open letter that will be very widely circulated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Along with a number of MEPs, I belong to the generation which was graduating and starting work when a storm of protest, partly fuelled in the United States, but with a definite European identity, broke out. Tradition associates it with the magical year of 1968, but anti-establishment activity had been brewing for a number of years and was to carry on for a few more years still. It was a very exciting time, brimming with ideas, new concepts and action. I would not have missed it for the world.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also remember my embarrassment on behalf of those who were as old as I am now and claimed to be on our side, to understand us completely and to know exactly where we were coming from. I will therefore not make the same mistake, but what I would say, on behalf of the presidency and on my own behalf, is that anti-establishment activity in itself is a good thing. The <span class="italic">pensée unique</span>, whatever <span class="italic">pensée unique</span> that may be, can never remain fruitful for long, and history is never-ending, whatever thoughts Marx, Engels and much later, Fukuyama may have had on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In my capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, I will not hazard an ideological debate. However, I do want to underline that the management and organisation of globalisation is precisely the task of the international, even global, organisations, and that the European Union is a excellent example of such organisation. It is therefore paradoxical for the protesters to fight precisely those institutions and organisations. The World Trade Organisation, for example, does not organise the economic and commercial anarchy, as some seem to think. It organises and regulates trade, it determines rules which apply universally and it operates by consensus of all affiliated states, which now number over 140. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, it would be quite improper to pretend that the globalisation of trade, the globalisation of industrial production and the increasingly monetarist approach to the economy offer nothing but advantages. It would be wrong to claim that the emergence and development of the new technologies have only brought benefits. We have to admit that these developments give rise to new divisions, new exclusions. In addition to the old division between poor and rich, whether individuals or nations, we now see the division, at the very heart of our societies and between the nations of the globe, between those who have access to the new technologies and those who do not, or who do not have the necessary training to make use of them. Insofar as the protests raise all these questions, it is up to us to answer them. Insofar as the debate is an ideological one, for instance where the protests are levelled against capitalism, the responses will obviously vary depending on our respective ideological positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above these ideological divisions, however, I believe there is no dispute about the need to keep globalisation under control. How can we derive the most benefit from it? How can we minimise the damage it does? How can we prevent exclusion and enable the largest possible number to enjoy its advantages? It is up to our societies, and especially the political authorities in our societies, to provide the answers. Over and above laying down the necessary rules to contain globalisation, the members of the international community must pursue a deliberate policy to safeguard international peace, to share the benefits of the growth of world trade more fairly and to ensure greater respect for the principles of justice, democracy and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the international organisations, in particular the United Nations, must play the role their founder expected of them. The European Union is particularly well equipped to cope with globalisation. In a sense it is a blueprint at European level for regulating globalisation. The Union has managed to reconcile the establishment of a single market with respect for social justice and environmental standards. It is, if you like, a model of its kind. For the protesters to single it out as a particular target is yet another paradox. The European Union and its institutions therefore have a great deal to do in the way of clarification. I told you that we propose to embark on this task, but we can only do so in a peaceful context, free from violence.</p>

<p class="contents">From 20 to 22 July this year, the Commission President took part in the G7/G8 summit, together with the current President of the European Council, Guy Verhofstadt.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit took a number of important decisions. However, most of the media attention was focused on events taking place outside the summit, on the city streets. These events confirmed that the G8 needs to engage in a genuine dialogue with civil society and with non-member countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Demonstrators must have the opportunity to express their opinions. This is an inalienable right not only guaranteed in law but also defended in practice. People are genuinely uneasy about various aspects of globalisation, and we must pay attention to their concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">However, violence disfigures any demonstration, even one held in an honourable cause. We cannot allow peaceful demonstrators expressing genuine fears and concerns to be tarred with the same brush as those who commit acts of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">To combat violence, whether at Gothenburg or Genoa, we need to improve European cooperation in the field of law and order. The Justice and Home Affairs Council discussed these issues in late July, and the events at Genoa show how urgent it now is to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would like to remind all of you that according to Article 33 of the Treaty the primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order lies with the Member States. Member States recognise, however, that better cooperation is required between their law enforcement and judicial authorities in order to safeguard public order at European Council meetings and similar events. The decisions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council were built upon the existing structures and existing legal instruments, which means that there will be no specific institutions to deal with these issues. It goes without saying that the Commission has always stressed the need for all police and judicial actions to respect the civil and human rights of the citizens and the legislation providing for privacy protection and for the respect of civil liberties.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to reflect on a political response to the two hundred thousand demonstrators in Genoa. It is the profound belief of the Commission that the Union should promote an active dialogue with bona fide organisations which peacefully exercise their rights to freely express opinion and assemble. We believe that the European Parliament should play a major role in promoting this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The demonstrators want us to tackle the widening gulf between the northern and southern hemispheres of our world, a gulf created by inequality, poverty, disease and war. In spite of our efforts and even some achievements over the past forty years, tragic disparities and social injustice remain and we have a long way to go in overcoming them.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the challenge not only for the G8 but also for our Europe in the years and decades ahead. The Union has to support those political leaders, especially in Africa, who are on the side of democracy. It has to prevent illegal trafficking in arms between the North and the South. And it has to implement policies that strengthen the economies of the poorest nations. Policies such as the “Everything but Arms” initiative that has opened up our markets to products from the least-developed countries are a good example of this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, public opinion today is increasingly concerned about where the world is going and people recognise that this North-South inequality cannot be tolerated. The Commission is well aware of the growing importance of civil society and is eager to involve citizens’ associations and NGOs in shaping and implementing EU policies.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission President said yesterday, when discussing governance in this plenary, “the Union is still the only concrete, practical and democratic response to globalisation”. It is therefore essential that the European institutions operate on the basis of five fundamental principles: openness, participation, accountability, effectiveness and coherence. We need to engage in an open and systematic dialogue with civil society and to involve all stakeholders in designing the Union’s policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential to strengthen the Union’s voice and influence in the world so that Europe can make a greater contribution to international prosperity and stability. Multilateral institutions are the key to harnessing globalisation, but of course we underline that we want to help reform the multilateral organisations, making them more open, more accountable and more democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, a particularly important event took place in Genoa – the “outreach” meeting with leaders of several non-member countries. This was a very useful meeting, enabling important representatives of southern countries to express their views directly and frankly and to discuss matters openly with the G8 Heads of State and Government. As a result, the G8 decided to make Africa one of the main topics of next year’s summit in Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission for its part can be satisfied with several of the decisions taken at Genoa. The documents on trade, food safety, climate change and communicable diseases, as well as the emphasis on Africa, by and large reflect the Commission’s preparatory contributions to the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">On trade, there was complete agreement on the need to launch a new round of talks at the ministerial conference in Doha in November. This view was, by the way, reiterated last week in Mexico City.</p>
<p class="contents">During the discussion on trade, President Putin stated that Russia was ready to follow the example set by the European Union in its “Everything But Arms” initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">On food safety, the European side successfully insisted that the final Communication include a reference to the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The G8 had a very long discussion on climate change, opening the way for the conclusions reached at Bonn a few days later and I believe you have discussed these conclusions at this part session.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit also provided an opportunity to launch the global health fund. The purpose of this international fund, which will not be limited to the G8 countries, is to help reduce poverty by dealing with the problem of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The Community, for its part, is committed to providing EUR 120 million.</p>
<p class="contents">As on every occasion when the current presidency of the Union is held by a State that is not a member of the G8, the Union was represented at the summit by the Council President and by the President of the Commission. The tandem arrangement worked extremely well and I am pleased to be able to underline that here.</p>
<p class="contents">We are sensitive to the fact that several aspects of the G8 will have to be changed in the future and not just cosmetically. The Commission, for its part, will encourage a return to the original spirit of the G8 summits. Indeed a joint decision was taken in Genoa to reduce the size of delegations and the summit to be held in Canada next year will be much simpler and – we hope – more effective.</p>

Indeed, in recent weeks, we have endeavoured to discuss issues of law and order, and we will have the opportunity to deal with this subject as well. However, there has been very little talk of the results of the Genoa Summit, which I consider to be positive, in terms of the fight against hunger in the world, against poverty and against AIDS; positive results of a summit under Italian management which, at last, saw the President of the United States and the President of the Russian Federation in dialogue across the table: these were things we would have not have believed possible, and so a powerful message of peace issued from the G8 cities.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have liked to launch this debate in Parliament on the contents of the summit before the summit actually took place, but were prevented from doing so by the rejection of our proposal by many left-wing Parliamentary groups. We are convinced that, for the first time, as Commissioner Vitorino pointed out, the G8 witnessed a focused debate on practical issues between the leaders of the world’s most industrialised countries and the leaders of the African countries, in which they discussed practical issues and also launched a project for cooperation on the proposal for African union, presented by the industrialised countries with the aim of setting up a partnership with these countries. An operation to reduce the debt of 23 countries by USD 50 billion, which is 70% of the total debt, was launched.</p>
<p class="contents">The go-ahead was given for a project which seeks to modernise the countries of the developing world: this is an extremely positive development. Positive, tangible results were achieved, but then it was attempted to turn the G8 summit into a mere question of law and order. There is much to be said on the subject of what happened, about the exploitation even of Parliament which went on. Parliament must not become the scene of debates on major national issues; it must not become the forum for national debates. Clearly, there can be no objection – and we must make this quite clear – to anti-globalisation demonstrations carried out using lawful methods which do not involve acts of violence, but globalisation cannot be opposed, the summits cannot be opposed through violent demonstration and attacks on the police. The inquiries carried out by the Italian Courts reveal that European citizens, who came to Italy from elsewhere to organise violent demonstrations of the Union, are also responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to end by pledging once again the support of the Italian police force and stressing the need for closer cooperation between police forces and between Ministers for the Interior. Such cooperation may have not have been adequate at the G8 summit and we must concentrate on improving in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in my opinion, the proposals made in Parliament to place Italy under observation are ridiculous. Italy does not need lessons in democracy from any political grouping in Parliament.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Socialist Group has requested this debate for two reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is because the conclusions and work of the G8 summit were obscured because the debate concentrated on public order. I must especially thank Mr Vitorino for having talked to us about the results of a summit whose agenda was set by a government, that of Olivo, in Italy, and which was discussed in the European Parliament – Mr Tajani, you were engaged in a municipal campaign, but it was discussed here – and, furthermore, we have asked for a resolution on this debate which has been replied to and denied by the PPE. We do not understand why they want to speak but refuse a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in any event, ladies and gentlemen, what I would like to point out is that we clearly said that the President of the Commission and the President of the Council were in the Genoa photo and we regret that they have not had time to come to this debate if they considered it so important.</p>
<p class="contents">And I must point out that some positive advances have been made. Commissioner Vitorino has referred to them. I would say that, on the cancellation of debt, little progress has been made. The fund for AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis is a positive step, although it is still not enough. Africa must be a priority; also the desire for flexibility in the TRIPs Agreements and the ‘everything but arms’ initiative as well as the extension of the system of generalised preferences are aspects which we Europeans should be proud of and should value more. In addition to this there is our firm position on Kyoto which, despite United States resistance, has allowed us to reach a solution in Bonn.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that as a Parliament we must bring this to account and hold a debate because, furthermore, my political family, the Party of European Socialists, which is a member of the Socialist International – we are internationalists and we have been globalised since the Nineteenth Century – is an organisation which is present in 160 countries in the world, and is not just an organisation of white men, that is to say, it is an organisation of all continents. Therefore, the issue of globalisation which, at our last congress of the International in Paris, two years ago, led to a resolution on the challenges of globalisation, must be, as far as we are concerned, a permanent element of European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a comment on issues of public order. My group has said, from the outset, that it is awaiting the conclusion of the investigation which is being carried out in the Italian Parliament on these issues, because we respect the Parliament of an important democracy which is a member of the European Union. This does not prevent us from demonstrating a very critical position in relation to the rights of European citizens contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. There are no public order policies which restrict citizens – and I say this to the Belgian Presidency – in their right to demonstrate and give vent to their feelings. A responsible public order policy must guarantee those rights, not repress them. Just as football cannot be prohibited because of fights between hooligans, rights cannot be restricted because there are nuclei of provocative vandals.</p>
<p class="contents">A final request, Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen: to mention civil society has become so commonplace that it is almost impossible to make a political speech without talking about it. But what I cannot understand is that people talk about speaking with civil society and then they put a comma and say, ‘and with Parliament, of course’. Society becomes civil when it elects its representatives and therefore the first duty of the President of the Council and the President of the Commission, when they go to these summits, is to come to Parliament and report on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will therefore concentrate on these latter issues rather than on aspects which, although important, will be discussed within the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and on which it would be appropriate to wait for the opinion of the Italian Parliament, which has set up a special committee of inquiry. Parliament will, of course, be able to address the issue in a fully informed manner in the future, although, at this point, we can certainly condemn and deplore the use of any form of violence by any party whatsoever in an attempt to resolve issues.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore absolutely essential for Parliament to discuss the major issues of globalisation now and then to lay down a clear political line to follow, undertaking to define tangible parameters to shape the globalisation process, ensuring that its ultimate goal is the development of a new, comprehensive<span class="bold"> </span>humanism which places at the centre of history the dignity of the human person rather than large-scale financial interests. In this sense, far from being an inevitable source of suffering, globalisation is proving to be a great opportunity to genuinely change the balance of play in the world and confront the dreadful scourges afflicting much of humanity which, in these times in which we live, mean that none of us can be sure of our moral innocence.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if we take into account the not insignificant humanitarian decisions taken at the G8 summit, it is not easy to accept the considerable unwillingness to change the development model, even partially, step by step. The model remains essentially focused on consumerism and an unregulated market rather than on accepted criteria of solidarity and participation.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic need is therefore to identify a political and institutional position which is acceptable to everybody and which can be used as a guideline for the globalisation processes. This clearly has to be something more than just the G8. We must speed up our work on this issue if we want to avoid irreparable damage, for we must start from the realisation that the globalisation of politics – the democratic control of the processes of globalisation – proceeds at an exasperatingly slow pace compared to developments in other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no current “off-the-shelf” recipe, but I feel that we could start from proposal of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prizewinner who envisages a permanent summit made up of the European Union, the G8, the World Bank, the group of 77 developing countries, Onlus and undertakings to launch and manage a great, worldwide Marshall Plan based on a common universal strategy. That could be described as a utopian dream, but, as Thomas More, the father of Europe would say, without a utopian dream, what would our politics be? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lannoye (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe the G8 summit in Genoa will come to be regarded as a milestone in our political life and will probably be seen as marking a turning point in European and international political life. This is not, unfortunately, because of the joint undertakings given by the richest countries in the world to respond to the serious problems facing the poorest countries – and let me point out that the North-South gulf has never been so wide – but rather because of the particular context in which this summit took place.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vitorino has rightly reminded us of certain decisions or at least guidelines that were adopted at that summit, but I do not think we should give them more importance than they deserve. It is true that we heard a rather timid acknowledgement of the importance of relieving the debt burden on the poorest countries, but no more than that. It is also true that a global health fund was set up to combat infectious diseases, but the total funding is pretty inadequate; it was set at EUR 1.3 billion, while the UN Secretary-General believes that EUR 10 billion is needed. On the other hand, there is no sign of any common resolve to rectify the inequalities by achieving the long-promised objective of contributing 0.7% of gross domestic product to development aid. There is no more talk of that.</p>
<p class="contents">The participants did, however, vigorously reiterate their faith in the virtues of the market, free trade, the development of new genetic engineering technologies and the international trade rules. Today, the European Union certainly wants to launch a new WTO round, but is that any answer to the problems caused by the unfair WTO rules? The WTO’s decision-making rules are indeed unfair in that they penalise the poorest countries compared with the rich ones, if only by giving the poor countries limited access to the information that would enable them to play a proper part in this decision making.</p>
<p class="contents">So, no response at all, no real response to the demands and protests of tens of thousands of demonstrators – and, more generally, of a very broad sector of European public opinion – who reject or challenge a globalisation that is essentially financial and commercial. It is not globalisation as such that they are protesting about, but its basically financial and commercial nature. I think that distinction needs to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the European Union must take specific initiatives in this regard and first of all it must no longer seem deaf to the voices of protest. In this context I welcome the Belgian government’s proposal to debate the Tobin tax at the next Ecofin summit. I think that is a good initiative, which ought to be followed by others of the same kind. First and foremost, however, we need to establish a real dialogue with the parliaments: Mr Barón Crespo is right to say that parliaments are, after all, the prime representatives of public opinion; that is obviously true. The European Parliament and the national parliaments must be the forum where the governments explain their initiatives. In addition, however, to the parliaments – for we are no longer living in the conventional world of politics we knew 50 years ago – we must talk to the associations, talk to organised civil society. In my view, that is essential. Many associations have put forward important ideas and serious arguments; to dismiss them is a political error.</p>
<p class="contents">Like everyone here, I deplore and condemn the violence of the Black Blockers<span class="italic"> </span>demonstrators but, at the same time, I can only condemn the unacceptable behaviour of the Italian police who trampled on human rights in Genoa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The conservative majority in this Parliament, which is feeling very defensive, prevented this debate from concluding with a resolution in which Parliament expressed its opinion. It will not, however, manage to prevent us from raising the serious questions arising from the events at Genoa again and again on our political agenda, in one form or another, throughout the coming period: the aftermath of Genoa is only just beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues raised by Genoa is the very legitimacy of G7, or G8, perceived as a kind of board of directors of the big powers of this world. I will not go into that today. Another issue raised by Genoa is, of course, this whole problem of violence, in particular the unheard-of repression of peaceful demonstrators, who were pursued even to the headquarters of the Social Forum of Genoa.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday we took the initiative, in association with the Green Group, the Attac association and socialist MEPs, of organising a major debate on the subject with the coordinator of the Genoa Social Forum, Mr Agnoletto. The extremely grave incidents that were discussed and described during that debate made us even more convinced of the need to shed full light on the course of events that led to the dramatic incidents and acts of violence we saw and on the entire chain of responsibility for respecting the rules and values in which the European Union believes.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, I proposed that we set up a monitoring committee right here to work in liaison with Italian members of parliament, the Social Forum in Genoa and other partners who wish to help discover the whole truth of the matter. In the same spirit, we have reiterated our support for players in the social movement who do not want to see their message be perverted by acts of violence of the Black Block<span class="italic"> </span>type, which our enemies find easy to manipulate. We will not allow this magnificent commitment on the part of our citizens to be discredited, let alone criminalised, in this way. That brings me to the third, and perhaps in our view the principal issue of the aftermath of Genoa, namely the political responses we will or will not be able to make to the questions asked by these men, these women, these innumerable young people who are quite wrongly labelled anti-globalist, whereas most of the time what they seek is a democratic globalisation based on solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the European Union is debating its future, its ambitions on the world stage and its relations with civil society, we for our part do not see these questions as a threat to be averted, but far more as a chance we must seize if we want Europe to move forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Two thirds of the world live in conditions of extreme poverty. Our aid must be targeted at genuinely benefiting communities rather than adding to the economic and political wealth of governments who have contributed to exacerbating the wretched conditions in which their peoples live and continue to prevent respect for human rights. We call for focused actions targeted at implementing initiatives which are genuinely useful for the people, and we must also, therefore, attempt to rethink the concept of globalisation. Is a European way possible? Can we prevent globalisation becoming a boomerang which always strikes the poorest communities?</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to say that, at Genoa, according to some elements of the media and certain politicians, public disorder pushed the issues discussed and the guidelines defined by the summit leaders into the background and yet, for the first time in the presence of representatives of the developing world, issues were tackled which are fundamentally important for the peaceful future of the human race.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, even the legitimate opinions of the peaceful demonstrators were obscured by the globalised violence of those who have become professional rioters. Faced with the urban guerrilla warfare which has reproduced the acts of violence perpetrated at the Nice and Gothenburg Summits, we must tackle two pressing issues. Firstly, how can we ensure that democracy is respected on similar occasions in the future? In other words, we must ask ourselves how future summits held in European countries need to be organised in order to ensure that the meetings of representatives of the different institutions are productive and not the cause of fruitless, violent controversy. Secondly, what political and cultural measures can we take to prevent legitimate demonstrations of dissent turning into organised, exploitative acts of violence? Is there an area of justice within which Interpol could play a role of preventing and controlling the spread of violence and terrorism?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in the face of Commissioner Vitorino’s call for greater cooperation to prevent violence, we wonder why Echelon which, with the help of Great Britain, listens in on everything that happens in Europe, did not warn us before Gothenburg and Genoa and help to prevent the violence which took place there.</p>
<p class="contents">These are worrying questions and we will come back to them. It is not Italy which needs to be placed under observation but that part of Europe which speaks of human rights in this Chamber and then allows those same rights to be violated, and the self-interested generosity of certain left-wing voices which condemn violence as a means of persuasion.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, Europe needs to act today to make it possible for the goals set at Genoa to be implemented. Its governments must not exploit tragic events that should be tackled by a common effort, for the purposes of internal politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must regain a sense of European Union rather than national self-interest! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, we will choose the Genoa Summit over international fora where it is the dictatorships of this world that have the majority and the decision-making power and whose final decisions are those of a racist conference, not a conference on racism. Otherwise, we would be saying we are dissatisfied with both the G8 method and the method of this European Union. We feel that the western democracies must relaunch the method of democracy and the rule of law, that they must attack rather than playing a defensive game and must relaunch the initiative of the globalisation of rights and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, if the European Union genuinely has the political will, it should not be possible, at this advanced stage in the process, for the statute of the International Criminal Court to still not have been ratified. It should not be possible for the universal moratorium on the death penalty not to have been approved by the UN. It is on these issues that the western democracies must fight back.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the G8, these summits must be made public. It is not a question of coopting representatives of NGOs or representatives of the poorest countries. It is a question of involving the parliaments and all the citizens, broadcasting the debates on these issues to them live via audiovisual communications and the Internet, opening the doors of these international summits to all citizens and revitalising the democratic model and the rule of law. This, I believe, is the way to improve the G8 summits and this European Union, and it is the alternative to satisfying those who call for institutions in which the worst dictatorships in the world have the right of veto to be at the central controls of globalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I think everyone is aware of the active, prominent role taken for the first time by the European Union at the G8 summit. Although it may well be true that the results could have been better in practical terms – as other Members have stressed – I would like to quote a politician who is not from my own culture but who is known to many in this Chamber: “The longest journey begins with a single step!” And without a doubt, a completely new way of working was established in Genoa compared to that adopted for all the other G8 summits.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am sure that the goal of all the Members of this House is to achieve increasingly closer Union between the peoples of Europe, and that we base our future work and our political activity on consensus, democracy and the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, with regard to the Genoa Summit and the messages which subsequently emerged through the media, what concerns me is an attempt to deny representative democracy. I find this unacceptable. It may be part of the culture of others, but we must reject violence because violence is contrary to the way civilised human beings relate to each other in our culture and, above all, we must adopt an approach which is totally different from this blanket opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end with two brief points for consideration. We did not support the resolution because – as I am sure some of you will remember – in July, we wanted a debate to be held so that we would arrive prepared, as the European Parliament, together with the Council and the Commission, at the Genoa Summit. This was refused us: we only had time for an oral question.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in my opinion, in view, apart from anything else, of the tendencies of some of the previous speakers, I would wait for the conclusions of the work currently being carried out by the Italian judiciary before firing accusations or making scathing judgments about the work of the Italian police force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not the time to tackle the issues of public safety and law and order, which are now assuming a European dimension, as has been pointed out, and which require effective responses which also respect rights such as the right to freedom of association and demonstration which is enshrined in the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to see that Parliament’s Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has decided to prepare a recommendation to the Home Affairs Council before it next meets in November. However, we cannot fail to express here our deep pain at the loss of a young human life, that of Carlo Giuliani, and our unequivocal condemnation of the violence perpetrated by minority groups in Genoa and elsewhere, and our concern at excessive crowd control measures employed to protect the citizens by sections of the police force who had assumed responsibility for the citizens’ safety. An inquiry into all this is being carried out by the Italian parliament as well as by the Courts, and we ourselves will be able to make use of the results very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the agenda, it has to be said that, as an informal event, the G8 summit is in danger of raising expectations which are hardly ever matched by practical undertakings. However, partly due to the attention that the movement has succeeded in drawing to these summits, it would be almost impossible to avoid addressing the role of the poorest countries and undertaking more convincing action with regard to the issues of debt, poverty, trade, the fight against disease and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, although it is the responsibility of the movement to reflect on its future, starting with the methods it should use to fight globalisation, and to reflect on the danger of it encouraging unfocused, provocative protectionist tendencies, the task of orienting the global processes, which have hitherto favoured economic concentrations, speculative investment and wide gaps and intolerable injustices, falls to the institution. The next appointment will be the WTO round of negotiations, when the responsibilities of the European Union and the Commission will be far greater than at the G8 summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission’s “Everything but Arms” initiative was consolidated by the final statement from Genoa. It is our responsibility to uphold it consistently in our relationship with our citizens and the poor countries which are excluded from the flow of world trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In short, we feel that a summit such as the G8, in the form it has taken hitherto, is substantially unproductive. Never more so than at Genoa has it been clear that similar displays of muscle and power on the part of the world’s greatest nations are just cinema which certainly does nothing to alleviate hunger in the world or to enhance equality between peoples if it is not matched by practical action to cancel the debt, redistribute wealth, safeguard material rights and eliminate all exploitation of developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, amongst the great many people who were exercising their genuine, lawful right to demonstrate for their convictions, there were also many troublemakers who infiltrated the demonstration in order to perpetrate unjust and unjustified acts of violence and thus sabotage the work of both governments and demonstrators. It is necessary – and this is the third point – for Parliament too to issue, first and foremost, a clear, unambiguous statement condemning and reproaching these people for their actions: they are the criminals who sparked off the violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, with regard to these criminals, I regret to say that the law and order agencies of the Italian government partly failed in their task. Their endeavours were both excessive and inadequate: inadequate in that their information activities, intelligence and preventive protection measures did not suffice, and excessive in terms of the crowd control measures employed by certain sections of the police force; this was true only of certain sections of the police force but, regrettably, methods of crowd control were used which could and should have been avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, of course this sort of behaviour is to be condemned, but we must not focus on individual members of the police force but on those who gave the orders or who should have controlled or coordinated the activities from both the technical and police points of view. We regret that this has not been the case. Let us await the conclusions of the Courts and the Italian Parliament calmly and let us hope that, in future, there will be no more acts of violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I belong to the generation that, in Italy, is called the ‘ebb’ [apolitical] generation – I am too young for either ‘68 or ‘77 – and I am used to thinking of the police and the <span class="italic">carabinieri</span> as those who ensure personal safety and who have made it possible to defeat terrorism in Italy. The most surprising and shocking thing for me in the Genoa events was therefore to actually see how, within the forces of law and order, something tiny, a mere change of government, a defamatory campaign by the anti-G8 movement, inadequate organisation and a bunch of violent hooligans, was enough to bring out in some of them – I stress some of them – a desire to become the instruments of blind and profoundly stupid intimidation.</p>
<p class="contents">This, Mr Tajani, Commissioner Vitorino, is a European, not a national issue. The divide that, from Nice to Gothenburg to Genoa and, perhaps tomorrow to Laeken – even if the Minister’s fine words perhaps give us grounds for optimism – is being erected, for right or for wrong, whether we like it or not, between people who, in good faith, want to take action for a better world and the institutions – the police, Parliament, government – is something that should concern us all, on both left and right.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that if police cooperation had been applied effectively and with respect for individual rights, if free movement were a true right, with the same level of priority as the free movement of capital, if the Charter of Fundamental Rights were in the DNA of all of us, the worst events of Genoa would, perhaps, not have taken place. That is why I believe that, to prevent another Nice, another Gothenburg or another Genoa, we need two things, and the first of them is transparency. In Italy, the Courts are already hard at work, as is the parliamentary committee of inquiry. Here, we must make a precise assessment of the lines along which the cooperation between European police forces was conducted and ascertain whether or not the Charter of Fundamental Rights was violated in the treatment of prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">The second and last thing, Madam President, is to understand whether suspension of the Schengen rules can justify the indiscriminate, collective ban on free movement.</p>

Worst of all, it laughed at the request by Kofi Annan for the allocation of a sum that would have been at all adequate and not just alms for the fight against AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">The pretensions of Western leaders to lead the world and their agencies for managing the world economy along free-enterprise lines have, since Seattle, been the object of criticism and active protest from a movement of thousands of associations and millions of people and even some States – I am thinking of South Africa – who are asking for an alternative, democratic model of globalisation oriented towards satisfying the often tragic needs of communities, especially in the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">In Genoa, then, the Genoa Social Forum – that is, a thousand or so organisations, all of them peaceful and non-violent, half of them Italian – called on 300 000 people to come together and express their dissent and their alternative goals.</p>
<p class="contents">You have all seen the pictures and film footage of what happened in Genoa in the media. That is proof, Mr Ferri! I have read the newspapers and watched television. A few hundred hooligans, then, between 600 and 800 according to the Italian police themselves, were left to run riot in Genoa, even though it was known where they were staying, to destroy businesses, banks and public property, while the full strength of the police was most brutally unleashed against the peaceful demonstrators. They broke into the residences where they were sleeping and beat them; hundreds of young men and women were arrested, and in the police barracks they were beaten up, insulted, tortured, forced to stand for hours with their arms against a wall and their legs apart, forced to sing fascist anthems and praise Mussolini; and the girls were even threatened with rape.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in Genoa over those days and I was a direct witness of the police jeeps driven at full speed and the police charges against peaceful marches, as well as the hundreds of tear-gas grenades thrown at thousands of defenceless people, amongst whom were children and disabled persons. I then went to the prisons where hundreds of young people had been transferred – Italians, Spanish, Germans, Austrians, Swedes, Swiss, aged between 18 and 20, and I collected their statements: all of them, I repeat all of them, had been beaten, insulted or tortured, many had stitches in their heads, and all that had happened in the barracks after their arrest.</p>
<p class="contents">Right-wing authoritarian processes have a history in Europe! Together with the underlying factors, this history includes accidental events, on the one hand, and the complicity or inertia of the moderate, liberal and Catholic right on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">The attitude emerging here of underestimation by the Council, and also by part of the political groupings represented here in Parliament, of the general trend dramatically revealed in Genoa which is taking hold of Italy, is therefore – if I may say so – irresponsible, not only towards democracy but also towards these groupings themselves. For much less, for Haider’s idle talk, Austria was subjected to surveillance and sanctions by the other 14 Member States of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But that is not the problem I want to deal with today.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point, however, which unites us all, which is: what can Europe do? Minister, you have said that Europe can be a model in facing the problems of tomorrow’s globalisation. That is true, but not this Europe, let us be frank, Minister. Yes, the Europe of human rights, for which we were the cradle, the Europe of respect for minorities and diversity, the Europe of the ‘No’ to the death penalty, which responds to the concerns of so many, perhaps the majority of human beings. But it would really respond to their concerns if Europe had a voice and an instrument to express this idea forcefully in the world. A divided Europe can have no part in this. The G8 summit did not give the idea of a Europe able to back up its decisions. The G8 summit has given the world the idea of the great superpower and a divided Europe that is weak and ineffective because it is fragmented. This is the real problem facing us.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want Europe to respond to the concerns of globalisation, let us move ahead on the road towards building a political Union and giving Europe a single voice. If, at a G8 summit, there were not four European states speaking but just one speaking on behalf of the whole of Europe, there would no longer be a great America and a number of little States; there would be two voices with the same weight.</p>
<p class="contents">Minister, your government could make a great contribution in this direction at Laeken by presenting and taking forward a draft Constitution that is not divorced from the reality of the problems, as the debate still is today, but which, in a few years’ time, when the euro has become the common currency and globalisation is no longer a contentious issue, can be an instrument for Europe to speak in the world with a single voice and as a single political unit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first, I would say, as regards the European or world leaders, the Euro-globalists who were barricaded in that town, is quite simply that they may govern badly, but they protect themselves well.</p>
<p class="contents">The second does not, for all that, tempt us to support the brutal and deliberately violent counter-demonstrations that were organised and that did not create too much indignation among their ranks so long as they were used against the national right-wing parties. When the targets are Flemish, Italian, French, German or other national militants, that is seen as entirely acceptable and there was no shortage of leaders within the French socialist party to encourage and organise the so-called democratic harassment. Until the day when, like the man hoist with his own petard, the socialist leaders find themselves at the receiving end of the stone throwing. Indeed the bloody events of Genoa show that protests against globalisation are not the expression of a moral protest born of the desire for a fairer redistribution of the wealth of the planet. In fact today, like yesterday, the issue is political and ideological. Lucas Casarini, leader of the White Overalls movement, said as much in an interview with <span class="italic">La Repubblica</span>. Negri, imprisoned for armed insurrection against the Italian state and now partially free, expressed the same view in a book. These people are no longer socialist internationalists, proletarian internationalists, but they are still internationalists. The people who demonstrated in Seattle do not represent the voice of the poor throughout the world; they are a political instrument directed against the Western world. In Genoa, they launched their attack from the very heart of the empire they supposedly wanted to destroy; but in reality another equally subversive form of globalisation is dialectically opposed to liberal globalisation. We do not support either one of them; the real reply lies in the defence of national identities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission spoke about this a while ago and this is certainly a subject to examine in greater depth.</p>
<p class="contents">On occasions such as these, however, many of us have also realised that there are forces in Parliament that are able to exploit even tragedies for their own ends, for the death in Genoa was a tragedy. This was simply to achieve their political objectives: that is, to discredit the centre-right government in Italy. To achieve this outcome, they use the European Parliament, organising in Parliament, as they did yesterday, for example, meetings with exponents of antiglobalisation movements that spread ridiculous, false accusations and offend a European Union Member State by calling it an incomplete democracy that should be placed under supervision. I regret to say that an active part is played in these demonstrations by Italian Members of this House – I need only name Mr Vinci – who perhaps do not realise that they are discrediting not so much the centre-right government but the whole of their country.</p>

<p class="contents">Worldwide, we are becoming increasingly connected and dependent on one another. It therefore makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to hide behind national, European or other borders. At the same time, however, we also see the other side of globalisation. World trade is flourishing, but the richest countries earn 37 times more than the poorest countries, and despite the enormous increase in world trade over the past few years, the chasm between rich and poor has only widened. One in five people who live in this global village still have no access to education or health care. It is precisely in this global village that this complete and utter imbalance concerns us all.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe – which, to me, encompasses the Commission, the Council, Parliament and the Member States – must stand united. This is something we can do and thereby be able to play a crucial role. We can fulfil a pioneering role as the largest trading power. We must defend our social model within and outside our borders, and, therefore, assume our responsibility, as well as support new social and innovative solutions. We must, for example, lend support to those poor countries which are endeavouring to produce cheap AIDS medication. We must make this possible and also defend their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">If we act on our own behalf, let us then show that we mean business. Certainly at a time when the United States now and then threatens to stray from multilateralism and withdraw behind a wall of self-interest, it is extremely important for Europe to fulfil this active global role. This then, of course, raises the question of what role that is and what the activities are we should be carrying out.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to list a few promising initiatives: “Everything but Arms”, our action programme against AIDS and the initiatives by Messrs Jospin and Schröder concerning the Tobin tax. Would the Commission and Council be prepared at least to have such initiatives seriously looked at and to back them? I would also like to mention our weaker points: the refusal to reform agriculture in the short term. I also have in mind the fact that, while the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, has earmarked EUR 120 million for our Global Health Fund, this is money taken from our own pocket. That is similar to helping ourselves to one of our own cigars. Moreover, when can we expect Parliament’s proposals, for this measure will surely require formal approval. We are here in Parliament to ask for extra funding, and not for one of our own cigars. I am also thinking of the Member States which do not spend 0.7% of their GNP on development and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe wants to be a friend to those who wish globalisation to have a human dimension, if it wants to listen seriously and be an example to all those who take to the streets out of concern, it will have to make it happen by taking action of its own and adopting appropriate policy. This is, in my opinion, the cornerstone of a partnership with developing countries. This is also the basis of success for a fresh WTO round. However, this is a different Europe from the Europe which sides with the few who are out to seek personal gain. If we really want the law to apply to everyone, then we have here in Europe a brilliant opportunity to make it happen, and the Social Democrats are happy to take this road. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is our response? Countless young people have waited all summer for this first session of the European Parliament. In Genoa, they encountered a state and a Europe which have deeply traumatised them. Their trauma is heightened every day that we fail to give them a satisfactory response.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this Parliament’s response? On the first day, Mr Poettering congratulated Mr Berlusconi. The Christian Democrats and right-wingers in this House have rejected the resolution and made it clear that they will also reject a committee of enquiry. Let me make it clear what they are identifying themselves with: police violence, systematic brutality and even torture in the prisons or at the time of arrest, hundreds of arbitrary arrests, sexual harassment, and Nazi slogans in the police stations.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in Genoa for a week. I visited the prisons. I spoke to the people in charge, and I took notes for ten hours with people who had been systematically abused and mistreated, in some cases for up to thirty hours. Yet you want to sweep everything under the table! The Christian Democrats are allowing the Italian right to dictate the course of today’s debate. One of them even had the gall to say that there is no evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, please vote for an enquiry. We will provide bags full of evidence of hundreds of cases of torture, abuse, brutality and excesses by the police. This is not merely a matter for the Italian police, for these young people all over Europe have waited for this first session, hopeful that the guardians of fundamental rights sit here in this House and that this House will not remain silent or make common cause with Italy’s rightist government.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a few bitter words as an Austrian. What would have happened if these appalling events at a summit had taken place in Austria a year ago? One dead, 500 injured, 470 arrested and imprisoned, with 90% of them having to be released later due to lack of evidence because the police had picked them up at random as much as 50 km outside Genoa and trumped up evidence against them. This has a European dimension, and this House must address the issue….</p>

<p class="contents">We register here the strongest possible protest against the Italian government and police forces, who were tolerant and permissive with the violent, but savage against the innocent.

On the G8 I share the opinion of the Council and Commission on the good and bad sides of it, but I also wonder why, every time an international summit is organised, from Seattle to Gothenburg to Genoa, conflicts break out that threaten public order, as if people were trying to fight an invisible tyrant. We should reflect on this paradox and initiate a dialogue with the young people, giving politics back its role.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence is rejected without equivocation. Violence is incompatible with democracy, and extremism is often the cradle of violence. The violence in Genoa is being investigated by the Italian magistracy, in whom we should have every faith.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, a political issue: there are various ways of defending institutions. We should not confuse the Black Block that was looking for violence with those who were exercising their right to demonstrate in the streets. That confusion leads to a spiral that produces more violence and sows the seeds of terrorism. In these situations it is very difficult to enforce the law without using force, but that is the responsibility of governments. To isolate the extremist movements we must start with the moral authority of national and European institutions and the ability to show every respect for the rights of the citizenry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are going to place value on the need to defend the freedom and fundamental rights of citizens. Since the Treaty of Nice, the European Parliament has had the duty to exercise the right to monitor respect for these rights and that is conferred on us by the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also exercise democratic control of the security measures proposed by the Council, of their proportionality and effectiveness. I am not going to throw accusations at the Italian police, but I believe that to suspend the right to movement of certain citizens while allowing the entry of the people who did what they did in Genoa could be described at the very least as ineffective and inefficient.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to do all of this. But I believe that today, Madam President, what we must demand of the European institutions above all is a political reaction to a situation which is not a natural catastrophe, for which a civil protection plan can be presented, as Minister Duquesne appeared to do a few days ago in our committee, but a political phenomenon which we must react to. And that reaction must also, and above all, come from this European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this Parliament have the obligation to create fora for political mediation given a demand which is becoming stronger and stronger, and we must do so above all because the European Union has this democratically elected institution. It is the only international organisation which has one and, given the widespread feeling that there is a lack of opportunity to exercise political demand in an international forum, we must be able to take a step forward and to offer this forum as soon as possible, in the hope that the other institutions will do the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like others, I regret that we do not have a resolution in front of us in which we could have expressed our complete condemnation of police brutality and of the violence of the Black Block at Genoa, our conviction that those responsible must be brought to justice, our commitment to uphold the right to protest peacefully, and our determination to clarify the growing evidence that much of the violence and damage to property which occurred in Genoa was the work of <span class="italic">agents provocateurs</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">But we have another task before us and that is to address the reasons fully why 300 000 people chose – in their own time, and at their own expense – to go to Genoa, just as hundreds of thousands have gone to Seattle, to Gothenburg and elsewhere to demonstrate about the continuing debt burden of the poor, about the increasing and grotesque inequalities between rich and poor and about the growing corporate control of many aspects of our lives. That means that we need to confront the reality that the neo-liberal economic policies of the European Union are currently part of the problem, not the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, it is the EU which is ruthlessly driving forward the agenda for a new, ambitious, comprehensive round of trade talks at Doha in November in the face of opposition from the majority of developing countries and of social movements around the world. Commissioner Vitorino said that there was agreement in Mexico last weekend. Well, there might have been agreement between the Quad countries, but it certainly was not endorsed by the African countries, the LDCs, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, the list goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in most EU Member States, the level of official development assistance remains far below the UN target and, contrary to the Gothenburg declaration, the Council is proposing for its 2002 budget a further 3.2% cut in commitments on foreign aid compared to last year’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members of the European Parliament, we have a responsibility to ensure that the citizens of the European Union continue to enjoy the right to protest peacefully. We also have a responsibility to listen to what they are demonstrating about and to respond because, if we do not, we cannot be surprised if the reputation of the EU institutions as remote and out of touch continues to grow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Similarly, the methods used by the Italian authorities do not seem to be just the result of the police being unable to cope with the rioting, which we of course condemn. After all, the private Italian network Sette broadcast scenes of people dressed like Black Blocks calmly chatting with the anti-riot police and then going away.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if it does not suit those who have a narrow conception of the sovereignty of states, we must make it clear that the events of Genoa do not come only under the heading of Italy’s domestic affairs but directly concern the European institutions, and chiefly among them the European Parliament because it is directly elected. First of all, Europe is concerned because the Union must not simply be a stepping stone of liberal globalisation, but also an area of freedom in which the citizens have the rights guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights and, more recently, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Furthermore, when citizens of all nationalities come together to exercise their collective freedom, their freedom of opinion and their right to demonstrate, it is the duty of the European Community to guarantee that they can effectively exercise these rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Europe must not remain inert in face of such disturbing manipulative operations. Europe cannot allow a government in its midst to use methods that are so incompatible with the values of democracy and freedom in which it believes. Lastly, as responsible democrats we cannot allow the violent actions of a minority of activists to be lumped together with the pacifist beliefs of thousands of people protesting against liberal globalisation, for the Union must, in its turn, become the motive force of democratic globalisation based on solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I deplore the rejection of the proposal to table a European Parliament resolution on the subject. I would have liked to see a committee of inquiry set up. Like some of my socialist comrades and other colleagues, I will play an active part in the monitoring group referred to by Francis Wurtz and we will carefully examine the conclusions of the Italian committee of inquiry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is precisely because the presidency – not only myself, but also the Belgian Prime Minister – takes this dialogue so seriously that the Prime Minister has sent me to represent the presidency here today and naturally the intention is not to limit myself to a brief explanation, but to follow attentively everything you have to say and to remain calm in the process, even if I completely disagree with some of the speakers. But that is part and parcel of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have thus carefully listened to all the speeches from the left, the right and the centre in this debate, and you can be certain that a number of elements will definitely inspire us. Even if it is correct that the Belgian Prime Minister, following Gothenburg, said that the law enforcers and armed forces in my country have extensive experience of all kinds of disturbances. Given the fact that the capital of my country sometimes deals with more than 2 000 of these annually, we do not want to give anyone the impression that we are not taking the situation seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">As a personal comment, obviously, I said that, in my opinion, the spectacle of a totally secluded zone for a summit meeting, as was the case in June or a number of weeks ago, is a very brutal spectacle. But at the same time, it was tragic to have to witness the extent of the street violence. It is absolutely awful if situations escalate to such a degree that, as we have personally witnessed, young demonstrators are killed during these disturbances. This is not acceptable, this must be prevented. There are very few, extremely few causes worth dying for. One should obviously have the right to demonstrate, protest and say whatever it may be in whatever way, but it is not acceptable that some are killed in the process, or are physically or mentally injured.</p>
<p class="contents">You can therefore count on us to do whatever is necessary during all council meetings of the next couple of days and weeks. My baptism – and I hope it will not be a baptism of fire – will take place tomorrow evening. The informal meeting of Foreign Trade Ministers in Bruges starts tomorrow evening and will be followed by a whole series of meetings. We will make every effort to ensure that the right balance is struck between openness and accessibility whilst ensuring that safety is maintained and that escalations of recent weeks are avoided. I wish to make that very clear to you.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, Mr President, I am also convinced that the debate on globalisation has only just got off the ground and that we will be discussing it for the foreseeable future. Needless to say, we will not always agree on everything, as I have already said, but that does not matter. For the debate to be fruitful, it is of the utmost importance not only to hear what the other person has to say, but also to try to understand what the other person is saying. For example, I have said that law enforcement and the way in which the law is enforced falls within the exclusive remit of the Member State. That is correct, but I also said at the beginning of my speech that in the Justice and Home Affairs Council, within the remit of the Union and by means of existing instruments, we will do whatever is necessary to prevent as much as possible the escalation of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">We will return to this topic during Question Time, when I will have the opportunity to give you more detail in my answers. We welcome dialogue, certainly constructive dialogue, but not only do we need to listen to each other, we must also try to understand one another, particularly if we do not share the same views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoframe_blue"><tr><td><img alt="MPphoto" src="/doceo/data/img/photo_generic.gif" align="right" width="50" height="63" /></td></tr></table> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I believe that this debate is leaning towards recognition of the need to structure the political debate on how to regulate globalisation. In this regard, I believe that the Commission has put forward several suggestions here on ‘how to structure this debate’. We acknowledge, and I want to say this quite clearly, that the European Parliament, the elected representative of European citizens have a key role to play in structuring this debate. For we need to embark on it with a degree of humility; we are all looking for answers, but nobody can say with any conviction that they have all the answers to the complex issues facing us all.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I want to point out, in reply to Mr Barón Crespo, that President Prodi genuinely wanted to attend this debate today. He had intended to take part in the debate had it remained on the agenda as originally scheduled, i.e. this morning. However, Parliament changed its agenda and Mr Prodi had to return to Brussels for the summit with the People’s Republic of China, so that he was unable to be present here today. I therefore have the honour and pleasure of taking part in this debate with you.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to the issue in question. I believe the Commission has worked well with Parliament on the substance of the Genoa decisions. I can tell you that we too believe in the global approach. In our view, some progress has been made and some positive decisions were taken at the G8 summit. Of course they do not go far enough. There is no doubt that the financing of the global health fund to combat disease is inadequate, as we agree, but at least we can say we played our part in funding it.</p>
<p class="contents">Along the same lines, let me tell you quite frankly that I do not understand how, in relation to the negotiations on a new World Trade Organisation, we can be reproached for favouring a purely pro-free trade vision of world trade. We work together very closely with Parliament and what we are trying to do is to establish areas of negotiation that also take direct account of issues such as the environmental balance, the social agenda and the interests of the less-developed countries. I therefore believe that the Mexico conclusions are entirely consistent with the policy advocated by the Commission for regulating globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in reply to Mrs Frassoni, let me emphasise that you must take my words in their strictest sense. What I said, and in fact that is what Article 33 of the Treaty also provides for, is that the maintenance of law and order is primarily the responsibility of the Member States. I acknowledge, however, that the question of law and order also has a European dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997, the Council approved a joint action on the maintenance of law and order. It may be that few people paid attention to the contents of that decision at the time, but it exists and the conclusions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 13 July are based on this joint action dating from 1997. The joint action provides for cooperation between law enforcement and judicial authorities in order to safeguard public order at European-level meetings and places it within the framework of the Europol Convention. That means we have a legislative text that regulates European cooperation on the maintenance of law and order.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have the Schengen Agreements. In this regard, I must tell you that in the case of the Genoa meeting what we saw was joint action by what one might call the ‘two Italian governments’. The idea was first put forward by the previous government and then put into practice by the new government. So it is quite clear that the Commission’s neutrality is beyond all suspicion in the debate within Italy. The truth is that the Italian government respected its obligations under the Schengen Agreements by reintroducing border checks at the time of the G8 summit in Genoa. Obviously, when it comes to monitoring the implementation of the Schengen Agreements, both the Commission and the European Parliament have certain responsibilities. They are limited responsibilities but that, Mrs Frassoni, is another matter entirely.</p>
