<p class="contents">I recognise the major efforts made by both Parliament and the Council towards finding a satisfactory compromise. The result is a balanced text taking into account the differing positions and interests of each party towards the goal of progressive harmonisation of the veterinary matters raised by the issue of pet movements.</p>
<p class="contents">The final obstacles preventing agreement were removed by the Conciliation Committee on 18 February. However, as regards the amendments concerning comitology, the Commission takes the view that these do not conform to Decision 1999/468/EC, as Article 8 of that Decision should only cover implementation measures aimed at public health objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore wishes to make the following declaration. 'The Commission considers that the wording of Article 24, paragraphs 2(1) and paragraph 3(1) of this regulation, is not in conformity with Decision 1999/468/EC, as Article 8 of that decision should only cover implementation measures aimed at public health objectives. As a consequence, the Commission reserves the right to take appropriate action'.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming back to the favourable outcome of the conciliation procedure, I repeat that this regulation is excellent news for pet owners. The agreement reached by the three institutions on this regulation represents a milestone in the establishment of the internal market and probably the most sensitive one in the animal health area, due to concerns in some Member States in relation to rabies.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress has been facilitated by the spectacular success over the past decade of our efforts to eradicate rabies within the European Union. Indeed we are now nearing total eradication.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, this regulation will have a huge impact on millions of European citizens who will now be able to travel with their pets, thus bolstering their perception of a united Europe by responding directly to their wishes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What has been commonly labelled the pet passport scheme will make it simpler to cross borders and at the same time ensure high safety standards and the protection of public health. It is worth mentioning again that the Commission brought forward this proposal as a result of the remarkable success of measures taken to control rabies in recent years. Due to vaccination campaigns the number of cases of rabies in cats and dogs dropped from nearly 500 in 1991 to a mere 5 in 1998 and, as the Commissioner says, it has almost been eradicated. This success has enabled the Member States to adopt a set of common rules on pet animal movements which is very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst there are exceptions for the so-called sensitive Member States – the UK, Sweden and Ireland for five years – in the other 12 EU countries proof of a valid rabies vaccination in the form of a passport document will be the only requirement for taking cats, dogs and ferrets between Member States as long as they also have an electronic microchip for identification, although some Member States may continue to use tattoos for an eight-year transition period.</p>
<p class="contents">After that time, only microchips will be allowed as it is a more humane and also a more effective method. In addition to that, microchips enable details of the pet owner to be recorded so it will be easier to trace lost animals and help combat illegal trade in pets. It is very important to be able to distinguish between commercial and non-commercial movement of animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK, Sweden and Ireland can still use quarantine for animals coming in from countries outside the EU where rabies is endemic, but for EU countries and countries where the disease is under control they will require vaccination and a follow-up immunity test before travel.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight briefly a couple of the key points that were raised during the discussion of this report. One is the OIE International Animal Health Code which Parliament wished to use in its entirety when drawing up the list of third countries deemed to be free of rabies. This is the position that Parliament has stated in earlier discussions. However, many countries are now moving away from use of this code and away from the strict rabies-free status; so adopting the code could actually unnecessarily exclude some countries from this pet travel scheme. But, more importantly, it could actually be less effective in stopping the spread of rabies. We must adopt the wording used in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, although Parliament expressed concern about the inclusion of animals younger than three months in the scheme, as they could not have been vaccinated, we have been assured that this will not present a danger to public health and can therefore agree to that for 12 of the 15 countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been a great deal of debate on the role of Parliament in agreeing any extension to the five-year transitional period for the UK, Sweden and Ireland. I am pleased that agreement was reached on this point, as it is of paramount importance that decisions relating to a report which has been adopted under the codecision procedure should themselves be subject to codecision when being amended or reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will have sufficient time to consult Parliament and the Council following the scientific assessment of this scheme which will be carried out in 2008. Similarly, comitology is now limited to implementation measures which Parliament could accept, and the delegation noted the Commission's statement on this.</p>
<p class="contents">A controversial issue earlier on was the inclusion of ferrets in the scheme. The original Commission proposal included ferrets as a category of pets which would not require any specific animal health requirements, and the common position then changed this by putting ferrets in a separate category, so they will require vaccination and identification. While many Members have expressed surprise that ferrets can be classed as pets, I can assure them that in Wales, which I represent, there are many ferret owners who will be delighted with this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation has changed considerably since the Commission first published its proposal, including several aspects relating to animal health and affecting the legal basis used, but we have the basis of a good and effective scheme and one which everyone will welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues in the other groups for their cooperation: the animal welfare intergroup for their support; several other organisations which have provided information and advice; and also the Commission and the Council for what turned out in the end to be a straightforward conciliation. We now have to ensure that people are aware of what the scheme means, and of how they can prepare in advance to take their pets with them when they travel. I look forward, on my travels back and forth, to seeing many pet owners taking advantage of these new rules which will benefit everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me just make two brief comments in addition to what the rapporteur has said. Firstly, many thanks to the Commission and the Commissioner. The conciliation procedure was a real pleasure. We were very pleased to note, in our group, how much effort was made to make concessions to Parliament here, and since we have often said unflattering things about the Council and the Commission yesterday and today, I would like to take this opportunity to express my warm thanks for this truly outstanding conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to say something in the interests of the dogs themselves. I have a dog myself, and he has told me that he does not want a microchip or a tattoo. It is no fun at all for dogs to be dragged about the place. You see these poor dogs on aeroplanes, barking, whining and whimpering, stuck in those awful cages and having to endure a long flight, and I really do think that anyone who gets a dog or cat should realise that they have acquired a living creature, and if they are not prepared to take proper account of its needs, they should not get an animal in the first place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fear, Commissioner, that you and I one way or another are on a stage with animals the whole time! This, however, has been a variant on the kind of health concerns and maladies with which we are only too familiar, and on behalf of my group I want to thank Ms Evans very warmly for the skilful way in which she has negotiated the process of codecision. She very modestly says that this was straightforward. No codecision that gets to that stage is ever entirely straightforward. You need to know when to advance, when to yield a little, and when to see that there may be further room for compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot say that I was entirely happy about the way every part of this procedure went. I was not entirely happy about the secure position of the ferrets. I have been very insecure in the presence of ferrets. I was not entirely happy about the provisions with regard to animals under three months old. One has some misgivings there about the rationale for what we have done; but equally the Commission was probably uneasy to some degree about the fact that we have extended into the codecision procedure any further consideration of the exemptions for the UK, Sweden and Ireland, which will follow after five years. In other words, a standard piece of give and take, the kind of thing that until a few years ago, until we had the present Commission and the present Parliament, was not possible. It still only works when you have skilled rapporteurs who can go through these shoals.</p>
<p class="contents">It has added modestly to the sum total of human happiness as well. There are many people, lonely people in particular, who are very dependent on the animals with which they share their lives. If we dare to believe that animals are sentient beings, it is also the case that we have added to the sum of animal happiness as well. That certainly is the view of my dog, which is the proud owner of two human beings! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andersen (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, it is not better animal welfare that is on the agenda at present. On the contrary, it is the convenience of animal owners, which is being promoted at animals’ expense. In the EU, there is otherwise a lot about the need to improve animal welfare. Having a larger number of pet animals being moved around is not in the interests of animal welfare. On the contrary, it may give rise to unnecessary stress. Fido and Kit are best off at home. At worst, transportation may result in illnesses such as rabies being spread to countries that, until now, have been free from rabies, possibly including new EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal would harmonise EU regulations. Sweden, the UK and Ireland at present have stricter requirements governing the import of pet animals. They will now, after five years, be forced to withdraw their sensible requirements. It makes sense to impose veterinary requirements in connection with the transport of animals. The EU should adopt a set of minimum regulations and call upon all the EU countries to follow Sweden’s, the UK’s and Ireland’s example. This would take the form of a proposal that puts health and animal welfare above animal owners’ freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is wrong in principal to demand that EU countries with high standards in this area should relax their requirements in order to promote freedom of movement. On the surface of it, it may seem to be a minor matter, but it is an important matter in terms of principle. By voting in favour, Parliament would be adopting the principle of harmonising down to a level corresponding to the lowest common denominator, at the same time as abolishing Sweden’s, the UK’s and Ireland’s right to be pioneers. I have therefore requested a roll-call vote on this matter. I would call for the proposal on freedom of movement for pet animals to be voted against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
