But, at the same time, I am extremely sad that we must have yet another resolution on Burma because the situation there, far from getting better, is actually getting much worse.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for this further resolution stems from a number of reasons. Among the most important is the fact that the SPDC has vowed to crush the National League for Democracy by the end of this year. The signs are that they are serious. Their attempt to evict the NLD from their current location looks like a systematic campaign to achieve that. The number of political prisoners appears to have risen from 1,500 to 3,000 very recently, many of whom are forced to carry out hard labour and are subject to cruel forms of torture.</p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming EU/ASEAN meeting in Laos in December offers us a crucial opportunity to demonstrate our condemnation of this regime in the strongest terms. We are calling for the Council and the Commission to postpone that meeting, to call it off, until the Burmese junta releases all political prisoners without conditions and allows freedom of movement for Aung San Suu Kyi and her party members and until the Burmese junta enters into a meaningful dialogue with the election-winning NLD and the ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Aung San Suu Kyi herself has said that the constructive engagement approach by ASEAN in relation to Rangoon is not working. The opportunity to call off and to postpone this meeting that is due next month in Laos offers us the opportunity to make the statement in the strongest terms, to send the strongest possible signal that we condemn this illegal regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How bad do things have to get? Aung San Suu Kyi is held incommunicado. There are 3,000 political prisoners, 23% of the population live below the poverty line and 40% of the children in Burma are malnourished. Burma is now the world's second largest producer of heroin and opium after Afghanistan. They are conducting a major offensive against the Shan people and the Karen people and, as the UN rapporteur has said, there is no sign of any dialogue between the SDPC and the NLD.</p>
<p class="contents">Today in Geneva the ILO are meeting as we speak and it looks very likely that they are going to support sanctions against Burma in protest about the use of forced labour. It is my understanding that the French representative in Geneva has supported that view. Now is the time to actually impose strict conditions on that meeting in December. Aung San Suu Kyi must be released and allowed to travel freely and a troika must be allowed to go to Burma and to go anywhere and meet anyone they like. Also today, Thailand, an ASEAN member, has said that Burma must allow a permanent ILO presence in that country, that there must be a mechanism to monitor forced labour and that ILO sanctions should not be lifted on their fellow ASEAN member until real results have been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">How will the EU respond to these strong voices from across Europe and indeed from the region for the first time? It is surely indefensible for the Commission and the Council to continue with any idea of holding this meeting. It will clearly be interpreted as a softening of Europe's approach at this time. Aung San Suu Kyi has reiterated recently that constructive engagement with Rangoon is not working and she and the NLD have asked for the meeting to be postponed. If the EU goes ahead, the junta would be encouraged and heartened by the decision to sit our foreign ministers from democratic European governments around a table which includes the military junta of Burma. We should be ashamed of such treachery. ASEAN would also continue to feel that it is not necessary to do anything about the pariah in their midst. Do we intend to collude with this or will we make a decision now to pull out? By standing by our own principles and the values that we cherish, we will also be cherishing the values of the people of Burma who are being so systematically persecuted by the military regime in their country.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maaten (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, there are several reasons as to why we are once again discussing Burma – in fact this is the second time since the summer – and nor is this the first time this year that this country has been on the agenda. There are several reasons for this. Not long ago, Aung San Suukyi was again denied permission to leave Rangoon and talk to the supporters of her party, the NLD, a party which won the elections by such a large majority and has never been allowed to wield power. It is true that James Mawdsley, the activist we talked about two months ago, has been released since then. We might think that this is a small ray of hope, but that must not divert us from the major issues, from the big picture that we get in Burma. At the end of the day, the fact remains that the UN rapporteur for human rights returned from Burma with a negative account. The human rights activist Soe Thein has been treated in a lamentable manner.</p>
<p class="contents">So there is every reason to talk about Burma again, and unfortunately there is no hope of it being the last time. Of course, slavery in Burma is talked about at length within the IAO. This is a subject that has not been given very much attention here to date, but, naturally, it must be discussed within the context of the European Union. The political repression continues and the flood of refugees, mainly headed for Thailand, continues – and for that matter, Thailand is putting troops into action. This is unacceptable in every sense by international standards. The military regime in Burma claims to be able to maintain order and stability in a country where ethnic rivalries are never far away. But the repression perpetrated by the regime only strengthens the rebellious feelings that can arise there and does not in any way, shape or form, lead to a resolution of potential ethnic conflicts. The problem of course, is what should we, as the European Union, do now? Our answer is to suggest that we keep the sanctions in place. I really do not think we have any alternative. The sad thing is that sanctions have proved ineffective so far. But ASEAN’s constructive contribution has fared no better, and I also have the feeling that increasingly, the other ASEAN countries, i.e. Burma’s neighbours, are beginning to feel ashamed of their decision to allow Burma to join ASEAN. Their philosophy of taking a constructive approach has failed and I feel that we, as the European Union, ought not to let them forget it. Round table talks with Burma do not work. In any case, I would not trust our own ministers to raise the matter there. They did not say a word about human rights at the ASEAN meeting in October, and I am not confident that they would do so now. That is why we are going to keep the sanctions strategy in place for the time being. We readily support the amendments that Mrs Kinnock tabled on that aspect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Its sad inheritance of colonialism and neo-colonialism obliges the European Union to take a firm, very brave and decisive stance, in order to aid the re-establishment of democracy in various parts of the world, such as Latin America, which currently faces the problem of Guatemala with its fight against the impunity of military figures, Africa or, in this case, Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, the truth is that the situation in Burma is getting worse; it is incredible that there is still this persecution of such an important leader of democracy as Aung San Suu Kyi and that the Democratic League cannot operate normally in its work for the re-establishment of democracy, especially when there is still economic investment in that country which is taking advantage precisely of that lack of freedom, that lack of union rights there. We therefore believe that the European Union is obliged to take strong action at international level so that, both through sanctions and through imposing a negotiation with leaders of the democratic opposition, democracy and the normal development of the right to freedom of the people of Burma may be restored and so that we can stop talking about situations which remind us with such sadness of the facts of the past. We therefore reaffirm the importance of this resolution and the firm commitment of the Commission and the Council in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we sit here in our climate-controlled comfort, the democratically elected parliamentarians of Burma are under house arrest, in hiding and under the gravest possible threat. Meanwhile the communist junta maintains its iron grip on the people, press and the National League for Democracy. Members of that junta have boasted about how they will exterminate the NLD before the end of this year, and for years made the same boast about the minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Twice since last September we have passed resolutions deploring the administration in Burma and despite our clear and heartfelt views on this matter, we know that the EU countries will be sending foreign ministers to meet their ASEAN counterparts in Laos next month. We must say loudly and clearly that we believe that it is absolutely wrong for them to do so, as is planned. We, in Europe, must not give them that spurious legitimacy and we heard some excellent speeches from Mrs Lucas and Mrs Kinnock on that point. We all know the story of Aung San Suu Kyi and we must be aware that constructive engagement between ASEAN and Rangoon has not worked. Therefore we must call upon our governments not to do the opposite of what the Nobel and Sakharov Prize winner has asked.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday Mr James Mawdsley, who was released from Burma, sent me a message which I want to read out to you. His words are far more eloquent than my own when confronting the evil of the Burmese regime. He says: "the military junta in Burma is terrified of the NLD. They are afraid of anyone who refuses to bow to their brutality. It is abundantly clear to them that the world and NLD led by Dr Aung San Suu Kyi will not now bow. Therefore the regime feels it must utterly destroy them. Military intelligence officers have boasted to me that the NLD is to be crushed. It is to be destroyed. They laughed when they said it. This is not sane behaviour. They sit and laugh about the murder and repression of Burma's elected representatives. The regime also boasts that they will kill all Karen and they are committing genocide among the Karen, Karenni and Shan ethnic groups of Burma. I have walked through this territory: from the top of the mountains as far as the eye can see, all villages have been destroyed and the populations murdered or displaced. I have seen victims of repression, women and men wounded, dying and dead. The regime's hatred of the ethnic groups and for the NLD cannot be checked by appeals to reason or morality. The regime responds only when it feels threatened. My release demonstrates that.".</p>
<p class="contents">It demonstrates that the regime will only do something when it feels threatened. These are the words of James Mawdsley, not mine. He suffered mightily at the hands of the Burmese and he says that only when they are threatened will they do something. We have to recognise that in relation to the ASEAN meeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The poster has got ragged and shabby and curling at the edges. I kept it there in the hope that I would be able to replace it with a happier and more triumphant poster. But, as has been said by many of the excellent speeches this afternoon, there remains still nothing but despair about this wonderful, gentle, charming and immensely brave woman and her attempts to keep the flag of freedom flying in her own country. Her country has become an international pariah state. ASEAN has become, in every sense of the word, a paper tiger in its failure to deal with the awful events in Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">An added failure on the part of the West has occurred with the departure of the UN's special rapporteur on human rights in Burma, Mr Rajsoomer Lallah. He left because he alleged that he was getting virtually no support from the Human Rights Bureau of the United Nations. I know myself what a source of anguish this is for the Commissioner, Mrs Mary Robinson. Mr Lallah has said: "I see very little changing. Year after year the General Assembly and the Commission pass resolutions. I feel disappointed." We feel disappointed. We feel that notwithstanding the many expressions of support and concern from this Parliament we have failed to succeed in making the military junta respond to the concerns of the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should have sanctions. Mr Deva has given the views of my group, which I totally support, and it is significant this afternoon that there is not one single person who has spoken who is not at one with these ideas and with the general support for Aung San Suu Kyi and her party. She has had a special place in our hearts here in Parliament for many years. It is almost unbelievable that to this day she remains a prisoner in her own home and has suffered as she has done over the years. I know that it is of some small comfort that we continue to bang on the door of this evil and vicious regime and I hope very much that the suggestions that have been made by both Mr Deva and Mrs Kinnock will be recognised by the Commission and respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I hope that, by prioritising this issue as an urgency, this Parliament is giving a clear message to the Burmese people that their plight is not forgotten and that we recognise that the situation in Burma is worsening rather than improving and are determined to try and do something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do believe that the international community needs to move on from rhetoric to real action and, as a member of Parliament's Delegation for relations with the Member States of ASEAN, South-east Asia and the Republic of Korea, I am disappointed and concerned like others before me that the EU has decided to enter into dialogue with ASEAN in Laos next month at ministerial level.</p>
<p class="contents">I know the arguments that the ASEAN Member States have put to our delegation about including Burma in this group. They believe that, by entering into dialogue with Burma, somehow or other they can influence it to change its oppressive practices because it will see the clear economic and political benefits of improving its human rights record.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma has been a Member of ASEAN for a number of years and there is absolutely no evidence to date that shows any improvement or an end to forced labour or executions or suppression of free speech and free movement. The list of human rights violations by this regime continues to get longer and longer each year. Engaging with them is a ridiculously naive concept so long as there is not even a glimmer of liberalisation in their attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">What this dialogue is achieving is legitimising the Burmese junta's continued brutal regime. As I said earlier, what we want is action and not words. If we are really serious about improving and having an impact on the lives of Burmese people we need to do some of the following. Like others have said before me: we should postpone the meeting in Laos next month; and the Burmese junta should lift all restrictions on democratically elected political members and the leaders of NLD. The junta should also enter into dialogue with the NLD and the ethnic nationalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should consider supporting ILO economic sanctions to prevent Burma from taking advantage of European trade, investments and tourism until they stop the system of forced labour. We have a moral responsibility, as a community of values, to ensure that the citizens of Burma can enjoy the same fundamental rights as those enjoyed by citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The plight of Aung San Suu Kyi continues to worsen. She has not been allowed to travel since she was placed under house arrest on 21 September when she attempted to travel to Mandalay. She apparently has no access to a telephone and no visitors. There are even rumours that she has been handcuffed in her own house.</p>
<p class="contents">The plight of the rest of the members of the National League for Democracy is hardly any better. Large numbers are under arrest or are being harassed, and attempts have been made to close down their offices in Burma. The junta has said that it is their intention to try and smash the party as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">But it not just Aung San Suu Kyi, it is not just the military, it is not just the NLD – there are almost 3 000 political prisoners who are suffering from hard labour and torture. There are forced relocations of populations of ethnic minorities and there is forced labour. The ILO has been in and tried to look at the situation and see if constructive engagement led to any improvement. As we know, the ILO is meeting today. It is likely to recommend sanctions because there has been no improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">I am beginning to get thoroughly fed up with making this speech – I have made it on three or four occasions now to the Council and the Commission – but the situation is worsening, so what are you going to do? Council and Commission, it is now finally time to act. You must recognise that we are making no progress whatsoever with the current approach. Please look at imposing sanctions. Make it absolutely clear that we are not going to attend the meeting in Laos in the presence of the Burmese military junta because that will be intolerable and the message will be that they can get away with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has taken a long time. I feel that special praise must go to Mr Dupuis for his assiduousness in this respect, because otherwise we might have had to wait even longer.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we see in Vietnam? We see a country whose people are becoming more liberal whilst the powers that be are old men who cling for dear life to old ways. It is so tragic, because Vietnam is a country with so much potential. It has a dynamic, healthy and well-educated population. It has natural resources such as oil, fish, coffee, rice and timber. You feel like telling those old men to open the door and success will flood in. Instead, we see a complete lack of press freedom and ongoing political oppression. Just look at how the dissident Ha Is Phu was treated.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware that the Vietnam debate is historically charged. We must be careful what we say about Vietnam, or at least that has been customary hitherto. After all, the West has had a certain level of involvement in the country. It is historically charged and naturally it is an awkward situation. When it comes to human rights, we cannot say whether the glass is half full or half empty. The glass is not full in Vietnam. That is what it is all about. We work with Vietnam; it is our partner, and so we cannot afford to keep our lips sealed about the situation there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some might say: surely Vietnam is a very long way away from the European Union. But I can tell you that Germany and Bavaria, for example, see Vietnam as very close. If you travel from the Bavarian border country to the neighbouring Czech Republic, you will see many Vietnamese markets, meet many Vietnamese who are playing a very active part in that border region. If you travel to the eastern part of the reunited Germany, you will find Vietnamese who made their home there in what used to be the Communist bloc. And in the western part, you will find Vietnamese who fled that same Communism and came to Germany as asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">That shows how closely our destinies have been intertwined in this Eurasian continent for many years. That also becomes very clear when you look at the parallels in the history of Europe and Germany and also of Vietnam. Germany and Europe were divided. Ten years ago they were reunited, in the name of freedom. Vietnam suffered terrible wars and was torn apart by the interests of the great powers. One day Vietnam too was reunited, not peacefully however, but by the force of arms, and it was reunited under a Communist system, a dictatorship. We now have a situation in Vietnam in which economic reforms are certainly being carried out. Many people believed that this would automatically also lead to political reforms. But we can see quite clearly in many states of Asia, including Burma which we just discussed – it is a parallel case – that economic reforms, trade and cooperation, however welcome, do not automatically bring more freedom or constitutional legality.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a particular risk in Asia of dissociating economic and political reforms, of economic progress and economic liberalisation without political liberalisation or greater constitutional legality. I believe that without a constitutional state that is functioning properly, in the long-term Asia will lose out on trade, subsidies and investments. That is why the economy also needs the framework of constitutional legality.</p>
<p class="contents">This explains why it is so important that we call clearly for the rule of law, for the so-called retraining camps to be dismantled, and above all for freedom of religion. In Vietnam this year, part of the land of a Catholic monastery was confiscated, small groups of Protestants were harassed, missions were closed and missionaries locked up. The Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, with its wealth of tradition, was brutally persecuted, although it had played such a major part in the national rebirth of Vietnam. That is why it is our duty to stand up for these political prisoners and, regardless of any justified economic interests, to call clearly for democracy and the rule of law. Instead of turning a blind eye to violations of human rights we must say, as the largest economic power in the world, that we want to and will cooperate with Vietnam, but only provided that it adheres ever more to democracy and the rule of law and finally initiates the overdue process of political reform. Freedom of religion, freedom of conscience and freedom of the media are the crucial yardstick by which we will measure it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It could be an Asian dragon, like the others that were discovered in recent years; nonetheless, as I said, it is one of the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem – Mr Posselt put it better than I could – is that there is one thing lacking: over and above the question of human rights, there is a lack of democracy in Vietnam today. That is what prevents the country from taking off; it is what prevents it from effectively combating the corruption which blights it. So the European Union must begin to take a firm stance towards Vietnam and raise the issue of the rule of law and not just – I repeat – the issue of human rights, where there have been some signs of improvement. These slight improvements – which we certainly do not owe to the author of the Socialist Group amendments, Mr Sakellariou – have come about over the last few years and given rise to a situation that is certainly no longer tragic but that remains disastrous and in any case still is no match for the real issues of modern-day Vietnam.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must therefore take resolute action to ensure that the question of democracy, the question of the rule of law, becomes the key to the European Union's relations with Vietnam. So I believe this is an important resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We adopted a resolution two years ago, the most recent one on Vietnam, and there, too, I do not remember – nor do I think Mr Posselt remembers – the Socialist Group giving any particular undertaking to support that resolution at the time. We adopted the resolution and we have had occasion to note that it brought about a few small improvements. I hope that after this resolution is adopted – without Mr Sakellariou's amendments – we will hear a firm undertaking from the Commission and a few practical responses from the Vietnamese authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself once travelled in this country and came to know its vitality, beauty and wealth of resources. That makes me all the sadder that it is not summoning up the courage to introduce greater freedom and power of initiative, that the government and the political leaders are preventing that.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in answer to Mr Dupuis, I regret in that respect that we could not agree on a joint resolution, that important and justified points that are also endorsed by the Human Rights Watch – not the most tolerant organisation when it comes to violations of human rights – were not accepted. If you are now more or less announcing that you will vote against these amendments, then unfortunately I must announce that we will probably abstain from the vote on this resolution. That is not because we are against its fundamental content, but because we believe that we should have found a common basis here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, with your permission I will misuse a little of my speaking time and draw attention to a case which could not be included in the list of urgencies because it only recently became known. In Iran, two individuals, Said Sadr and Khalil Rostamchani, have been threatened with the death penalty, or at least the public prosecutor has applied for it, in a case relating to an event held by the Heinrich Böll Foundation in Berlin after the elections. I would ask you to draw the attention of the President of this House to this very precarious situation. I am not necessarily calling for intervention, but we should follow this case very closely and then, if it seems necessary, also make it clear that we are against the death penalty under all circumstances, but especially for what are no more than ‘ideological’ crimes. I would just ask you to approach this matter with delicacy, and I hope you will pardon me this misuse of my speaking time on the question of Vietnam. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, it is not the case that countries that have themselves been subject to violence, oppression, torture, mutilation and mass murder automatically become angels who cannot perform such acts themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel is probably one of the most obvious examples in world history of the fact that it is not so simple. Every nation must learn over and over again what democracy and human rights are. Now, however, Human Rights Watch, as Mr Swoboda mentioned, is saying that Vietnam has recently taken steps to improve the situation regarding human rights. Tens of thousands of political prisoners have been released. I think that is it appropriate for such a thing to be mentioned in a resolution. We must be harsh in our criticism, but we must not ignore what is nevertheless being done. This only weakens the criticism, and those who are being criticised get the feeling that it is of no avail what they do – if they do not do everything at once, which is something they neither can nor want to do. Criticism can be counterproductive if it does not take into account what has actually been done. Vietnam deserves harsh criticism of the kind reflected in the motion for a resolution – there is no doubt about that – but I think that it is appropriate for us also to include a few sentences demonstrating that we are aware that certain improvements have been made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The war between these two countries has not led to lasting bitterness. It would be better still though, if the President were not just to concentrate on reinforcing mutual cooperation, when he visits Hanoi, but if he were to make this very cooperation conditional on the extraction of firm promises from Vietnam to drastically improve the prevailing lamentable human rights situation. For there is certainly a great deal amiss in Communist Vietnam.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to Amendment No 1 tabled by the PSE Group, I noted in a document published on 10 November, that Human Rights Watch regards the human rights situation as being grave on quite a number of counts. Think of those imprisoned for political and religious reasons, some of whom are in re-education camps. Equally, consider how the special UN rapporteur’s recommendations regarding religious intolerance were ignored, and think of the lack of freedom of expression and the ongoing media censorship.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I would now like to take a brief look at the grave persecution of Christians taking place at present. It is therefore right that these acts should be referred to in recital E and paragraph 5 of the joint resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent edition of the Asian weekly ‘Far East and Economic Review’ today refers to the existence of top secret documents originating from Vietnam. These extremely secret documents give us a rare look behind the scenes of Vietnamese government policy. Closer examination of these official papers – I have read them myself – reveals that the Protestants are the main target of persecution. Hanoi has been particularly alarmed by the unexpectedly rapid growth of Protestant Christianity under the Hmong minority in the country’s mountainous north-western provinces, and this has prompted it to instigate cruel repressive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">What is telling about this is the promotion of a district official whose fury has driven hundreds of Christians to take flight. This persecutor of churches has been asked by the powers that be to cleanse not just his own province, but also the entire district, of Christians. The documents that have come to light are nothing less than a smoking gun. They reveal that church closures, arrests and bible burnings are not isolated acts perpetrated by overzealous party officials. No, these outrages derive from the political directives issued by the Vietnamese Communist party. The lie has now been exposed.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the Vietnamese government claims to have introduced freedom of worship in recent years. President Clinton would do well to raise this matter during his present visit to Hanoi. I urge the Council and the Commission to protest in robust terms against this flagrant abuse of freedom of worship by the Vietnamese authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I will try to speak about both issues. Firstly, with regard to Myanmar, my colleague Chris Patten has already condemned before this House the constant violations of human rights by the military regime in Burma: executions without trial, the widespread imposition of forced labour, the enforced uprooting of local populations, hundreds of political prisoners in the country’s prisons and the clear hindering of the free functioning of political parties. He also expressed his concern about the detention and harassment of Aung San Suu Kyi and the members of the National League for Democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Commission fully share your concerns about this situation and we agree wholeheartedly with the numerous criticisms expressed here today of the way in which the military regime usually makes a mockery of each and every principle contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The resolution recently adopted by the United Nations demonstrates that it is not only the European Union that harbours these concerns. However, the Commission remains convinced that a lasting solution to the current situation can only be found by means of dialogue between the military regime, the democratically elected opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council has tried to persuade the military regime of the value of this argument in favour of political dialogue and to exert pressure so that there might be changes and it will continue to do so. The Commission supports this initiative. Despite everything, we are convinced that we must not allow the situation prevailing in Myanmar to hijack the dialogue between the European Union and ASEAN.</p>
<p class="contents">Three years have passed since we held a ministerial meeting with our ASEAN partners, which is far too long a time in our relations with a region that is important for the European Union from the political and economic points of view. That is why we believe the meeting should not be postponed. However, that does not mean that, either now or in December, we should behave as if the accession of Myanmar to ASEAN had not affected our relations, because it has. Our ASEAN partners know this very well and are concerned to repair this damage; on the other hand, they know that encouraging Burma to make a genuine effort and to put an end to its appalling behaviour in the field of human rights is the best way to revive relations between the Union and ASEAN. Given the importance that both they and we attach to these relations, we hope that our ASEAN partners will continue to communicate our concerns – which we believe the majority of them share – in relation to the military regime.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union-ASEAN ministerial meeting should be taken as a new opportunity to clearly and firmly express our opinions on the situation prevailing in Burma, both to the regime itself as well as to the members of ASEAN. We will therefore exert pressure on the military regime to put an end to the violations of human rights and begin a dialogue with the democratically elected opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of Vietnam and the human rights situation, I would like to point out the following: we must remember that Vietnam is a country in transition, that its government initiated a process which led to the adoption in 1986 of a reform programme that embraced external relations and political and economic change. Since then, Vietnam has pursued an open-door external policy, and that is why that country occupies the place that it deserves within our international relations. Furthermore, the process has led to the signing of a cooperation agreement between the Commission and Vietnam in 1995. During this time, Vietnam has made advances towards a market economy, which has, in particular, led to its presentation of a request to join the World Trade Organisation. Furthermore – and I think this should be highlighted today – within the framework of the new constitution adopted in 1992, Vietnam has an elected national parliament, which has the duty of adopting legislation and to which the government must answer in relation to its policies. According to our information, the members of parliament rigorously fulfil their function of examining legislative proposals and supervising the initiatives and policies of the government.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is important to acknowledge these advances and the context in which Vietnam continues to make progress. It is clear, therefore, that things have been achieved, but it is also clear, as you have pointed out, that there is still much more to be done. I fully share the concern about the problems raised by some Members: although it is true that almost 23 000 people have already been freed as a result of general amnesties, we must continue to show concern for those are still in prison for their political or religious beliefs. It is a source of satisfaction that there is no official censorship in the Vietnamese press, but it is also absolutely clear that there is occasional censorship in the foreign press. There is also clear pressure from the Vietnamese authorities for their own press to operate a system of self-censorship. Furthermore, although it is to be welcomed that there has recently been a reduction in crimes punishable by the death penalty, it is clearly the case that, in our view, the death penalty should be abolished completely. The circumstances surrounding the execution at the beginning of this year of a Vietnamese-Canadian citizen undoubtedly support our convictions in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with the Member States, the Commission participates in all the initiatives adopted by the European Union directed at the Vietnamese Government in relation to human rights and I can assure you that, within this process, we will continue to raise specific problems and cases and to promote a steady improvement in the human rights situation in Vietnam. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We fully agreed the text. Subsequently, you tabled amendments, which is entirely legitimate; it is just that we cannot accept the way they are worded because they seem to relativise the question.
