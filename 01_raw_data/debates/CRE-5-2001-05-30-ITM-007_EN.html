<p class="contents">“Is there one single creature in the air,</p>
<p class="contents">on earth, in the water,</p>
<p class="contents">that we do not kill or destroy?</p>
<p class="contents">No physical force,</p>
<p class="contents">or skill,</p>
<p class="contents">let alone craftiness or deception</p>
<p class="contents">can save them</p>
<p class="contents">from our destructive power.</p>
<p class="contents">No rock is too hard,</p>
<p class="contents">no mountain too high or mighty,</p>
<p class="contents">no tree too majestic or mature:</p>
<p class="contents">We can obliterate it all.</p>
<p class="contents">No bird flies too high in the sky,</p>
<p class="contents">no fish swims too deep in the sea,</p>
<p class="contents">no animal is too remote,</p>
<p class="contents">in lonely places.</p>
<p class="contents">We can control it,</p>
<p class="contents">We can kill it.”</p>
<p class="contents">This poem expresses a deep compassion for creation. You may think that this was written by a twenty-first century environmental activist, but it was published in 1536 by Martin Bucer, clergyman of the Thomas Church in Strasbourg. Caring for and caring about the environment are thus not recent phenomena. It is fair to say that we are debating a Commission communication and a Parliament report which do not contain any ground-breaking news.</p>
<p class="contents">The Environmental Committee is of the broad opinion that the European Commission’s communication displays too much resemblance to the document that was published six years ago. In our view, the policy development in this intervening period has been too insubstantial.</p>
<p class="contents">The cautious approach which the Commission has adopted is, in itself, understandable, but should not mean that the safeguarding of economic growth in the short term is afforded top priority in the political arena. If that were to happen, other social and treaty objectives would be prejudiced. One of those other objectives is that it will be possible to tailor economic development to the environment. The Commission should emphatically alert the Member State governments to the fact that they have made a commitment in this connection and that they have to live with the consequences that this entails.</p>
<p class="contents">By introducing commercial instruments, it is possible to internalise the external impact of economic activity in the prices of goods and services. As a result, many scarce environmental resources, which have not so far had any price placed on them, can be better valued. In this way, a growing number of ‘automatic incentives’ would be built in, with the aim of inducing producers and consumers to live and operate more sustainably. However, it is striking that the Commission does not pay any attention to the imperfections and the dark side of market forces. Clean air and pure drinking water should be freely accessible to everyone. This principle of social justice and equality should also be one of the considerations. The opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs specifically addresses this aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of environmental degradation does not exist in isolation. Poverty, unemployment, energy and environmental problems affect and reinforce one another, as a result of which a negative spiral looms. Not only in developing countries, but also in prosperous countries does this interaction occur. More attention ought to be devoted to this.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the indicators for integration of economic and environmental policy, the Commission is right to call for accordance with structural indicators, which the Lisbon European Council requested. Unfortunately, the Commission has not underlined how crucial it is to opt for a systematic approach here, linking environmental accounts to National Accounts. The European Parliament has drawn attention to this approach in resolutions dating from 1995 and 1998. A systematic approach would make it fairly easy to identify the interaction between economic activities (per sector), the environment and other areas in an objective manner. Separate indicators involve far more surveys. Could Commissioner Wallström confirm that this systematic approach is being pursued in accordance with the proposals in this resolution?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal to tackle subsidies which promote environmental damage and tax measures in future, has attracted a great deal of press attention. However, the suggestion to draw up indicators for this purpose, appears not so fruitful in my view. I would much prefer a critical analysis based on a quality study, in which measures which promote environmental damage and levies which protect the environment, as well as stimulating subsidies are tested on their effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication devotes no attention to the impact the newly announced policy measures will have on the candidate countries. In what way are the government or policy bodies from those countries involved in the stage that follows this communication?</p>
<p class="contents">Public awareness of the importance of a sustainable, economic development is generally below par. Greater expansion decidedly dominates current economic practice. It is not exactly the case that plenty of scope is given to respect for retaining Creation and respect for others, including future generations. Current unequal global relations not so much create privileges, as they do responsibilities and obligations for the people of rich, industrialised countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore regrettable that today’s debate was announced under the heading ‘environmental policy’. That is far too restricted. Today, we are discussing our future and the question whether we are prepared to take part in a changing process which got off to a promising start in Rio, or whether we will adopt a laissez-fair attitude instead. It is thus about whether we want to assume our responsibility, and whether we really want to be the stewards of this earth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Five minutes to debate sustainable development in a 25-year perspective is not much, and it is an art to be able to keep to the time margin exactly to the second.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is what we mean by a ‘sustainability strategy’? Is it a new political buzzword that we are attempting to invent here in Parliament? No, it is not. It is an inheritance that goes back further in time. We have had this task ever since it was decided in Rio nearly ten years ago that each nation was to establish a sustainability strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is sustainability? What are we actually talking about when we discuss sustainability? Well, we are discussing the future of coming generations. We are discussing what development, what life we want future generations to have – in other words, how their lives are to be managed as regards social issues, ecological development and the economy. However, we must bear in mind that it is easy for us who live in a fairly small, rich part of the world to say that we want to leave behind us, for others to inherit, a situation that is just as good as that which we have. For an overwhelming majority in the world, the desire must be for their children to have a better life than they had.</p>
<p class="contents">The process in Parliament for producing this document, which is still to form some kind of basis or contribution to the Gothenburg Summit, leaves a great deal to be desired. Parliament has had to rush to keep up with the Commission in order to be able to produce it or be given any opportunity at all to get its viewpoints across concerning the form this development should take. This is not satisfactory. It is possible that the Commission itself had plenty of time, but Parliament should still be given a real opportunity to discuss these matters – not just from an environmental perspective. The whole of Parliament, the committees working on social and economic issues and all the other committees that are actually concerned should be involved. Otherwise, we restrict the issue and make it just an environmental issue, which it is not.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as which areas of policy it would be desirable to look at in such a document, including in the light of the direction that the treatment of the issue is to take in Gothenburg, I believe that we must primarily start from the ecological perspective. Both the social and the economic perspectives are, of course, important, and we know that they rule our lives. However, if we do not have a well-functioning planet in ecological respects, it will be very difficult to discuss social and economic issues. It is quite simply a prerequisite that our ecology is in equilibrium. The Commission’s text, which we feel despite everything takes the current economic systems as its starting point, is then perhaps not entirely satisfactory. The point has somehow been missed. It is about utilising the economy that exists. It is about trying to set the limits we want to have on the market. It is about finding the management tools that we can use ourselves in our own budget and our own purchasing.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to create a sustainability strategy for the European Union, we must certainly observe the problems that exist within the Union, but it is completely impossible to isolate the Union from the outside world. We must see ourselves as part of the planet, in the global context. What we do in the Union affects the world around us. We must not export that which we do not want to have ourselves. We must review our trade relations and our agricultural policy, as well as the negative effects that the latter is having on the opportunities for other countries to develop. We also have a responsibility in international trade relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, without the local perspective, there will not be any sustainability strategy. The point of the Agenda 21 work was that it provided, and is providing, opportunities for voluntary organisations, players at local level, municipalities and citizens to participate in the process and understand what it is about. In the final analysis, it is about the responsibility of the individual and about the fact that it is actually necessary to change our behaviour in every area. The Commission, but naturally also the Council, must think about how we can encourage people to feel involved, and ensure that this is the case, so that it does not just become a message from on high.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say something about political leadership. It is essential that the message that will be given in Gothenburg is clear in order for it to be effective. It cannot be simply an empty manifesto. There must also be evidence that the Commission and the Council really want to move from words to actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The debate is addressing the strategy for sustainable development and integration of environmental issues in economic policy. The fact that these issues are high on the agenda is an expression of political will regarding change and renewal.</p>
<p class="contents">When sustainable development was written into the Treaty of Amsterdam, we were criticised for it not being sufficient and for implementation not being compulsory. Distrust was expressed regarding our common policy and the abilities of the European Union. This criticism can no longer be levelled at us. Now we must take a stand on concrete proposals, goals and funds, based on the Commission’s well-formulated proposal for a strategy for sustainable development and the reports presented by Mrs Hulthén and Mr Blokland.</p>
<p class="contents">An effective policy on sustainable development requires direct and clear social criticism. Biodiversity is under threat, acidification continues, eutrophication is increasing, chemicals are building up in our bodies, air pollution is becoming deadly, climate change is accelerating – and all this is happening at this very moment. We must not, however, forget the great opportunities we have: research is expanding, we have an increasing focus on education and lifelong learning, skills are growing and being passed on, new technology is being developed, efficient solutions are becoming more common, the problems within agriculture and fishing are breeding new ideas and new solutions and political will is strengthening.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now adopt a holistic approach in which various political areas cooperate. The economic, social and ecological perspectives must be interwoven and given equal weight in all political areas. We must propose concrete measures, changes in principles and clear goals. Now is the time to formulate a vision for the future. The goal for Europe is to be the world’s most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy. That goal must be coupled with the ecological aspect in Gothenburg if we are to be the region taking the greatest responsibility for nature and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for the policies to be based on the everyday lives of citizens. Research, education, democracy and participation are all preconditions for taking joint responsibility. In the continued work on a strategy of sustainability, dialogue with civil society and between the institutions of the European Union must be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim for the Presidency ahead of the European Council in Gothenburg is to adopt a strategy which will link the Lisbon Process with the strategy for sustainable development, establishing the ecological dimension by setting a number of clear, monitorable targets in order to reverse the negative trends we see today. It will require all future decisions in the EU being tested from the perspective of sustainability. It will clearly show Europe’s aim of reducing our impact on the climate and actively taking part in global cooperation. It will mean discarding unsustainable subsidies. It will lead to the adverse impacts of chemicals on health and the environment being minimised and it will ensure that sustainable development continues to be discussed at the highest political level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise the importance of having the political courage to establish concrete, timetabled targets for achieving sustainable development. As such I am happy to see that the report from Mrs Hulthén, which the European Parliament is examining today, expresses the same view. I would particularly like to mention the requirements in this report for a climate change programme and targets for renewable energy, the requirement for changes to transport policy, the requirement for a new chemicals policy based on the precautionary principle, the requirement for a sustainability analysis of all decisions, and the requirement for a strengthening of the sustainability perspective in the European Union’s global work.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report says, it is important that Parliament continues to push the issue forward and to critically review new legislation within the EU. When it comes to global responsibility, I would particularly emphasise what Mrs Hulthén brought up in her report. Sustainable development cannot be achieved unless the global perspective is addressed. This is therefore the vital task for us. The European Union must take a leading role in the work towards global sustainability. We must be clear in our work to ensure that next year’s World Summit for Sustainable Development in South Africa achieves the necessary results.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the preparations for the European Council in Gothenburg and for the summit in Johannesburg, last weekend I received 250 young people aged 20–25 from 110 different countries around the world. The meeting recognised no borders between countries or between people. So what do these young people have? They have involvement, they have enthusiasm. What do they lack? They lack patience, they lack fear of tackling difficult and complex problems. What do we owe them? I believe what we owe them is to lay the foundation for their faith in the future by being clear, by establishing concrete, political measures, by showing that we have the political courage and the political will to reverse the dangerous trends in the world. What do they demand of the EU, particularly following the US action on climate policy? They demand that the EU takes a clear lead in the global work towards sustainable development, against poverty and against the environmental destruction now taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise: sustainability on one continent is unsustainable sustainability. As Mrs Hulthén said, we can never assume that one part of the earth can live sustainably while the rest of the earth suffers poverty and environmental destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">In his report, Mr Blokland highlights the correlation between depletion of our natural resources and the impact on the environment on the one hand and economic policy on the other. The conclusion is that the absence of price tags on scarce resources and environmental impact leads to insufficient integration of environmental considerations and economics. To me it seems clear that a vital element of future sustainability policy is to better internalise environmental costs into the costs of goods and services in the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals presented in the report are important instruments for further development of the strategy for sustainable development and sectoral integration. The Presidency’s view is that it is important for environmental integration to be included in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. In this respect, market-based financial controls must also be used to a greater extent to put a price on scarce resources and to assess whether subsidies and tax exemptions have an adverse impact on the environment. Development of a strategy for environmental integration must include targets, timetables and follow-up mechanisms in the BEPG.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by referring to the conclusion in Mr Blokland’s report. Measures are needed now to avoid the need for more expensive measures later. I can also add to this a report from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, which shows that it generally takes considerable time for nature and the environment to recover from the environmental destruction we have caused and continue to cause. I believe this conclusion complements that of Mr Blokland.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words we cannot afford to wait. We must act now, and the reports before us today are an important step forward ahead of the European Council in Gothenburg and the summit in Johannesburg next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not integrating our social, economic and environmental policies. They should be pulling in the same direction, and they certainly do not at present.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also exemplified by the fact that the one Commissioner we have with us this evening is the Environment Commissioner. I welcome her here, but when we are discussing sustainability I would very much like to see in future the Commissioners from my own committee, and also at least from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to have long-term sustainability and develop a truly green economy, we have to take care to foster environmental-friendly businesses and use resources efficiently, and that includes the way in which we use our workforces. Hence my committee’s call for rapid progress in enabling people to work efficiently through effective consultation and participation, because democracy is also part of sustainability, as are reduced working hours and good quality work in safe working conditions supported by an effective system of social security.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are demanding that businesses provide social and environmental audits, as we quite rightly do, we need the accountants and other professionals than can do that. If we want builders who can construct energy-efficient buildings, we need to train them. Hence my committee’s call for all European Union funded training initiatives to take the environmental dimension fully into account, if we are really preparing people for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Social inclusion, as has already been said, is a key component of a sustainable society, hence the need for a guaranteed minimum income to provide for basic needs. We must combat discrimination and poverty. At present the dispossessed feel they have no stake in the future and that, under anybody’s reasoning, is a wicked waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable development is about creating a world in which there are no losers. We cannot achieve this goal if we continue with policies that pull in different directions and even undermine each other. Our common future depends on finding an effective way to ensure integration and sustainability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is that while there is in theory no internal contradiction between economic growth and preserving the environment, up until now economic growth has in practice normally been detrimental to the quality of the environment. However, on the other hand, economic decline combined with rising unemployment and poverty have also always resulted in a loss of environmental quality.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is a very complex subject and one particularly difficult to grasp because we still have no universal indicators for putting a monetary value on environmental assets. We need yardsticks that are valid for all the EU and we can conceive of them only for the EU. The Commission must put its communication on a statistically secure footing if we are not to continue building castles in the air.</p>
<p class="contents">Even assuming that we have such a secure footing, the question remains as to what conclusions should be drawn. Many things have been considered. Subsidies, tradable emission rights or the so-called eco-taxes, that is environment-related taxes or levies. Models for these exist.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, however, that such models should be introduced in all EU Member States in the same way and at the same time, so as to offer fair opportunities to all involved. Only fair competition will ensure that environmental measures, of whatever kind, find acceptance. Subsidies must be examined for their effectiveness and changed or replaced by other measures if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade in environmental assets must be fair. Environmental taxes and levies are worthwhile and effective only if related to emissions and imposed in such a way as to be neutral in their effect on the amount of tax paid by the citizen. In no case must such taxes and levies be misappropriated and spent on other areas than the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the only way we shall actually meet the justified demands of our citizens and of people outside the EU for a healthy environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sustainable development is a beautiful concept which articulates the belief that economic growth can go hand-in-hand with improving the environment. Until now, this has rarely been the case, as economic growth has been at the expense of the environment. We now need to improve our production methods so that they take the environment more – or even more – into account. We also need to change our thoughts and actions, and to consider environmental costs, so that environmental protection starts to pay off. The Gothenburg European Council needs to take an emphatic first step in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Blokland on his report. His realistic approach has in any event generated a few specific building blocks to develop further. I should also like to thank Mrs Hulthén for the conviction and tenacity with which she has presented her vision on sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of sustainable development must be translated into concrete proposals and decisions. I should like to home in on three points in this connection: production standards, bio-diversity and compliance. Sustainable development must be given a practical dimension. We want to focus on the development of concrete product standards, standards which curb the use of energy, standards which restrict, or ban as much as possible, the use of dangerous substances, and rules to enable the environmental cost to be reflected in the price of the product. Such standards are important in the food sector, as well as the building materials, clothing, paint and natural packaging sectors. In my opinion, we stand to gain a great deal on an environmental plane.</p>
<p class="contents">The standards must also aim to prevent waste: less throw-away packaging, less wear-and-tear, more sustainability and more sustained quality. If products do reach the end of their useful lives, re-use and recycling should be the obvious choice. The major challenge is then to create markets for all the product waste and all waste substances. Moreover, such markets also yield new employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Passing on environmental costs to the consumer is important, but not everything can be expressed in money. The protection of nature and bio-diversity is also a value in its own right without having an immediate economic value. The protection of bio-diversity is a theme which must recur in many policy areas. Needless to say, we must also adhere to the Bird and Habitat Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Which brings us to the third point: compliance. There is a great deal of sound European legislation. It is therefore necessary to comply with these laws. However, that is often a problem. Not all Member States enjoy the same good reputation in this connection. Mrs Hulthén and Mr Bowe asked in Strasbourg how the Commission intends to deal with this problem. The replies which the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, gave, were disappointing to say the least. I should therefore like to ask the Commission once again in what way it intends to address the Member States on the issue of inadequate compliance with European rules. I should also like to underline that Parliament could be far more involved in compliance. I should like to be issued with half-yearly reports on the state of affairs in terms of compliance with legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is terribly easy to write about wonderful dreams and to use fine words.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see those attending the European Council in Gothenburg dare to point the way forward. I would also like the courageous step to be taken of examining the EU’s own accounts, its own system of subsidies. Mr Blokland addresses this in item 5 and Mrs Hulthén in item 33 of her report, that is, that we need to revise the agricultural subsidies. I am happy to see that the Commission’s declaration is a little more stringent in stating that, when the common agricultural policy is reviewed in 2002, greater emphasis should be placed on quality than on quantity.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture is still Europe’s main industry, with agriculture and forestry being responsible for our cultural heritage, our recreation and biodiversity. The issues are chemicals and nutrients in the water, air quality and public health. So the question must be: How sustainable is the EU’s own subsidy system for agriculture? Is it not time to use some of this money for sustainable development, rural development, protecting biodiversity, removing chemicals and growing food which we can eat happily and safely?</p>

I refer mainly to the agricultural policy and, general speaking, to the emphasis placed on economic growth with too little thought for sustainable development. This is stressed in a recent OECD report which I should like to bring to the attention of the Commission and the Council and which is far more critical than usual of the Commission's texts. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that what we urgently need, and this is the gist of our support for the two European Parliament reports and the Myller report attached to them, is to change direction. Politically, we have three demands of Gothenburg. First, the European Council needs to endorse the Commission text without watering down the guidelines proposed by the Commission. Secondly, the Environment Council to be held a week after Gothenburg needs to take account of the demands of the European Parliament for the Sixth Framework Programme. Thirdly, the Belgian Presidency must be instructed in Gothenburg to take specific action on the guidelines decided in Gothenburg.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as economic aspects <span class="italic">per se</span> are concerned, the ECOFIN Council needs to revise the agenda. Subsidies for environmentally damaging production methods should be abolished and replaced by incentives for more environmentally-friendly production methods. We need environmental and social criteria for public procurement. On the question of indicators, the fact that the restricted list of indicators does not contain a single environmental criterion is intolerable. We also need to think about national accounts which integrate environmental data. </p>
<p class="contents">These are a few of the things we want to think about. We need the means to do so, however. We shall be watching to see, under the Belgian Presidency, if the European Council in Barcelona really will be the first European Council to integrate an environmental, social and economic strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Above all, I would like to highlight the requirements to limit road transport, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, remove harmful subsidies, change procurement regulations in favour of the environment and adapt the common agricultural policy.

<p class="contents">The question now is whether these concrete proposals will survive the European Council in Gothenburg.

I believe it can make a real contribution to changing this policy. I wish the Swedish Presidency luck with this.</p>

The PPE-DE will support the report. It contains important emphases for environmental policy. We are not, however, really in agreement with the wording on every point. In the matter of what it says about economic and social policy, in particular, it would have been good if we had had more time also to discuss them with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. If, for example, in item 32 we are calling for a minimum income and talking about access to essential services, that should not have its place in a report on environmental policy that has actually been prepared only by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but only after intensive discussion with the Social and Economic Committees.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret – and it was no doubt also due to pressure of time – that we have taken up only one point on the development policy aspects of sustainable development, because anyone who has looked into sustainable development and the Rio process knows that development policy is a key part of the entire issue. I think more could have been said about that. That is not, however, a recrimination, because it was simply difficult for Parliament to cover everything properly under such pressure of time.</p>
<p class="contents">One point in the report and in what Commission President Prodi said about sustainable development has caused quite a stir in Germany. It is found here in items 21 and 22 of this report. It concerns the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies, especially on coal. I personally believe that it must indeed be our aim in the long term to completely abolish environmentally harmful subsidies. However, I think we must be very cautious about specifying a date in the very near future. If the PSE Group is calling for an end to them before 2005 in its forthcoming report on the Sixth Environment Action Programme, that will lead to mass redundancies and then we will certainly not achieve the objective sustainably. I therefore believe we should clearly state the objective, there is no dissent about that, but we should also give thought to alternative employment...</p>

It is vital that this issue of sustainable development is placed high on the political agenda. It is a question partly of solidarity, that is, solidarity with coming generations and EU solidarity with poor regions and poor people, and partly of a global responsibility, of how the EU interacts with the rest of the world with regard to trade and development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable development concerns all policy areas. It is well known that it concerns transport policy, agricultural policy and energy policy, but it also concerns social policy. In this regard I do not share the views of the previous speaker. Social policy is also naturally part of sustainable development. Good social policy and fair economic policy are vital.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable development is also about a whole range of methods. It is not the case that the current methods of legislation are poor. The legislation must continue. The legislation we have in the EU must be implemented better. We must use tax instruments, which have often been emphasised by Parliament. The new approach is that we must integrate the ecological aspects of the Lisbon Process. The next time the Council gathers in the spring in Barcelona it is not only economic issues, social issues, issues of lifelong learning, issues of investment policy and industrial policy which must be addressed. The Council must also be a ‘Sustainability Council’ by ensuring that the ecological aspects are integrated into policy. The new strategy which is being developed, and which we in Parliament warmly support, is crucial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, my group supports these two reports wholeheartedly. Both show the necessity of integrating environmental policy, social policy and economic policy, if we are really to achieve sustainable development. However, this must happen <span class="italic">now </span>and not simply be a goal for the future. The Cardiff Process is good, but it is proceeding far too slowly. It is also very clear that a break in current trends is vital, to put it mildly. As Swedish Minister for the Environment Kjell Larsson says, what is needed now is political courage within all the institutions and in all areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s document on integrating environmental policy into economic policy states that there is no contradiction between economic growth and environmental protection. If this is the case, how can we explain the fact that increased production and increased consumption have eaten up all the environmental initiatives which we have so far carried out and are carrying out? Such a view does not fit in with the times. Therefore, economic development must be adapted to ecological requirements, otherwise there will be no sustainable development. We must all realise this.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal from the Verts/ALE adopted by the committee states that the adverse environmental impact resulting from some EU subsidies must be examined, particularly with regard to the current energy policy and common agricultural policy. They must simply be phased out. We cannot afford to keep them in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hulthén also mentions, as other people have also said, that the strategy must not only be for the EU but must also constitute a global starting point. Ten years after Rio, this really must be addressed...</p>

The Gothenburg Summit will try to provide an answer to these questions and will demonstrate the maturity and political capacity of our governments to deal with the challenge of a new order of peace and prosperity for the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">The first step consists of severing the link between economic growth and the intense use of resources and unwanted effects such as pollution. In this context, I believe that we should welcome the reports by Mrs Hulthén and Mr Blokland. To turn the European economy into the most competitive and dynamic economy, based on knowledge and not on the intensive use of resources, will require a better and greater use of market instruments in order to achieve greater levels of efficiency for our procedures and products, but will also require other factors to be taken into account simultaneously.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to eliminate forever the spectre of the loss of competitiveness or the threat of industrial conflict in Europe, we need more than ever, and urgently, to move ahead in a way which is uniform and coherent between all the Member States. It is even more important that we do so from a global point of view, by means of international agreements which resolve the legal and practical difficulties which face many of our legislative actions.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to establish realistic timetables which allow companies and society in general to adapt to the new market conditions and introduce the necessary reforms, thereby reducing the possibilities of unwanted effects if they are dealt with within too narrow a margin for manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I think it is essential, in order to successfully bring the process of change to a conclusion, to enjoy a broad social consensus which includes commitments with social operators and the gradual but firm replacement – of course – of the social values of the old order – based on the possession and accumulation of goods – with other values of a society which is ethically and civically more advanced, based on the enjoyment of the less materialistic aspects of life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Wealth, growth, enterprise and development need not, and do not, consume the environments of mature societies. On the contrary, it may be observed that there is a clear relationship between the quality of the environment and the wealth of a nation.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the EU and North America recent years have seen dramatic reversals in the pollution of air and water due to technological improvements driven by legislation and societal expectations. In the same period there have been profound increases in the extent and quantity of habitats and natural resources that are formally recognised and protected. The infrastructure, organisation and technology that are needed for a cleaner environment are all achievable because of the wealth and surpluses of the local economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Significant environmental pollution of air and water and the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources have become characteristic of the early stages of developing industrial economies, as they were once with us. Environmental protection requires surpluses, education and vision together with institutional maturity and stability. A strong lobby in favour of environmental protection is a good and necessary part of any mature democratic society.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be committed to ensuring the widest range of opinions and values, and that they are nurtured, expressed and considered because debate can only increase knowledge and improve the quality of decisions. Likewise, environmental orthodoxies must be constantly scrutinised and re-evaluated to ensure that the protection required is proportionate and effective. Environmental scaremongering hampers open debate by inflating a stateable risk, for example the presence of a toxin, so that it becomes an inaccurately perceived threat, for example by failing to acknowledge that the quantity of the toxin falls significantly below any threatening dose.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that great sensitivity, tolerance and compassion must be employed whenever it is proposed to employ the environmental standards of a developed economy to the economies and environments of emerging economies. The EU’s history has shown that localised overloading of environmental carrying capacity can be a temporary phase of an emerging economy. We need to acknowledge ...</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(SV) </span>Mr President, thank you for the various constructive contributions which we have heard. I would, of course, also like to join in congratulating Mrs Hulthén and Mr Blokland on their reports. It is right to discuss these two reports at the same time, as they definitely belong together.</p>
<p class="contents">It is remarkable to think that the concept of ‘sustainable development’ has been around for 15 years now and has been kept alive despite so many people criticising it over the years for being woolly, difficult to achieve in practice, difficult to establish practical results for, etc. However, it still no doubt offers us an opportunity to link together economic policy, environmental policy and social policy and not just to see the problems, but also the <span class="italic">opportunities</span> inherent in this concept. Therefore, it is important to develop indicators, as pointed out in the debate, and to follow this up in a sensible way. I believe we are just starting to develop effective indicators which, in the long term, may lead to new economic concepts in general, a sort of new definition, including a new economic definition. At the same time, we must of course continue to work on developing effective indicators and effective monitoring of developments.</p>
<p class="contents">It has felt as if we have been pressed for time, but I would like to say that we have received more than 100 written comments, all in plenty of time. Almost all environmental organisations, social organisations and even major <span class="italic">business </span>organisations have formulated their proposals and sent them to the Commission. We also looked extremely carefully at the proposal contained in the report by Mrs Hulthén.</p>
<p class="contents">In our proposal, we at the Commission have said that we naturally wish to ensure that this is a proposal <span class="italic">owned</span> jointly by many different stakeholders in society and that we will follow it up in such a way that we also consult various groups in society. In this context, Parliament will naturally also have an active role. It could be said that the Commission’s proposal for a strategy for sustainable development has remained the same during negotiations for this proposal. The priorities we established from the start have remained throughout, and the proposals along the way have reflected this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to comment on what has been said about the international perspective, for this is incredibly important. The Commission has said that we must continue to become still more practical and to follow up our views on how to act internationally. As such, it is important for us to set our own house in order, show how we will be addressing these issues and show leadership before we start telling the rest of the world what they should be doing. Of course, the global perspective must be present in everything we do. At the same time, our strategy for sustainable development also emphasises, as Mrs Paulsen pointed out, that we must ensure that we rid ourselves of inconsistent policies and subsidies which are actually not good for the environment and which are not favourable to sustainable development. I think this is clear in the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The next step is to address this at the European Council in Gothenburg. It is important to ensure that it is not watered down during this Summit, but that we can actually stick to a plan as ambitious as the Commission’s strategy and get all Member States to work to achieve it. I believe it is a good aim for the Belgian Presidency to follow up matters in the way described by Mr Jonckheer during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">As has also been mentioned in the debate, I think too that it makes sense to review the way the European Parliament and our own institutions must be changed so that we can live up to the ideal of sustainable development and create these links between economic and social issues and environmental issues. To this end, we in the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council will probably have to review our way of working so that it can become effective and so that we have a way of tackling cross-border issues rather than just looking narrowly at limited areas. It will be exciting when we now review policy in areas such as agriculture and fishing, transport and equal opportunities. This will be the moment of truth for us and for the EU as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">These were the most important comments, with the exception of the issue brought up by Mrs Corbey of the way implementation will be carried out. I would say that I have been clear from the beginning that we have good legislation, solid legislation, which was also the conclusion of the report on the Fifth Environment Action Programme. At the same time, we must also ensure that we implement this legislation. Therefore, it is important that we monitor implementation in this area too. It is no doubt possible to find further measures to strengthen the monitoring procedure, but the means already in place to ensure that Member States meet their obligations in line with the legislation must be strengthened. In addition, we must make it clearer for citizens of the EU how well Member States are doing. I believe this can help to put pressure on countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to comment on how we define sustainable development, as this was brought up in Mr Blokland’s report. The Commission’s strategy for sustainable development starts with a quotation from the Brundtland Commission report which contains a definition of sustainable development. The section containing this definition also addresses ways of combating poverty. This is naturally vital. I emphasise once again the significance of a global perspective, but if you have read the Brundtland Commission report carefully, you will see that our definition is correct. I believe it is important for us to keep to this definition as it is excellent and spells out our responsibility towards future generations, which is what it is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for this debate. Let us ensure that we can put these issues into practice.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Larsson,</span></span>   Council. – <span class="italic">(SV) </span>Mr President, I would like to comment on what has been said in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Several speakers have mentioned economic growth and its impact on the environment. There is a rather outdated view that economic growth always has an adverse impact on the environment. However, it has also been pointed out that poor economic development creates a major risk of damaging the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The term ‘decoupling’, that is, the importance of being able to separate the trends for economic development and those for environmental impact, is becoming increasingly central to environmental policy discussions. This is actually nothing new. We have been working on this for many decades without perhaps using this particular term.</p>
<p class="contents">I would put growth in the EU at around 30 percent over the past 10 years. At the same time emissions of greenhouse gases have fallen by 4 percent. This means that for every one million euros of production, emissions of greenhouse gases are approximately 55 percent lower. This shows that decoupling is already taking place. At the same time we must become even more successful and ensure that we achieve more than a marginal reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Emissions of NOx in Sweden per EUR 1 million of production is now down by approximately 60 percent. The equivalent figure for emissions of SOx is around 80 percent. These are two further examples of decoupling. Now we must redouble our efforts, including in areas where we currently see no reduction in environmental impact and where economic growth has been a contributory factor to this.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of subsidies and international costs has also been brought up by several speakers. As I said in my introduction, I regard this as a key issue with regard to environmental policy, now and in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">At a global level, it is actually quite amazing that we currently have subsidies which, according to some, amount to 200 billion dollars a year for non-sustainable energy, that is, fossil fuel. This is an incredibly large amount, which shows that instead of internalising the environmental costs, we are actually externalising them and redirecting them. Removing this type of subsidy and focusing on proper internalisation of environmental costs in prices must be a key element of EU and global development.</p>
<p class="contents">Biodiversity has also been mentioned here, and this is something close to my heart. I would like to point out that we have major problems with biodiversity here in Europe, something which far too few people are aware of. Something in the order of 55 percent of all species of bird are endangered, as are no less than 45 percent of butterfly species, to mention just two examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Our targets cannot simply be met by introducing Natura 2000 areas, although this is an important part of our nature conservation policy. We also need environmental issues to be integrated into the common agricultural policy. Many of the endangered species are dependent on a small-scale agricultural landscape which is currently disappearing. It is vital that we prevent this from being repeated in the new countries which we hope will become members of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not just a matter of integrating this approach into the common agricultural policy. The same must be done with the common fisheries policy. The condition of marine biodiversity is in fact much worse than that of biodiversity on land. The marine ecosystem around our coasts is in crisis. If EU citizens could see what we are actually doing to our seabed and sea water and the effects this has on biodiversity, there would probably be an environmental revolution in the EU. It is therefore also important to integrate the environment into the common fisheries policy and to see marine ecosystems as vital elements of the biodiversity we must work to preserve.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Jonckheer also pointed out that the sectoral approach directly opposes environmental policy in the EU. It is exactly this which we will be putting right through sectoral integration. I also agree with Mrs Schörling that this is proceeding too slowly. I therefore hope that, based on the Presidency’s synthesis report, the European Council in Gothenburg will be able to draw up clear guidelines for continued work on sectoral integration. I believe, Mr President, that these comments will suffice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
