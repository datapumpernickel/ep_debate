<p class="contents">Despite the progress made over recent years, these negotiations have been in deadlock since October 2004. At that point, it was considered that the offers of the two parties did not allow our high ambitions for that agreement to be achieved. At the ministerial meeting in Lisbon in October, the Ministers decided to take the time to reflect on how to relaunch the process.</p>
<p class="contents">In January 2005, Presidents Barroso and Lulla da Silva met in Davos. The two Presidents stressed the strategic importance they attach to an association agreement between the European Union and Mercosur. We should remember that the negotiations began with an ambitious, indeed strategic, objective: to construct a strong alliance between the two blocks, which have much in common, including parallel visions of the international order. The two Presidents agreed that, if we wished to make progress with the negotiations on the commercial aspects, they should be based on the best offers exchanged at that point by the two partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of restarting the negotiations on the basis of the best offers was largely taken up and supported by all the European Union and Mercosur negotiators at the EU-Mercosur Business Forum in February. A technical meeting took place on 21 and 22 March to prepare for the ministerial meeting that was to restart the negotiations. At that meeting, Mercosur refused to confirm the best offers exchanged. It expressed the view that they would be too favourable to the European Union and that confirming them would increase the supposed imbalance. Our objective is to convince Mercosur to allow the negotiations to progress quickly. This is essential, in fact, since certain Mercosur partners could be tempted to focus exclusively on the negotiations within the WTO and then to finalise a bi-regional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, I would like to point out that we entirely disagree with Mercosur’s view that the offers on the table are too favourable to the European Union. Firstly, with regard to access to the market, the Union’s offer is the most generous ever made in terms of the products it covers and the timetable for dismantling tariffs. In particular, the Union’s offer on agricultural products is the most substantial that has ever been made in any bilateral agreement. Secondly, in relation to rules, Mercosur has refused to make an offer on public contracts or to include a chapter on intellectual property rights. It has refused to accept the principle of appropriate protection of the European Union’s geographical indications. As for Mercosur’s offer on services, it does not even consolidate the current level of liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, we believe that only a ministerial meeting would allow the dialogue to be relaunched. The preparations for this meeting are underway. To this end, we are maintaining close contacts with our Mercosur partners. Our efforts are essentially focused on the stage reached by the technical preparations and Mercosur’s level of commitment to substantial discussions, since our ambition at this stage is to prevent a downwards spiral and to avoid jeopardising the progress already made.</p>
<p class="contents">Our partners, in particular Mr Amorin, the Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs, have repeated publicly on several occasions that Mercosur wished to keep all the options open, including therefore the bi-regional negotiations with the European Union and the Free Trade Area of the Americas Agreement, while making the negotiations within the WTO their main priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective, therefore, is to seek to maintain a communication channel until our partners have a sufficiently clear picture of the potential results of the negotiations within the WTO. The Commission remains committed to putting these negotiations back on track, with the aim of reaching an ambitious and balanced agreement. To this end, we hope that a ministerial meeting will take place before the end of July. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Charles Tannock, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> It gives me great pleasure to speak on behalf of my Group, and I pay especial tribute to the work of my colleague, Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, who is unable to be present tonight, and who is a renowned expert on EU-Latin America trade and political relations.</p>
<p class="contents">At times, it is very difficult for someone such as myself, interested in global trade patterns, to monitor the number of different bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations going on all the time outside the framework of the Doha Round of the WTO – which, I hope, will ultimately make such biregional deals redundant in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, in Latin America the EU has successful free-trade agreements with Chile, in the shape of an association agreement – which also enables additional close political cooperation and key human rights and democracy commitments by both parties – but also a similar agreement with Mexico. However, being itself from inception a regional customs union, it makes sense for the EU, wherever possible, to negotiate with other multilateral customs unions elsewhere in the world and to draw up regional free-trade agreements in preference to a whole series of bilateral agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">One such major bloc is Mercosur, consisting of four Latin American countries – Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay – with Chile and Bolivia having associative status. Mercosur’s fortunes have waxed and waned in recent years over the imbalances in trade between Argentina and Brazil in particular – a matter constantly under criticism from Argentina, which last September proposed to Brazil a safeguard clause to which Brazil refuses to agree. Mercosur has traditionally been designed to deal in trade between the large industrial conglomerates, not the SMEs in the region, which feel disadvantaged by this deal.</p>
<p class="contents">Argentina also objects to the confusion over the Brazilian initiative last December to create a South American community of nations, which was important recently in supporting Brazil’s role in stabilising Ecuador, as Argentina believes that Mercosur needs to be reinforced before that happens.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the tricky issue of the desire of Portuguese-speaking Brazil to have a seat on the UN Security Council to enhance its regional superpower political ambitions. Argentina instead suggests the seat could rotate to give room for all the South American countries, mainly Spanish-speaking, to express their opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, Mercosur had problems negotiating a deal with the EU – particularly because, Mercosur alleged, Pascal Lamy, the then Commissioner, came from France, which is amongst the most protectionist of countries in terms of agriculture – chiefly regarding Mercosur’s desire to gain access for its agricultural products, which our EU farming sector finds threatening. Brazil is a huge soya bean producer and Argentina a producer of wheat and beef, as well as of fresh fruits, etc. In turn, Mercosur is unhappy about giving tariff-free access to EU industrial goods, as Brazil, in particular, is highly developed in the heavy industry sector. Curiously, Mercosur is simultaneously negotiating with countries like South Korea and with other multilateral blocs, like the proposed agreement this week with the Gulf Cooperation Council, as the leaders of Latin America are meeting tomorrow in Brasilia with the Heads of Government of the Arab League.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that President Lula da Silva of Brazil and President Kirchner of Argentina are still jostling for power to see who is perceived as the principal interlocutor with the United States of America ahead of President Bush’s visit.</p>
<p class="contents">Mercosur appears still to hope that the Free Trade Area of the Americas will come to pass even though the USA has little appetite for it, preferring instead advantageous bilateral deals with individual Latin American republics, as it already has a very successful and cosy set-up in NAFTA with Mexico and Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have outlined, the situation is complex, and I disagree with the recent allegations from Mr D’Alema on the other side of the House, who accuses Commissioner Mandelson, who I believe will be the main player in the negotiations, of lack of interest in the region or in securing a deal. I look forward to hearing how Commissioner Mandelson will bring this project forward after the breakdown last October, as it would appear to me there is no real political will on Mercosur’s side. I would be interested to have a fuller explanation from the Commissioner on how we could bring them back to the negotiating table. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Please allow me, Commissioner, to address my comments and questions to you in my capacity as a member of this Parliament’s Committee on International Trade and of its Delegation for Relations with Mercosur, which will be on an official visit to Brazil next week.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the standstill in the negotiations last autumn — that you have mentioned — and their subsequent hibernation, I am delighted to see that the Commission is making every possible effort to reach an agreement. Nevertheless — and you have mentioned this as well — I am concerned about the possible tensions that may arise between those negotiations and the Doha Round negotiations, which I believe to be the Union’s main priority in terms of its trade policy, particularly with a view to the Ministerial Conferences in Hong Kong in December of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Could you go into a little more depth — and you have already mentioned this — about the reciprocity of the two different negotiation processes? At the beginning of the negotiations it was emphasised that the Association Agreement would be based upon what is agreed in the WTO. My question is how the results of the Association Agreement negotiations will be incorporated if they are concluded before December. As far as I can see, it is going to be difficult, but if they are concluded, how will this be done?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask you three very brief questions: what solution is on the table to deal with the differences over the lack of reciprocity between the free movement of agricultural products requested by Mercosur and our demands for the opening up of its market, with a view to achieving the free movement of services, particularly in the field of telecommunications and financial services?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, how do you intend to reconcile access to our market for developing countries with the protection of our fisheries and agri-food industry sectors?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, could you give us a brief assessment of the Commission’s cooperation and technical assistance programmes for the institutional development of Mercosur with a view to greater sub-regional integration at political and economic level? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In both these problematic processes – the Mercosur negotiations and the question of how these can rationally be tied in with the ongoing WTO negotiations – we need to make sensible strategic plans, particularly as regards the timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the difficulties that we came up against in the negotiations last year and the fact that neither we nor the Commission have yet managed to resolve them, I do wonder how you think you will manage, by the end of the year, to organise a proper timetable and to extract more substantial concessions than have been made so far. As Mr Moreno Sánchez has already said: how, in fact, do you intend to establish a link between these negotiations, not least in terms of the resources at your disposal? I think both sets of negotiations are enormously demanding and complex, and the whole business strikes me as very difficult. Hence the question as to whether it might perhaps be more intelligent and more rational to provide for more time and more leeway in the negotiations, particularly in view of Dr Tannock’s argument that there are, quite simply, a lot of political power games being played here and that the negotiations between Brazil and Argentina are very complicated indeed, not to mention those with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, then, that the big issue is whether we actually have to keep to the timetable that has been laid down, or whether it might be smarter to consider another one. My second question has to do with the texts. I have read that you want to organise a major round of talks with ministers, which will then achieve a breakthrough. That is a good way of going about it; it is always important to get the backing of political leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me, though, that – rather as with negotiations involving the United States and the rest of the world – you, the Commission, are concentrating too much on governments and very often ignoring the parliaments. That is something we, over and over again, have had cause to deplore. Here, too, it might be appropriate to make use of the bodies that we have for this purpose – after all, this House does cooperate with those in the Mercosur countries. Our giving political back-up may perhaps seem difficult, but why should it not be given consideration as a means of stimulating greater political willingness, and also to send the message to the political leadership in each country that parliamentarians want to support negotiations of this sort? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For the time being, in reply to Mrs Mann, it is clear that Parliament’s role is of key importance. This is the reason why the Commission is funding exchanges; I am thinking for example of the Parliamentary Delegation for Relations with Mercosur. We would therefore view it as very positive if, on their coming visit to those countries, the honourable Members, within the context of their competences, could take things in hand. The problem is that if we want more WTO, it would be better to wait until the WTO is operating in its present form before forging ahead. That is precisely the conflict between the countries that want to move ahead bilaterally as quickly as possible and others that want to wait for a WTO decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I have nothing to add to the Commission statement that I made as an introduction to this debate, apart perhaps from the following elements. It is important that, when they visit Mercosur, the honourable Members are aware that the latter is defensive about the majority of the issues of interest to the European Union: industrial tariffs, services, investments, geographical indications and public contracts. The European Union’s agricultural offer, for example, amounting to EUR 2.7 billion, is the largest ever made within the context of bilateral negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the proposals already on the table, we believe that there is an imbalance in favour of Mercosur. I shall give you some examples. The Union’s offer on liberalisation of the trade in goods is more generous than that of Mercosur in terms of the products it covers, the dismantling of tariffs and the timetable for that dismantling. The offer relating to access to Mercosur’s market in services remains unsatisfactory in a number of key sectors of interest to the European Union, such as financial services, maritime transport and telecommunications. The Union’s specific demands relating to services, investment and public contracts are not aimed at achieving broader access to the market – in practice, Mercosur’s market is already entirely open – but at reaching an agreement on rules providing legal security for our operators in the region. In fact, Mercosur has specifically refused to make an offer on rules of this type relating to public contracts, intellectual property and European Union geographical indications – an extremely sensitive issue for countries such as Spain, Italy and France in relation to wines and spirits.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, the Commission is available to the honourable Members to provide them, before their mission begins, with all the information they will need in order to help establish, under the best possible conditions and as quickly as possible, a balanced relationship between these two regions of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
