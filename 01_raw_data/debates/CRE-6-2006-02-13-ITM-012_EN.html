<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gunnar Hökmark (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, the roadmap for State aid reform from the Commission is a good and an important document. I hope that this report will contribute to the improvement of the State aid policy. Therefore, I should like to thank colleagues and shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this improvement by the amendments and discussions we have had in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I hope there will be, as there was in the committee, broad support for this new policy, which I hope will make an impact on the future guidelines on State aid policy that the Commission will be responsible for. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Europe needs a competitive economy. As we say over and over again, we need new businesses, new jobs, new products and new markets. It is, therefore, also important to follow these matters up by ensuring that new, small companies operate under basic conditions as good as those under which old, large companies operate. Experience of various kinds teaches us that State aid always tends to safeguard old, existing companies at the expense of new and growing companies.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look around at the European economy, as well as at the international economy, we see very clearly that the new companies and the new products have emerged not through State aid but through the existence of sound basic conditions for businesses and individual entrepreneurs. Each type of State aid that distorts competition always tends to distort it at the expense of what is new and growing and to the advantage of what is old. This is therefore an issue that, to the highest degree, is about how we are to obtain new jobs and new businesses. A policy of State aid whereby we preserve businesses that are not very competitive, together with old products and low wages, will contribute to Europe lagging behind. However, a policy that aims for less State aid and at removing such State aid as distorts competition and that, moreover, invests resources in innovation and research will be able to produce a different outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In European history, we have a lot to learn from a whole range of different experiences where State aid is concerned. In my report, I write that the Commission needs carefully to monitor and analyse these experiences, as well as the good experiences there are, because the objective of State aid is often popular and generally approved of. The problem is simply that the results of it are rarely what one had imagined they would be. As a consequence, we end up with old structures and with a dependency on subsidies, and we do not produce new jobs. We have seen this within the shipbuilding and steel industries and within a great many other sectors. Where State aid is introduced, renewal and transformation go out of the window. We must ensure that the opposite situation comes about.</p>
<p class="contents">An overarching objective of the report is to follow up the general aim not only of reducing State aid but also, as stated clearly in the report and still more clearly in the Commission’s document, of removing such State aid as distorts competition. A further objective is to ensure that those rules that exist are made clearer, for the aim must be to follow up the demand for less State aid. What is required is that State aid be predictable. It must not be possible for it to be used for relocations. The rules governing State aid must be generally applicable. The aid must not have a specific focus, but be directed across the board and not favour one company at the expense of another. That is extremely important when we debate innovation, for innovation policy must not be an excuse for increased State aid but be designed to create better basic conditions for innovation. The same applies to companies in the public interest. We must not have State aid that funds that type of activity excessively, but must give new companies opportunities to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">The same may be said of regional or environmental aid. It must be directed across the board and so made open and accessible to all. If we ensure that this happens and follow up the demands for increased scrutiny and transparency, better rendering of accounts and more stringent auditing, we shall lay the basis for a State aid policy that entails less State aid, and such State aid as there is will no longer distort competition. There will, however, be increased resources for innovation, a cleaner environment and thriving regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a pleasure to take part in the discussion about the report on the State Aid Action Plan prepared by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I can assure you that, after your remarks, it is an even greater pleasure. As has been said, it is of fundamental importance to handle State aid in the correct way. If it is not handled in the correct way, it is an instrument which, instead of providing a solution, can have the opposite effect. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his clear and balanced report.</p>
<p class="contents">I greatly appreciate the interest and involvement of the European Parliament in the process of reforming the rules of State aid. This is – as has been mentioned before – a crucial project. It is a high priority for me during this term in office. You may remember that the consultation on State aid reform was launched here in Strasbourg last June. Today, again, Strasbourg is the place where we are continuing the debate and, hopefully, will come to a conclusion as to which direction we can go with the review. I am happy to say that the consultation on State aid reform will be completed with your report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has received many comments on the State Aid Action Plan, from many different stakeholders across Europe. For me, your comments are an essential complement to what I have heard from elsewhere in Europe. I am very pleased that Parliament, like the great majority of stakeholders, is supportive, in general, of the Commission’s plans.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not repeat the content of the reform programme, which was touched upon by the rapporteur. In the spirit of the Lisbon Strategy, we want State aid reform to help Member States get the best value for money by focusing state resources on measures that will contribute to sustainable economic growth and to more and better jobs for the future. State aid is taxpayers’ money, so we need to take into account that we can explain it to those who want it and those who obtain it. We also want to improve the procedures and administration of State aid policy, as was rightly touched upon by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">One important message in the report is the need for legal certainty. I fully share the concern that, if we are not successful in making that legal certainty visible, then we will have failed. The Commission will explain further how it intends to use economics for State aid policy. Market failure is not a magic word; it is, rather, a methodology to analyse the problems within markets. I agree with the report’s focus on the need for transparency of aid. On services of general economic interest, the Commission has no competence to interpret the jurisprudence. Nevertheless – I got your message, Mr President! – the Commission will try to give guidance when adopting decisions on individual cases in this field.</p>

<p class="contents">In its document, the Commission correctly indicates that State aid is an important factor in ensuring homogenous regional development, thereby strengthening one of the fundamental economic pillars of the European Union. I would like to take this opportunity to raise the issue of regional bonuses. It seems to me that in striving to attain the Lisbon Agenda parameters it would be logical to invest more in regions that are lagging behind, otherwise we risk creating only advanced, competitive enclaves that will inevitably be held back by the depressed areas, thus preventing the all-round growth of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would like to emphasise the need to simplify procedures and to make the whole system of State aid provision transparent. Maximum transparency should be applied rigorously to the process of allocating and approving State aid. All persons and entities applying for aid in support of their activities must feel sure, in the event that they are turned down, that it was for objective reasons. Similarly, they must be informed about who has been granted aid, and why. This will generate a spirit of trust, and will enable citizens to have faith that the EU system is functioning in a uniform way.</p>
<p class="contents">National governments are important elements that can either support or disrupt this system. If they are given more responsibility for taking decisions on State aid provision, their decisions and activities must be subject to the transparency of the entire system. I hope, Mr President, that we will all be able to conclude, following the reform of State aid provision, that the system really has been improved, and that it will contribute in a clearly objective manner to the uniform development of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the general philosophy, I agree that, since State aid is a form of competition policy aimed at creating an even playing field amongst the different companies, we should insist not just on aid that takes the form of subsidies and which therefore belongs in the public spending chapter, but also on those fiscal incentives that do not respond to the nature of the tax, but which respond to the desire to stimulate certain activities in geographical areas, that is to say the same intention as direct aid.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to research, development and innovation, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur in particular on the extension of the scope of beneficiaries, to expressly include universities amongst the possible beneficiaries of this kind of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate him — and I am now addressing the Commissioner — on his comments in the field of risk capital. If one thing explains the differences in growth between the United States and Europe, it is dynamism, the power of its small and medium-sized companies, not so much in terms of net birth rate, which is more or less the same, but in terms of US small businesses’ greater capacity for growth in the first two years, which requires a degree of funding. And in the field of risk capital we are a long way behind. If my figures are accurate, while risk capital represents 0.45% of United States GDP, European risk capital is less than 0.14%.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of regional aid – my final point – I would also stress what Mr Koterec has said, but I would like to add an aspect that has not been mentioned: it would not make sense also to take State aid away from regions that stop receiving Structural Funds as a result of natural growth, and not just for statistical reasons, as the rapporteur has said. If the Commissioner will allow me, therefore, I would like to correct paragraph 36 on this issue, to include regions losing funds for statistical reasons and those that lose them through natural growth.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gilles Savary, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PSE Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Gunnar Hökmark, and all of our fellow Members. We are in fact dealing here with a non-legislative report, and I believe that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has done a good job in terms of voicing the European Parliament’s strong position. On the whole, we have managed to end up with a fairly clear outlook on things.</p>
<p class="contents">I am one of those who believe, along with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, that we do in fact need to review the State aid system. This system is more than ever at the heart of the Commission’s powers, since Europe remains essentially a Europe of the internal market and competition until further notice. I am not sure whether the ‘No’ vote in the French referendum offers other prospects for the long-term future. We are therefore truly at the heart of Community powers here, and it is true that, with the enlargement of Europe, the European Union and the Commission are at risk of thrombosis if the State aid system and arrangements are left in their current state.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has above all stressed that the internal market and competition should not be regarded as representing every aspect of European society. We are not just a market society; there must, as the texts stipulate, also be room for public action, not only on all those occasions when the market is failing, but also on all those occasions when we need to reduce social or territorial inequalities, manage external effects, promote innovation and, should the need arise, give a boost to industry. When, at times, we shift to a free market way of thinking, we sometimes find ourselves wondering: ‘Would we be in a position today to build the <span class="italic">Airbus</span> or would we be in a position to build the <span class="italic">Ariane</span> rocket, given the dominant ideology?’ I believe that we must retain this opportunity to intervene very forcefully in the industrial landscape and in public research.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to the Commissioner that the main contribution of Parliament is to ensure that State aid is not assessed as something merely to be borne but, rather, is assessed in a balanced way, that is to say that not only are the negative aspects, such as distortions of competition, considered, but so too are the positive effects. We, in the European Parliament, wanted the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality to be clearly applied and, more specifically, wanted State aid that has no obvious impact on the internal market to be considered as compensation. We also wanted market failures to be better understood.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention the issues that still need to be discussed and that are referred to in the 21 amendments tabled. With regard to public services, we need clarification on those aspects to do with compensation, with the legitimate funding of public services and with subsidiary funding and, above all, we need clarification on what constitutes the fourth criterion set out in the <span class="italic">Altmark </span>judgment, a criterion that, by the Commission’s own admission, is actually extremely vague and very difficult to handle.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to innovation, Mrs in 't Veld will soon present us with her report. We believe that it is a very good text and we hope to enhance it. The question that must be asked concerns the scope of the report: should it be strictly confined to innovation, or should it branch out a little further into the area of research and development? With regard to the regions, some excellent amendments are focused on preventing relocations from being funded by State aid. This is an extremely serious problem because it gives Europeans the impression that they are being pitted against one another, and this in terms, furthermore, of the amount received by way of public subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to conclude by saying that we are obviously totally in favour of State aid being considered in the framework of the Lisbon Process and the Gothenburg Process, that is to say not only in terms of the knowledge-based economy, but also in terms of helping the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

State support should be a last resort and is not a panacea. Although it may be presented in that way from time to time, it also has adverse side effects.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we can be open-handed in granting state support only after all pre-conditions and our other items of policy have been complied with, or else we would end up fighting a running battle. We must, for example, ensure that the internal market is completed and functions well and in that respect, I hope that this House will be taking a sensible decision on Thursday with regard to the services directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We must counter protectionism, promote fair competition, abolish red tape and excessive legislation, guarantee better access to risk capital and also establish an internal market for financial services, but at the same time, we must put in place such things as truly free movement for workers from all EU Member States and an immigration policy that is geared towards keeping the brightest and best, our top people, in Europe rather than chasing them away to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Only when those things are in place can we see whether we might be able to intervene with State aid where the market is inefficient, for we are not so much dealing with market failure as we are with market inefficiencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to repeat that State aid should, in principle, not be sanctioned. It disrupts the market and distorts competition. Mr Savary said a moment ago that the EU has a tendency to be too liberal, but I should like to draw Mr Savary’s attention to the fact that we spend billions on State aid each year. Even by the most conservative estimates, the amounts involved are more or less half of the EU’s budget, so that is not terribly liberal in my view. Things could be a bit more liberal as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with what Mr Savary said a moment ago: we must set aside State aid for the priorities of the twenty-first century: the Lisbon objectives, innovation, knowledge, sustainability …</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I think that we should give far less State aid to obsolete and obsolescent industries, and as far as State aid for environmental objectives is concerned, I think we should first set to abolishing the billions of State aid we grant the many polluting industries and sectors that make use of sources of non-renewable energy, and I will therefore advise my group to support Mr Lipietz’s amendments to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Global context is also important in the debate. We cannot deny, of course, that in other parts of the world, liberal amounts of State aid are still being given out. That much we should recognise, but our objective to reduce State aid remains intact.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say a few words on public services. I should like to repeat – and I am increasingly feeling like a voice in the wilderness in this respect – that the phrases ‘services of general interest’ and ‘services of general economic interest’ have still not been defined, and it is, in that light, very odd to legislate for them. That is just by the by.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Savary mentioned a moment ago, legal certainty and clarity are urgently needed for those public services.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by asking the Commission to submit, at the earliest opportunity, an assessment of the impact which the rules that the Commission adopted last year had on State aid as compensation for public services. I would like to know the amount of State aid involved, the number of companies involved and what impact this had on the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true to say that Europe is competitive only if it is also innovative in the ways in which it protects the environment. I think it would be a good thing if there were a bonus not only for innovation, but also, and primarily, for environmental information, and I think it regrettable that this is absent from the Commissioner’s draft.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, one important feature of the report is the fact that the de minimis rules really must be applied to businesses with at least EUR 200 000 per annum. I have to say, Commissioner, that they are very generalised, and that is not enough. We know that these businesses are needed in rural areas if they are to enjoy the most basic economic development, just as we know that the regions affected by population change need businesses to settle in them, and if they are to do that they will need State aid. There is no other way in which we can counteract such effects, and so I think it is important that there should be a marked increase in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me turn to the rules for businesses providing services of general interest. It is not acceptable that such rules should qualify the Altmark ruling, for the risk then arises of the Commission using competition rules as a means of defining what general interest actually means – the very same thing that you are trying to do by means of the services directive, that controversial document in which you sacrifice general interest on the altar of the free market.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need, then – and urgently, too – is a framework directive, even if you do not see yourself as having that responsibility, and we need one in this instance because we want the social Europe to stand on secure foundations, one of the most fundamental of which is services of general interest, and the public will turn their backs on Europe if these become the victim of rules on competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means less State aid for grass-roots needs and servicing of the competitiveness of European capital. In other words, the people's money will be not for grass-roots prosperity, but for the profitability of capital.</p>
<p class="contents">The references to State aid for purposes of general interest and in the public good at European Union level not only demonstrate indifference to the asymmetrical development between the Member States, but also prejudge that such a procedure will further strengthen this asymmetrical development by increasing inequality and injustice.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital, they say, to reduce State aid, in order for it to have positive results. Do remote rural and island areas, such as those in my country, in which capital does not invest because there is no or little profit, really have to be abandoned completely, including by State aid, and be laid to waste? They are already being abandoned, to a degree, and it looks like this will intensify in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Public services are being privatised, basic grass-roots needs are being commercialised. The reduction in State aid and its orientation towards servicing the anti-grass roots Lisbon Strategy will exacerbate still further the situation of the grass-roots classes. Despite the reference to the financing of small- and medium-sized enterprises for investments, unfortunately the evidence shows that, so far, economic aid for small businesses has been non-existent or has been dispensed with a dropper. By contrast, for big business there has been open-handedness and it is big business that benefits and, with today's proposals, will be strengthened even more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At an exhibition in Brussels put on by the Dutch Presidency, it was predicted that another ten poor European countries will be joining the EU by 2022: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and Ukraine. West Germany’s experience in pouring almost a thousand billion euro into East Germany shows what it costs to try to create a level playing field for a poor neighbour. The cost of giving State aid to all of these new Member States will be astronomical.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently the EU is spending over half its budget on State aid. Britain is far from rich as it is. We are being told that our government cannot afford to pay us a decent pension unless we work until we are 70. Our health service is seriously under funded and our navy, which is a fraction of the size it once was, can hardly afford to pay for the fuel it needs to go to sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us stop this crazy idea now before the so-called rich Member States end up totally impoverished. Instead, why do we not help to improve the economies of our European neighbours and of Third World countries by opening up free trade opportunities to them?

I therefore question whether a further assault on State aid is justified in pursuit of the failing Lisbon Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the specific issue I wish to focus on is regional aid. I welcome the fact that the present regional aid guidelines, as they affect my constituency of Northern Ireland, are a marked improvement from earlier drafts, and that the Commission has listened to representations from myself and others. The new draft guidelines provide for continued distinctive treatment of Northern Ireland as an economic development region and therefore allow ongoing aid to attract inward foreign investment on a reducing scale through to 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Having to compete with a 12.5% corporation tax south of the border in Ireland, the capacity for Northern Ireland to give aid to attract foreign investment is absolutely indispensable. It is exactly such local realities that the Commission needs to reflect more and more on the implementation of what is too often rigid dogma on State aid and indeed on other policies affecting the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commissioner’s contribution also gave great cause for hope.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of policy on State aid is enormously important to people at the local level, where the towns, boroughs and regions are the main sources of public investments. As has already been said, their municipal enterprises play an important part in guaranteeing the provision of services of general interest, and so it is important that the Commission should – as it has already agreed to do – announce how it proposes to implement the criteria set out in the ECJ’s ruling in the Altmark case. If legal disputes are to be avoided, those who will have to apply these criteria must have a clear idea of what the Commission’s policy is. The more concrete the Altmark criteria are, the more difficult they are to implement, and the individual public offices cannot be expected to get to grips with the fundamental principle and determine for themselves whether or not aid has been granted on the basis of the avoidance of overcompensation using market compensations; to do so would involve them in a quite unjustifiable amount of bureaucracy. The local offices could, though, be enabled to do that if – as has indeed already been announced – they had access to workable guidelines with which, for example, they could determine which market was relevant. I am glad that the Committee, under Mr Hökmark’s guidance, has turned its attention to the non-inclusion of public SMEs in the definition of SMEs, and I also welcome the conclusion it has come to regarding that.</p>
<p class="contents">Public undertakings meet the public’s needs where they are, and the public regard them as their own property. By supporting communal public undertakings in their work rather than making it more difficult, the EU will go up even further in the public’s estimation, and so I would encourage the House to continue pressing for the definition of SME to include communal public undertakings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that it is once again thanks to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that we have managed, with a very liberal Swedish perspective and at the same time a Socialist French perspective, to achieve a good outcome after all.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast to my Dutch fellow Member, Mrs in ’t Veld, I will not make a case for less State aid. In my view, this ‘less is more’ mind-set is not the most important dimension. What matters is for what purpose and how this State aid is deployed. State aid should not only be seen as a deviation or aberration from perfect market forces, but as an instrument for achieving socio-economic objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be welcomed that the current Commissioner for Competition also sees her portfolio in such a broader economic context, to include the Lisbon strategy, for this strategy is not just about economic, but also about broader socio-economic effects. This socio-economic context and this additional perspective of employment and social cohesion are also the very aspects I should like to stress on behalf of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, in this context, like to mention two points in respect of which I would ask you not to be too dogmatic in your approach.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, with regard to market failure, it is important to look at the bigger picture in that area too, and to take full account of employment and social cohesion. The other point is the temporary nature of State aid. Here too, I would ask you to allow for some degree of flexibility, because some sectors might well need government subsidies and government instruments in the longer term – national radio and television spring to mind. The importance of plurality of the press and a good balance in the provision of information may require longer-term investments of government funds into sectors of that kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Public housing is another example. Given the interests of town and country planning, the integration of minorities and social integration in cities, certain players within the market may well be granted government support in order to achieve those broader objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the European and national dimensions, I should like to point out, as indeed Mr Hökmark did in his report, that State aid can be used from time to time to stir up policy competition between Member States, and I should like to ask the Commission to keep an eye on this and to monitor this more closely, and to check whether it is the Member States themselves and not just the companies that are granted State aid that have to have sanctions imposed on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we take Gothenburg seriously, it makes sound business sense to rely on the equilateral triangle between economic, social and environmental development, but the statement is flawed in economic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">If Mr Hökmark – as he himself is right to say – wants small and medium-sized enterprises to be efficient and innovation to be driven forward, above all by subsidy, then what is needed alongside that is good training, good education, and the right infrastructure – not just in the great conurbations, but also, of course, in rural areas. He is therefore forced back onto the need for territorial, social and environmental cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">If not, the simple fact is that people who live in places without these favourable and natural conditions are put at a disadvantage. That being so, I do indeed urge that a great deal of care be taken when considering where aid is to be applied, and it also has to be considered whether services in the public interest benefit from it, or else there is no point to it.</p>
<p class="contents">In one respect, I can tell Mr Hökmark that he is absolutely right. He writes that it makes no sense to give aid to businesses that are already profitable, and in that I agree with him.</p>
<p class="contents">When I say that that sort of aid is wrong, I am thinking of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the highly-profitable motor industry into which money is shovelled, only for the firms to then close down and take production elsewhere with the help of more subsidies. That cannot be what aid is for. In that respect, Mr Hökmark, you have got it absolutely right.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a whole load of models that we have to change. The <span class="italic">de minimis</span> threshold is the right one. It is indeed the case that regional aid is needed for the more backward regions in particular, and it cannot be denied that aid under Article 87 will continue to be needed for those regions currently affected by the statistical effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that the administrative aspects of the procedure ought to be simplified, too. I strongly agree that we should increase the transparency of assistance. I also agree that a clearer regulation should be developed, especially in the area of public services. Transparency is also needed to make it clear who may be granted government assistance. Therefore the provision of assistance should be accompanied by the publication of a detailed list of those who are granted assistance, specifying the amounts received by each of them, especially in the case of agricultural allocations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to call attention to the fact that while, on the one hand, I agree that there should not be any discrimination between regions or countries as regards assistance, on the other hand we must acknowledge that there are significantly underdeveloped countries and regions within the internal market. However, these countries – precisely in the interest of deepening the internal market – need a longer period of adaptation. It would not be fortunate if the debate on government assistance provided an opportunity for political attacks against the new Member States. These new Member States have already reduced their assistance significantly. These levels of assistance are not outstanding even when compared to their GDP, and they are lower than those of the more developed Member States in the most relevant comparison terms of euro/capita. This must also be taken into consideration when new Member States are accused in other areas, for instance of tax dumping. Also, it would not be fortunate if someone were to make a connection between government and European Union assistance and the delocation of companies, especially when new Member States are still in a negative transition period as regards structural funds or direct payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from defined regional assistance, the aim is indeed to assist investments that create jobs in underdeveloped, competitively disadvantaged regions. We are not aiming at introducing an approach that would drive investors away from the European Union. Therefore maintaining well-targeted, but moderate assistance could be both justified and useful, without distorting competition. This is already forecasted in the Directives concerning regional assistance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too wish to join my colleagues in thanking Mr Hökmark for all the excellent work he has done to enable this report to be finalised today. The subject of State aid is one on which there is definitely a lot of room for discussion. This is because it directly concerns all 25 Member States. It is good to ask where we want the reform to take us and to see what has led to the need for this kind of reform. When the preliminary decisions taken by the Commission between February 2004 and the present day are examined thoroughly and compared with the Lisbon Strategy and the conclusions of the 2002 Barcelona European Summit, it is evident that it would be much more productive if State aid were more direct and designed to meet these same objectives. Thus, I think that we should work towards having a system that is as simple as possible and, therefore, more effective and more transparent. This will be an indispensable instrument because it will eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy that, until now, has not only led to more money being wasted but has prevented State aid from bringing about progress and made it less suited to the purpose for which it was intended. We need better to protect the use of State aid so that funds are delivered to where they are needed and not, as previously used to happen, squandered to no good purpose. We have to reach a position where the State has clear aims, involving the proportionality principle, concerning where it wants to use its aid. We must not forget that these funds are subsidised by all taxpayers, so we want them to be used wisely and responsibly so that they are more productive and their effects still more keenly felt. We must not forget companies that have logistical problems as a result of being based in disadvantaged regions, for example companies on an island such as Gozo. Once again, I wish to thank our rapporteur for his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since it provides a particular advantage and differentiated treatment, its establishment required stricter justification than other alternatives and it needed to be drawn up in a careful manner in order to guarantee that it is effective and consistent with the Union’s policies and objectives, as well as its international commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of State aid for the period 2005-2009 must bear in mind that, even when regional aid contributes to true convergence, there are great internal differences in income and opportunities amongst the regions of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of the Hökmark report is well balanced. I am pleased that it reflects the need to link the reform of regional structural aid to the reform of the regulations on the Structural Funds until 2013, stressing its complementary nature, and that it advocates the maintenance of adequate support measures for regions affected by the statistical effect without any discrimination. I take a positive view of the proposal to increase the threshold for de minimis aid, which will eliminate bureaucracy and above all benefit SMEs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, it is naturally in our interest to make sure that State aid provided in individual Member States does not undermine the natural competitive environment. On the other hand, it gives me great pleasure that in its action plan for State aid reform the Commission has taken into consideration the fact that it is essential to strengthen the European Union by means of promoting the knowledge-based economy, something we have been demanding for so long.</p>
<p class="contents">In my contribution, I would particularly like to emphasise innovation, research and development, areas closely associated with access to venture capital. These are areas where public funding may be usefully applied, generating high rates of return in the form of sustainable development and the increased competitiveness of the European economy, primarily for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">The model of public and private partnerships establishing research and development centres, technology incubators and high-tech centres where universities have an important role, as well as local and regional authorities and third sector institutions, may contribute significantly to greater transparency over the use of public funds and, at the same time, help better tap the research, technological and innovation potential of individual member countries. The same applies to venture capital funds. Without public funds, it is almost impossible to set up the seed capital funds that innovative start-up businesses need so badly. State aid policy must in no way restrain their development. On the contrary, it should encourage and attract sufficient private capital funding. I trust that State aid reform will meet such requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully endorse the Commission’s chief message of less but better-targeted State aid, as well as the fresh policy’s mainstays of innovation and research.</p>
<p class="contents">I am looking forward to the Commission’s concrete proposals on this score. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be closely monitoring the Commission in the next few months and we will gladly enter into dialogue with it, because I hope that the Commission will issue more detailed guidelines on the definition of State aid so as to guarantee more legal certainty and prevent misuse at the same time, because innovation should be what it implies, rather than a licence for certain Member States to carry on as before.</p>

As we heard, this House, in an own-initiative report a few weeks ago, spoke out in favour of State aid for disadvantaged regions being continued until 2013. As the support businesses get from State aid is among the factors that influence them when making decisions about investment in a given area, it has an essential contribution to make to economic growth and the creation of jobs in that area. The EC Treaty includes a fundamental prohibition of State aid where it has a detrimental effect on the internal market by potentially distorting competition, but an exception is made for certain types of State aid, such as that given to promote the economic development of Europe’s disadvantaged regions. As a member of the Committee for Regional Development, I am firmly of the conviction that direct State aid has a key role to play in regional development and plays an important part in achieving our primary cohesion goals.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope given to aid by Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty in conjunction with the guidelines for regional aid have, in the past, enabled the regions concerned to attract businesses and thereby actively contribute to their own regeneration. Were such support is no longer possible, these regions’ convergence process would be jeopardised by the lack of any competitive advantage against not only regions without developmental disadvantages but also regions in the new Member States in receipt of the maximum amounts of aid. This is particularly the case for regions bordering on the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The reduction of bureaucracy is an important part of the law on aid and, like the increase in <span class="italic">de minimis</span> aid, makes an important contribution to making the legal environment more welcoming to businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Prodi Commission always looked upon State aid as the enemy of competition and of the single market. Sadly, that was a one-sided and distorted outlook, which often meant that less of that rightful public support went to strategic economic sectors, such as research and innovation, or to the vital cohesion policy. In contrast, the Barroso Commission seems to take a different view, and the resolution approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs provides some guidelines from which the Commission ought not to deviate.</p>
<p class="contents">None of us opposes competition. Nevertheless, this basic value in the market economy has often been subject to the ideologies of bureaucrats and economists lacking in any political responsibility, to the extent that, in the real economy, they have been responsible for delaying the recovery of competitiveness in entire regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Pittella has already stated, we must start a new chapter today by reconciling competition with cohesion policies. To this end, advantageous tax conditions, for instance, are useful because they can contribute positively to the cohesion policies and because, in the absence of any tax harmonisation among the Member States, they constitute a vital instrument in the hands of national governments where tackling regional underdevelopment is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore want to make just one recommendation to Mrs Kroes: that she drafts a new proposal for a directive as quickly as possible. This proposal should – if not exclusively, then mainly – take account of Parliament’s guidelines, given that the crisis the Union is grappling with is completely subsumed by the Council’s crisis and by its inability, for example, to deal with the unequal way in which the Member States’ markets are deregulated, a situation that is far more damaging to competition than any misguided State aid is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I conclude that there is not that much difference between political views on this issue. I congratulate the rapporteur. The content of the report and the Commission review are in line with what we discussed during this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to underline that there is no rigid dogma. That was made clear on your side. It is more that we try to give a hook to Member States’ companies, because the aid does not go to the Member States themselves. Via State aid, the Member State gives a hook to those who need a bit of help, instead of just giving them the fish. They want to do it themselves, but they need a little bit of backing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs in‘t Veld and other Members have talked about less and better State aid. She mentioned that that statement by the Commission is appropriate advice, in the opinion of her political group and her personal opinion. I would have been pleased to say that it was my wording, but we got it from the Council. Aid should be less and better. That is what we tried to indicate and that is what the rapporteur put in his report. State aid reform has to be shaped to deliver not only on growth, innovation and employment, but also on a wide range of primarily non-economic issues. We all agree that they are of fundamental importance to our social European model. These include the social and regional cohesion, human capital and cultural diversity rightly mentioned by Mrs van den Burg. However, State aid should be used wisely, because it is taxpayers’ money. We should not compete through State aid by the Member States, because that is the wrong route. It would have a very detrimental effect. We must not allow a subsidy race between the Member States, so there is clearly a need for less aid, and aid that is better targeted.</p>
<p class="contents">On the specific concerns raised here today, the Commission will do its utmost to improve how the rules work in practice. It will also step up transparency, rightly called for by a number of Members. Aid should be monitored, but in the end it is only through a positive partnership that we will be able to deliver successful State aid reform.</p>
<p class="contents">A couple of Members touched upon the role of the regional aid guidelines and focusing aid on the regions most in need. We discussed this before and it was adopted last year. Again that is not dogmatic, but it takes account of the fact that some need more backing at a particular moment. We want to deliver a fair and balanced package and we discussed that here in December.</p>
<p class="contents">We will look further at how the State aid rules can be adapted to new financing mechanisms such as public-private partnerships. The same goes for aid for projects of common interest to boost competitiveness and technological innovation. The question of innovation has been raised. I have just read an article by Professor Getz, saying that innovation should not just be developed in the research and development department of a company, it should be at all levels, from bottom to top. That is an interesting philosophy that could be considered when we are talking about how to boost innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to SMEs, when we look at the 25 Member States, 92% of all the enterprises in the European Union are in the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. So when we talk about creating jobs and economic growth, we have to bear in mind that the vast majority fall within the category of small and medium-sized enterprises. That is what we are trying to take into account when we talk about giving them more attention than they have received up to now and to stimulate innovation and cooperation between, sometimes, a combination of research institutes, smaller companies and larger companies. It is a challenge to ensure that all those SMEs can take advantage of these opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">It has rightly been mentioned that risk capital is not very developed in Europe. Compared to the United States, quite often innovative ideas are not taken up by companies that are small or just starting up because there is no backing from the banks. State aid to back those companies in their early development could be very helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wortmann-Kool asked whether the Commission could raise the threshold. I am not saying that we would not be prepared to raise it. However, we should bear in mind that we are talking about SMEs and not large companies, and we should try to reduce bureaucracy and red tape. The amount of euros we are talking about really covers that category. So we shall be submitting a proposal quite soon, but do not be too optimistic, because I have heard on the grapevine that people are thinking of huge sums of money, but then we are not taking account of the category.</p>
<p class="contents">On the environment, the Commission cannot refuse to approve aid just because the objective pursued is not environmental. I am sure that is not the question that is being asked. We have to look at all the policies of the Union. However, the Commission shares the aim of reducing environmentally damaging State aid and we should all encourage Member States to take that into account when deciding on the subsidy.</p>
<p class="contents">On public services, services of general economic interest, the Commission’s decision and framework makes clear how the State aid rules apply to public service compensation. The Commission is committed to reporting on the impact of those rules within the deadlines set by those instruments. As you know, the Commission does not consider a framework directive necessary. I am talking about less bureaucracy. I am being consistent and not saying that we should still do it when it is not necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have done a great deal of work on this report and I am grateful that we can have a discussion with the same goal, i.e. more jobs for Europe, in a social context that we are proud to be living in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
