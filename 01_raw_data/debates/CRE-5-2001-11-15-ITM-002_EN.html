There is a risk that this latest accident will worsen still further the economic and social crisis that the sector has been facing since 11 September. However, this should not make us forget the roots of this crisis, which is the result, not only of the combination of economic problems directly linked to the attacks on 11 September, but also of previous structural difficulties which were revealed and aggravated by the events of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">As President of the Council of Transport Ministers and a Belgian Federal Minister, I am particularly concerned about this situation. It seems to me more than ever vital to implement structural, economic and social reforms so as to enable the sector to overcome the current crisis, to give it a boost in the form of social measures, and to lay the foundations of sustainable development in this sector in the long term. In order to do this, we must understand the real roots of the problem and identify the obstacles that must be removed, and I should like to make a start on that here and now, with you and with Mrs Diamantopoulou.</p>
<p class="contents">The main cause of the fragility endemic in the European air transport sector is its over-fragmentation, along with a lack of both consolidation at Community level and strategic alliances. Up to now, the Community structure has been based on the desire to create a single market in which optimum conditions for competition are guaranteed. The extreme competition that results from this, in a sector where marginal costs are relatively low, gives rise to problems of over-capacity and at the same time prices that are too low in relation to the average costs borne by the airlines. This particularly fierce competition has therefore helped to make the airlines more fragile, and so they are vulnerable to any economic upset because their margins are so small.</p>
<p class="contents">The American air transport industry has for a long time been much more concentrated than its European counterpart, which together with other factors has helped it to cope, for better or worse, with the crisis which is affecting the United States in particular. Although the difficulties in the air transport sector were caused not by the attacks of 11 September but by structural considerations, the events of that day imposed new constraints on what was already a difficult situation, and it was those constraints which precipitated the current crisis, and which have been made worse by the present context of an economic recession.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall list the major constraints, in chronological order. Firstly, US airspace remained closed for four days, then passenger confidence was reduced and there was a considerable fall in the amount of air traffic operating – 20% fewer holiday flights compared with the year 2000, particularly on transatlantic routes where there was a drop of 30% – and to top it all there was the tragic accident two days ago, which will no doubt make the situation even worse. Then there is the fact that insurance companies have decided to raise insurance premiums for both passengers and aeroplanes in the case of accidents due to a state of war or to acts of terrorism. They have also decided to limit the airlines’ coverage for third-party damages in the same circumstances to USD 50 million. What is more, additional security measures of necessity mean additional costs for airports and airlines. Last but not least, American aid, consisting of USD 15 billion in immediate aid and Federal credits to companies in addition to USD 120 million for suppliers of services, have now caused distortions in competition in relation to the European industry, in particular because they have made possible predatory practices on the part of certain companies on the transatlantic routes.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic and social consequences for Europe of this combination of structural and economic factors are well known: airlines are experiencing serious difficulties, some of them even going into liquidation, investment is at a standstill and the whole air transport sector is experiencing a terrible crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">What has been the Council’s response to all this so far?</p>
<p class="contents">At their meetings on 14 September and 16 October, the Transport Ministers had already discussed the consequences for this sector of the attacks on 11 September, as had the European Council of Economic Affairs and Finance Ministers at its meeting on 21 September, with a view to issuing a rapid and coordinated response from all Member States which would make it possible to support the restructuring of the sector while at the same time trying to retain the basis for healthy competition. The meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers on 16 October in particular examined the proposals contained in the European Commission’s Communication of 10 October on the economic situation of the air transport sector, with a view to implementing a certain number of its proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all the Council very rapidly coordinated Member States’ measures to deal with the insurance situation. It decided that state aid provided to airlines and suppliers of services in order to make up for insufficient or non-existent cover for risks resulting from war would be extended until 31 December. Such schemes have to be declared to the Commission and examined by it on a monthly basis.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the cost of additional security measures, Member States have agreed to take these on board initially, without this being regarded as state aid. However, they have emphasised the need for users and operators to contribute towards this cost in the long term, when the situation has become more normal again.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the four-day closure of airspace, the Council requested and obtained from the Commission a certain amount of flexibility to enable limited aid to be granted beyond that period, on the basis of objective criteria of course, to airlines which were the victims of the closure of airspace and its consequences. Both the Member States and the Commission believe that this support must respect the major elements of the Community acquis regarding the containment of state aid to the air transport sector, and must not under any circumstances cause distortions in competition. We do not accept the idea that American companies should use state aid in order to smash prices. Our companies are suffering from the unfair competition practised by the American airlines. We must not allow such a situation to continue within the European Union. This is why the Presidency supports the Commission’s proposal to adopt a code of conduct together with the United States, precisely in order to prevent or remove such distortions in competition. In addition, the Council has taken into account the request by certain airlines for more flexibility in applying the procedures for allocating time slots.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, one of the key factors in the rapid recovery of air transport is the winning back of passengers’ confidence. With this in mind, the Presidency and the Commission have worked very hard, with the support of the other Member States, in order to define and implement, as rapidly as possible, measures intended to reinforce security at airports and on board aircraft. This will be a two-stage operation: the first stage, which is a matter of priority, will be to apply, on a Community-wide basis, the recommendations of the European Civil Aviation Conference on passenger and baggage checks at airports, which are the result of many years’ experience. The earlier these checks are carried out, the more effective they are. As you know, the Council has invested a great deal of time and energy, particularly through the Council-Commission joint experts group, in order to achieve a policy agreement among Member States as of the forthcoming Council meeting on 7 December.</p>
<p class="contents">In a spirit of close coordination with the European Parliament, I believe that it is very important to achieve our aims as quickly as possible. The Council of 16 October also expressed the hope that the European Parliament should be in a position to give its opinion on this subject as quickly as possible. In other words, I believe that the public would find it hard to understand if the Council or Parliament were to drag its feet on such a crucial issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency is at the disposal of the European Parliament in order to facilitate a close dialogue between the two institutions, and to enable the Members of the European Parliament to benefit from the expertise of its specialists, with a view to the rapid adoption of measures.</p>
<p class="contents">At a second stage we shall be studying the advisability of additional security measures on the basis of the final report of the joint Presidency-Commission <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> group, which will be submitted on 7 December. Some of these measures will perhaps require legislative initiatives supplementing the first stage, represented by the ‘Security’ regulation currently being examined.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council on 16 October thus made it possible to react coherently to the crisis in the air transport sector, but we should now be seeking to reconstruct a solid and sound foundation in this sector, even though we know that the current crisis may continue for several months.</p>
<p class="contents">As my contribution to today’s debate, I propose to share with you my personal analysis of the prospects that exist for this sector and the measures that should be taken. This debate, which the Council has not yet embarked upon, is all the more necessary within this House, because there is no doubt that in the months to come Parliament will be involved in it.</p>
<p class="contents">In structural terms, therefore, we must ensure that the sector is allowed to restructure itself, by reorganising the skies over Europe around a number of major alliances.</p>
<p class="contents">One way of enabling the airline companies to restore their real viability is to improve the way in which the pressure of competition is channelled in this sector, in particular by having recourse to some form of consolidation. Without going so far as to recommend mergers or shareholdings which would require a full-scale remodelling of the system regulating competition, the creation of alliances or commercial alignments would be enough to enable a start to be made on the relieving of some problems. For example, it would make it possible to limit the over-capacity which is such a burden on the sector’s performance, and to reduce the effects of excessive competition on certain routes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a question of allowing economies of scale and of network, which are particularly highly developed in this sector, to operate properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the Commission, we must also think about adopting a strategy which will enable us to cope with similar situations. In particular we must study the adjustments to the European competition rules that will be required, at the same time overcoming, if possible, the current legal obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">This raises the sensitive issue of how the companies concerned can be controlled, and it means that we need to think more about the role of the European Community in relation to third countries, and in particular the United States. In effect, we must allow the major European airlines, around which future air travel will be organised, to be better armed to face their major North American rivals. With this in mind, I personally support the eventual granting of a clear mandate to the Commission, to negotiate with our international discussion partners, particularly in America. It is important for the future of civil aviation that the European Union should speak with a single voice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that the preliminary and essential stage in this step forward is to establish a regulatory framework for the air transport sector which will be more coherent and complete. This ‘internal’ framework should lay a healthy foundation for the redeployment of the sector and enable us to avoid any distortions in competition. Out of the wasteland we have at the moment, we need to create a clear and binding regulatory corpus.</p>
<p class="contents">This movement needs to cover all areas of aviation, whether safety, security, the fight against noise pollution or more general environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, the Commission’s proposals for a ‘single European sky’ should be examined without delay. This project is the point of departure for a whole range of regulatory measures and should be as detailed as possible in order to build up a strong and united European market. The European Union must in time become an equal partner in international negotiations, particularly with its American discussion partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that I and my fellow members of the Council of Transport Ministers will have an opportunity to come back to the question of the Community’s competency in international negotiations on matters concerning air transport. We shall have to give some thought to the conditions governing such a mandate, and the guarantees that will be given to Member States regarding the transparency of negotiations conducted in the name of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In-depth action must also be taken to deal with the social aspects of the crisis. The bankruptcy of Sabena and the redundancies announced draw attention to the importance of and the urgent need for this. The collapse of an airline causes job losses not only within that company itself, but also among its subcontractors. Sabena was the key client of many businesses, not only Brussels-National Airport itself, but also the various providers of airport services. We cannot rethink the civil aviation sector without rethinking the whole of our social policy in the context of liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian Presidency therefore believes that it is vital that it is able to intervene to support social plans and retrain employees, while at the same time respecting the principle that public money should not be used to subsidise companies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also vital that there should be a more far-reaching analysis of the social and environmental impact of the liberalisation of air transport, with a view to creating the conditions for greater harmonisation in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it will be necessary to develop more specifically targeted measures by the European Social Fund. In effect this means that the programming documents drawn up by the Commission and the Member States will have to be adjustable so as to cater for crises in any sector. This will allow prompt reaction to any increase in the number of people seeking jobs, so that they can be retrained as soon as possible and their knowledge and skills brought up to the necessary levels rapidly and appropriately. The problem lies in encouraging people to be adaptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the other vital requirements I will also mention the need to implement an information monitoring system at Community level, with regard to redundancy decisions, the need to increase consultation with social partners, and finally the need to introduce crisis-forecasting management into the European Change Observatory set up on 23 October in Dublin.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, it is important that the ‘Employment and Social Policy’ Council meeting on 3 December should study the Commission’s communication on the restructuring of undertakings, which the Commission announced at the time of the Marks &amp; Spencer crisis last summer. It will be a question of having to consider the concept of the social responsibility of undertakings in the context of restructuring measures. The December ‘Employment’ Council will certainly enable an agreement to be reached on the directive on informing and consulting workers, which also represents a definite step in the right direction in the form of the consultation of representative bodies in times of crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, looking at the long-term prospects, the challenge we are facing also includes the task of ensuring that civil aviation becomes a sustainable activity. Security and safety, economic stability and respect for the environment are the essential components of sustainable development in this sector, which leads me to my last point: the need to make progress in the environmental aspect of the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The responses to economic and social difficulties that are needed in the short term, like the measures on security standards that are needed in the medium term, must in no way prejudice the task of continuing and expanding the efforts being made in this area. Environmentally responsible growth in this sector will, in the long term, be the vital condition for the survival of this form of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We made considerable progress at the ICAO General Assembly in Montreal in September. We must take advantage of what the European Union obtained on that occasion – and believe me it was not a foregone conclusion – in other words that consideration should be given to local, national and regional differences when defining these public policies, in order to adopt European regulations which effectively guarantee a high level of environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We must put into practice the progress that has been made in policy, in particular by rapidly adopting adequate anti-noise measures, but also by adopting measures to reduce greenhouse effect gases, in the context of the undertaking that we gave in Kyoto and confirmed in Bonn and Marrakesh. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Even though European airlines have been less badly affected than their American counterparts, we must ensure that we put in place, at Community level, a regulatory framework that will ensure that they really are viable, and this means in particular revising the competition rules. Moreover, it must be possible, in a crisis, for the regulatory framework to guarantee a high degree of social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Together we must build up a civil aviation industry which is sustainable at economic, social and environmental levels. We must act, and we must act quickly, in order to guarantee that from now on civil aviation will once again become the bridge between peoples and the bringer of peace that it always has been.</p>

The events of 11 September have exacerbated the current situation exponentially. The number of passengers on the main carriers has fallen dramatically and has now bottomed out at 20% lower than in 2000. The airlines recently announced 30,000 redundancies. Two national carriers, Sabena and Swissair, have folded. When Sabena folded, 7,500 people lost their jobs from one day to the next. And we cannot exclude the possibility of further job losses in the industry at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week I met European partners representing all sectors of the air transport industry. Their description was most interesting. The airlines operate in a global village. A global village which has been hit by an earthquake and all its buildings, both large and small, strong and weak, are teetering. So how are we to cope at European level with part of a problem of truly global dimensions? I think that it is important for us to send out a clear message, and I agree completely with Minister Durant here: we shall not be doing the industry any favours if we allow the economic crisis provoked by 11 September to delay decisions to restructure and unify the industry. The main message must be that the proper response is to restructure the airline industry. It is important that we agree that we cannot help the industry with a massive injection of public funds but, at the same time, we must understand that we cannot restructure in a time of crisis without additional economic and social tools. The communication which the European Commission approved on 10 October entitled "The repercussions of the terrorist attacks in the United States on the air transport industry" is an initial reaction to this extraordinary situation and therefore focuses on restoring confidence by planning additional safety measures, coupled with economic measures to support the industry. Of course, I fully agree with the Minister that, because of our institutional configuration and specific policies in the European Union, we are unable, unlike the United States of America, to react directly and support European airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">This communication contains a number of important points and measures. The European Commission is examining measures, in the light of state aid rules, on compensating airlines for the damage which they sustained over the four days during which American airspace was closed. This compensation must be granted without exception to all airlines licensed by the Member State. The European Commission will examine various measures, again in the light of state aid rules, on compensation for the cost of additional insurance and continuing state intervention up to the end of this year. The Commission is currently checking a number of medium-term monthly insurance plans on the basis of competition rules and internal market legislation relating to insurance. And it is examining the possibility of a longer-term solution to the problem of insurance within the framework of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission and the Council of Transport Ministers have called on the Member States to check that third world carriers can provide the same level of insurance cover as that which is going to be required of European airlines. If we are to be able to restructure and stabilise the air transport industry as we must, the problem of ownership and control needs to be resolved now more than ever. The restrictions imposed on airlines by traditional rules of ownership and control in bilateral air transport service agreements make mergers and acquisitions and external investment very difficult, even if the companies are in dire economic straits, which is why the Community desperately needs a dynamic common policy in the external relations sector. The European Commission has been asking the Council for years now for negotiating guidelines on an EU/USA air traffic agreement in order to set the procedure in question in motion. This sort of agreement would benefit our air transport industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, given the rules on landing and take-off slots, the Commission takes the view that the situation is highly critical and agrees to propose that airport coordinators allow carriers to keep the slots which they did not use during the summer of 2001 and during the current 2001/2002 winter period for the same programming periods next year. The President-in-Office of the Council has set out the specific problems and the need for a direct European policy and agreement at European level very clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not go over them again; instead I shall focus a little longer on the question of the social crisis. As I mentioned earlier, there have already been 30,000 redundancies in the space of a few weeks across all sectors and we are currently conducting a study to see what the repercussions will be on sectors working with the airlines. The analysis of the cause of the redundancies is throwing up many and varied factors. Some are due to the crisis per se, which started last spring. Others are due to a fall in demand. Some to the delay in adjusting capacity in order to correct the ratio between supply and demand after years of strong growth. It is difficult to analyse the causes for all the redundancies immediately, but we shall certainly have to see where we can intervene directly and what part the European Union and the European Commission should play.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is a relatively complete legal framework which allows companies to negotiate with their employees in order to find new working models in a bid to keep redundancies to a minimum. British Airways and Alitalia, which have made a great many employees redundant, are already working with and keeping the workers' representatives abreast of developments. But of course legislation cannot stop the current round of redundancies, which is why available Community resources need to be used to deal with the fallout from the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an economic tool at European level – I refer to the European Social Fund – which can be used in three ways: first through the European Employment Strategy, for training and retraining employees made redundant or, often, in order to help them maintain their skills, which they risk losing on such a specialised job market. The second way is by subsidising salaried employees whose jobs are at risk. The problem of small and medium-sized satellite enterprises surrounding the airlines has already been raised. The third way is for local and regional authorities to mobilise action programmes through the Social Fund to deal, for example, with the closure of small airports or local problems caused by redundancies or crises in specific sectors, so that they can be dealt with at regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the financial regulations for the European Social Fund are concerned, it is regulated at European level, but we have the flexibility to redirect funds in times of crisis or in special circumstances. Certain measures for Sabena will be jointly funded by the European Social Fund. These are the legislative and social tools currently available. Of course, one of the most important tools in times of crisis is social dialogue and discussion with the social partners. The European Commission set the European sectoral dialogue on air transport issues in motion following the crisis on 11 September. We have already held meetings with the social partners through the Social Dialogue Committee and it has been decided that a European workshop will be held on 3 December, attended by all the sectors at social partner level and by national delegates from the fifteen Member States, in order to discuss the specific question of the repercussions on employment and the nascent social problems, in a bid to reach a joint agreement on measures which we can take into direct consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, at this time of crisis, when it is hard to find answers and a recipe for recovery, we need proper and direct collaboration both between the European institutions and between the European institutions and the social partners before taking further steps.</p>

I should like firstly to thank the representatives from the other groups involved in drawing together this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true to say that since the attacks on the USA in September the aviation industry has suffered catastrophic consequences, not least on passenger confidence, but in addition for the tens of thousands of jobs which have already been lost worldwide and in particular across Europe. Unfortunately this situation is not confined to the airline industry. The knock-on effects are now evident, both in the aerospace manufacturing sector and in tourism. In my own country, the United Kingdom, the slow recovery following the foot-and-mouth epidemic has suffered a major setback which is truly hard to bear.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the failures of some of the companies in the European Union to face the challenges of the business world, the vast majority of businesses have, through no fault of their own, found themselves on the brink of bankruptcy, or even worse. I recall my own government, along with other national leaders, insisting within three or four days of the incident that help would be given as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, apart from the short-term assistance concerning insurance cover, which should have been 180 days as at the outset in the United States, no financial help has been forthcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not aware of any compensation for financial losses due to the closure of US airspace and airports, or for the additional security measures that the aviation industry has been expected to put in place. It is Member States which should assume responsibility for security costs. In short, the situation is a disgrace, not least because job losses outlined two months ago by many businesses are already escalating due to the lack of help.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this Parliament want action – and we want it now. We are not interested in waiting for some case-by-case consideration by the Commission which may be agreed some time in the future. We demand that interim financial aid packages be made available now to those eligible.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I must inform the Commission and the Council that it is my intention to keep this issue at the top of the agenda and I expect at the very least a report back to this Parliament at the November II part-session on the progress that has been made. I hope that fellow MEPs will support the comments I have made, because we must remember that thousands of livelihoods are at stake. Inaction is not an option, nor is a lecture on environmental issues, because at the rate we are going we will not have an aviation industry to worry about.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Simpson (PSE).</span></span>   – Madam President, I came to the Chamber this morning with a prepared speech about the situation in the airline industry. I have radically altered that, in view of what I have heard from the President-in-Office and the Commissioner this morning. Frankly, what we have heard is totally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced with a classic scenario of the Council of Ministers fiddling like some modern-day Nero while the aviation industry of the European Union burns. Madam President-in-Office, we are in a deep crisis. You, more than anybody else, should know that from your own Member State. Airlines have gone bankrupt. Others are on the brink of bankruptcy – and what response do we get? We get a suggestion that the Commission can go and sit down with the Americans and talk to them about the aid they are giving to try and level the playing field. By the time that happens there will not be a European civil aviation industry left to put on that level playing field! We need action now. We do not want fiddling at the edges, we want direct action so that our civil aviation industry can survive and have a future of its own.</p>
<p class="contents">The response from the United States after the events of 11 September was direct and straight to the point. They made USD 5 billion available to their airlines straight away and offered another USD 10 billion in indirect aid to help them over other crises should they arise. And what did we do? We fiddled at the edges and said, "Well, we might do this" and, as Mrs Foster said, "Well, we said you could pay compensation for the lost days". That is not enough. We need direct action now.</p>
<p class="contents">What appalled me today was the tone of the contribution from the Commission and the President-in-Office. It is as if they are accepting that airlines will have to go bust and that thousands of jobs will have to go, without doing anything to stop it. Before today I suspected that Member States wanted to use this crisis to consolidate the industry, to get rid of some of the airlines. Well, today the President-in-Office all but admitted that this is the case. If that is so, then I condemn it.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the trade unions are with us today in the gallery. I say to them: I give you the support of my group in the quest to keep a European civil aviation industry alive. Sadly, from what I have heard today, a similar commitment from the Council of Ministers seems to be a good way off. I just wonder, Madam President-in-Office, whether people in history will remember the Belgian presidency of the year 2001 as the presidency that oversaw the demise of Europe's civil aviation industry.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Costa, Paolo (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, I feel that a situation such as this requires us to keep calm. My group supported the motion and is prepared to take part in any way it can in any action addressing the current situation quickly and immediately – and, I hope, effectively. Three lines of action must be pursued: defending European industry fully against any unfair competition from the United States in the future; speeding up the restructuring of European industry itself; and meeting the obligations, which we had, moreover, already established before the crisis, to ensure, in any event, improved conditions of safety and respect for the environment than those hitherto in operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has many objectives, which it must pursue simultaneously if we are to pull ourselves out of this situation. This certainly means that we need the Council to confer a negotiating mandate upon the Commission as soon as possible, we need to be able to speak with one voice before the United States and we need to be able to monitor what happens on that front. In other words, we must either defend ourselves or ensure that we all play according to the same rules in this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the need to defend ourselves against attack from an industry which has taken less time to complete restructuring, which has regained its competitiveness first, must not be used an excuse not to change the current situation. Therefore, we need to honour our aid commitments, within the limits laid down for aid for the past financial year, for insurance costs and for the extra security costs, but no more than this. We must consistently maintain state aid within this framework and, what is more, be very astute in our management of the restructuring phases. There is no doubt that European industry will have to go through some rather painful stages as it re-establishes itself and, therefore, it is quite likely that there may be more bankruptcies. However, there are different ways of handling them. That is a fundamental point, one on which it might be appropriate for both the Council of Ministers and the Commission to do more, to produce a few more proposals on how the transitions are to be handled. One tiny example: the bankruptcy of <span class="italic">Sabena</span> or the restructuring of the new <span class="italic">Sabena</span> has led to a debate now on the allocation of slots on European routes. There are small, competitive companies able to take on, to employ people who would be willing to take part in co-sharing operations on European routes. Well then, we must not restrict ourselves to defence but be open to these possibilities too, in short, to a faster<span class="bold"> </span>developing market: we must have the courage and the ability to keep up with it with active as well as defensive measures. In this way, I feel we will also be able to meet the needs of the trade unions and workers very well, aware that this is the right way to ensure that there genuinely will be jobs in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point: this issue affects the services related to the aviation industry as well as airlines; it affects the whole tourist industry. If we do not succeed in restoring the confidence of our fellow citizens and persuading them to start flying again, much of the work we are doing will be wasted. I have not yet heard anyone address this matter, but I feel it is the final task before us all.</p>

I believe that we should be careful not to miss the point here. The air transport sector is experiencing a cyclical and structural crisis, as has been pointed out, but the whole of the European economy – and of the world economy – is also in crisis. The real response to the employment problem is therefore, of course, to relaunch growth and general policies of social solidarity and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the air transport sector is concerned, and in connection with the meeting on the social dialogue referred to by Mrs Diamantopoulou, I believe that the deterioration in working conditions and wages that is starting to occur in this sector is obviously a point to which we must pay a great deal of attention. Moreover, at the level of the European Union, we would like to see the Community’s competition policy adopted and, far from preventing the restructuring of the sector, coming to the aid of that sector, and we should also like this medium-term restructuring policy to be compatible with the policies set out in the White Paper on transport policy, in other words the development of a multi-mode transport policy which reflects, in the medium term, the real situation regarding costs for all sectors as a whole. Finally, and I believe that it is necessary to draw attention to this point, this Parliament has always voted, by a clear majority, against any spiralling in state aids. I would find it hard to understand if the majority of this House were to unleash a spiralling growth in state aid to one particular sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of the United States, let us be clear among ourselves. The United States of America have presented us with a policy which is a fait accompli. Their position on aid to their air transport sector is unacceptable and contrary to fair competition at international level. Since we cannot, apparently, take the issue to the WTO, it is essential that in the context of the overall partnership between the United States and Europe, the European Union should be able to protect those legitimate interests which will, in the long term, work to the benefit of both the American and the European airlines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although this situation was not caused solely by the events of 11 September, it was made much more acute as a result. Air passengers' confidence has fallen leading to a reduction in passenger numbers, losses have been incurred because of the closure of American airspace and airports, insurance cover has been withdrawn and there has been a decline in the numbers of tourists from the USA and the Far East: these are the main causes, as is the cancellation or postponing of orders for new aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental causes of this crisis are, however, of a structural nature: crippling competition between the airlines, built-in overcapacity, a general economic recession and bad decisions by management. This motion for a European Parliament resolution refers to a host of necessary measures, for example compensation for the closure of airspace and airports, financial support or guarantees from the Member States to compensate for insurance cover being withdrawn, proposals on providing financial support to the European air transport sector so as to establish a level playing field with the United States and strategies to safeguard or create jobs. The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports this motion, although we are aware that it is intended as a very short-term measure and can only constitute a first step, but a step which should be taken immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">In the medium and long term, we need a harmonised European airspace, higher standards of quality and safety, highly trained staff, high social standards and no low wages. The mass redundancies which were announced in the air transport sector even before 11 September are absolutely unacceptable to us. We need a strategy to coordinate the different modes of transport; we need an all-embracing European transport strategy. This problem cannot be solved on a mode-by-mode basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now faced with a problem: the problem of the crisis in general and a problem of safety too, which, if the theory on the plane crash should prove to be true, would prompt us to focus more closely on the issue of servicing of aircraft for safety purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Without a doubt, the state of war and the economics of war then precipitated events into a genuine crisis for the airlines which has already had extreme consequences for Sabena and Swissair. As has already been pointed out, the crisis, due to many different causes, not least – there is no doubt – clear strategic mismanagement of the sector, with airlines (which we might describe as too individualistic) unwilling to form consortia, which would have allowed them to streamline human, structural and financial resources; we have seen pricing policies which are misguided and often seeking to evade competition law; there are airports – such as Malpensa, to quote an example from my country – which are unreliable in terms of safety as well.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear today that, in the current situation, the issue has reached dramatic, critical proportions, with the loss of at least 30 thousand jobs in Europe and 180 thousand jobs worldwide. In Italy, my country’s national airline company has contemplated recapitalisation. It is preparing itself to take draconian measures, with a further 1 000 job cuts on top of the 2 500 already announced. Italiatour, Eurofly and the IT services company Sigma Travel will be drastically reduced in size, if not abolished. The recapitalisation will have to be endorsed by Brussels. The Commission had already authorised, on 17 October, payment of a public subsidy of EUR 387 million, but Alitalia needs EUR 1.5 billion and we do not know how useful the shares created by the Treasury by issuing bonds will be. Strengthening commercial links with Air France or joining the Skyteam consortium are likely to be more effective in terms of structural reform.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we endorse the joint motion for a resolution and we feel that the situation calls for various different types of action from the European Union, extremely urgent action which, with the precious help of the European social partners, will succeed in firmly stopping the severely critical situation from further deteriorating now. Subsequently, however, it will be necessary to plan action to modernise and streamline the sector and to take clear, incisive measures to boost tourism, which, as has already been pointed out, is a sector which, all too often, to be honest, is discussed at length but in which very little is as yet being done.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we hope that the forthcoming reflections on the White Paper on transport will lead to resolute, incisive undertakings to support the transport and tourism sector’s economy, helping the many workers and their families, in particular, who must not be allowed to suffer further misfortune. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An attack in the United States is also an attack on the rest of the civilised world, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the effects are making themselves increasingly felt, we must also look to solve the economic implications. In our opinion, the solution should fit into the line that the European Union has adopted in the transport sector. In principle, businesses must operate without direct government subsidies. Whether or not we should make an exception in this case should, however, be placed in the correct context. After all, aviation is a worldwide market. It is not acceptable, therefore, for European companies to go under because governments refuse to grant emergency aid, while elsewhere, government participation keeps companies afloat. In view of the measures which the United States has taken, the zero option has been ruled out for the European Union. We will need to establish, therefore, how far we can, want, and are able to, go, and the sooner the better. This question is not restricted to aviation. Indeed, in addition to aviation, there are all kinds of related industries, including tourism, that have been hit hard. We must also distinguish between short-term and long-term measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first instance, aid must remain restricted to the industry affected and to the damage which is the direct result of 11 September. The payment of insurance costs is logical and, in principle, a certain compensation for lost income is also necessary, because otherwise there would probably only be a few airline companies left in the European Union. However, that does not mean that we will prevent already financially unstable businesses from folding under the veil of compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to focus on the longer term. Since aviation has acquired a global character and attractive services are on offer, businesses are increasingly forced to seek economies of scale. As a result, fewer companies will remain in business, not only in the European Union, but also outside. The sector will then become truly global. National and bilateral legislation, as well as certain existing rights, must be tailored to this. It is not national claims, but the market that plays a decisive role in respect of such rights. In that light, I endorse the measures which the European Commission is proposing and I expect that they will also be able to benefit the European Union in other areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has already been said, and it is obvious, that Sabena is not an isolated incident. There are a huge number of airline companies that are going through very difficult times, and the events of 11 September have only made matters worse. I am aware of this, but with regard to Sabena, it has to be said that the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Durant, has kept two fundamental facts from this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Sabena has been continuously loss making for the last 40 years, except for one year, and that was probably thanks to an accountancy trick. For the past 40 years, the taxpayers have had to inject no less than BEF 62 billion into that company.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the cause. Sabena was a Belgian public company with all the hallmarks of the Belgian State and of the <span class="italic">Parti Socialiste</span>. That translated into political profiteering, political appointments of the manifestly incompetent and political interference by the Belgian Royal House to keep the company in French-speaking hands. For that reason, the alliance with KLM was sabotaged. Everyone knows that in my country. In fact, parliament is currently setting up a parliamentary inquiry committee in order to scrutinise years of mismanagement, and, in my country, this is saying something. We are all agreed that the airline industry is having a bumpy ride, and we must find a solution in Europe on the basis of a policy of “Europe first” as long as the Americans are putting “America first”. However, in the Sabena dossier, we must first of all identify those responsible, notably in the Belgian Royal House and in the successive Belgian Governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Belgium, the small- and medium-sized enterprises expect one redundancy per job lost at Sabena. In our view, it should be ensured that government aid, in whatever form, benefits all industries affected. We are also relying on the fact that the measures which the Commission can take are carried out promptly and on a large scale. The following measures spring to mind in the first instance: the creating of scope for government investments in the safety of air transport, the prompt handling of specific financial aid dossiers and extended flexibility, albeit limited in time, in slot management.</p>
<p class="contents">The extremely difficult situation should also prompt the Commission to clamp down on competition-distorting practices in transatlantic relations. In this day and age, we are dependent on many factors. If they all go wrong at the same time, we will end up with a right mess, and Sabena is a tragic case in point. As a Belgian MP, I would urge that DAT be treated like any other airline company that is being affected by the effects of 11 September. DAT should also be seen as a company that is being restructured, and must have access to the same facilities which other companies would have at their disposal in the same situation.</p>

I would ask those who would seek to use this specific issue in order to criticise public enterprises to measure well the responsibilities of all those concerned. Yes, Europe is responsible when, along with the Commission, certain parties urge rapid, inhumane and brutal liberalisation, and yes, Europe now appears to everyone to be the real driving force behind this process. People no longer want this kind of Europe. They now want to construct with us a social Europe, the Europe that we defended at Lisbon, which develops convergence indicators in order to increase employment and combat unemployment, in other words a Europe which refuses to be dictated to by the market. The 12 000 Sabena workers who were dismissed at the beginning of this month are the first victims of this wave of liberalisation in civil aviation. The results of other European companies are giving cause for concern. Thousands of people are afraid of being thrown out of work, and they cannot understand the intransigence of the European Commission over repayment times for bridging loans to the Belgian company, while the United States are spending billions of dollars on subsidising their national airlines so that they can keep their European slots. They find it unacceptable that the Commission should give preference to sanctions and ukases, in the name of the virtues of liberalism and the market, while at the same time that out-of-control liberalism culminates in companies in Europe closing down one after the other. By setting up the Lisbon process, the Community authorities and the Member States have proved that they are capable of taking into account the human and territorial consequences implied by every decision. Such blind liberalisation will do nothing to advance the cause of the European idea or to increase confidence in Europe’s institutions and in our plans for peace and social progress. It will inevitably lead the public to reject this European and simplistic vision.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the European Parliament’s vote on the Langen report two days ago, confirmed that there are certain sectors that should not be open to competition, and among those sectors are the sectors with which you are concerned. Let us be clear about this, we do not reject the idea of modern and efficient public enterprises, and we do not want them to be sacrificed and ridiculed. We are waiting for a forward-looking vision of economic development, a project which is humane and intelligent, and which will enable sustainable development to be achieved. I hope that that is what we shall see on 3 December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Needless to say, that is never entirely possible with a bankruptcy of this scale, but it is important nevertheless that an effort is also being made indirectly, in the area of training and in-service training. I should also like to ask the Commissioner to advise soon whether something will also be done at European level, what the amounts will be that are involved and what kind of efforts will be made in respect of various airline companies. Sabena is, of course, a spectacular case, but social tragedies are also unfolding in other airline companies. That is where a European approach and European support are needed, so that people know that Europe is doing something, for my fellow MEP quite rightly pointed out that at the moment we have a one-sided image of Europe which, in my view, should be rectified.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is clear to me. In my opinion, the role of the Member States and of an individual approach to aviation per Member State is over. We have been saying this for years, even if some people in this Parliament still believe that a national approach must be maintained. That era should finally come to an end, in my view. We must opt for a European approach. National state aid to airline companies makes no sense whatsoever. We must decide very quickly on whether – and I share your view in this, Mr Simpson – European aid to a European sector is possible and on the conditions under which that can be done. However, I do not think the problem is solved by saying: OK, they put USD 5 billion on the table, we will put EUR 5 billion on the table. In my view, the problem will not be solved in that way, for this financial solution must be accompanied by a simultaneous restructuring scheme. There was no point in getting the Belgian Government, or possibly the European Government, to bail out Sabena once again and to keep it in the air. Sabena had to restructure and do something, which happened in too painful a manner. They have waited for too long to do this rationally. Instead, it is now happening in a chaotic manner. That is unfortunate, but I believe we should learn from this.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that Sabena is the first national airline company to go bankrupt in the Union speaks volumes. We tend to hold on to national airline companies, and those days are over, as various MEPs have stated today. We must adopt a European approach. That implies air traffic control, security measures and agreements with third countries. Mrs Durant, I am pleased that you are offering a window in this respect, but I hope that you can convince all your colleagues, for that is exactly what the opposition in the Council was about. Member States are reluctant to relinquish this authority, and refuse to join forces at European level, and we are now paying the price for this. the Americans <span class="italic">are</span> able to adopt a joint policy, but we are not. You are not represented at international level when aviation is at issue. It is the fifteen Member States that conclude agreements with open skies etc. and that compete with each other politically. I hope, therefore, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that you will be able to convince your colleagues. And I hope that everyone here in this Parliament is convinced of the fact that we must at long last respond at European, rather than national, level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I personally am not satisfied with the Commission’s response, which favours the speeding up of restructuring in the air transport sector. I am in favour of a European approach. We can discuss and comment on the content of that approach later. As for restoring confidence, I believe that confidence is actually a product of safety, and the safety dimension in this sector, as in others, is dependent upon the expertise, competence and qualifications of the staff employed. Commissioner, I am absolutely in agreement with you on the urgent need to develop the social dialogue, but we cannot just be content with a social dialogue at a time when people are facing the problem of redundancies. Is anyone really listening to the employees concerned? They too have comments, and thoughts, and proposals, and in view of what we have just decided regarding the consultation of workers, perhaps that could be implemented much more rapidly. I also believe that restoring confidence involves learning lessons from the present crisis and putting a stop to the process of liberalisation that is currently underway. Frankly, I do not believe that the liberalisation that has developed in this sector has contributed towards its development. In fact I would rather say that it has contributed towards its difficulties. Restoring confidence also means, at any given moment, taking responsibility for providing assistance. I believe that the limited targeted measures are insufficient to cope with this crisis. Since the American aid is considerable, I believe that there should be compensatory aid in the air transport sector, but that it should also be made conditional upon maintaining jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that we also need to open up prospects. It seems to me that among our long-term prospects we should be looking at how the European Union can work, not towards concentrations, but towards the development of international cooperation, on safety and the management of air traffic, between the airlines and the public authorities. Mr President, I believe that we should also increase cooperation between air and rail transport, and that airports should be integrated into the trans-European networks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want to ensure that we retain competitive airline companies in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the key proposals included in the compromise resolutions that are before us today. It is important that the Commission works out a set of proposals which make it possible for the European airline industry to withstand the competition resulting from the massive help which the American Government is giving American airlines at this time. We must ensure that the European aviation industry receives equal treatment vis-à-vis our American airline counterparts, particularly when it comes to addressing transatlantic arrangements. For example, from an Irish perspective, Aer Lingus is highly dependent on transatlantic travel. Other EU airlines also make a substantial profit from their transatlantic routes. It is important that these EU airlines can compete against the American airlines which have received state aid from the American Government in recent times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office, you were too generous in your comments just now when you said that the Council had in fact responded consistently. I have my doubts about this, Madam President-in-Office, and I should like to urge you in the strongest possible terms to ensure that the same subsidies – whether it be for insurance cover, whether it be compensation, or whether it be possible restructuring aid – are granted or not granted in all of the Member States. It is not acceptable for airlines to be supported in a particular way in one Member State and not in another when all are supposed to be competing fairly in an internal market. This cannot work. We want to establish fair terms of competition between the airlines. As President-in-Office of the Council you must ensure that this is the case and you, Commissioner, must, if necessary, take the Member States to court if there are distortions of competition here which destroy the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Madam President-in-Office, you rightly referred to the fact that restructuring is necessary. Probably there will be a number of larger global players and some regional airlines. They cannot be bound to Member State A or Member State B. We need a functioning European and global air transport market. This can only happen, Madam President-in-Office, if the Member States cede their responsibilities for take-off and landing rights to the Community and if we administer the take-off and landing rights together. Only then can we give our airlines a chance to compete on fair terms in the global market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would earnestly request that in the next few weeks you do all you can to bring your influence to bear on your Member States on these two points.</p>

<p class="contents">The fact is that Aer Lingus in Ireland had already been hit by the downturn in the high-tech industries where much of the lucrative business travel for Aer Lingus had already been badly hit because businessmen and women were simply not travelling back and forth across the Atlantic. Clearly, 11 September virtually wiped out that business.</p>
<p class="contents">Tourism is also a major linchpin in the economy of Ireland. Our airline is an important asset in that area of the industry. If we allow that to go down the drain, who is going to service the Irish tourist economy?</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and the Commission are, I am afraid, confused. They are minimalist and grudging in their response to this crisis for the Irish airline. That is perceived to be so by the workers of Aer Lingus and the Irish people in general. We will pay the price in Europe for that perception. It is important that we recognise that the national carrier in every Member State in Europe is as important as the national anthem or the national flag. You can shake your head, but that is the reality. We have to take that into account. We may regret it, but we must take it into account in dealing with this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are four things I would ask the Commission and the Council to address. There is an urgent need for a reply to the Irish Government's request to the Commission for permission to assist the Irish airline with the compensation that is due as a result of 11 September. There is an urgent need for the reform of the competition rules. There is an urgent need for assistance to help companies create alliances at a European level, which will ensure that the national carriers are not annihilated. Finally, we need firm proposals for the social fund package that has been talked about here today. Parliament should be discussing those proposals when we next meet in Strasbourg in December, not next June. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And no doubt others will follow. In the medium term at least, two or three large airlines will survive in Europe to share the pickings with the American behemoths which, with the connivance of our governments, have taken pains to penetrate and take over the European market. The terrorist attacks on 11 September have intensified the crisis and been used as an excuse for cutbacks and mass redundancies. And in what is already a dismal situation for many national carriers, along comes the Commission to administer the <span class="italic">coup de grace </span>by prohibiting state aid, at a time when the US government is injecting its behemoths with massive amounts in aid.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that this situation is here to stay and, the more capital is concentrated, the more the workers and consumers will be expected to pick up the tab in the form of job losses and more and more expensive tickets. That is why the only solution is to support the fight to get this policy reversed and get rid of those who apply it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Restoring public confidence means getting security screening right and improving the quality of staff, training, job procedures, pay and conditions. It means, perhaps, ensuring that there is a state-run security operation at airports and paying accordingly. That may well create more jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the airlines and their financial viability are concerned, we do not want more intervention, more bureaucracy and more delay. We need targeted assistance in areas like insurance and the cost of security. We must let the market decide what the future of the airline industry shall be.</p>
<p class="contents">As was said earlier, Sabena made a profit in only one year out of the many years that it has been in existence. Aer Lingus, Alitalia, Air France and KLM are not far behind. Why the devil should we support Aer Lingus when Ryanair can make money without any difficulties at all – like Easyjet, like GO, like Buzz? All those airlines can make money at a difficult time. Why should we therefore bail out the Sabenas and the Aer Linguses with their overcapacity, with too many routes, too few passengers and too much state pride?</p>
<p class="contents">I have two specific questions that I wish to ask the President-in-Office of the Council. Firstly, I am led to believe that there are problems with the Sabena slots that have been offered, in Britain, for example, to British Midland and British European Airways. They may have them for a short time but there is some suggestion from the coordinator that they may be lost in six months time if DAT is reformed and wants those slots back. That is unacceptable. If Sabena cannot fill those slots then others should be allowed to use them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what is being done to ensure that the staff at Brussels airport does not restrict the movement of those new-slot airlines as a result of picketing and delays at the airport? We need guarantees of freedom of movement on the ground as well as in the air. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, in the name of what is in this case totally blinkered liberalisation, they require full adherence to the State aid system, which prevents any action being taken to support airlines. On the other hand, there is a genuine danger that we will find ourselves – there have already been 30 000 job losses within the space of 30 days – with 100 000 jobs being lost in 100 days, in a sector which, moreover, enjoys little in the way of social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">For two months, we have been saying that 11 September changed the world and the balance of society. It would be a shame if we were to miss the political significance of this and fail to review the order of our priorities. In European integration based on social cohesion, in a Europe built on the fundamental principle of work, what priority should we today give to the risk of an uncontrolled wave of unemployment? Do we still think we can prevent the inevitable market crisis? We are all aware that this crisis has roots in the past, that it is more than just a consequence of the events of 11 September, that it is also the result of excessive market fragmentation. However, we do not feel that going to the opposite extreme – bringing about a huge merger which would ultimately only save three national airlines: the French, British and German companies – would be a healthy solution. We are actually not so very far off this situation, considering what happened to Sabena and the engineered drop in the nominal value of the shares of a large number of airlines which are in danger of selling at a loss. A prime example is <span class="italic">Alitalia</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I welcome the code of conduct for US airlines intended to avoid piracy in the market, provided that, as others have said, the European governments do genuinely intend to enforce it, for otherwise it will be just another list of unfulfilled good intentions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This organisation also expects that the total losses incurred in this industry will amount to 7 billion this year, and that it will take twelve months before the industry will recover. That is what we are facing here: a worldwide crisis which has major ramifications for Europe. That is point one. Point two – and this has already been mentioned by a number of speakers – is that this industry had been in a very bad way for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">I often have to take the floor when we deal with enormous job losses, and it is always a sad occasion. This time is no exception. However, there is something peculiar about it this time round. Part of the guilty party is sitting directly opposite me, namely the Council itself. We ask in our resolution for a European airline industry and a European airline policy. What the Council has offered us is a policy of national carriers where everyone acts in their own self-interest and everyone wants to conclude their own agreements with the United States. Mr De Rossa said that the national carrier is as sacred as the national anthem. If that is the attitude, then we will never solve the problem, of course. If we all act in our own self-interest, we will be unable to reach a European solution. We will then end up in a frosty restructuring programme, which is exactly what is now threatening to happen. I think we are all agreed that that should not happen, but we must get the idea out of our heads that we can still have national carriers in this internal market. It is impossible to pursue sound social policy if the economic backdrop is in total disarray, and as far as that is concerned, the Council is innocent in all of this. The Commission has made a very good effort. There are many proposals before us, but these have all been rejected by the Council. The first thing the Council should allow the Commission to do is to talk with the United States on its own. If that is not done, other things should not be discussed either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today I want to deal with the effect they are having on the regional areas of Europe, rather than the major cities like London, Birmingham and Paris, because they will survive and receive support.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Northern Ireland watched with interest as Sabena pulled out, and then Aer Lingus, which provided a service from Belfast to Shannon for transatlantic flights and was used by many people in Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland's Government said it wanted greater cooperation with Northern Ireland, but the first time there is a bit of trouble, it runs away! That is the kind of cooperation we Unionists have to put up with!</p>
<p class="contents">No one can persuade me that some of these large companies have not used this situation to put some of their own problems right. British Airways stayed in Northern Ireland and stood by its staff through bombs and bullets. What has it done? It has pulled out of Northern Ireland as well! I condemn it for that. I hope, Commissioner, that you will ensure that it is not allowed to keep those slots in order to open up more lucrative routes and that if other companies are prepared to start up from the regions those slots will be given to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly feel very strongly about this. I am not in favour of giving large amounts of money to bail out inefficient companies. To some extent Mr Atkins is right: there are other companies out there which are making money and they have to be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to the Commission and the Council that they cannot come here and give us a lecture. They will have to come back with firm and positive proposals.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Durant,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, briefly, on the subject of the discussion that we have just heard, I do not believe that anyone here, either the Council, or the Commission, or any one of us, has exclusive rights to indignation in the face of the social problems that are occurring now for each of these airlines, and perhaps for some of them more than others. I am particularly well-placed to know all about that.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this social crisis that is being experienced by a certain number of those who operate and work in the air transport sector is obviously a challenge to all of us. However, I also believe that, despite this challenge and the need to react to this problem, to follow the road that we took in the past, via massive state aid, would be to avoid or conceal a situation which was already in existence before 11 September. This is a fragile sector, in which the profit margins have been extremely low in recent years. Therefore, despite the indignation that we all feel in the face of the current social problem, I believe that to imagine that simply returning to massive structural aid will solve the problems in this sector would be to evade an obstacle which will confront us again later, in an even more dramatic form.</p>
<p class="contents">I really believe, on behalf of the Council, even though this debate has only just started in the Council, that it will not be easy, and what you have said today demonstrates that. We well know how much Member States are attached to their national airlines and how important that attachment is, and here I am speaking more on my own account than on behalf of the Council, where we shall soon have to start these discussions. We have made an immediate start by giving immediate and specific responses in this sector. Yes, there is aid in various forms. There are specific and targeted forms of aid with regard to the closure of airspace, and the possibility of providing even more, on the basis of objective criteria. There has been aid in connection with insurance facilities. There are other types of aid, not financial aid, regarding the problem of time slots, so as to enable the airlines to keep their heads above water, or at least not to sink any deeper. There have been responses. I also believe that what we have done regarding the matter of security is an immediate response concerning those elements which will restore passengers’ confidence in the safety and security aspects, which are obviously so essential if the public is to regain confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the responses which have been given by the Council and the Commission are immediate responses. It is true that the social crises which we are experiencing in various European airlines, and particularly in Belgium, and which also call for social responses involving taking these problems into consideration, should not cover up the urgent need to begin a debate, within the Council, on a more structural consolidation of the sector. This is without a doubt the only way of giving to this sector, in structural terms, not only the social responses which it needs, but also economic responses, and responses which will guarantee its long-term survival, not forgetting – as some of you have mentioned – the need for multi-mode transport systems, the need to place air transport too in the context of short-distance journeys at European level, the development of the high-speed train and any other alternatives which will enable us, in that context too, to provide responses at the level of a common transport policy. However, I really believe that a return to massive state aid would be a step in the wrong direction, a step backwards, and a step which would, above all, risk leading us, at a later date, into even more serious difficulties. By contrast, we have provided specific responses, and there are other responses to come: the security regulation, which I hope we shall be able to agree on on 7 December. I also hope that it will be possible for Parliament to contribute its views on this subject to the debate as well. There is still an enormous amount of work to do, but I really think that the time has come to begin these discussions on structural consolidation, in addition to the specific responses which have already been provided and which were necessary in the very short term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two major sets of issues have been debated.</p>
<p class="contents">The first relates to the restructuring of the airlines. The second relates to the need for social intervention. As far as the first is concerned, I think that all the speakers agreed on the need for restructuring and for a new airline model in Europe. There are three points worth making here: first, the present traditional model of ownership and control obviously will not allow the degree of restructuring we would like, or rather the degree of restructuring required. Meaning that we need a new approach, with a more European dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that, in today's global world, Europe is not negotiating with one voice. This works to the detriment of the European airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">And the third point relates to state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The point was made that we are debating whether or not to support the airlines and that, when we finally make our decision, it will be too late, because the European airlines will already have gone out of business. The law on state aid is not the Koran. Let us assume that a decision is taken on state aid. What tool do we have at European level? Can we decide to give state aid to airlines? Of course not. What we can decide at European level is a yes or a no and the facility to grant state aid then shifts to the national level. Meaning that we have national governments with different capabilities, different frameworks and different airlines. Meaning that we will probably end up with a direct distortion of competition and the internal market. Consequently, the state aid path is a hard path to tread as things currently stand in Europe. To focus on three of the points of the dialogue, I would simply highlight what was said repeatedly by the members and the Belgian minister. That now more than ever we need a European transport policy, not national policies which at the moment are leading nowhere fast.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the second line of approach – social policy – is concerned, I analysed the potential for intervention under the Social Fund in my first intervention. Policy to deal with the social fallout and employment needs to be taken, of course, at local, national and European level. As far as intervention under the Social Fund is concerned, as we have been asked directly to table proposals, I should like to say that, depending on their particular circumstances and the problems which redundancies cause them, the Member States will need to table proposals to change their current programme for the community support framework so that it can be approved by the Commission. This has already been done in other sectors with large companies being restructured both in Great Britain and France. Consequently, it is up to the Member States to act fast and adjust their Social Fund programmes along these lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
