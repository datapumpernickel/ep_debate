<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Müller (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate this evening concerns the revision of the body of legislation relating to medicinal products in the European Union and its impact on patients and the pharmaceutical industry. In this context, it is important to note that knowledge about the manufacture of medicinal products and the action of any given drug is not general knowledge. Due to the complex scientific interactions and manufacturing processes, very few patients in Europe will be able to evaluate the opportunities, risks and prospects of success of a treatment with any given drug. That is why we need an agency to evaluate the safety, efficacy and quality of medicinal products on behalf of the patient.</p>
<p class="contents">This evaluation must meet high scientific standards, not only in the interests of patients but also in the interests of manufacturers. After all, if problems arise as a result of serious adverse reactions to a drug, the manufacturers are likely to forfeit their reputation and have to pay financial penalties, while patients have the physical effects to contend with.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the reform of the legislation on the authorisation of medicinal products, which is the subject of our debate today, must guarantee the safety of medicinal products but also establish general conditions which authorise and underpin research by pharmaceutical companies and thus boost their competitiveness. This not only benefits the companies concerned; it also safeguards jobs. Not least, patients benefit from the research findings and from new and effective medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">With this legislation, we have, I believe, succeeded in resolving the dilemma between the need for high standards of health protection, on the one hand, and the industry’s calls for better conditions for research and competitiveness, on the other. In a global economy with different legal frameworks in Europe, Asia and the USA, and with the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, this was not an easy task. The global compromise with the Council that has now been achieved offers us the opportunity to conclude the package reforming the legislation on medicinal products in the second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good compromise, as it generally reflects the views of this House on key issues concerning legislation, pharmacovigilance, the scope of the centralised authorisation procedure, protection and the composition of the Agency's Management Board. I believe that the compromise tailors the legislation to reflect scientific progress and economic developments, and patients will benefit from this.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me comment briefly on the key topics. A particularly important aspect of the reform of the legislation on medicinal products is improving pharmacovigilance. This House has successfully enforced a high level of safety in the authorisation procedure as well as an effective system of surveillance and control. With the establishment of a database at the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), the Agency will in future play a key role in an effective pharmacovigilance system. This is especially important because a well-functioning pharmacovigilance system is essential for patients’ wellbeing. Although the compromise does not establish a compulsory centralised authorisation procedure for all new active substances – a proposal which was endorsed by this House at first reading – the list of indications has nonetheless been extended to include orphan drugs, with a further extension after four years to include indications for autoimmune and viral diseases. As a result, a wide range of new active substances will be subject to the centralised authorisation procedure in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Medicines Agency in London will guarantee, through the structures and working methods envisaged in this legislation, that scientific resources are coordinated effectively, thus safeguarding the high standards of the evaluations. Centralised authorisation through the EMEA will ensure that all patients in Europe enjoy the same prompt availability of innovative and effective medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions on data protection were another controversial topic. The protection period agreed in the current compromise, of eight years, plus two, plus one, for the centralised and the decentralised procedure, ensures, firstly, that there is an incentive to carry out research, and secondly, that the further development of proven active substances is rewarded. This uniform Europe-wide provision protects the economic interests of manufacturers engaged in research and the interests of generics manufacturers and – unlike the period originally proposed by the Commission – reduces the burden on the national health systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The global compromise with the Council places patients’ needs at the heart of the legislation, promotes research and innovation and also safeguards the competitiveness of European industry. That is why I urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to support the Council’s compromise. As is always the case with compromises, not all our proposals have been fulfilled. Nonetheless, I believe that we have found a solution, even on controversial points such as homeopathic medicinal products. Through the mutual recognition procedure, it is now possible for every patient in Europe to access these medicinal products. On the matters concerning the WTO, too, I believe that we have found an acceptable solution, although it is beyond the scope of this legislation to regulate these issues. The Commission has pledged to present a proposal on this topic in the new year.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the overall outcome is good and that the compromise is worth supporting. I do not think that initiating a conciliation process with the Council will produce a better result, especially as it will not solve the two issues that I have mentioned. Tomorrow’s vote – and I urge my fellow Members to support the compromise on that occasion – will enable us to launch sustainable legislation on medicinal products. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow rapporteur Mrs Grossetête, as well as the Secretariat, the Council and the Commission, for their cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Grossetête (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, this evening we are examining the review package of legislation on medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products. This review represents two years of work, indeed more than two years of joint work, of research, questions and negotiations: two years which will, I hope, be crowned with success at tomorrow’s vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to extend very sincere thanks to my fellow Members of the European Parliament, across all of the groups, with whom I have held countless meetings, and in particular my fellow rapporteur, Mrs Müller. I should like to thank her for collaborating so effectively. I have listened to the requests made by fellow Members. I have put forward their arguments to the Council. I have involved them every step of the way, so that everyone could share in today’s result.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the Commission, in particular Commissioner Liikanen and his outstanding team. I have had first-hand experience of their dedication and have appreciated the quality of our exchanges. I should also like to thank the Council for being willing to adopt a constructive approach on these dossiers so as to reach an agreement at second reading. These expressions of gratitude will, however, count for nothing if Members of this Parliament do not act responsibly tomorrow and adopt the compromise that has been negotiated, rather than vote in favour of other amendments which, I believe, are more of a reflection of individual interests than the common good.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we have a compromise and a compromise is never satisfactory on all counts. But consider the strides forward that we have made in protecting public and animal health! The objective of striking a balance, which was so difficult to attain at the outset, has been achieved. Attempts were made to pit the various different partners against each other, and in particular to put the health system and innovation on opposing sides. In fact, analysis has shown that generic medicines on the one hand and innovations by pharmaceutical laboratories on the other are not contradictory. These two products are not incompatible, but complementary. Generics do not develop without innovation and innovation is stimulated by the availability of generic medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">Protecting patient health means being able to counteract the emergence of new diseases, to confront old scourges when they reappear and to provide more effective treatment. Protecting patient health means giving scientific research the necessary resources to discover either new molecules or new therapeutic applications for existing medicines. Innovations come at a price. Let us not forget that safeguarding our health requires significant financial investment. Data protection is therefore essential to guarantee medical advances, the European medical advances of which we are proud. The result of our compromise, known as 8+2+1, is what I would like to see adopted in tomorrow’s sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">Research and development are at the root of health protection, which would not be complete without the availability of generic medicines. Generics are very important for our European health systems and for patients. I therefore welcome the approach adopted by these directives. The term ‘generic medicines’ has been introduced for the first time. It is also proposed to start using the Bolar system in the Union, a proposal that our amendments have, by the way, served to improve. This provision will enable all generics to be made available more quickly. My fellow Members and the Council also accepted my ‘eurogenerics’ proposal, which will prevent any hold-up in the development of these products, in particular in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The review of pharmaceutical legislation does not seek solely to strike an optimum balance between generics and innovation. Many other aspects that are just as important have been studied. I am thinking in particular of the definitions of medicinal product, generic medicinal product and biosimilars. These have been the subject of heated debate. Personally, I have always advocated an approach based on product safety. Having definitions that are too broad would be counterproductive for both manufacturers and patients. A satisfactory balance has been struck in this respect, as is illustrated by the provision on borderline products. I know that this point raises further questions. Simply deleting this so-called ‘borderline products’ clause would not have resolved anything and would require each manufacturer to seek judicial clarification from the courts, which would involve hiring lawyers and waiting months and months for a judgment. Drawing up a list of exemptions did not appear to be the right solution, either. Such a list would never have been exhaustive. We already have legislation on cosmetics, food supplements and medical devices, to name but a few examples. This is legally valid and our task here is not to call it into question, but to resolve a very real problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Here I have a request to make of the Commission and I would actually like it to give an undertaking in this regard, so as to increase the legal security of those active in the field. There is no doubt that it would be helpful if the competent Commission services were to convene a meeting as soon as possible of all of the stakeholders that I have mentioned previously. I believe that this would be particularly important to set their minds at rest. On the basis of this meeting and in the light of rulings already handed down by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, a joint and official interpretative statement could then be published. I sincerely hope that this proposal is acted on, in the same way that I expect the Commission to clarify its position on the Doha Declaration. I know that this too is an essential point for a good number of my fellow Members.</p>
<p class="contents">The issuing of an authorisation for a medicinal product for human or veterinary use does not, however, signal the end of checks on its efficacy and safety. Strengthening pharmacovigilance has therefore been one of our priorities. This has made it necessary to modify the existing provisions: firstly, to make it possible for inspections to be carried out unannounced at the manufacturing source and secondly, to shorten the deadlines for mandatory submission of the periodic reports and to set up a system for the rapid exchange of data collected by all of the partners so as to ensure that the pharmacovigilance systems are applied consistently across the Member States. We have also stressed that pharmacovigilance should be independent and requested that the management of funds earmarked for this purpose remain under the direct supervision of the competent authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow Members and I also wished to take into account the environmental aspect of medicinal products. This point was, moreover, raised with the Executive Director of the EMEA in London, who confirmed that this was a valid approach. However, under no circumstances should this constitute grounds for a marketing authorisation to be refused. We all know, for example, that the products used in chemotherapy may cause harmful chemicals to be discharged into the environment, but we would not consider banning their authorisation. This would not make any sense. The idea here is to assess better the environmental risk and, for all therapeutic classes, to take effective measures to reduce its impact. This is a very important issue for this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wanted, with the support of my fellow Members, to return to the issue of information. It is our responsibility to address the problems that arise. It would have been easy to ignore the subject, but we have not done so. We are therefore asking the European Commission to table a clear paper setting out what exists in this field, to analyse the potential benefits and risks of making information available to patients, to reflect on the responsibility of the information provider and to table proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I do have a number of regrets where these reports are concerned. The most significant concerns the scope of application of the directive and the Council’s refusal to make the centralised procedure obligatory immediately for all new active substances. Here, Parliament has been too European for the Council. The compromise does, however, include some significant pathologies in the scope of application and a review clause in four years’ time will enable us to strengthen this provision and increase equal access to health for every European citizen. I would congratulate my fellow rapporteur, Mrs Müller, who negotiated this.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the EMEA and the composition of its scientific committees are concerned, common sense should prevail. It would seem to me to be inconsistent and even very dangerous if the professionals appointed to sit on these committees did not have a similar level of expertise. It is the criterion of competence and not nationality that will guarantee the quality and effectiveness of the scientific evaluation. We will be very vigilant on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">On homeopathic medicinal products, Parliament wanted to go further than the proposed compromise. I am very aware of this, but advances have been made in the field of mutual recognition. This provision will secure the development of this category of medicines. We should look at what is being proposed and not just at what has not been agreed in the negotiations. It is important to put things in perspective, as it shows that homeopathic medicinal products have not been neglected, just as veterinary medicinal products have not been sacrificed. All of the provisions that I have mentioned so far also apply to all veterinary medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">These directives do not seek, as I have had occasion to hear, to hamper social security systems or to give one sector an advantage over any other. On the contrary, they guarantee the development of a high level of health protection. They facilitate access to products for all patients and encourage scientific research by supporting essential growth in generic medicines. Neither do they divide the fifteen current Member States or the enlargement countries. I hope that tomorrow’s vote is favourable, so that our three institutions are successful in improving human and animal health. I am confident: we have an undertaking from the majority of the political groups. I dare not imagine that it will not be respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> First of all, I would like to thank and warmly congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Müller and Mrs Grossetête, for their work and efforts, particularly in the search for a global compromise with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The review package, as originally proposed by the Commission, had three important objectives: first, to guarantee European citizens a high level of health protection; second, to increase the availability of innovative medicinal products while at the same time encouraging competition with generic products; and third, to prepare for enlargement. I am glad to note that the final compromise proposed by the two rapporteurs and by the Council would indeed meet these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the compromise amendments are concerned, I would like to concentrate on the most important issues. First, the data protection scheme and generic competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wanted to strike the right balance between innovation and generic competition by adjusting criteria for achieving it.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures in favour of generic competition we proposed were agreed upon and even improved on thanks to Parliament’s amendments during the first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding innovative industry, the Commission proposed harmonising the data protection period at 10 years across the board as an essential element for a smoother operation of the single market. This period also represented one of the major tools available in the context of pharmaceutical legislation for rewarding innovation. We also proposed a one-year extension when an innovative indication is granted after initial market authorisation. The current compromise, known as 8+2+1, meets our objectives and expectations. I am fully aware that the impact of this harmonisation in the new Member States was much discussed during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I would like to welcome the provision regarding the non-retroactivity of this harmonisation. This was a preoccupation of the acceding countries and is now a part of the compromise today. This provision will limit the effect of the new protection period to medicinal products authorised after the implementation of the directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, I would like to state that the Commission will give full consideration to any request for a transitional period presented by the new Member States on adoption of the legislative package.</p>
<p class="contents">The rest of the compromise on the data protection scheme and generic competition, including a one-year period in the case of switches and a one-year period for well-established substances in the case of innovative indication and clarification of generic and bio-similar definitions, is also welcome and acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the scope of the centralised procedure and the need to reinforce the role of the European Medicines Agency, despite your support during the first reading, the Council has taken a more limited approach on the scope. The common position did not follow the Commission and Parliament approach, but extended the current scope of the centralised procedure to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">The current compromise further extends that scope, and more importantly, allows for future development. It takes account of some of the most important therapeutic needs of today and probably of the near future. The Commission welcomes the compromise solution.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, the new legislation will consolidate the Agency’s international role and will increase its role in key sectors such as market surveillance, pharmacovigilance and public awareness of medicinal products. This development is also to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">To perform these tasks, the Agency had to undergo some adjustment, and the compromise amendments related to its administrative structure, and in particular the composition of the management board and of the scientific committees, meet this objective on the whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the environmental aspects. The possible effects of the use of medicinal products on the environment is important. The question needed to be addressed carefully as, at the end of the day, the availability of certain medicines was at stake. The compromise amendments, which require an environmental impact assessment and possible mitigating measures but leave the criteria for granting the marketing authorisation untouched, are to be seen as a well-balanced solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, the implementation of the Doha Decision concerning the granting of compulsory licences for the export of patented medicines to countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity. First of all, I would like to stress and reiterate the Commission’s political commitment to ensuring that the implementation of this decision is facilitated and that the right conditions are in place for its operation and efficient application.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Amendments Nos 6 and 19 pose a problem of form because a clause regulating the exports cannot be part of a directive dealing with the placing of medicines on the Community market. This proposal concerns only market authorisation in Europe. It in no way impacts on exports of medicines from Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission fully agrees with the principle of the implementation of the WTO General Council Decision of 30 August 2003, both at Community and at Member State level, in the context of the patent legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission undertakes to address the implementation of this decision in the EU as a matter of the highest priority in early 2004 with a view to bringing forward an appropriate legislative proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, information to patients. The Commission’s attempt to modernise this part of the legislation has not been as fruitful as I would have wished. However, I am pleased to note that the issue is now part of the compromise. I would like to ensure that we make steady progress towards a future Community information strategy to deal with this question.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning recommendations for second reading from Mrs Müller and Mrs Grossetête, the Commission can accept entirely the global compromise package as proposed by the Council and accepted by the two rapporteurs. As to Mrs Müller's request, once the legislation is adopted my services will organise a hearing with a view to adequately implement Article 2(2), where all stakeholders will be given the possibility to have input.</p>
<p class="contents">This compromise allows the settlement of a number of important questions and a dynamic approach to the tasks of the agency and the scope of this centralised procedure. The proposed harmonisation of the data protection scheme, irrespective of the procedure used, is a major improvement. I would also like to reiterate the importance of the new environmental features introduced in the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the veterinary legislation, we also note that if the provisions have been brought into line globally with those of the human medicinal products directive, some specificity has been adequately kept, in particular concerning environmental impact.</p>
<p class="contents">In the veterinary sector, environmental impact may determine the final authorisation of the given product and therefore constitutes a criterion for its evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to urge Members of Parliament to support the two rapporteurs on the approval of the compromise so as to conclude, at this stage, the legislative process of the pharmaceutical review for the benefit of all European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My warmest thanks therefore go to Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Müller, Commissioner Liikanen, and Mr Brunet, as well as to Mr Silano from the Italian Presidency who intelligently and openly contributed to drawing up these compromises that have finally been accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the main aim of all of the institutions is finally to have new legislation that allows European citizens to have equal opportunities and to have access, as soon as possible, to new, more powerful drugs, which are more selective<span class="bold"> </span>and more easily tolerated than existing ones, hopefully at a reasonable price.</p>
<p class="contents">I will focus on just a few points. As regards the composition of the management board of the European Drugs Agency, the current compromise proposal is preferable both to the initial Commission proposal and to the one from the rapporteur Mrs Müller, which, in my view, contains major deep-rooted conflicts. The management board, as approved, will be predominantly institutional – as I had personally wished for on a number of occasions – with the addition of two representatives from the Patients’ Association and two from the Doctors’ Association.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I am satisfied with the length of the data protection period because this agreement is, in my view, very well balanced and will, on the one hand, give new impetus and incentives to European industries to invest more in scientific research and, on the other hand, will allow them to respond to ethical requirements, by implementing a solidarity policy towards developing countries and also towards some of new Europe’s accession countries. The agreement reached to see a further data protection period in the case of a ‘switch’, as well as in the case of new therapeutic indications for well-known medicinal products, is also a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point of the agreement regards the development of an EMEA centralised procedure for the marketing authorisation of new medicinal products. As I have stressed on numerous occasions, I agreed with the initial Commission proposal and I am convinced that new medicinal products should in future be subject to authorisation by the EMEA.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that in Europe the pharmacovigilance system, which I outlined as a pharmacologist and that guarantees maximum protection of citizens, will be made more efficient and transparent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is always a danger that a trialogue before second reading will turn into a kind of Bermuda triangle of lost hopes and failed expectations. That has not happened in this case, and we can all accept the achievements that we have. Everyone has sacrificed something to find a balance. I accept that the failure to accommodate the Doha amendments, the further recognition of homeopathic medicines and the limited extension of data exclusivity for switch products will leave some here with heavy hearts.</p>
<p class="contents">It is when I turn to the third report on veterinary medicinal products – which the Commissioner dealt with briefly – that I confess to some further anxiety. Again, I support the compromise amendments: they enhance the EMEA, they recognise some limits to the status of prescription-only medicines, which we all support and welcome, and they allow options in relation to the centralised procedure. Nevertheless, they could go further in acknowledging the position of some Member States, including my own, where routine medicines are used by qualified persons, but not veterinarians.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 27 would have allowed an explicit derogation to allow this to continue, alongside prescription-only medicines. The Commission indicated before second reading that Amendment No 27 was acceptable in principle - it was not to the Council. Nevertheless, I hope to hear from the Commissioner, when he winds up this debate, that there will be a subtle and consensual solution to this dilemma that will be in the spirit of compromise and of the Christmas season as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ries (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Liikanen, I too should like first of all to congratulate my two fellow Members, Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Müller, on their excellent work on this review of pharmaceutical legislation, which is undoubtedly one of the most important public health dossiers of this parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have on the table today is a package of amendments that has been negotiated by the two rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs and the Italian Presidency. It is an overall compromise, a balanced compromise, which has been accepted by the majority of the Member States and which gives guarantees and proposes measures to foster the growth of both branded and generic medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement with the Council incorporates a series of proposals that are dear to our hearts. I am not going to repeat what has already been said by previous speakers, particularly on the subject of pharmacovigilance or the EMEA and the centralised procedure. However, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the five-yearly renewal of authorisations, which will enable the national authorities to remove medicinal products from the market if they are no longer effective; the clear distinction that needs to be drawn between information and advertising, together with the Commission’s undertaking to table a report on current practices; the collection of waste and the environmental impact of medicines, and the Braille inscription on the packaging – which has not yet been mentioned – for the partially sighted. Finally, and most importantly, I would draw your attention to the fact that the definition of generic medicines has been broadened and the eurogenerics concept has been introduced. This will harmonise and facilitate conditions for launching generics across Europe, and constitutes a major step forward in this review. Our rapporteur mentioned it, but it has not been stressed enough so far. I was also delighted with Commissioner Liikanen’s response to Mrs Grossetête’s question about so-called ‘borderline’ products, whose status does require further clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to what has been – it has to be said – the real battleground in Parliament and between the Member States from the outset: the question of data protection. The 8+2+1 formula should be supported, as that is what we need today: a win-win approach, I would say, which will promote research, which is crucial for Europe, and provide better patient access to less expensive medicines, with the impact that we know this will have on our governments’ health budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">To my fellow Members and representatives of the four Member States who voted against this fair compromise and continue, in their efforts to defend health at a lower cost, to take data protection as their main, if not in many cases their only, target – as if the debate could be limited to this question alone – I should like to say that they are taking a huge risk. The risk that they are taking is no more and no less than that of seeing Europe become nothing but a sales counter and of letting the United States become the only country where innovation takes place. I will remind you of just one figure. Since 1996, the proportion of new medicinal products launched worldwide by Europe has fallen from 55% to 28% – in other words, it has halved – and I am not talking here about turnover but about insufficient investment in research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it is important that we do not choose the wrong target or strategy in this debate. If the essential objective for Europe is to continue to care for its patients, and care for them well – and we all agree on this – then we need to pursue a genuine policy of innovation, stem the brain drain, fight against parallel imports and, as I was saying, promote, not a head-on collision between industry and generics, which would be fruitless, but a win-win approach, which will be of the greatest benefit to patients. On behalf of the Liberal Group, which I am representing, I think that this is what we have succeeded in achieving here at the end of two years of work together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that, at that time, I had hoped for a lot more than this compromise package, negotiated with the Council and the Commission, which will be put to the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, this process of revision of the procedures for European marketing authorisation of human and veterinary medicinal products should lead to a radical development of the criteria for evaluating and authorising medicinal products in the interests of patients, public health and health-care professionals. The principal aim of this revision was to have the European Agency legally recognise all of the new substances. In actual fact, the centralised procedure will only focus on some illnesses. The London Agency has sufficiently enlarged its sphere of activity to ensure its funding, but the national authorities have, for their part, retained the most lucrative classes of medicinal products, namely those regarding neurodegenerative disorders or cardiovascular diseases. The interests of the Commission and the Council are safe, but are they those of the patients?</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above introducing Braille, we have improved pharmacovigilance and transparency in patients’ interests, but it is true that some last-minute Council compromises subtly weakened these gains. The majority of the documents relating to the evaluation of medicinal products should be publicly accessible, but what about pharmacovigilance reports? The public authorities responsible for issuing authorisations should be independent of companies but remain, in actual fact, dependent upon private taxation. Patients do not have the means to directly inform the competent authorities of the side effects of medicinal products, and doctors are not obliged to do so. It is a great victory, however, that advertising for medicinal products subject to prescription was rejected, but until when?</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of public health, the environmental impact of the new medicinal products should be assessed. This should not be the sole evaluation criteria, but it must be considered in the benefit-risk equation for a medicinal product and, therefore, be one of the conditions for granting a marketing authorisation. The environmental risk goes far beyond the damage to nature; pollution linked to discharges of toxic residue from medicinal products represents a risk to human health. Clearly, treatments for which the medical benefits outweigh the environmental risks should continue to be used. When effective alternatives exist, however, they should be promoted. I am sorry to say that the final wording of the amendments concerned does not recognise the full scale of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">For a doctor such as myself, the evaluation of the effectiveness of medicinal products compared to others is sorely lacking in this new pharmaceutical package. It is only the safety and the quality of the new substances<span class="bold"> </span>that<span class="bold"> </span>count. It is of little importance whether or not they provide a significant clinical benefit. I endeavoured to make the concept of added therapeutic value acceptable in order to encourage firms to carry out research into substances that are genuinely innovative, and I came up against the opposition of all of the institutions. I was, however, persuaded that this debate will return to this House, because the pharmaceutical industry no longer wants to make do with placing new bogus treatments on the market and overprotecting them for years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the major cause of friction related to the authorisation of generic medicinal products. The pharmaceutical industry is trying to delay the sale of generic products, and this is normal. The Commission and some Members shared this reaction, however, by restricting the definition of generic products, tightening the conditions for granting authorisations and extending the periods for authorisation by using various tricks: switch, new indications etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite opposition from the majority of Member States faced with problems of funding their social security, the first European medicinal products will have the longest protection period of administrative data in the world. I wonder, furthermore, about the compatibility of such protection with the Doha provisions that call for the creation of generic medicines for export. That is certainly the main concern raised by this legislation when it comes to funding public health. Finally, another major disappointment was in the area of homeopathic medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact and in conclusion, I recognise that we have made much progress, and I welcome this, but it is true that there still remains a great deal to do in the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I still take issue with two points: patent protection and homeopathic medicinal products. In May, ten countries will be joining the European Union. Naturally, they are most welcome; at least that is what we tell them. Of course, saying and doing are two different things. That is also evident today: the proposals that the Commission and the Council have made here can hardly be called a warm welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">For one thing, the compromise on patent protection is extremely disadvantageous for the new Member States. In the accession negotiations, it was agreed with these countries that they would include a protection period of six years in their legislation. The ‘8 + 2 + 1’ compromise would mean health care in these countries becoming much more expensive: to the tune of hundreds of millions a year.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Liikanen may well promise a transitional period, and I welcome that in itself, but it is less than was agreed. Amendment No 55, which I and my colleague Mrs Corbey have tabled and which has the support of a large number of observers, returns to the new Member States what they were promised, thus translating our good words into good deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point is that the compromise proposal on the table also pays particularly scant regard to homeopathic medicinal products, even though a substantial majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy did advocate this. One hundred and ten million Europeans use these medicinal products, and we must not deny them this. I therefore call on my fellow Members to support Amendment Nos 20, 21, 22, 23 and 38. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I was chairing the debates on Mrs Grossetête's and Mrs Müller's reports in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I was presented with a petition, which I have with me here tonight. It was signed by a large number of members of the observer teams from the accession states. Almost all the accession states are there represented. Certainly a very large number of Polish observers are very worried about this proposal. I support the Grossetête and Müller reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate both our rapporteurs, and I imagine that they will be very glad to see the back of these three proposals. They have done very good work.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also support the ten-year data exclusivity period for the present 15 Member States. But I am very aware that the accession states have recently negotiated legislation in their own countries to put the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> on to their statute book, and that included a period of data exclusivity of six years.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in danger here tonight of glossing over something very important, and I cannot understand why, given that the accession states were able to ask for derogation periods, we are not already hearing exactly what derogation periods they are asking for. Part of the trouble may be the responsibility of the accession states themselves: they have not yet asked the Commission the Commissioner can tell us this for delays, temporary derogations, extensions, etc. It would be far better, however, and in the interests of transparency, if, before we adopted this legislation - and I know that it is almost too late - we had a list of the derogations requested from the accession states in order to build these into the preamble to the existing directives before us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Liikanen may say that is impossible. If he does, he is wrong, because that is precisely what we have done in the draft directive on packaging, which we have almost concluded. The accession states asked for certain derogations. We asked what the dates were. They gave us the dates. The Commission said that these dates were fairly acceptable. We then built into the packaging directive preamble reference to the dates of derogations that the accession states requested. If we adopt the legislation before us now without specific reference to the negotiations and to the deadlines requested by the accession states, then we are in danger of producing legislation which is not transparent, because nothing will appear in the Official Journal alongside these directives drawing attention to the deadlines available to the accession states before they need to implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very bad way of proceeding. I have some sympathy with the Poles and others who are worried about this. I can see that it is necessary for the health of the western European pharmaceutical industry for us to go for the ten-year data exclusivity period, but we need to be fair to the accession states and, above all, we need to be transparent about the arrangements that we reach with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very happy that this Parliament, together with the Council, has succeeded in refining the Commission’s proposals substantially, which were indeed very sweeping and liberal at first. What is being served up is of course a compromise, with some elements that are good and some that are not so good. In any case, it is a good thing that all medicinal products<span class="bold"> </span>falling under EU regulations will have to comply with the same criteria of quality, safety and efficacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing of great importance is that commercial advertising is still outlawed. Do you recall the original Commission proposals, which, as a pilot project, sought to permit advertising of medicinal products for AIDS, asthma and diabetes? In my view, patient information must be guaranteed to be reliable and objective. It is logical, therefore, that this flow of information be organised and coordinated by the public sector in the first instance. I am pleased that the Commission is now being given the task of putting forward proposals, based on an overview of the current situation, to bring about improved, objective information provision, which, in my opinion, will have to include information and sales via the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The duration of data protection, however, is less positive, in my opinion. After all, in comparison with the United States or Japan, for example, the period of protection for medicinal products<span class="bold"> </span>in Europe is extremely long. Admittedly, it is a good thing that, from the eighth year, the generic pharmaceuticals industry will be able to start some preparatory work in order that it may place generic medicinal products<span class="bold"> </span>on the market from the tenth year. In my opinion, however, there are too many possibilities for an extra year’s protection to be added, for example when a new indication can be proved. In my view, this was entirely unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope, therefore, that the Commission will monitor the situation closely to ensure that these possibilities are not abused. Finally, I also regret the absence of an amendment on Doha. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have reached a good compromise: eight years for generic medicinal products, to begin with: the European Parliament achieved this. The ten years has been dropped. The Dutch Government voted against the common position since it would mean an extra EUR 160 million expenditure per year in the Netherlands alone.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, the European Parliament reached a good compromise of between six and eight years. We have held on to this, and have also been able to push it through in the face of opposition from the Council and the Commission. The centralised procedure via the EMEA in London is increasingly becoming the norm for an increasing number of medicinal products. That is a good thing. In this regard, too, Parliament has put its stamp on the legislation in no uncertain terms. We should have liked more, but the compromise is acceptable. It was very important to us, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to incorporate the environmental effects of medicinal products into that Community legislation. REACH does not do this – a small error on the part of our brilliant commissioner. That deficiency has now been remedied, however. In the case of veterinary medicinal products, negative environmental effects can even lead to a blockade. That is not the case with human medicinal products, but negative effects will indeed be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy that the Commission has spoken out on Doha and stated that it will present legislation in early 2004. We shall hold the Commission to this.</p>
<p class="contents">American advertising of medicinal products is and remains banned. We in the Verts/ALE Group welcome this. We shall have to discuss later on how provision of information to patients can be improved via websites and telephone helplines, and indeed that is the crux of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Direct patient reporting did not make it. Member States can develop this further, however, and some of them will do so, and the subject will return to the agenda later. The line between food supplements and medicinal products is not sufficiently well defined. Let us hope that the Commission will conduct an accommodating policy on this. Homeopathic medicinal products did not make it. We in the Verts/ALE Group shall continue to fight for these. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we have a good compromise package on the table and I will work to ensure that this House votes for it by a large majority tomorrow. The most important point, in my view, is that we will have a uniform system of protection in Europe. Regardless of whether we think that eight or nine years is the right period, I believe it is very important, in an internal market, that we do not have the differences which have hitherto existed in Europe. That is a major step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I also greatly welcome the fact that we have been able to achieve an additional year of protection for existing substances. Progress sometimes proceeds at a snail’s pace, and it is not always a new substance that brings improvements. Sometimes, improvements can also be achieved through studies on existing substances. I think we have achieved very important progress here.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that at first reading, there were a number of points which were already non-contentious but were nonetheless very important. We need to speed up procedures. We also need to speed up the procedures further where particularly important medicines are concerned, and we need an adjustment of the structures of the European Medicines Agency to the EU of the Twenty-Five. All this is very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think we were right to reject the Commission’s proposal on information and advertising. The Commissioner has expressed his regret yet again that this was the case, saying that the Commission was proposing to modernise this part of the legislation. I am still sceptical. Let me give you a specific example to show why I am so sceptical. The industry claims that it merely wants to provide information and naturally has no intention of engaging in the type of aggressive advertising that we are familiar with from the USA. A few weeks ago, I was in Bratislava in Slovakia, which is not yet part of the EU but thankfully will be joining on 1 May 2004. Opposite my hotel, there was a large billboard. It showed two people – a couple – lying listlessly in bed. Above them, there was Pfizer’s little blue pill – Viagra – and the name of the website: <span class="underline">www.potentia.sk</span></p>
<p class="contents">I thought to myself: ‘So this is the objective information that the industry wants to supply to patients via the Internet.’ This was advertising, and I for one would prefer not to have this type of advertising in Europe. It is not that I have anything against Viagra, but I think that in view of its side effects, Viagra should not be marketed on the Internet but should be prescribed by doctors. Objective information should also not be supplied in the manner depicted on the billboard. That is why I think we were right to reject this proposal and accept Mrs Grossetête’s compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we have achieved a great deal. Sadly, we have surrendered on one point, Commissioner. We said that we would not include paediatric medicinal products in this legislation so that the rules on paediatrics could be adopted more swiftly than the overall package. Unfortunately, we still do not have a proposal from the Commission. Regrettably, I must say to the Commissioner that the Commission should keep its Christmas break short. We expect your proposal on paediatric medicinal products in January. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The amendments improve the common position, but, as far as I am concerned, it is not necessary to wrap the pharmaceutical industry up in cotton wool any longer or any more. At the start of the second reading, I put a number of questions regarding the new Member States on the table. I shall not pursue these, as I fully agree with what my colleagues Mr Blokland and Mrs Jackson have said on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is much more fundamental and concerns the manufacture of medicinal products for developing countries that are undergoing a serious health crisis. In early December it became known that AIDS has claimed five million lives over the last five years. This is a serious situation, but there is hope. On 30 August, on the eve of the WTO Conference in Cancun, the United States, the EU and developing countries came to an agreement speeding up the enablement of the manufacture of generic medicinal products for developing countries. It was not an enormous agreement, but it was a start nevertheless. However, we must now put that into practice. I cannot understand why the Council, the Commission and some fellow MEPs are not prepared to do what the European Union decided before the Cancun Conference. The Commission seems to be of the opinion that this matter belongs with the Community patent and national patents legislation. That does not seem to me to be an acceptable stance, because we do have data protection. That is exactly what this legislation is about.</p>
<p class="contents">A minute ago, Commissioner, you asked me to name a specific medicinal product that cannot now be manufactured on account of data protection, and AZT is such a medicinal product. Now, as it was at first reading, Parliament is prepared to get involved, and several resolutions have been adopted, for example the report by Mrs Sandbæk from the Committee on Development and Cooperation, which unanimously called for the Doha agreement to be implemented in this legislation. Finally, I have two questions for you, Commissioner. Firstly, you have just said that you are prepared to introduce, in the near future, the legislative measures enabling the implementation of the decision of 30 August. When can we expect a proposal from you, and is it possible that that will take place in January? Secondly, I am assuming that products manufactured in the European Union are always authorised in the EU. Are you now stating that the data protection in this legislation does not constitute the slightest obstacle to the manufacture of generic medicinal products for developing countries by European undertakings? If not, are you prepared to amend this legislation again if necessary? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can agree that what we have here is a hard-won compromise, a compromise in which a large number of Parliament’s wishes, in particular, are also fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not Parliament who is the winner here, however. The winner is the citizen, who will soon be given the possibility of obtaining a good supply of medicinal products, quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">A compromise cannot be achieved, however, without some watering down. I accept that it is not possible to win on every point. May I add some criticisms, however? The first relates to the decision on pharmacists that was taken in the compromise. I understand that that amendment did not fit in the legislation as it stood. A good supply of medicinal products also requires, however, that pharmacists make their know-how available, not only to patients, but also, in particular, to those writing out the prescriptions.</p>
<p class="contents">That is an omission. If we do not regulate this here and now, I shall fight for its regulation in further legislation dealing with the quality of health care. As far as I am concerned, it must not be the case that the only places still concerned with medicinal products are supermarkets, because it is cheaper that way.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns homeopathic medicinal products. On this subject, the compromise achieved does all users of these medicinal products a great injustice. I ask myself why the compromise that has now been achieved would fail if we now voted for a couple of original amendments, such as Amendment No 20. I know that some fellow Members have requested a separate vote. I have the feeling that we are failing to answer the questions of many on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like a definite answer to the following question. Why do we not go further with these homeopathic medicinal products? After all, what has now been adopted in this compromise does not by any means present a solution. I am genuinely sad about this.</p>
<p class="contents">My next point concerns Doha and medicinal products. I agree with Mrs Corbey’s comments. Unlike my fellow MEP Mr Liese, I think that it is a shame that we still do not consider our European citizens fit for independence when it comes to information on medicinal products. I am not in favour of advertising; I am, however, in favour of information. I think that an independent citizen should be able to obtain the information he or she needs in Europe, too, instead of being redirected from the website of a European undertaking to that of a US undertaking to find this information. I think that that is a shame. We have missed an opportunity. Those were my remarks, and I should like an answer from the Commission regarding homeopathy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I recognise all that they have done. I would simply like to say to you that the compromise, which consists in providing medicines with data protection for eight years, plus two, plus one, is a great New Year gift from the European Parliament to the pharmaceutical industry and recognition of the effectiveness of powerful lobbies.</p>
<p class="contents">This gift will, however, further deepen the deficits for the Member States’ social security budgets by delaying the marketing of generic medicines. Why such generosity? The pharmaceutical industry put forward the reason that it must fund research, but studies have proven that only a fifth of new medicinal products launched on the market during the last twenty years were really innovations. In addition, the New York Times writes that two thirds of medicinal products approved between 1989 and 2000 were only minor modifications of existing medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, if our social security systems urgently need generic medicines, then what about developing countries where 95% of AIDS victims live and where there are also a large number of endemic diseases? There, the lack of generic medicines is,<span class="bold"> </span>quite<span class="bold"> </span>simply, criminal. Amendment No 19 of the Grossetête report refers to this. For goodness sake, let us adopt this and uphold the spirit of Doha.

<p class="contents">There is a lot of good in the package before us but, if we are honest, there are a lot of problems as well. We have tried to do too much, too fast, with the threat of conciliation and enlargement used as the big stick to knock us into line. I object. In the months and years ahead we will pay the price, not least to the lawyers who unfortunately will have a field day.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Liikanen, you mentioned that one of the objectives included the need to prepare for enlargement. I say to you that a race to conclude this package before enlargement is not the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Human Medicines Directive, concerns have been raised that, with the wide definition of medicinal products and the supremacy clause, it is possible that food and food supplements, cosmetics and medical devices could all be classified as drugs. The Commission's and the Council's solution to this problem is to insert wording in recital 7 Amendment No 60 to the effect that: 'Where a product comes clearly under the definition of other product categories ... this directive should not apply', thereby distinguishing between medicinal products and other products.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem with this solution is that recital 7 will not have any legally binding effect. Indeed this recital will not actually go into the Pharmaceuticals Directive itself. I have seen an expert legal opinion which advises that, unless modified, the Pharmaceuticals Directive will completely subsume the Food Supplements Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two specific questions on this, which I would like you to answer, Commissioner. Why did the Commission and the Council not propose that the recital 7 wording should go into the operative article of the directive to ensure that it has legal effect? What assurance can the Commission give that even if recital 7 wording is not put into an operative part of the directive, it will still be effective in addressing the problem of borderline or frontier products?</p>
<p class="contents">The Veterinary Medicinal Directive would have benefited significantly if it had been dealt with on its own rather than as part of a package. It has not had the scrutiny it deserves, not least in the working groups where it has been dragged along in the wake of the Human Medicines Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Liikanen, you accepted my amendment consolidated Amendment No 3 at first reading over 12 months ago on the prescription-only medicines issue. You accepted this in principle, but the text presented to the Council and hence the second reading in Parliament of the common position amounted to the deliberate thwarting of the clearly expressed will of Parliament on three occasions and your own will as Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position now requires all medicines for use in food-producing species to be subject to veterinary prescription, but with the possibility of an exempted list of medicines being available without prescription. From considerable correspondence with you, Commissioner, it is clear to me that the exemptive list will contain very few medicines and is not a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Medicines must be available to the farmer in a sensible manner. Animal welfare and food safety must be our priority. We all appreciate the ability to purchase certain medicines over the counter, without the need to go to the doctor. Simple pain relievers, cough medicines, vitamin supplements are cases in point. Likewise the farmer should have access to certain medicines without the need to consult a veterinary surgeon. By making access to medicines too difficult, use will decline and animal welfare will suffer. The use of preventative medicines such as vaccines will decline and we will end up treating sick animals with antibiotics, as opposed to protecting the animal against disease.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a food safety issue. All our information confirms that residues arise from medicines that are already the subject of a prescription regime in all Member States, namely antibiotics. Putting even more medicines into the prescription regime will do nothing for food safety. Food safety can only be improved by intensive monitoring programmes and large penalties for anyone who violates the residue limits.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome the proposed resolution of the present crisis concerning the availability of veterinary medicines for a range of minor species, including equine veterinary medicines, but this crisis arose because of inadequate scrutiny and inadequate understanding of a previous directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, there is no public veterinary medicine as in human medicine, only private veterinary medicine. We have an extra duty of care on grounds of animal welfare, the integrity of the veterinary practice, the truth about the impact of the food chain and, most importantly, the economic viability of our farmers. We turn to you to ensure that in future there is protection in all these areas, and proper scrutiny, particularly of the Veterinary Medicines Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The pharmaceutical review is important for EU citizens. In this review we are not only encouraging research and innovation but we are also trying to get generic medicines on to the market more quickly. This will cost the taxpayer less.

The tragedy is that human and veterinary medicines have been confused rather, because both of them are combined in one report. We should really be looking at them quite separately. I will come back to that in a moment. On that score I agree totally with what Mrs Doyle said.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to thank both the UK and the Irish Permanent Representatives for their work. It is a pity that their work on this report has been rejected by some Member States. The Council's co-called common position is not at all a compromise: it is merely a way of expressing the Commission's original proposals, and the Commission has made it clear that any listing of products arising from comitology proposals will largely be under its control.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position would mean, as Mrs Doyle quite rightly said, that many rural small businesses would be put out of business. That is of particular importance. There has been huge confusion here and this is where the Council seems to have got it totally and utterly wrong that we are asking for exemption for prescription medicines. That is not the case: they are already covered under food safety regulations and completely off the record as far as we are concerned. We are not asking for that sort of thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Doyle quite rightly said that while you can go to the chemist's and get a pill for a headache, the problem is that in the United Kingdom and Ireland you can go to similar locally registered people where you can get flea powder, teat-dip for cows all those sort of things. And we are going to put at risk not only animal health but also animal welfare and the whole principle, because people just will not bother to pay the money for a vet. That is very important. This is already covered, as I have already said, by legislation. In the United Kingdom we do not eat horses, dogs, cats, or budgerigars for that matter, so these should not apply.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to you that if you cannot accept this sort of proposal then maybe we should have taken veterinary medicines out of this particular proposal and had a separate piece of legislation for it. In fact, tomorrow, if you are not prepared to accept what Mrs Doyle and I are saying, it might be an idea to vote against this particular piece of legislation and send it back to committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe this compromise is a gift to European citizens and not, as some Members of the House might think, to the pharmaceuticals industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I take a different view. Those of us who have worked intensively on this package of legislation and are familiar with the details also know that the situation is different. With the EMEA, we have created efficient structures which safeguard the quality of evaluations, thus ensuring that safe medicinal products are available to patients.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a database containing a wealth of information for patients, doctors and, indeed, for companies themselves. We have transparent authorisation procedures, and we have information about adverse reactions, to cite just a few examples of what we have achieved for patients. We have a centralised authorisation procedure which covers a wide range of indications. As a result, a great many new and innovative medicinal products are subject to the centralised procedure and can be made available at an early stage to patients. We have asked the Commission to compile information and guidelines to ensure that the information supplied to patients is genuinely independent. All these are things which directly benefit patients. In five years’ time, we will have a new authorisation procedure, which will include a cost-benefit analysis. In other words, we have achieved a great deal for patients. That is why I would ask everyone to be rather more cautious, perhaps, in their arguments for and against this package.</p>
<p class="contents">On the two points concerning the WTO, I have tabled an amendment myself, but I think the most sensible approach is for the Commission to put forward a proposal next year which deals fully with this topic and does not simply produce detailed legislation on the hoof, which would not be a good approach. I therefore urge all fellow Members who may have a rather critical viewpoint to support this compromise tomorrow. It will benefit Europe’s citizens, and that is a real gift to patients, no one else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to state at the beginning that I totally support the view put forward by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on homeopathic medicine. However, as the report I want to deal with tonight is on prescription-only medicine, those are probably the only pleasant comments I will make tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this something you really want to take forward? Both Mr Sturdy and Mrs Doyle asked whether this should not have come forward in separate legislation. Surely common sense, somewhere, some time, must prevail, even within the European Commission. Surely! You must listen to what people are saying and the concerns that they have. Is this not, once again, total interference in the internal affairs of people within their own nation state? When will you ever learn?</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to speak on prescription-only medicine because it will have a tremendous effect on my constituency in Northern Ireland. We have an efficient, workable, effective system of agricultural merchants. Mr Sturdy and Mrs Doyle have said that they have the same system in their own areas as well. It works, is effective and does not need to be scrutinised in this way. It has done that for centuries. What harm has ever been done by those agricultural merchants?</p>
<p class="contents">All you will do, Commissioner, is drive this trade into the black market. You will drive it underground. You will drive people to sell on the black market, under the counter. That is all you will do and that is what you have done in many other policies, from fishing to every other area in the European Union. The European Union and the Commission are not listening to what the people on the ground are saying. That is what you must do.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this is essentially a UK, Irish and perhaps also a Dutch problem. But we have that problem. And you have to reflect on what we are doing. I am amazed by the dictatorial attitude that has come forward from the Commission and indeed from some Member States that want their own way at all costs: get what you want, regardless of the rest! This sends out the wrong message. In my opinion that is not what Europe is all about. Europe is about much more than this. Europe can be much more than this. You will deserve what you get, in the longer term, when they start to go underground.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge this House to support the amendment put forward by Mrs Doyle and others. That is the way forward. I hope, Commissioner, that you will reflect upon that, go back to your college of Commissioners and say that this has to be looked at again. You must be flexible. You must allow for what has been handed down and what works in certain areas at this moment in time. Do not force decent, honest people to go underground; do not force them into the black market.</p>
<p class="contents">I am terribly unhappy that the United Kingdom Government is backing out and not supporting its industry through Coreper. It is chickening out of the situation. It says it is going to do it by the back door, which will end up placing a tremendous responsibility on farmers and many other people in my constituency and other areas. Once again I ask you to support the amendment put forward by Mrs Doyle and the rest of us, as a way forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem here is that whenever we try to put the whole of Europe together and try to bring in legislation that suits every Member State, one size does not fit all, and that is why I urge this House to support Amendments Nos 27 and 28 by Mrs Doyle.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the medicines which at present farmers in Ireland and the UK buy not from vets but from general suppliers are either drenches for worms or vaccines and they are administered by the farmers. Therefore, it is not the case that the vet will do the administration; these drugs will just be bought from the vets. Vets will then have a monopoly on the sale of these commodities and it puts farmers again at a competitive disadvantage. We have been told many times by the new world that farmers have to live in that they have to face up to responsibilities and the marketplace and yet here we are preventing them from being able to compete in buying those medicines. It is absolutely crazy to try to force this through.</p>
<p class="contents">I echo again what Mr Nicholson said. I rather fear that the UK Government, having said all along that it would support the farming industry so they would be able to buy these medicines from suppliers and not from vets, has capitulated and caved in. Therefore, it is up to this Parliament to put this legislation forward in a way that will allow flexibility between Member States. That is what we are being asked for. A huge fuss is being made about food safety, but this is not the issue, because these drugs, wormers and vaccines can be bought from suppliers. They can be registered there and therefore we will know when the farmers have bought them. The farmers will then administer them, so there is no need go through all the procedure of veterinary prescription and vets-only medicines. Therefore, I urge the House once again to support Amendments Nos 27 and 28 by Mrs Doyle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Grossetête (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, all the same I would like to respond to some objections made by my fellow Members. First of all, I am disappointed to see behind me that Mrs Jackson left a long time ago. I would have liked to tell her what I am going to do and I will also give her an answer in writing tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="contents">We have concerns regarding the enlargement countries. These formed part of the discussions that we had with the Council and the Commission so that, quite rightly, the difficulties that some enlargement countries, but not all, could face with the application of this pharmaceutical legislation were taken into consideration. We know, furthermore, that the Commission has made a commitment to propose derogations for some enlargement countries as soon as this legislative package is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, I would also have liked to tell Mrs Jackson that, this morning, I received a letter from one of our observers from the Czech Republic who declared that he fully supported protecting data for eight years, plus two, plus one, feeling that this was an acceptable compromise between protecting data for six years and the proposal to protect it for ten years plus one. He is completely aware that it is important to protect patent rights whilst allowing generic medicines to enter the internal market. This is a letter which I will make available to my fellow Members. It is not the only one that we have received in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would also like to reply to the British and Irish Members on the issue of veterinary medicinal products. When I hear my fellow Member, Mrs Doyle, say that we have proceeded much too quickly, I really do find this rather appalling, being aware of the discussions that we have been having for months with the Commission and the Council; hours of discussions to quite rightly find a good compromise. When it is an issue of animal safety, I believe that we cannot prevaricate on this issue either. When it is an issue of animals raised for food production, you will understand that the concept of safety is essential in this case. It is essential for us and it is essential for the Council. We also had a large number of discussions about this too.</p>
<p class="contents">The British Members declared that there ought to be separate legislation, but that is what we have! I would like you to look at the texts. We have two directives and today we are discussing two directives. One regards medicinal products for human use and the other regards veterinary medicinal products. There are simply a number of provisions regarding the directive on medicinal products for human use that are the same as the provisions for the directive on veterinary medicinal products. I would, therefore, like you to look closely at these texts, before speaking, in order to avoid this type of mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">When you refer to something that is specific to Britain and Ireland – and I hope that it is not because of this specific characteristic that you are going to take the risk of not adopting this compromise – I would like to remind you that Article 67 of the common position rightly provides for derogations, medicine by medicine. You, therefore, already have the answer in the text. All the same, I would like there to be a little more honesty in this type of discussion. When you tell us that horses are not in fact part of the diet in the United Kingdom, then you really should not forget, and you know this all too well, that when these horses are no longer of use in the United Kingdom, then they are exported to other Member States to end up on our butchers’ stalls. This is why there should be much more safety regarding the prescription of veterinary medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still many things to be said but I would like to finally conclude by stressing that we ended up with compromises that were especially difficult to reach and that the Italian Presidency made the necessary effort to consider a number of requests that it did not intend to take into consideration at the start, and it would be particularly serious to be responsible for not adopting these compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">Like my fellow Member Mrs Müller, I appeal to your sense of responsibility: do not allow yourselves to adopt amendments that are not part of the compromises. You would call these compromises into question. That means to say that there would certainly be conciliation, Mrs Doyle, but it is not absolutely certain that we would obtain the results that we amassed today. I therefore ask you to adopt these compromises tomorrow and, above all, not to risk, or be responsible for, allowing what we have achieved through weeks of work to run aground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. Mr President, I would like to reply to at least those Members who asked questions and who are still present.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Mrs Corbey's written question on Doha. If I rephrase your question it will be easier to give a reply. I want to be very precise here. Authorisation is needed for medicines only in the EU market, so this legislation concerns medicines which are authorised for the Community market. Mrs Corbey asks whether I declare that data protection does not hinder and here I rephrase it the production of the medicines in the EU to be authorised in the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">If I rephrase it like this, then my reply is 'yes'. It means that this legislation concerns the authorisation to market products in the EU. If TRIPS and patents mean that products produced in one country can be exported to a developing country, this has no impact, because this protection only concerns authorisation to market: it is not linked to manufacturing. We are not regulating manufacturing via this regulation, we are regulating authorisation to market. There is one small exception: Bolar provision, because there is always some production as regards generics.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully share the concerns of Mrs Corbey, Mr Whitehead and many others that we must respect Doha. Doha takes a strict position on the patent. It does not take a position on data protection. Data protection is not linked to market authorisation outside the EU. Products outside the EU will be authorised for placing on the market by the authorities of those third countries, according to their legislation. I hope that this has clarified the situation. This does not hinder in any way the implementation of Doha.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as far as commitment is concerned, what I have said here before has been accepted by the whole college of Commissioners: it will be our first priority in early 2004, which is in two weeks' time. I will do my best also to help my colleagues prepare, because not all the proposals fall under my direct responsibility. I will, however, take this issue up once this has been voted.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Jackson raised the issue of the new Member States and asked how many of them have asked for a transition period. So far none have asked, but for good reason: we cannot start to negotiate on transition periods before the legal act has been adopted. Then we will be able to start negotiations. My position which my colleagues support is positively open. We understand the transition period is a problem here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Liese raised the issue of paediatric medicines. I feel a little uncomfortable here because I personally told this House that a proposal would soon be forthcoming. As I said before, the Commission decided that this proposal should go through an extended, in-depth assessment, which has delayed the procedure. On the one hand, this is good for better regulation but, on the other hand, it has caused a delay. We will do that early in 2004. I will take personal responsibility here because it is my proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Liese also raised the question of direct consumer advertising. He mentioned a case in Bratislava. If you have been surfing the Internet or looking at your e-mail, you will have seen a lot of aggressive advertising which pops up on your screen and which you cannot do anything about. That is an explosive problem which we must deal with, but I am sure we can come back to that in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the points made by Mrs Doyle, Mr Whitehead, Mr Parish and Mr Nicholson on veterinary medicine. I know they feel very strongly about this issue. Mrs Doyle has talked about it in committee and elsewhere and I understand her problem. When we say that we can accept an amendment in principle, it would of course be more precise to say that the amendment should be subject to modification, because normally, permanent derogation will never go through in the Member States' institutions. Permanent derogations are exceptional.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise gives a limited exemption which should be applied in a harmonised manner. It states, however, that Member States may grant exemption from this requirement according to criteria established in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 89(2). So it will limit it, and this can be done on the basis of this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Nicholson mentioned internal affairs. That issue was raised in the Council and many Member States strongly contested that position. They say that even though the medicines may not circulate on the internal market, meat, as a food product, circulates. So there is an impact across the national borders. That has been the position of many Member States and for reasons of internal market coherence they contested the possibility of having a permanent derogation in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately Mrs de Keyser has gone, because I would have liked to reply in even more depth to her comment. Discussions regarding the pharmaceuticals industry are always problematic. We have public objectives which are accepted across the board: we need to have better health that is what medicines are for. But if there are no innovative new medicines we will not be able to tackle illness in the way we should. There have been some success stories in the last 20 years for example, illnesses which were extremely difficult to handle without heavy treatment in closed institutions can now be treated with medicines. But this cannot be done without innovation. Twenty or thirty years ago people with mental illnesses were placed in institutions. Today they can live freely, which means better quality of life and also lower costs. So we need to pursue innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take the example of Alzheimer's Disease. If we do not find any new, innovative medicines the cost will be enormous. We must support innovation. Somebody referred to the situation in America where exclusivity periods are shorter. Compare the costs for a moment. Because we in Europe cover the costs from public budgets we want to have a say in pricing levels. The longer protection period gives some compensation for innovation, due to the lower prices.</p>
<p class="contents">I commissioned a study in 2000 to assess the state of the European pharmaceuticals market. It showed that in Europe there are countries where, after the expiry of a patent or data protection, there is no change in the price level of generics. They remain at the same price level. So there are high prices when they are put under a patent and under data exclusivity and no change after that. This proposal will certainly create a real European market for generics. When the rules are the same and they are harmonised, I am sure the generic industry will profit from this opportunity. We need to invest in innovative medicines in order to be able to tackle difficult diseases but, at the same time, we need to push prices of generics down to reduce the costs. That is the balance we want to achieve. I am personally convinced that in that area this House has been working on very good balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to thank this House for a <span class="italic">very</span> good debate. It has been very committed in its work throughout this period. I must also say that not all the issues have been solved here, but we all have worked very hard and very well to find a compromise which is good for public health and innovation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I am ready to continue my reply.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mrs Corbey, I should like to clarify that there is a difference with regard to manufacturing authorisation - Doha concerns manufacturing. We fully support it. Authorisation to market is regulated by this directive which is before the House. It in no way limits Doha for they are handling different parts of the issue. If, according to Doha, manufacturing is allowed for developing countries, the authorisation to market in developing countries will be given to the authorities of the countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is that this data is needed for authorisation to market.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue raised by Mrs Doyle concerning recital 7: it is an explanation of the clause provided for in Article 2(2); the provision contains only the legal wording of the clause. I said, in part, when I replied to Mrs Grossetête, that my services will discuss with all interested parties the proper application of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's question, on Amendment No 20, which asks for Member States to take due account of products registered in other Member States, our position is that the common position goes beyond that amendment because it submits these products to mutual recognition.</p>
