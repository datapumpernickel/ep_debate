<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (PPE-DE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, may I start by saying how delighted I am to see the new generation of Europe in the visitors’ gallery following this debate, which directly affects their future.</p>
<p class="contents">No one will be surprised if I say that this European Commission report gave us yet another opportunity to confirm that the equal opportunities situation is totally unsatisfactory. Unfortunately, however, the European Commission report is also unsatisfactory. It is still a descriptive annual report. Of course the 2001 report contains more facts and figures than previous reports but it is still the product of a routine exercise. It fails to illustrate properly either where we have failed to achieve our targets or commitments or the real difficulties in applying our policies at European and national level. Although it refers to future developments, it fails to set specific commitments or timetables.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to individual issues, the European Commission is clearly finding it hard to apply equal opportunities and is failing to do so adequately. Some Directorates-General are not making commitments in this area. At the same time, action to encourage more women to apply to participate in applications has been unsuccessful. Our motion for a resolution calls on the European Commission to examine new ways of disseminating information and simplifying bureaucratic and other commitments which will allow women and women’s organisations to find out about and take part in European programmes. The same applies to the Member States, which are having trouble understanding gender equality and implementing it in practice. Where there are no central or regional political support mechanisms, equal opportunities programmes are not being applied. Member States generally have no quantitative targets in their programmes, do not evaluate the repercussions of equal opportunities on their economic policy and have no indicators or statistics broken down by gender either for programming or for evaluating national policies. So it would be very useful for the purpose of raising awareness of the situation and drawing up future policies if the European Commission were to conduct a serious study with indicators and comparative data on the situation in each Member State, especially on the application of Community legislation, so that we can compare problems and achievements and exchange best practices.</p>
<p class="contents">During the forthcoming year, 2003, the European institutions and Member States will need to act boldly and decisively. During the mid-term review of the Structural Funds which, as we know, will take place in 2003, the Member States will need to decide where there is room to promote equal opportunities, so as to prevent appropriations for measures to benefit women from being transferred to other objectives. We shall be preparing for the first European elections to include the candidate countries in 2003, and for national elections in various Member States. The Council recommendations on the equal participation of men and women have not brought about the expected results. Nor does the Council have a competent agency to help improve the coordination of equality-related issues. As for the European Commission, we are anxiously waiting for it to present a proposal for a gender equality directive based on Article 13 as quickly as possible, so that we can follow up the equal opportunities programme decided in Beijing and achieve our self-imposed targets throughout the fabric of economic and public life. All of this, you will say, has been said many times before, and you would be right.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous people have commented, both inside and outside Parliament, that we women and some of the men working on these issues are becoming tiresome and repeating ourselves. We need to ask ourselves why they make these comments. Why does this issue not affect our society or at least not with the degree of importance we attach to it as regards both the human and economic factor? Why are our policies and principles not being applied directly and properly? I think that now more than ever we need to conduct a broad, ground-breaking dialogue with society and with those responsible for exercising European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want from the European Commission, Commissioner, are good ideas and efficient ways of applying them. Where the European Commission cannot force the Member States, it should encourage them to realise that equality brings benefits, not losses and difficulties. Let them understand how important promoting equality is to the strategic objectives set by the European Union, and I refer here both to the Lisbon objectives, which have been complicated by enlargement, and the objectives of defending human rights throughout the world and contributing to the economic and social advancement of mankind, especially in our own neck of the woods, by which I mean the Balkans and the Mediterranean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the members of the committee, and particularly the rapporteur, on the extremely careful and valuable work they have done, as well as thanking them for both their excellent suggestions and critical comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Very progressive and inspiring ideas have been explored, and these encourage the Commission to continue its efforts towards this objective. Every year, we observe how effective, efficient and innovative our dual strategy is, involving as it does on the one hand, the inclusion of gender mainstreaming in all the Commission's areas of activity, and, on the other, the implementation of specific measures of positive action in favour of women. As we did in the last annual report, we have taken care, in the report on 2001, to take your comments and proposals into account. Your proposals, suggestions and concerns will, of course, also be taken into account in preparing and elaborating the report on 2002, work on which has already started.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, at this point to enlarge on one point in particular, the evaluation issue. I am already in a position to inform you that, in 2003, evaluation will be carried out by means of two methods which, although different, complement each other. As happens every year, what we call a gender scoreboard will be set up, whilst it is planned that a second evaluation will be carried out by external experts. These efforts have to do both with the assessment of the 2001-2005 framework strategy and also with the financial plan. It is envisaged that a provisional report on these activities will appear at the end of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to lawmaking, we will support the revision of the directive on the equal treatment of women and men, planned for 2003, by, among other things, drawing up a report evaluating the implementing measures taken at national level. It is precisely this to which you have just drawn attention, and we will make it our common concern to carry out an assessment in this area. The object of the revision of the equal treatment directives is to simplify them, help to make them more coherent, and bring them into line with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reason why the coming year will be significant is that we will be focussing on how to balance the participation of women and men in the decision-making processes. In this respect, too, we are endeavouring to achieve tangible results in all areas, with women becoming better represented in all sectors, including in the social partners. Your report will be a very valuable help to us in doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004, we will be concentrating on the crucial area of combating negative stereotyped images of women. Misogynistic clichés, being a substantial obstacle to equal treatment for both genders, can and must be combated. This will be a comprehensive action, aimed at all the actors, with the objective of robbing obsolete ways of thinking of their power and, in the medium term – who knows? – perhaps even completely eradicating them. In any case, misogynistic clichés should soon be seen as ridiculous relics of times that are no more.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has insisted on the best possible utilisation of funds for this purpose. Let me, in this context, remind you of the assessment to be carried out by outside experts, and, furthermore, bring to your attention the imminent adoption of a Commission communication on the introduction of the gender question in the Structural Fund. This communication will be a valuable instrument in the programme's mid-term assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the candidate countries have made evident efforts to transpose the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> on equal treatment, substantial advances remain to be made, and so the Commission will continue to give the utmost attention to this topic. The success of European enlargement policy is dependent on the common rules being correctly applied. In this respect, the role of the programme of action, with which eight candidate countries have associated themselves this year, is that of giving impetus, and a valuable one.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by returning to the issue of violence against women, in relation to which the Commission welcomes the Council's framework resolution of 19 July 2002 on the fight against trafficking in human beings. This resolution is of great importance in terms of the conclusions to be drawn at criminal level as regards the trafficking in human beings. The Commission will follow closely the way in which this resolution is transposed into the laws of individual states, and will work very closely with the committee in closely monitoring this as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The political measures implemented are being analysed but their consequences are not being assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this framework strategy is to guarantee that all the Commission’s policies take account of gender issues and analyse the repercussions of its activities on men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again we have to insist on the need to create more and better jobs between now and 2010, in accordance with the objectives set at the Lisbon Summit. We must insist on the need to guarantee equality between men and women in all political fields, in accordance with Article 3(2) of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We must once again demand that indicators be produced on the structures for childcare, dependent persons and family assistance, as well as the differences in salary between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barcelona European Council called on the Member States to eliminate the obstacles preventing women from fully participating in the labour market, in particular by creating crèches.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for and promotion of equality between men and women are part of the Community acquis and are therefore an essential condition for the new countries of the European Union. It is true that the Commission has made efforts to promote equality between men and women, but so far they have been insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to programmes funded with Structural Funds, it has been noted that the objective of equality has not been met, including in the Regulation referring to them. Even when certain programmes present it amongst their objectives, the results are not analysed and we know that this objective of equality is not really being met.</p>
<p class="contents">The absence of women through balanced representation in decision-making bodies is significant, particularly social partners and other bodies. Additional efforts must be made so that the presence of women in decision-making bodies becomes a reality. It is cause for satisfaction that this issue has been included as a priority for 2003 and we hope that it yields positive results.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that the Commission has included the integration of the principle of equality between men and women in external relations, and it must be present in all agreements with third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has succeeded particularly well in giving clear pointers for the way forward in equal opportunities, by means of the framework strategy on gender mainstreaming and the associated fifth action programme on gender equality. More rapid progress is being made in some areas. Last year, we adopted the directive on equal treatment in employment. That is a milestone, and we keenly await the first evaluation report.</p>
<p class="contents">In other areas, things are taking a little longer. However, there are already clear pointers in the case of the Structural Funds and as regards combating violence. I would like to point out that we in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities have already on several occasions proposed what was agreed here this morning: to make 2004 the European Year of Education through Sport. This House and I myself have for many years been calling for a European year of action against violence. I hope that will be picked up again.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also very anxious to see the proposal for a directive under Article 13 banning discrimination. There is also some delay on that. This needs to be pursued with great vigour. We also need to maintain the political will to make progress in involving women at all levels of decision making, both legally speaking and in practice. The outcome of the Convention in that respect has been very disappointing, so we need to act now.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also still a great deal to be done in the European Parliament, and my criticisms are accordingly also aimed at this House. Let us not beat about the bush – Parliament is lagging somewhat behind the Commission when it comes to implementing gender mainstreaming internally. We need to make progress both in terms of political decision-making and as regards the administration. Balanced participation of women and men can only be achieved if a genuine political will exists, and it requires a top-down approach. We are particularly looking to the political group chairs, to the President of Parliament and to the committee chairs to set a clear example.</p>
<p class="contents">We are at present working in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities on an initiative to achieve gender mainstreaming in the European Parliament, a kind of gender equality health programme if you like. It will be ready in time for the 2003 International Women's Day. I believe that we can set an example here to make it crystal clear that the European Parliament – even when enlargement is in the offing – is serious about equal opportunities for women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">Particularly when elections are on the horizon, it is not enough for the parties just to include equal opportunities in their manifestos; we also have to make sure it is implemented in practice. We expect that here in the European Parliament, where 30% of the Members are women, which means that we are somewhat better than average, things will be even better after the elections, so that we will move significantly closer to the goal of equal representation of men and women in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many other points appearing in both reports that I could comment on. I believe that ultimately the crucial factor will be the political will that needs to be demonstrated if the position of women is really to be improved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In recent days, in my region, Galicia, this equality is being clearly demonstrated, through solidarity and also through pain. Yesterday, television stations broadcast the human and heart-breaking image of the minute’s silence expressing condemnation and rejection of the latest terrorist attack by people, men and women, who were working to recover Galicia’s environment, the marine environment, in the fight to deal with the consequences of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday as well, the media reflected the figures relating to domestic violence inflicted on women by their husbands, boyfriends or ex-partners. In some sections of the media it was also pointed out that the great majority of victims did not recognise their situation. This is what seems to me to be the most serious violation of sex equality. On the other hand, it is of some comfort that the result of the survey suggests an improvement in the situation in comparison with the survey of 1999, but it is worrying that this situation is continuing 15 years after a constitutional text, in its marvellous Article 14, declared that all Spaniards, in this case, are equal before the law, and that there could be no discrimination on the grounds of race, sex etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Charter of Fundamental Rights, in Article 20, declares that all persons – it does not say men and women, which is not necessary – are equal before the law. And Article 21 states that all discrimination is prohibited and, in particular, discrimination on the grounds of sex, race etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Tuesday, the plenum of the Spanish Congress of Deputies approved the idea that all legislative provisions produced by the government should include a report analysing their impact on gender equality. I believe that practical conclusions should be drawn from Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou’s report, which is excellent, given the balance she has achieved on an issue on which it is very easy to fall into demagoguery and not do enough, and we must move on from theory to reality and insist on the objective of equality through the horizontalisation of policies promoting equality, so that principles may become reality and so that reality may reflect the principles which the great majority of us advocate and which we want to see alive and enshrined in the Europe we are building. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Progress has definitely been made on the question of gender equality, even if it is two steps forward and one step back. The fact that certain male colleagues have started to take the floor and enthusiastically support gender equality shows that progress has also been made within the European Parliament. However, I must express my acute concern, as did Mrs Gröner earlier, at the fact that the Convention discussing and planning the future of Europe, in the absence of women, feels that any serious discussion about enshrining gender equality in the new Treaty and, more importantly, applying it in practice is pointless. Unfortunately, even in areas in which there is Community legislation, we often find infringements and violations, as with legislation on an equal day’s pay for an equal day’s work. It is a fact that resistance, with attitudes and structures generated by this long-standing patriarchy, often proves to be stronger than political will or even legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also note that there has been a serious delay with the new anti-discrimination directive based on Article 13, which we have been expecting for some time now, Commissioner. We are extremely worried by the fact that the European Commission keeps putting off a decision. What is the reason for this delay? Can the Commission tell us? Why is this decision so long in coming?</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is the fight against various forms of violence against women. We know that various forms of violence in the European Union have mushroomed. We know that thousands of women are literally at the mercy of slave traders. I know, Commissioner, that you mentioned the decisions taken by the Commission to fight trafficking in human beings, but we are by no means convinced that these decisions and the guidelines which you have issued will soon be transposed into the legislation of the Member States and we know that without judicial and without police cooperation, that is, without pan-European collaboration, it is impossible to break up these gangs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am delighted, Commissioner, that you have given priority in the 2003 programme to breaking the glass ceiling. This is a particularly worthwhile priority, because we predict that there will be an even balance of men and women in the new European Parliament following the 2004 elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we need data and statistics to facilitate comparative assessments based on which solutions can be identified. A simple statement that men and women are equal before the law is not enough. The Commission's priority theme for 2001 was equal pay. However, the report once again reminds us that women's pay for the same or equivalent work continues to average only 76% of men's pay. The Joint Report on Employment for 2001 states that the Member States have taken only limited measures to reduce this pay differential, and the Commission needs to play an active role here, especially with the prospect of enlargement. The committee is actively working on the priority themes for 2002 and 2003 – the reconciliation of work and family life and the participation of women in decision-making processes. The provisions in force at present will have to be better adapted to current requirements. If women, and men too, opt for family life and to have children, that should not prevent them from participating in working life. Women need to be involved in decision-making processes at all levels. The only way to make credible progress with a policy for both sexes is by means of mutual cooperation based on equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, some good projects have been worked out by women's organisations, but those organisations need more information on access to the Commission's system of financing and aid. The objective should be to ensure that as many stakeholders as possible can participate in the relevant programmes. After all, appropriations are made available every year to support projects relating to women, for example in the Structural Funds and in particular in the 2000-2006 action programme. However, the procedures involved need to be rationalised and simplified, because they are too complicated, both at Community and at national level. I would like to conclude by very sincerely thanking Mrs Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her balanced report. Unfortunately, the limited time we have available means that I can only touch on a few points. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is very important that we take equality seriously. Not only through declarations, but also through intentions, policies and actions. We therefore need to take the pulse of the equality policy, measure it and assess it. We therefore call for quantitative objectives for policies on employment and access for women to information, training and politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst all of us, men and women, we must make it possible for both governments of the current countries of the Union and the governments of the candidate countries to take equality seriously, to transpose the directives when necessary and ensure that they do not fail to comply with Community legislation. A new stage is beginning in which we will have to be very vigilant.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality – as many of us here know – needs to be fought for every day and every day no progress is made is in reality a step backwards. Many women are looking to the European institutions. Many of them live far from our prosperous Europe. For them, the progress we can make here is absolutely essential. It is possible that for many of them their only hope is that the European institutions will take equality seriously, both for the women within the Union and for all of those who, because they are outside the Union, encounter many more difficulties fulfilling their expectations of life.</p>
<p class="contents">We often say that there is no discrimination worse than that which comes from happening to be a woman. One does not choose to be born a woman. One is born one and, from that moment, one faces a huge number of obstacles which would not be there if one were a man. Therefore, given that we women make up half of the citizenship of the European Union, it is essential to attend to their needs and expectations, because they are the needs and expectations of the majority of the European citizenship. We are also talking about the expectations, the rights and the defence of equality for the majority of women in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament’s Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has been working very intensively on all these issues. This committee has achieved, I believe, significant progress, but it is not sufficient. We are interested to see the work the European Commission is doing as well and I believe that this report reflects perfectly both what we have assessed and also everything we are asking for for the more immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this excellent cooperation in our committee has borne fruit. Now that the time has come to evaluate the work of the year, we can all be pleased. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the dynamism of our rapporteur, although I would like to make two observations.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must remember the scale of poverty amongst women. Most of the 60 million people living beneath the poverty line in the EU are women.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must remain vigilant over Europe’s desire to protect the equality of the sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the first preliminary draft of the constitutional treaty presented by the Convention in October 2002 causes me some concern. The absence of any reference to equality between men and women in Europe is notable: it appears neither as a value nor as an aim, despite its inclusion in the Treaties.</p>

Since 1975, the date of the first directive on equal pay and treatment, progress has certainly been made, but a great deal remains to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Statistics broken down by gender and the gender dimension that is included in all our policies are essential prerequisites. Practical actions to ensure that parents, both men and women, can benefit from infrastructures such as nurseries, for example, which enable them to reconcile family life and working life, would constitute a considerable step forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Our actions must increase the population’s awareness of changes in mentality so that finally more women gain access to positions of responsibility and to supposedly typically ‘masculine’ careers. This also requires a common effort to be made with the social partners to ensure that this fundamental principle is applied in every company and in all collective bargaining.</p>
