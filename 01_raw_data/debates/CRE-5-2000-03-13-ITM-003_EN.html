The challenge for us all consists in integrating social and environmental considerations. This means, for instance, that environmental considerations cannot be seen as a sectoral issue but that the possible negative environmental impact of production, transport, construction, etc. must be clarified at the planning stage and minimised through a variety of measures. </p>
<p class="contents">The Rio Conference involved preparing an action programme which, on a sector-by-sector basis, points out the most important problem areas in this context and states how protection of the environment and of natural resources is to be ensured. In spite of the fact that this is a document of several hundred pages, it is a programme which, in general, is well put together. If further progress is to be made towards the necessary level of integration, an appropriate method has to be developed. Indicators also need to be selected so as to be able to keep abreast of what is under way in terms of developing know-how, pilot projects etc. </p>
<p class="contents">This type of work has been going on for many years in many of the OECD countries. It could be given higher priority, but it is in fact under way. Matters are organised rather less well in the majority of developing countries. There, there is a lack of both knowledge and resources to facilitate the integration of environmental considerations, together with the preventive approach which is the very essence of the decisions taken in Rio. In this context, aid can play an important role. As aid donors, we have, on the whole, a major responsibility for ensuring that we transfer knowledge and techniques that are sustainable, that is to say which do not entail severe damage to the environment and to natural resources. </p>
<p class="contents">The proposed regulation we are discussing today is aimed at ensuring that, in providing aid, the EU fully and completely integrates the environmental dimension into its activities. In the longer term, the objective is, of course, for this type of integration, or mainstreaming as it is called, to take place quite automatically, that is to say without special budget appropriations or programmes. So far, there remains, however, a lot to be done in terms of developing methods. In particular, knowledge and skills within both the Commission and the recipient countries must be increased. </p>
<p class="contents">I was responsible for the preparations for this second reading. My work has, of course, been very much based upon experiences from the first reading and upon the preparatory work for that reading. On that occasion, Parliament tabled a large number of amendments, of which approximately a third have been accepted by the Council ahead of this second reading. Analysing the situation, I identified three or four principal points where I think we in Parliament ought to try to amend the Council proposal. The most important of these issues are firstly, the size of the budget, the way in which activities are directed and the way in which the rules are to be interpreted, that is to say they should relate not only to developing countries’ activities but also, of course, shape our own activities within the EU. That does not mean that other questions raised at first reading are not important. What it does mean, however, is that we ought to concentrate on those which are most important. We ought also, in the interests of reaching agreement with the Council, to see to it that we, as far as possible, relinquish what is of less importance. </p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to note that, following the informal discussions which have taken place, it has been possible considerably to increase the amount of the budget, namely from the proposed figure of just over EUR 50 million to just over EUR 90 million. This is something we ought to support, a fact which also emerges from Amendment No 11. Regarding the period of applicability of this regulation, I believe that there is no reason to commit ourselves now once and for all. I think that the Council’s proposal is acceptable because an evaluation will take place within four or five years. This question will then, at all events, return to Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to mention a question on which there have been, and remain, a variety of views. This concerns the committee procedure, that is to say how actual implementation of this regulation will look. Where this is concerned, I take the view that we should try to get away from an arrangement whereby the Member States themselves are directly involved in determining the fine detail of implementation. They should be involved, and determine the framework and rules, but leave it to the Commission to implement the actual project. In this connection, we have proposed, in the course of the examination of this proposal, a so-called split comitology procedure, which could be used to excellent effect. I hope that the vote will ensure that this will also become Parliament’s proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">Might I just ask for one more thing? The fact is, we shall need further consultations. I would therefore propose without further ado that the vote could take place on Wednesday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now our task to counteract this.</p>
<p class="contents">In the industrialised countries, significant initiatives are being taken to preserve and protect the environment. In the developing countries, however, intensive work still needs to be done on designing appropriate policies, strategies and projects to prevent further destruction and to care for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures need to be implemented which, for instance, take account of the consequences of developing countries being integrated into the global economy. Nigeria can once again serve as an example here, as oil drilling there is causing commensurate environmental damage. Here too, education and training measures need to be supported in order, in the end, to help people to help themselves. The content of the regulation must therefore be supported in full, although the budget proposed by the Council is not sufficient by far. That is why I should like to ask all colleagues to vote in favour, in particular, of Amendment No 11, so that at least reasonable financial provision is made, even if this falls well below the amount for previous initiatives and is still only around EUR 13 million a year. Even at this early stage a considerable increase needs to be considered for when the Treaty or the regulation is revised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the notion of sustainable development takes on real meaning in such countries, and more particularly in the very poorest of them, since these are the countries which most often experience large-scale disasters, including the natural disasters which have recently become increasingly common.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has indeed been said of pollution and the effects of pollution, but this proliferation of natural disasters was evident in Central America and Venezuela at the end of last year, and can now be seen in Mozambique and Madagascar. These disasters are in fact the result of extreme climatic changes with which we should be quite familiar, since they are precipitated by human activities, notably those of developed countries. The greenhouse effect and deforestation also have a considerable impact.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards this regulation on the environmental dimension in the development process in developing countries, the Council has broadly taken up the amendments that we presented and voted upon at first reading. From this perspective we cannot fail to be satisfied. I would nevertheless like to stress one point that the Council has overlooked – inadvertently, I believe and hope – but which is absolutely fundamental: coordination between European operators and local partners, which is to say local NGOs, grass-roots communities and people with a time-honoured understanding of how to harness biological diversity. No programme can be truly effective unless it is conducted in close collaboration with the communities concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point: should we be successful in setting up steering committees, I believe it would be necessary to re-emphasise the importance of establishing a complaint procedure which is open to civil society in developing countries with regard to measures that run counter to legitimate concerns in the field of social welfare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whenever I have been involved in development work I have observed that this approach has, thankfully, over the past few years been taking the place of the old paternalistic aid-oriented ideology, where the so-called developed countries thought development was a matter of transferring our way of life to the less developed countries. The new paradigm for development cooperation stresses the notion of partnership, in which the so-called donor of aid is a consulting party. It must allow scope for the countries concerned to determine for themselves what their problems are, and let them draw up a plan to improve the situation and find a solution themselves. The most important task aid agencies have is to make themselves unnecessary, all the while ensuring that the work is leading to local action and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Mr Wijkman, has produced a good report in this respect, one that emphasises this paradigm that is the only successful and morally tenable one. However, at present, this approach is being applied scandalously badly by the EU as far as scientific and technological projects are concerned. The EU’s framework programmes do not extend to developing countries. In other words, our North African partners, for example, cannot become involved in scientific and technological projects concerning the environment. Nothing is actually preventing them from doing research but there are simply no facilities for financing projects, as the developing countries do not have access to the consortia as a party applying for funds. But why not? It has been made easier for Eastern Europe to participate. The matter is even harder to appreciate, when we think of how much we are affected by the problems of desertification in North Africa and the problems that are associated with the Mediterranean area. We must give more responsibility, by way of funding, to local researchers to be able to create development that will be of benefit to the local community and leave the job to them when the financiers have left. We must ensure that no project can be established without input from local researchers.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To do this, sufficient financial support is of course necessary. That is why I, like one previous speaker already, advocate voting in favour of the rapporteur's Amendment No 11.</p>
<p class="contents">Since integrating the environmental dimension is a long-term commitment, I am in principle against limiting the duration of this regulation. However, the arguments that excessively lengthy negotiations with the Council are putting existing projects – projects which are already up and running – at risk have persuaded me otherwise. I also believe that Amendment No 9, which seeks to involve civil society in exchanging information and implementing this regulation, is of fundamental importance, because in my opinion the discussions about civil society and the discussions about good governance must not only be reflected on the political soapbox but also in active policy implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way I support the rapporteur's proposal on split comitology, whereby decisions on the strategic guidelines would be decided under a management procedure and those on implementation under an advisory procedure. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Hopefully we are reaching the conclusion of a process that started a year ago under the previous Parliament. Apart from the importance of the topic itself, this regulation and the accompanying tropical forests regulation represent the first regulations concerning development cooperation to be considered under codecision. So for many of us this is an interesting learning experience.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous regulation expired at the end of 1999. Since the beginning of this year, the Commission has been unable to make any new financial commitments on these budget lines. This places the Commission and Europe in an increasingly difficult situation. Hence our desire to conclude the process of adoption in the near future. In this context, we have supported the informal negotiations between the Council presidency and the parliamentary rapporteur so as to arrive at a proposal which could be accepted by both parties. The main areas of difference have been on the financial reference amounts, on comitology and on the duration of the regulation. I would like to comment briefly on each of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">On the financial reference amount, briefly, we accept the compromise proposals put forward under Amendment No 11. Comitology:</p>
<p class="contents">Our position has been to advocate an advisory rather than management procedure for the management of the regulation in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 which states: "The management procedure should be followed as regards management measures such as those relating to the application of the common agricultural and common fisheries policies; also the implementation of programmes with substantial budgetary implications". In our view, the programme to be funded under the regulation does not represent substantial budgetary implications and hence does not merit a management procedure, an advisory procedure being more appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in view of the Council's views on this matter and in order to avoid conciliation, we support the compromise proposal put forward by Parliament for a split comitology procedure whereby decisions on strategic guidelines for the actions to be financed would be subject to a management procedure while project approval for the limited number of projects over EUR 2 million would be subject to an advisory procedure. Hence the Commission supports, in principle, Amendment No 16 but prefers the wording of Amendments Nos 19, 20 and 21.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the duration of the regulation, our position has been to support an unlimited duration subject to periodic revision following evaluations. However we are aware that if unlimited duration were to be approved here, this would lead inevitably to a conciliation process. In this context we consider that the duration of seven years, proposed by the Council, is adequate and hence, in the interest of avoiding conciliation, we do not support Amendment No 18, which places an unlimited duration on the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The final important issue common to both this regulation and the forest regulation are the amendments concerning bank guarantees. We concur with the view of Parliament that the Commission should not place bureaucratic barriers to the access of some NGOs to financing from Community funds. For this reason the Commission took a decision in July 1999 only to require bank guarantees for advance payments of over EUR 1 million. Hence the problem has, to a large extent, been resolved. Furthermore the Commission considers that such matters are best addressed in a horizontal manner rather than through specific regulations. For these reasons the Commission does not support the proposed Amendment No 10 on bank guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">The remaining amendments of the environment regulation can be placed in two categories: on the one hand, amendments which consist of reformulating elements of the scope of the proposed act or its means of intervention; and on the other hand, amendments concerning the management of the actions to be financed, in particular financial aspects. With regard to these two types of amendments, the position of the Commission is as follows. With the aim of finding a compromise solution which would make it possible to avoid conciliation the Commission could support Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, although it considers that they bring little added value to the text overall. Careful reading of the joint position will show that most of the concerns behind these amendments have been taken into consideration but following the structure of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second type of amendments pose more problems to the Commission which therefore does not support them: Amendment No 9 – coordination with the local partners, as formulated in the report – is not supported by the Commission, not because of disagreement with the principle, but because the article in question is framed in the context of the Treaty which only refers to coordination with Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 12 proposes the raising of the threshold for submission of projects for consideration by the Council from EUR 2 million to EUR 5 million. Given that most projects are already under EUR 2 million this amendment is considered not relevant. Furthermore we are concerned that its adoption would lead to a conciliation process. Therefore the Commission does not support it.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments on procurement and access to the markets – Amendments Nos 13 and 14 – would mean a departure from standard and carefully agreed formulations. In any event, as with bank guarantees, the Commission does not consider it appropriate that such issues be addressed through special provisions in specific regulations but rather in a horizontal manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We oppose Amendment No 15, concerning the creation of an environmental monitoring union, as this is in our opinion a question of internal Commission organisation which should not be addressed through a regulation. Such a unit is, in fact, already operational although we intend to strengthen it further.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we do not support Amendment No 17 as it does not conform to the usual rules or formulation of regulations and is considered to be redundant.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
