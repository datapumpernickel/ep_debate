<p class="contents">Accidents occur in all industries, and we have just seen an appalling train crash in the UK this week. But accidents in nuclear installations, especially criticality accidents, are the most feared of all accidents. Rare though they are for obvious reasons, the potential consequences to very large numbers of people are extremely serious. That is why the nuclear industry has to be more careful than other industries. It will not survive as an industry unless the public believe in a strongly instilled and strictly enforced safety culture. Now that culture was breached quite clearly at Tokaimura this week. There will be an investigation. We hope and expect that the findings will be shared with us so that any lessons can be enforced everywhere where nuclear activities take place. Workers in the industry expect this, and the public most certainly does.</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear activity requires emergency plans, spot checks by independent inspectors and factoring-in of the possibility of error or negligence. That costs money but it has to be done. All installations in the supply chain are part of safety requirements. Any weak link is dangerous. A wide-ranging investigation and a public explanation are required by those whose concerns have been justifiably raised by this very serious incident indeed in Japan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The resolution which has been produced is a good one, even if I should like to have seen it go further still in the positions it adopts.

<p class="contents">As we all know, Japan is one of the world’s technologically most developed countries. Nuclear power and the way in which nuclear fuel is handled are probably, all in all, no less safe in Japan than they are in our own countries. It may be worth remembering this when we happily criticise unsafe nuclear energy in other countries but do so less readily in the case of our own countries. </p>

<p class="contents">All over the world nuclear authorities insist that an accident like that in Japan could not happen anywhere else. Different processes will ensure that the chain reactions do not start. But in Britain, BNFL has recently admitted the falsifications of safety checks on MOX fuel while in Japan the authorities have found that the plant at Tokaimura was operating illegally for four years. The nuclear industry is clearly out of control.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE and PSE refuse to acknowledge a link with the BNFL MOX shipments to Japan. Perhaps here we see the long arm of Mr Blair, but the falsification of such data is of concern to Europe. There is a link – MOX shipments to Japan are under EU safeguards controls. If both ends of the chain are operating illegally, we must not only halt all MOX shipments but we must also halt the production of MOX fuel.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say here today that we must also stop blaming workers, workers who are now under sentence of death for the illegal and criminal activities of the nuclear industry. We have been told time and time again that stringent controls are in place, that accidents cannot happen and that fail-safe systems are in place and then when anything happens, we are told it is the fault of the workers. This is not only injuring people but also adding insult to injury.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time that the nuclear industry was shut down completely. That, of course, is our position. But is this latest accident the death rattle of the nuclear industry or must further nuclear terror happen before we close this monstrous industry down? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karoutchi (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, a nuclear accident always provokes highly emotional reactions, fear and even irrational terror. The events in Chernobyl affected our mood for a long time. But in Tokaimura, the Japanese authorities have themselves recognised that the safety procedures, both in the conversion plant and in the fuel production plant, had not been followed. It was therefore not an unforeseeable accident.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from our sympathy and friendship towards the families affected by this drama, what are the lessons and consequences to be drawn from this accident? The first lesson is clearly that it is imperative that the European and national authorities in each of our States deal with the question of safety procedures. Secondly, it seems very clear to me that the IAEA should intervene more regularly, not only to verify the text of the regulations, which it does too often, but also to do what it has not done often enough, that is, to go to the site to verify that the regulations are really being applied. In the case of Tokaimura, the IAEA should, in any case, ask the Japanese authorities not to authorise the resumption of reprocessing activities before a thorough investigation is carried out and before public and transparent conclusions are published.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, the European Parliament, it seems to us more necessary than ever that the European Commission, within the framework of its Euratom competences, not only lends its assistance to Japan in the current circumstances, but also asks the Euratom services to carry out a complete analysis of the official safety regulations for our power stations, and around our power stations, in Europe. In this way, it would be in a position to ascertain whether all the safety conditions are being respected and to know whether further urgency procedures can be added in the case of regrettable human negligence, which are ultimately much worse or at least they have been in the last few years, than the unforeseeable accident which, by definition, can spread terror.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour, Mr President, of the use of nuclear energy and we know that, in the European Union, the safety rules and conditions are stricter and more respected. Or at least we are told, for example, that the initiation of a nuclear chain reaction as a result of faulty handling by an operator is practically impossible in Europe. This is what happened in Tokaimura.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to avoid two pitfalls, Mr President. On the one hand, the blind, unconditional and uncontrolled support for nuclear energy. But also on the other hand, the manipulation by too many people of public opinion in order to spread irrational fears and terrors which were well known a thousand years ago. These were the famous millennium fears of the year 1000. Today, they are the fears on the eve of the year 2000. No, nuclear power does not kill any more than a traditional source such as coal has killed and still kills. That is the purpose of our resolution today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ford (PSE).</span></span>   – Two accidents have focused our attention over the last ten days. The first was in Tokaimura in which some 45 people were injured and 3 are in a critical condition in hospital. The second, was the rail crash in London which involved a train taking hundreds of people from the capital to the region of England I represent, in which 70 died and 200 were injured. While I wish to think of the individuals and families of those who died or were injured in the railway accident, I am afraid that the two accidents are very different. Accidents in transport systems can endanger the lives of hundreds of people. Unfortunately, a nuclear accident can affect potentially hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people. Mrs McNally made the point that near Tokyo, in Tokaimura, 300,000 people were confined to their homes. It appears that the accident was not as severe as we first thought. As a former Japanese civil servant, and as a member of the Japanese delegation for the last 15 years, I wish to put on our record, however, our concern for the victims of this accident in Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make three political points: firstly, it is very clear that human error or human stupidity is continually with us in all areas of endeavour. We cannot trust individuals. In Tokaimura, it would appear either that the workers – with the active collusion of management or owing to the failure of management to enforce regulations – were breaching regulations that were there in the interest of nuclear safety. There are stories that there was actually an illegal handbook produced by the management telling workers to operate in this way. The swift action of the Japanese police going into the company may enable us to establish whether that is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">If it was the case, it demonstrates the truth of Nietzche’s dictum that madness is rare in individuals but common in parties, groups and organisations, which is why we need individual, independent monitoring of what goes on in nuclear plants. We need someone to guard those people from their own stupidity and errors. Secondly, it is clear that there is a lack of emergency planning. Thirdly, we have to say that we should be offering assistance to the Japanese if they request it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, two factual corrections; firstly, our Amendment No 6 makes it clear, when we are calling for the plant not to be reopened until an investigation has taken place, that we are talking about the conversion plant and not the reprocessing plant in Tokaimura, which is a separate plant on a separate site operated by a separate company...</p>

Firstly, it has created uncertainty about the safety of nuclear power. Now Japan is planning to build 20 additional reactors between now and the year 2010 and to make itself enormously dependent on nuclear energy. It is therefore unacceptable that neither Japan’s own people nor the rest of the world have been provided with adequate information, and their failure to involve the IAEA in the investigation is equally unacceptable. Of course, it should actually be standard international practice to involve the IAEA when accidents of this kind occur.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, nuclear MOX fuel is shipped from Europe, for example from Cherbourg and Sellafield, to Japan. Apart from the problem of what may happen to it out at sea, British Nuclear Fuel has admitted that safety data relating to MOX shipments has been falsified. Of course that just cannot be allowed to happen and is every bit as unacceptable. I would like, in due course, to hear from the Commission about what kind of European Union regulations are applicable to such shipments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my view, the accident in Japan demonstrated, first of all, that nuclear energy is not safe. When are the safety levels actually determined? How many victims were there at the time of the Chernobyl accident and how many are there today, about ten years on? Safety levels cannot be measured at the time of the accident. A nuclear accident is not the same as a train accident. In time, the effects magnify and they cannot be reversed quite so easily. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, just how cheap is nuclear energy, Commissioner? Will the nuclear industry pay the initial cost of research and development which the military, i.e. the taxpayers, had to pay? Does the nuclear industry pay for the cost of the accidents when they affect areas and sections of the population on a much wider scale? Of course, it would work out cheap if it did not have to bear all those costs.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I believe that it is time to turn a new leaf, to change existing policy. It would take decades to close down all the nuclear plants. Let us capitalise on this time and concentrate our efforts on the other sources of energy we have been discussing here. Let us discourage the establishment of new nuclear plants, particularly in areas which are not as safe as Japan such as the ones now under preparation in Turkey, in Akkyu, or in Thrace. How can we dare to encourage such dangerous investments?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Self-declared opponents of nuclear power have drawn the distinction between the relatively safe reactors of the West and these reactors. The Japanese have said, just as the Europeans are doing today, that their reactors are safe and that a chain reaction could not occur. The facts tell us otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, after these two bad accidents, the one in Japan and the other South Korea, we have to recognise that drawing this distinction between high-risk nuclear reactors and supposedly non-risk nuclear reactors was a serious strategic error. All nuclear reactors have a risk attached to them, to say nothing of the fact that the permanent disposal of nuclear waste is not safe in any area.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that such nuclear accidents do not stop at national borders, now would be an opportune time to explain to the accession candidates to the European Union that if they choose to continue with their risky nuclear policy – I am thinking here of Temelin, Krško, Bohunice and Mohovce – which are a threat to the entire European Union, then accession should not, and cannot, be granted under these circumstances.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The nuclear accident of 30 September in the private nuclear power plant in Japan proved once more that the use of nuclear energy is dangerous and that it is imperative that we establish tough safety specifications. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, what is particularly noticeable is the fact that for a country with 51 reactors and an undertaking to establish a further 20, it does not have the appropriate knowledge and experience to deal with such events. Thirteen years after the great Chernobyl disaster, this nightmarish history seems to be repeating itself. In the immediate future, we shall find ourselves grieving for yet more innocent victims. Despite all that, instead of being ousted from the world energy market on environmental and financial grounds, the nuclear power industry is still continuing to expand </p>
<p class="contents">The issue is a critical one and public opinion is sufficiently sensitive to it. The European Parliament, as a representative of European public opinion, has a duty to take heed of the messages and react accordingly. The objective of sustainable development stipulated in the Treaty of Amsterdam has once again provoked deep concern and forced us to rethink what we are doing. Current trends show that milder and renewable energy sources are increasingly becoming the only solution to the energy problem of post-industrial society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That an accident such as this could happen in a technologically developed country such as Japan once again makes it very clear that nuclear safety requires great and constant vigilance everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Another major concern is that in a facility handling such hazardous materials the operators were able to interfere with or bypass the procedures designed to avoid such accidents. This, in particular, highlights the question of the overall safety culture of the plant and the level of training of the personnel as well as the importance of rapid dissemination of information.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already asked the Japanese authorities for detailed information on the accident and its causes. The authorities have launched an enquiry. This will undoubtedly address the issues of regulation, safety procedures, supervision and worker training. The Commission will most carefully examine the report of this enquiry for lessons to be learnt in Europe. In the light of these, it will in due course review its emergency procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Poor safety management in combination with inadequate training or poorly qualified personnel appears to have been a very important factor in this as in many accidents. In the European Union, Member States’ national authorities must require undertakings to inform exposed workers and apprentices of the health risks involved in their work and train them in radiation protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will enquire of Member States what their latest provisions are for radiation protection and training of workers. The Commission will also undertake a review of the present levels of training in nuclear safety for operators and other workers in the different types of nuclear facilities in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Research on safety culture in the nuclear sector is already included in the research and training part of the Community’s Fifth Framework Programme. Research on nuclear reactor safety is also included in the programme, though at a lower level of funding than previously. The Commission will respond positively to any request for assistance from the Japanese authorities in managing or exploring the consequences of the accident. The Commission services will remain in close contact with the International Atomic Energy Agency to exchange information and analysis and, if necessary, provide support for follow-up activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues raised in the motions concerning the manufacture, transport and use of mixed oxide – the MOX fuel – are unrelated to the accident at the Tokaimura plant. The questions relating to inspection of the fuel at the Sellafield MOX plant are within the competence of the national authorities and have been reported to the UK nuclear installations inspectorate. There was no question of any of the material being removed from safeguards control. Transport of MOX fuel is performed under the control of national authorities in the countries of origin and destination, taking into account the appropriate Community legislation and IAEA standards. As the MOX fuel shipped to Japan is ready for use in the nuclear power reactors without any further processing, it will not pass through the Tokaimura facility. Concerning the use of MOX fuel in nuclear power plants, this is a decision made by the individual electrical utility after licensing by their national safety authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
