Today, we must talk about something else, namely employment policy. As late as yesterday, I received an enquiry from a Danish municipality that included a message: ‘Can you not work for a situation in which the Member States learn from the EU? Can you not work for a situation in which they learn to realise that it is through local efforts in partnership with public authorities and private enterprises that unemployment is best combated, especially in its least tractable form – as experienced by the vulnerable and those who are out of work long-term?’. When I received that appeal, I in fact felt genuinely happy. I was happy that we in Parliament have done some good work on this directive on the EU’s employment policy. We have done the right thing. We wanted greater transparency surrounding employment policy and the more active involvement of local authorities and both sides of industry. We wanted better opportunities for the individual citizen to become familiar with and to understand this policy, for it is of course at the end of the day the citizens, or electorate, who have to assess whether their national governments are up to scratch on employment policy. We wanted to promote employment policy at local and regional levels through more information about local employment plans, through exchanges of experience concerning good practice and through demands that, in their national action plans, countries report on how local authorities can be involved in employment policy. Moreover, a conciliation has now successfully been brought about which fulfils Parliament’s demands on these important points.</p>
<p class="contents">In that connection, I would thank my fellow MEPs here in Parliament for the unity and perseverance we demonstrated during that procedure. For example, we submitted proposals tabled by Parliament in another context, so there was good preparatory work. I would also thank the Council and the Commission for their efforts and helpfulness, which have now ensured that we have ended up with a good result. We in Parliament have attached a lot of importance to there being a link between employment policy and the EU’s efforts via the social fund programmes. We are therefore also very satisfied with the declaration attached by the Commission to the agreement on incentive measures. In the declaration, the Commission promises to secure this link and fully to inform Parliament and the Council both of the priorities chosen within the framework of Article 6 under the European Social Fund and, especially, of the local activities to which quite large amounts will be allocated over the next couple of years. We shall remember that pledge.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want briefly to say something about the budget for employment policy. Parliament had proposed a higher amount than the Commission’s proposal of EUR 55 million, and we of course wanted the Commission to make an additional contribution, so it was natural to ask for more money. However, we have now received assurances from the Commission that the additional input of information can be achieved within the EUR 55 million, and that is therefore something we are relying on. Nor has the budget framework been fully utilised so far, so it appears realistic. A portion of the budget is to be used for assessing European employment policy. We also wanted this assessment to extend to include the methodology used. The ‘open’ coordination method has triumphed in many areas in recent years, and it would be odd if there were not both good and bad experiences arising from employment policy which can provide inspiration in the work using ‘open’ coordination in other areas. Employment policy has now been up and running for approximately five years and, in that period, a great deal of experience has been accumulated.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I think it is a good result we have ended up with, and it is therefore up to the Commission and the Member States to fill out the new framework. What, however, is no doubt most important is that citizens, the two sides of industry and the local and regional authorities have, by means of this legislation, obtained a tool for developing mutual inspiration and engaging in the race to secure many more footholds in the labour market. They have obtained a tool for participating in the work on the other important objectives of EU employment policy: reducing exclusion from the labour market, ensuring that we are flexible and competitive and ensuring that it becomes possible better to combine working life and family life. I wish and hope that this challenge will be taken up seriously by all the parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the Minutes of the Turin European Council we notice that, if Europe were to advance only in the economic and monetary fields, its success would not be guaranteed – I am quoting from memory here – because we would be forgetting the most important thing Europe has: its citizens. To involve European citizens in the process of European integration, the European Union has to take a greater interest in their concerns. An example of this appears in the introduction to Title VIII of the Treaty, with regard to employment, following Amsterdam, with an important reference made in Luxembourg, as well as the 2000 Lisbon European Council, where the conversion to a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based society that can grow in an economically-sustainable fashion with more and better jobs and better social cohesion was set as a new strategic objective for the European Union, and therefore to achieve the conditions for full employment. This objective was highlighted once again at the Barcelona Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I believe that this Parliament and Council decision on Community measures to stimulate employment seeks to noticeably improve cooperation with Member States in analysis and research in the field of employment and the implementation of these results in the labour market. It also seeks to coordinate employment policies within the general Lisbon and Barcelona objectives and to apply an information and transparency policy as a response to the aspirations of European citizens to be well informed on European employment strategy, in which they place great hopes. It also intends to support the Member States’ efforts to evaluate their action plans, exchange experiences and good practices, carry out a follow-up to the employment strategy, particularly through the European employment survey, involving the various players to a greater extent, from the authorities to those seeking work, and to rationalise and guarantee coherence in order to avoid duplicating actions and of course expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">I think therefore that we are dealing with an important decision full of good content and good intentions which hopes to rationalise and optimise European employment strategy and which will constitute a step forward in the process of European integration for all European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to say that we are very satisfied with the conciliation achieved. Cooperation with a view to increasing employment in Europe is a matter to which both our group and Parliament as a whole attach crucial importance. Unemployment is unfortunately too high in Europe, but we do in fact have documentary evidence that a coordinated employment policy produces far more jobs than is the case when an individual country pursues its own policy without taking account of what is happening in neighbouring countries. The incentive measures on which conciliation has now been achieved are specifically designed to support and strengthen cooperation on employment in the EU. This is to take place through, for example, analyses, statistics, reports, information activities and evaluations. I think that the outcome of the conciliation is commendable in many ways. It is important that employment policy not only be something that is conducted in offices and in more or less secret meetings of the Council of Ministers. People must know which method we are using, even when its designation is something as difficult as the ‘open coordination method’. Moreover, information must be provided about what is happening in terms of employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What is still more important is that local authorities, which must play a part in getting things moving, should also be involved. That is why it is also so incredibly encouraging that the local dimension of employment policy has successfully been given a still more prominent place. I am delighted that the Commission and the Council have come to the conclusion that it is precisely local and regional authorities that are important in efforts to promote employment. The same is true of the two sides of industry and of voluntary organisations. Partnerships are the way forward in this area. The practical work involved in getting people into jobs is done locally, and that is why local players must be involved in employment policy. It requires targeted support for local efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the routes to a more effective employment policy involves disseminating good experiences of employment policy to everyone who does practical work on getting people into jobs. There must therefore be adequate means of being able to learn effectively from each other’s methods and experiences, and that is also of course something to which we must make a positive contribution. It is also important, therefore, that we should obtain thorough evaluations of the results and methods of employment policy. Only by having access to such evaluations can we become still more effective, and I am therefore very satisfied that agreement has been achieved on increasing the budget – by a modest amount, admittedly, but nonetheless to EUR 55 million in place of the original amount of EUR 50 million. That is something encouraging, I think, precisely because we have reached a phase in which we are to point out and demonstrate to people that employment policy does in fact work and that the open coordination method has something specific to offer. I should like to conclude by thanking all the rapporteurs, especially for their fruitful cooperation, and wishing the Commission luck on getting these measures put into effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Where Mrs Thorning-Schmidt’s report was concerned, there was a hard fight at the conciliation stage. On one point, our political group is not satisfied with the outcome, and that is when it comes to the limit value for whole-body vibrations, which we believe was set too high. It is even higher than the international industry standard and significantly higher than the level set by the Commission from the beginning. I know that Mrs Thorning-Schmidt shares my group’s view on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mrs Jensen’s report, I want to point out that it is incredibly important that the Commission and the European Employment Strategy should now begin to pay attention to the local levels. The employment strategy we have had so far has often got no further than government offices and not been channelled into working life in the Member States. Now, there is greater interest in such a strategy’s being applied, and it is incredibly valuable for money to be earmarked for information activities at local level. I have followed Mrs Jensen’s work and seen how hard she has fought along the same lines as myself. Later in the year, I shall return with a report that will take the work further in the same direction.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly important to set aside money for the provision of information because local information activities are unheard of and there are no trends at all towards, or guarantees of, the central authorities’ distributing information from Brussels. I should like to have seen still larger appropriations, but I hope to be able to return to this subject later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, it saddens us all to see how slowly we are moving in this direction. Employment strategies in numerous countries are inefficient, resulting in long-term unemployment and the social problems that go with it. It is vital, therefore, that we boost cooperation between national policies, coordinate our efforts, exchange best practices, carry out research and monitor and analyse the market and its needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The approved proposal provides an excellent framework for making use of efficient employment policies; all we need is good cooperation between the Member States, the European Commission, the social partners and all the social agencies involved. We particularly welcome the fact that the approved proposal gives us an opportunity to inform public opinion and agencies at local and regional level. This is particularly important, which is why the European Parliament insisted on it. We need to make the most of the opportunity being given to local and regional agencies. These agencies must play their part in designing and implementing these policies and disseminating their experience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The measures included in the decision we are discussing today are important funding instruments for achieving the strategic objective set at the Lisbon Summit, and the decision will, indeed, serve to increase cooperation between the Member States on labour market policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The gamble of implementing the European employment strategy through open coordination in recent years has started to pay off. It is important to note, however – and we too see evidence of this every day – that there is a huge information gap between citizens regarding the existence of this strategy, its objectives and the procedures for implementing it. That is why the European Parliament persisted in calling for all the information measures aimed at raising public awareness, particularly the awareness of those who can benefit from this strategy, to be implemented and therefore to be set forth in this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">A further point on which the European Parliament has insisted – and rightly so – is the involvement, association and participation of the local and regional levels in implementing the employment strategy. We know how important the role of the local and regional authorities is in promoting employment and high-quality employment, particularly for those people for whom it is most difficult to penetrate or re-enter the world of work – women, young people, people with disabilities, older workers – for they can involve all the social operators present on the territory and create favourable conditions for employment. To this end, I feel it is absolutely essential to introduce activities relating to awareness-building, best practice, cooperation and exchange of experiences. The partnership, which has already been used to implement other initiatives and has proved to be an extraordinary, effective involvement tool, must become a traditional, standard method of working in the field of employment too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The text adopted will lead to an action programme not only reflecting the aspirations of both co-legislators, but also putting on a firm foundation the measures that the Commission intends to implement in order to accompany the European Employment Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission especially welcomes the agreement on a proactive and transparent information policy enabling Europe's citizens to be made more aware of the Employment Strategy's successes. The Commission particularly welcomes the extension of the Employment Strategy's scope from national to local level. The Commission wishes to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Jensen, on her proposals, and thanks are also due to the Spanish Presidency of the Council for the openness with which it conducted the concluding negotiations. Had all the parties involved not taken such a positive attitude, it is certain that no agreement could have been reached concerning this programme. The Commission undertakes to implement this programme strictly as Parliament intended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
