<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berenguer Fuster (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Council Regulation (EC) 994/98 contains the provision that the Commission should approve regulations on block exemption which exempt certain aid from the obligation to notify the Commission, employing a technique already used successfully in the field of anti-competitive behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, the Commission has approved the Regulations on SMEs, training and minimums, and now it is proposing a Regulation on employment aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by making a series of observations. Firstly, that the proposal we are currently analysing, although it is not being modified, improves the existing system. There is currently no regulation on block exemption in this field and the guidelines on this type of aid are based on a series of diverse communications which are not regulatory. The fact that certain aid with clear criteria is being exempted from the obligation to notify, although those criteria may be insufficient, represents considerable progress in terms of transparency and legal certainty, which we must not fail to recognise.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to insist that this does not mean that aid without the characteristics included in the Regulation will be considered illegal. Not at all. All it implies is that such aid will have to be subject to notification, in order to analyse whether or not it contradicts the objectives of the Treaty. And we must not forget that these objectives do not just include maintaining a system in which competition is not distorted, but also the promotion of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, certain possible scenarios should be stipulated in order prevent the administrations who grant the aid – particularly the regional authorities in the case of Spain and also in other Member States – from being subject to long procedures involving notification when granting aid aimed at promoting employment, especially in sectors in which workers are most affected by unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, and in line with the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, we must propose support for the transformation of employment contracts into permanent contracts and greater flexibility in defining the different groups of workers who will benefit, as well as adapting them to the particular characteristics of each region, and the inclusion amongst the exempted aid of aid aimed at promoting the employment of women and, finally, extending the age range, so that young workers – or those who are in the final stage of their working life – can benefit from aid without the need for modification.</p>
<p class="contents">All these criteria, included in Amendment No 1 from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, are aimed directly at promoting employment in the least-favoured sectors, and their inclusion in the Regulation in no way distorts competition. The comparison of the anti-competitive effects of this aid with other types of aid, if we analyse it soberly, is something of an insult to the intelligence.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not going to get into a debate here on public aid and its effects on competition, but, if there is any public aid worthy of being seen as compatible with the objectives of the Treaty, then that is the aid aimed at promoting employment.</p>
<p class="contents">It would not be good to give the European citizens and workers the impression that the Commission shows signs of flexibility when allowing other types of aid, while being extraordinarily strict when it comes to employment aid. Furthermore, it would be appropriate to include the social economy sector – in a general sense – as an exempt sector. As all the honourable Members know, social economy companies provide a significant cushion in terms of maintaining employment when there is crisis in a sector, and that reality should be reflected in the Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the report adopted certain paragraphs have been introduced in relation to the preference for employment flexibility measures over aid for the promotion of employment. I am not going to get involved in refuting this idea, which – like all ideas expressed in such emphatic terms – reflects a rigid and distinctly conservative approach, which I cannot agree with. But, quite simply, the honourable Members will have to recognise that whatever the ideological position they hold, this is a strange and extravagant idea at this time, which should not appear in the report, since it relates to other issues. To insist on it would imply an excessive interest in sending messages in favour of a certain action, which cannot be shared by important sectors, both in Parliament and in European society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the employment situation in the Community, every aspect of employment represents, and must represent, an essential political priority. I welcome Parliament’s comments on this proposal, which seeks to reduce the administrative burdens on national authorities which employ State aid measures to respond to the challenge represented by employment. I am all the more pleased to note the generally very favourable tone of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware and as the rapporteur has just pointed out, the proposal concerns a fourth exemption regulation in the field of State aid, which follows on from the exemption regulations already in force in the areas of training, aid to small and medium-sized enterprises and <span class="italic">de minimis</span> aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim behind all these regulations is to reduce the administrative burdens upon national authorities, exempting them from the obligation to notify measures which are clearly compatible with the internal market. The proposal concerns the relationship between two essential Community objectives: employment and competition. The need to find the right balance between these two objectives<span class="bold"> </span>is clear – and let it be understood that in saying this I am in no way trying to suggest that competition and employment are two objectives which are incompatible. On the contrary, we are convinced that, worldwide, sustaining a dynamic market economy in which the forces of competition are free to express themselves will contribute greatly to increasing employment levels.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, of course, countless measures that the Member States can and, indeed, do take to promote employment. Many of these do not constitute State aid, particularly when they are not selective but cover the entire economic activity of a Member State. The draft regulation does not relate to these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be pointed out that, in many cases, State aid with different primary objectives also has the implicit objective of promoting employment. This is the case of regional investment aid, for example, and aid to certain sectors. The regulation before us only concerns aid which is formally and explicitly linked to the achievement of employment objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The text does more than just streamline the administrative requirements: it clarifies the fundamental rules which apply to employment aid too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has worked very hard on this report and it is a good one. The report and the underlying regulation seek to establish clearer and more transparent rules for state aid for employment. Streamlined procedures for Member States wishing to aid employment schemes are to be welcomed and sensitivity to local circumstances is also desirable. The report welcomes and expresses support for the state aid register, which the British Conservatives have made a priority. It is vitally important that we keep track of the various Member States and their record on state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of general principles, we believe that it is vitally important to restrict the areas where state aid can be given. I am not sure whether we would go as far as Mr Monti – I believe he has referred to state aids in the past as evil – but we certainly believe that it is necessary to restrict state aid in order to maintain economic efficiency and economic prosperity and a level playing field between companies in different Member States. Having said that, this report and the regulation acknowledge that certain state aids are acceptable and indeed desirable in relation to employment schemes. We are, however, very wary about the degree of extension that can be accepted even in this case, because of our suspicion of state aids. But we believe the Commission has drawn the line at a sensible point. That is also reflected in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not go as far as Amendment No 1, as put forward by Mr Berenguer Fuster. In particular paragraph (a) of Amendment No 1, which seems to specifically condemn temporary as opposed to permanent contracts, is not appropriate and should not be supported by the House.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the House to remember that state aid, in this context, is rather like a Band-Aid or a sticking plaster being applied to a gaping wound. State aid for employment, where it is permitted, as appropriate, by this regulation, can never actually solve Europe's unemployment problems. It is appropriate to permit government state aid for employment schemes in restricted circumstances, but the real way to tackle the 18 million unemployed in Europe, to give people genuine job opportunities, is by labour market reform, by producing structural and economic reform and labour market flexibility, making it easier to hire people. That is the way to deal with the serious and unacceptably high level of unemployment in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So we accept this as a pragmatic and sensible measure. Both the regulation and the report make sensible proposals, but it is vitally important that we address the key issue, which is labour market flexibility and economic reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is precisely because the private economy is failing to live up to its responsibility and create secure jobs that we need more aid to promote employment in the European Union. You only have to think about current mass unemployment and the different situations in the regions to realise that this regulation is crucial, because it creates greater transparency, cuts red tape, provides legal security and improves comparability and, with it, we shall soon be in a position to judge how effective aid is.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting to note that national employment policies in the European Union have changed, gearing towards the common objectives of the employment strategy, with action plans being used as levers. But what struck us in this context is that the current employment guidelines make no reference to growth or to the desirable or undesirable effects of employment aid. We need to call for finishing touches to be put to the employment guidelines in the interests of mainstreaming and the coherence of European employment policies. We need to clarify that the contribution of both sides – employment policy and competition policy – to the European employment strategy can be guaranteed. I think that, in the proposal before us, the Commission rightly recognises the need to allow state measures in the form of employment incentives for companies, especially for certain disadvantaged groups. This is not just a logical consequence of the objectives set in Lisbon. Full employment is and always will be one of the most important objectives of the Lisbon strategy, Barcelona confirmed that. Which is why we must call for finishing touches in the form of a more flexible definition of which groups are to benefit. I think that the age limit of 25 should be raised to 30 and that the age limit for older employees should be dropped from 55 to 50, because society relies on both, young people entering employment and older people remaining in employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to call for special care to be taken to ensure that the differentiation which the Commission rightly makes in its proposal between small and medium-sized enterprises and large companies does in fact apply when this proposal is implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have not reached a view on this report as we would normally do, partly because we received it far too late. The same may also be true of other committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background of the matter we have just been discussing, namely the Commission Communication on policy coordination between economic policy, which involves competition policy, and employment policy and other areas of social policy, we need to consider to what extent we can achieve a number of things that are very important in the fight against unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">One example of a very important issue is a fourth exemption regulation. If you are in a region suffering from severe problems and pressure, where subsidies are needed and the procedure for obtaining them is very bureaucratic – I myself come from such a region, but I know countless others – then this is very irritating. In these circumstances it is great to see the social aims in existing legislation being given a chance, and that is what I meant just now when I was talking about exchange. I hope that this base will broaden in the future, and that starting from the Spring summit in Athens we will pursue exchanges in an attempt to achieve common social and sustainability goals, considering what economic policy can contribute to this process rather than bringing matters which the Treaty describes as subordinate in line with economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, against that background I think that this is an excellent proposal and believe it important for competition rules in general – I am thinking for example of services of general interest, which I could list – to be re-evaluated and tested against what we want to achieve through social policy. Looking at the Lisbon process as a whole, I think that a number of the assumptions contradict what we are trying to achieve with our employment objective. Some objectives, such as the new economy for example, were quite unjustly selected in the Lisbon process. We can see that now and realise the far-reaching consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">State aid based on those Articles 87 and 88. Those articles are very important in rechanneling back to the objectives of social policy, and that is why we must avoid any misunderstanding. Perhaps we now need to go a step further. I believe that we must not only ensure that existing regulations are properly translated into social objectives but must also look at what social objectives we need, as formulated in the Treaty among other documents, and consider whether we should revise the Treaty, for instance to put social policy and economic policy on an equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">Against that background, and considering the proposals contained in Mr Berenguer Fuster's report – and I should like to thank him and his committee for their work – I call on members to support Amendments Nos 1 to 4. Support by the whole of Parliament for these amendments could well sway us to vote for this proposal as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many different regulations, varying requirements and conditions, masses of provisions and long texts create a forest of rules. Citizens and companies are lost without expert help.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, European regulations are not shining examples of clarity and comprehensibility. Legal action taken and legal queries raised by local authorities, businesses and affected citizens shows that this can cause problems when it comes to applying for aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament should therefore support the proposal to simplify and clarify the rules on granting aid in the context of employment promotion.</p>
<p class="contents">Simplification and clarification does not mean adding numerous new objectives and ideas that are difficult to implement. It is in this context that I should like to make a brief comment on the first amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">The additions proposed in Amendment No 1 really belong to employment policy, and have no place in a resolution on granting aid on the basis of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, the Commission's regulation deals primarily with the financial side of granting aid. After all, aid is granted only when necessary and when justified by the circumstances. The additions mentioned in the first amendment are in my view also too broad for specific application in the context of granting aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I support this resolution, except for Amendment No 1. I also agree with Mr Bouwman that the procedural handling of this report has been somewhat bizarre. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need both, one presupposes the other. There is no contradiction between competition policy, growth policy and the need to grant aid to certain sectors, as this regulation clearly illustrates.</p>
<p class="contents">We realise that aid has to act as an incentive and help bridge the way to self-help. Aid is no substitute for economic policy and a well-ordered employment policy. We still think the best way of creating jobs is to have a functioning internal market, to implement the stability and growth pact, to pursue the Lisbon objectives and to introduce the four freedoms, a deregulated and more flexible employment market and an education system which encourages lifelong learning, diversification of skills and continuing learning.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome this regulation because it says yes to systemisation, simplification and bundling, yes to control and transparency, with the help of the aid register, yes to regulated employment aid for small and medium-sized enterprises, the pillars of European economic and employment policy, and because it says yes to greater coordination between the Commission's policy and the policies of the Member States and between ministries in the Member States. We have already moved in this direction in Austria, for example, by successfully merging the ministries of labour and the economy into a single ministry.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank you, Commissioner, for sending out a clear signal in your statements on aid and the floods that your aid policy takes account of regional differences in economic, competition and employment policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unlike some of my colleagues, I am not very enthusiastic about the regulation before us. I am quite sure that if no changes are made to the regulation during the consultation process many Member States will have the greatest difficulty in achieving the ambitious objectives of the European employment strategy to which they committed themselves in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to see 70% of the population of working age in employment by 2010, this also requires helping older workers, giving people without good educational qualifications access to employment and getting disabled people into jobs, all of which means that supportive measures will be needed. I am sure that greater flexibility and structural reforms will not suffice to solve these problems. However, Commissioner, the regulation focuses so much on competition that it will be almost impossible to achieve these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one example: the ceilings for support for vulnerable workers are set so low that from one day to the next all Flemish social insertion firms that provide meaningful work for the unskilled long-term unemployed will have to close down, unless we reclassify the workers as disabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point: I am still concerned that the Commission fails to recognise the institutional reality of some Member States. In my country and in others, it is the regions that set support for employment programmes. As the regulation is currently drafted, this responsibility comes under the specific measures, not the general measures, and must therefore be notified by the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I think that we have found a number of arguments for the Convention to limit competition policy, but I do hope that when the Commission applies this regulation it will be able to show that, even without amending the Treaty, it is able to reach a balance between employment objectives and competition objectives. And I should like to ask you whether it would be possible to ask the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in charge of monitoring the Lisbon objectives for its views on this regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You might wonder, since I support the regulation, why I am speaking at all, but I have taken the floor because we are confused about one fundamental matter. This is my question: why is it that, in a regulation which seeks to reduce bureaucracy through a series of measures – and we have already mentioned the specific sectors – was it decided to exclude the transport sector? I am taking as an example – most exceptionally – the domestic situation in Italy, where decisions have been taken over the years which have had debatable consequences, although it is also true that Italy is a country whose environmental conditions are very different from the rest of Europe. In a regulation which regulates employment measures in sectors which already have a great many problems and which need to diversify and to retrain their workforces, singling out the transport sector for absolute exclusion from the measure would appear to be something that the Commission might want to reconsider. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I want to ask Commissioner Monti, in replying to the debate, to address the 400 000 disabled workers, such as those at Remploy in Southend in my constituency – and in other workplaces throughout Europe – where the company employs more than 50% of disabled workers unable to work in the open labour market.

<p class="contents">I know the Commissioner has received representations from the General, Municipal and Boilermakers Trade Union and many others that the actual organisational, administrative and transport costs of such companies should also be exempted from the state aid rules.

First of all, there is a basic coherence between competition policy and employment policy, as Mr Karas quite rightly pointed out. There are two reasons for this coherence. Firstly, in the long term, a competitive economic environment will certainly contribute to the creation of sustainable employment, and, secondly, competition policy is sufficiently flexible – as is shown by the regulation – to combine overall rigour with the possibility of state aid where there are sufficient grounds for this.</p>
<p class="contents">State aid – this is another aspect of the rationale which I feel today’s speeches have picked up on very well – is, by definition, selective. Our goal is to ensure that it is selective in a way which benefits enterprises and groups of workers which are encountering particular difficulties. Aid for the creation of new jobs should, therefore, be granted to small and medium-sized enterprises – as Mrs Randzio-Plath pointed out – and to businesses located in assisted regions. Further aid should be allocated to fund the employment of disadvantaged groups of workers. This explains, amongst other things, why large companies located in non-assisted regions are excluded from the possibility of receiving aid for job creation. This is not to be interpreted as a lack of appreciation of such enterprises: we are simply acting consistently with the desire to support other enterprises which are in situations which justify aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules are now clearer and the amount of aid granted no longer depends on complex criteria such as whether or not jobs are linked to an investment project, and, moreover, they are now consistent with the rules on regional aid and aid to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of speakers – Mrs Villiers, in particular – have also mentioned the value of transparency in the state aid register too. I have to say that converting such a philosophy, which appears to be widely supported, into detailed, directly applicable provisions, is by no means a simple task. There may be some room for negotiation as regards the precise provisions, and I note the amendments tabled in this respect. I can tell you, for example, that we are considering the possibility of extending the definition of disadvantaged worker – I am addressing Mr Howitt, in particular – beyond that contained in the proposal published in the Official Journal in April. That text already included a provision on women in regions where unemployment among women is higher<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>than the regional average, as mentioned in Amendment No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">To move on to the subject of transport, raised by Mr Fiori, I have taken note of your suggestion, Mr Fiori, although, as you are aware, in terms of internal Commission responsibilities, this matter falls within the sphere of competence of Vice-President de Palacio, of course. I will just say that there are specific concerns regarding the excess of capacity in certain parts of this sector, particularly in the area of road transport, and we are, in general, of the opinion that where there are problems of overcapacity, it would not make sense to grant state aid, which could, indeed, exacerbate these problems. We will, however, give all due consideration to your comments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say – and here I am addressing Mrs Van Lancker, in particular – that we are considering providing the explicit possibility for Member States to notify measures benefiting workers who are not covered by the definition of disadvantaged workers. Moreover, we intend to make provision for the special case of sheltered employment for workers with disabilities.<span class="bold"> </span>There may also be other cases in which we might be able to consider increasing flexibility too.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by thanking the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, once again for their very valuable contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
