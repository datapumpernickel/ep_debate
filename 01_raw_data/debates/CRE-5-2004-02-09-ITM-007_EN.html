It follows that the underlying principle – of cautious and balanced actions – is the right one. The Commission has various options in mind for the reform process, and the report makes reference to them.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rapporteur, the most important thing is still that every orientation and every reform measure must be aimed at combating poverty, consistently and without ideological blinkers. Containing poverty, and eventually overcoming it, will be the greatest challenge facing the human race in the twenty-first century. The progress made so far is, however, modest at best, and new setbacks are constantly hindering or even nullifying it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that the report, like the Commission communication, discusses a wide variety of options, although there is no mistaking the different emphases and priorities adopted by the Commission and the rapporteur. Although services of general interest are the subject of controversy in the Member States of the European Union, they may, in those countries, be regarded as relatively stable, but problems are nevertheless ever-present. That is far more the case in the developing countries and will remain so for longer, for they often totter on the brink of a catastrophe. The European Union’s efforts should, above all, be devoted to supporting and motivating them. Whilst the Commission, and also several of my fellow-Members of this House, are strongly in favour of privatisation, all the experience we have had, including in the EU’s Member States, leads me to urge that, along with a responsible role for the public sector and the State, the focus should be on cooperative solutions and also the involvement of the private sector in these states. In the private business sector, priority should be given to the promotion and development of small- and medium-sized enterprises, which lay the foundation for more jobs and self-supporting economic development in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, in principle, endorse Mr Deva’s amendments. Were they to be adopted, the report would lose its critical view of things and would not be equal to the nuanced handling of the reform process that is necessary. Nor, too, are they in line with the primary tendency of the report as adopted by the committee. Finally, they do not go as far as the Commission in terms of willingness to enter into dialogue, and are incompatible with the character of the reform process.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I have endeavoured to propose and achieve workable solutions. Far from sticking rigidly to principles and to ideological points of view, everything should be subordinated to the great goal of the war on poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is clear that the Commission, with these two communications, is trying to highlight the importance of the business sector to development. The development of businesses and the existence of a dynamic private sector are basic factors in economic development and are the main source of employment in developing countries, especially if account is taken of the unofficial sector of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We outlined the experience which the Commission has as regards the support of the private sector, the benefits which derive from action at Community level and the need to harmonise the various means. Thus, we can determine sectors which reflect the actions undertaken by the Commission, on the one hand, and those which are rightly left to others to implement, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as state-owned enterprises are concerned, our intention is to contribute to their reform in developing countries. It is clear that there are huge losses and inefficiency in state-owned enterprises but, of course, this reform needs to be integrated into the framework of plans to restore macro-economic and financial balances and promote development.</p>
<p class="contents">We avoided adopting easy or simplified ideological approaches. Finally, we have not put an end to the discussion on ownership, by which I mean if they are state-owned or private enterprises or partnerships between the public and private sectors. Our objective is to expose all the arguments and analyse them so that, once we have objectively got all the interpretations, we can make a final choice which reflects the needs of each country and each sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that the Commission has always had a constant position on these programmes, which always took account of the social repercussions of programmes to liberate the economy and it is interesting that, over the years, even the Bretton Woods institutions have adopted the same stand. We recognise the huge importance of domestic investors, as well as the investments which European small- and medium-sized enterprises can make, especially those which have experience and knowledge. We highlight the need to lay down suitable regulatory frameworks and supervisory mechanisms; these are issues of vital importance on which the Commission wishes to put its experience and the high level of expertise which it has at the disposal of the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As I mentioned, we place great emphasis on the need to attract investors and create a favourable environment. This strategy has as its objective the development of the credit sector in developing countries, the promotion, as an efficient means of funding, of small enterprises and micro-credit institutions which play a vital role in granting small loans to the unofficial sector of the economy, which mainly includes enterprises run by women. The two communications are complementary and have been drafted on the criterion and with the ultimate objective of further reducing poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, with the debate in Parliament and your resolution on it, we shall make a better contribution to the understanding of the need to invigorate business development in these countries and help the necessary reform of state-owned enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased to be associated with the report as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry External Trade, Research and Energy. I am particularly pleased that the Committee on Development and Cooperation decided to integrate fully the recommendations which I made on behalf of the Industry Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight what I believe are some of the key elements in the reform of state-owned and private enterprises in developing countries. Later in the week, corporate governance is on the agenda in this House, following the recent Parmalat case in Italy. We are all aware also of the Enron scandal in the United States. In other words, the issues of the efficient running of enterprises are as pertinent in western, developed market economies as they are in developing countries. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that a thriving and efficient private sector can play a major role in developing the economy of third countries and in combating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support the idea of EU assistance to the business sector in developing countries through intermediaries. I share the Commission's view that reforms of state-owned enterprises must take account of the capacity and resources of the countries involved. Many of the enterprises in question are essential to development in the fields of energy, water, transport and infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Reform of state-owned enterprises in developing countries should not be confined to privatisation measures. An overriding goal should be to ensure affordable access to services of general interest, such as water supply, drainage, energy supply, education and health services. The EU should encourage reform strategies which involve domestic investors and devote particular attention to decentralised solutions involving small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that businesses in developing countries should be assisted, particularly in the fields of good governance, institution building and consultancy. Our own SME sector should be actively engaged in this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I enjoyed working with him in the Committee on Development and Cooperation on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no single holistic approach to the management of public utilities that fits all developing countries. Evidence from post-independent developing countries in the past 50 years shows that state-owned enterprises have, in the majority of cases, failed to efficiently and cost-effectively provide water, waste management, municipal services, road transport, aviation services, mining, reforestation and energy supplies, thereby making them a considerable burden on the state budget, hindering economic growth and impoverishing the poorest. Poverty, diseases and lost economic opportunities have increased because of the state management of public utilities by bureaucrats whose first priority is job security and not economic efficiency: just look at the failed Soviet system.</p>
<p class="contents">It is imperative to get the private sector involved in the provision of public services in developing countries in order to increase cost efficiency as well as economic growth. The private sector alone can generate sustainable employment and is the driving force of every modern economy. Public utilities in developing countries should be privatised through open international procedures that are transparent, quick and not onerous, and able to meet sustainable development and public interest criteria. Ideally, the award of a tender should be the sole task of an independent, foreign financial institution, acting alone, according to international norms and reporting conditions, and one that has no conflict of interest in that country or in that project.</p>
<p class="contents">I have studied this process for many years and have sadly come to a very sad and bitter conclusion: many foreign direct investors are put off by tedious and laborious tender procedures, consultants' reports, evaluation committees and committees to evaluate other evaluations – devices constructed by officials of developing countries and consultants to international bodies to earn money either through fees or corruption. These procedures are an open door to the impoverishment of countries through delay, vacillation and corruption. The more decision-makers there are in the loop, the more corruption there is.</p>
<p class="contents">Such corruption takes various forms.</p>
<p class="contents">The first form is that of accelerating a decision and overlooking a better bid by making payments to high government officials, such as are to be found in East Asian countries. The other form of less detectable corruption to be found in South Asian countries and Africa is making payments to block the success of another more favourable bid by a competitor. In the former case, despite the corruption and the more inferior services now provided, the job gets done and some form of utility is provided, while in the latter nothing ever gets done and the economy suffers. The former is endemic in the North and East Asian countries, while the latter is epidemic in South Asia and Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">When large transnational companies are encouraged to invest, through foreign direct investment, in developing countries, they should also be empowered to make offset investments. By offset investments I mean that they should be able to put a part of that investment into social capacity-building, into schools, hospitals, training colleges and youth centres, so that there is a public element in the privatisation of a public utility whereby everybody around the utility benefits.

I welcome the Commission's communication and I agree with the Commissioner that we need reform of state-owned enterprises. When resources are tight, we need to ensure that they are used effectively. I also agree that we have to be sensitive to the needs of the countries involved and not adopt dogmatic solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">If you look at our own history, public services have played a vital role in our economic development: they helped to end poverty and disease, and, by adopting the principle of universal access to public services, we managed to help eradicate poverty, raise living standards and create more equal societies. When we are looking at public services in the developing world, we must also focus on the eradication of poverty as a top priority of our reform of public services and state enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one other key ingredient we should not miss out on and that is the principle of public accountability. That accountability should include scrutiny by elected representatives, independent regulation and the involvement of civil society and NGOs. We have some models of good practice in our own countries to show how public services can be held accountable. If we have more accountability built into the way we look at reform in these countries, I am sure we will have the kind of public services which deliver for people, make sure resources are used effectively and help us to pursue our own development goals of eradicating poverty and raising living standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to Mr Modrow, the report has the virtue of pointing out the contradictions, and sometimes even the inconsistencies, in the European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is not actually impartial on the issue of strengthening or not strengthening State-owned sectors in countries with which it has close relations. Unfortunately, it too often advocates a policy of reducing public costs and deficits in response to the structural adjustment measures dear to international financial institutions, a policy which, in its wording, admittedly seeks to reduce poverty but which in reality can end up being to the total detriment of the peoples concerned. In this way, the incentives and pressures exerted on these countries with a view to privatising their economies has a price, and this is a high price to be paid by the men and women in these countries, a high price for the employees concerned, there as here. There is a chronic lack of connection between economic and financial objectives, and the need to satisfy, above all else, the needs and fundamental rights of these peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">In this framework, the often too exclusive call on the private sector is at best a deception and at worst a seizure of economic, social and political power, which slips from the control of the peoples in these countries. We are aware of the drastic social consequences of this. If this is not the case, why then does the Commission always refuse to carry out a transparent, public and openly debated assessment of the effect of liberalisation on employment, on the quality and the extent of the services provided and on working conditions in Europe itself? Yet, such an assessment would render more credible its call for the European Union’s experience on this matter to be considered. If combining a strong and modern State-owned sector and private enterprises could be desirable to meet needs, in particular in the services area, it is nonetheless a fact that the call for public-private partnerships at present actually does more to weaken public enterprises than to create an overall dynamic.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the jungle of competition, the safeguards – when there are any – that are meant to maintain, strengthen and modernise services of State-owned enterprises are not enough. Without employees being involved in decisions and the destiny of the enterprise, without consulting the peoples and without a genuine code of practice which restricts multinationals involved in developing countries, recourse to private investments amounts to financial takeovers by large corporations, without there being any improvement to the service and often to the detriment of the national interests of these countries. The ever more dominant role of these transnational companies in the world clearly benefits the financial, speculative and stock market system more than the people of the South.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, furthermore, surprised that the Commission is furthering privatisation as a means to fight corruption. In this regard, a great deal of experience in Europe and throughout the world far from verifies these assertions. The EU should strengthen its aid to the developing countries according to the criteria of whether enterprises are modernising by moving towards democratisation in decision-making processes, with more transparency in the operation of public service enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and I will conclude on this point, the fundamental rights of every person to health and education must remain in the public sphere, just as water, transport, health and energy should remain outside of the GATS. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The nationalisation episode in the decolonisation era was followed by an episode of wild privatisations of undertakings, only for these often to become impoverished. Invariably, it was the political elite that pocketed the profits and placed these in foreign bank accounts during both eras. Invariably, too, Western multinationals acted as corrupted undertakings in order to lay their hands, for a song, on vital national industries such as mining and raw materials. When I visit Africa, I am often embarrassed on their behalf about their unethical behaviour, by the way, for example, in which the Zambian copper sector, with the closure of the mines, has dragged along with it an entire social fabric, an economic fabric which has shattered an entire country.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that the development of a country requires investments. However, can the European Union not play a more positive role so as to help create the conditions to ensure that the reforms in state-owned undertakings can progress in a more favourable sense for the sake of development? I am not calling for dogmatism but for true partnership. A poor country is often not equal to the financial power of a multinational whose budget is many times greater than that of that country itself. If even we are not able to enforce the ethical codes of conduct for undertakings, how can we expect those poor countries to do so?</p>
<p class="contents">I join the rapporteur in calling for more attention and more resources to make the transition of small undertakings in the informal sector to the formal economy possible, and also for more resources for women, who are often active in this informal sector. They must have the first claim on aid, because their undertakings are probably the most direct way in which the fight against poverty in their country can be tackled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, the Commission's striving towards a predictable legal framework and a decrease in corruption receives my wholehearted support.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reform of state-owned undertakings, the Commission and the Modrow report are less convincing. First of all, the scope of both the Commission's policy framework and range of duties becomes too unwieldy. The Commission states that all other options must be examined before a developing country chooses to reform a state-owned undertaking. However, the Commission itself admits that the considerations to decide in favour of reform are political decisions. It is therefore unrealistic to make an objective consideration of the various options a requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is social policy. According to the Commission's communication and the rapporteur, the requirement of social measures must run parallel to reforms. This sounds charitable, but is inappropriate. After all, the European Community has no powers in the field of employment policy and social policy in the developing countries. These fall outside the remit of technical support and European development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in relation to the Member States' policies; there is hardly any reference in either the Commission communication or the Modrow report to the Member States' development cooperation in this field. The sustainable development relation between a developing country and a Member State could be the perfect framework in order to, for example, offer support in the event of redundancies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the relation between state-owned undertakings and poverty reduction; the Commission wishes to use poverty reduction as an assessment criterion for granting support to state-owned undertakings. This is not in keeping with its neutral position on private versus State ownership. The criterion should either apply just as much to private undertakings, or should not apply at all. In conclusion, support to undertakings in developing countries has my blessing, but the line of approach in the case of state-owned undertakings raises essential questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the major problems in the developing world was – and still is to a great extent – the absence of a truly free market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, socialistic and collectivistic experiments have generally exacerbated the problems rather than offered a solution to poverty. There appears to be a gradually growing consensus that governments alone will not bring universal happiness, and we have allowed free initiative to play a role. This is a positive development, and one that can only be applauded.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report states, there are different ways of reforming state-owned undertakings. Nobody can be opposed to gradual change. We should only add a word of caution with regard to obstacles as a result of all kinds of intermediate levels of government intervention which people might try to incorporate. It is, at any rate, positive that there is a willingness to provide small- and medium-size companies a role, both <span class="italic">in situ</span> and in the European Union. In my view, it is of the utmost importance for there to be a thorough and timely evaluation of the course of affairs, with no taboos, such as corruption, excessive bureaucracy, administrative inefficiency or even sheer incompetence. Moreover, this should not only apply to local governments, but also to NGOs and similar organisations, because, where dysfunction is concerned, these are only rarely called to task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish, however, at the same time to regret the generally negative attitude to free enterprise and private ownership that emerges in the draft report. The high living standards and prosperity achieved by the western world, Japan and Australia are not the results of monopoly and protectionism but of the free market economy’s and private enterprise’s many dynamic forces that promote development and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, this state of affairs has been particularly clear. Half our continent has tried another method involving centralised control and large state monopolies. The inefficiency and collapse of monopoly socialism in Europe has been the experience of many European peoples and has provided them with a bitter lesson. It is a lesson that we ought, indeed have an obligation to, pass on to countries that wish to construct democratic welfare societies. The developing countries must be given the same opportunity to develop and create an economic model involving free competition and an open market economy. It is not the EU’s task to try to prevent a development towards competition that will bring prosperity in its wake. It is not too much in the way of a market economy that has been the big problem in the developing countries. On the contrary, the problem has been too little in the way of free economies and too much in the way of monopolies, something that has led to mismanagement, corruption and stagnation.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully share the view concerning people’s need for clean water, efficient drainage, elementary health care and medical treatment, basic education and access to energy. It is not, however, the form of ownership in itself that is the most important thing, but a high degree of flexibility and efficiency in delivering these services. Competition is very important in this area. The developing countries naturally need regulations that provide a legal framework, and perhaps this is an area in which the EU can be of great help to the developing countries. Current political solutions in many developing countries are, unfortunately, often ineffective and expensive and only reach a limited proportion of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">Those developing countries that have succeeded in taking the step from poverty to wealth and prosperity have all given priority to competition and efficiency, not centralised state control and the building of monopolies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be said, however, that one of the two Commission Communications – the one entitled ‘reform of state-owned enterprises in developing countries with focus on public utilities: the need to assess all the options’ – made for more than thought-provoking, but at the same time welcome, reading for me. Indeed, we read that numerous liberalisations and privatisations that were carried out quickly in developing countries, under the pressure of structural adjustment plans that are often imposed, have had disastrous consequences in terms of job losses and the deterioration, and increase in price, of the services concerned. We would like the Commission to show similar clarity and objectivity when dealing with services of general interest within the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As is called for in the draft report, an initial step in this direction would be for the Commission to finally agree to carry out a transparent, public and openly debated assessment of the effect of liberalisation on employment, on the quality and the extent of the services provided and on working conditions in Europe. This would be just as beneficial internally as it would be in terms of better understanding the state of affairs in the southern countries. As I say, our objective is clearly to combat poverty and ensure that this is not just all talk.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look more closely at the various examples quoted in the Communication, we can see that among the positive experiences are cases in which State-owned enterprises have remained State-owned but in which mismanagement and corruption have been combated, the enterprise has gained renewed dynamism and effectiveness in its management and, above all, a regulatory and political framework has been implemented, which has clear objectives that are ambitious in terms of development, accessibility and quality of service and that are, in particular, financed by tariff adjustment.</p>
<p class="contents">These different elements do not amount to a commercialisation of the State-owned enterprise according to the Commission’s definition but, instead, constitute, in my view, factors for good management of public utilities, which we also need to establish at European level, perhaps through a framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point is that those in favour of the general liberalisation of utilities though the GATS claim that opening up public utilities in developing countries can only benefit them. A more pragmatic analysis should favour a different economic development strategy: one that is centred on the local economic and social actors and small- and micro-enterprises – with account being taken, in particular, of women and basic public utilities – and one that, above all, does not hand such enterprises over to the reckless appetites of the multinationals. Excuse me at this point, however, for I think we are talking about ethics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore clear that the most valuable contribution that the European institutions can make – and I would say, in general, the most important contribution that developed countries can make – is to guarantee legal infrastructure that protects legal certainty and to support and guide processes towards democratisation and the recognition of the principles of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission document only briefly refers to this issue, which I consider to be key, and the report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation does, I am sorry to say, drop this reference and concentrates on the tragic consequences of the policies promoted by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. You see, I do not believe that it is right, even in such situations, to attribute liability to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for certain bankruptcies; I am thinking about the Argentinian affair, where it is ever clearer that the failure, the decline of the State itself, is not to be attributed to the Monetary Fund or the World Bank but to the level of corruption and the level of statism present in that economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is said that we do not want to be ideological, but I fear that that is what we are in actual fact being. It is good to consider all the options; I believe, however, that the political option that we must propose is privatisation of enterprises with a view to seeking efficiency and investment. We want services to be available to the people, and to be available to an extent, and with a degree of quality, that satisfies needs that are not satisfied today. I believe that asking corrupt and inefficient public utilities to provide this service is wrong. The privatisation option – both in Europe and also in developing countries – is the politically desirable option. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the rapporteur that the main focus must be on combating poverty and safeguarding the availability of basic services, and that the priority is support for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent decades Structural Adjustment Programmes have been used to try and respond to the call for economic development. These have involved the opening up of markets and various types of arrangements, including privatisation. This, however, has not always improved the situation; on the contrary, it has contributed substantially to the spread of poverty in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission quite rightly states that that there are various options for reforming State-owned enterprises, such as reform of a public enterprise without altering its ownership structure, or partial privatisation. It is absolutely vital to take account of the parameters when selecting different types of reform. With privatisation, particular attention needs to be devoted to competition law and its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The various options for reform must be weighed up, and here it is essential to involve civil society, particularly users’ and consumers’ organisations, cooperatives and trade unions, in decision-making and in monitoring the measures taken. At all events, the stated overriding objective of the EU’s development cooperation – combating poverty – must be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication on the approach to future support for the development of the business sector in third countries<span class="bold"> </span>also contains some good basic ideas. It is excellent that the Commission should put forward an overall strategy for the business sector. The basic aim of that strategy must simply be that there should be investment in the developing countries. People must be able to expect it. It cannot be based on the bottomless well principle.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to have tangible support for SMEs and cooperatives by means of advice in the fields of services, training, business modernisation, and promotion of micro-enterprises, particularly by ensuring there is available funding. It is nevertheless essential to remember that enterprises and cooperatives in the developing countries also need customers that are going to spend their money, and the market with the greatest purchasing power is us, the EU. For that reason, the channels of fair and sustainable trade must be made to work in such a way that European consumers are able to support enterprises and producers in developing countries by means of their own purchasing decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
