<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Danielsson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the Israeli election for prime minister on 6 February, the peace process in the Middle East is at an uncertain stage. During the negotiations in Taba, the parties came closer than ever before to a negotiated solution. At the same time, the violence in the Palestinian areas and the large number of dead and injured has meant a serious reduction in trust between the negotiating parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Israeli Government faces change, irrespective of the outcome of the election for prime minister on 6 February but, at the same time, there should hopefully be a strong desire for peace on the part of both the Israeli and Palestinian populations. The Israeli election for prime minister and the forthcoming formation of a government will be important factors in determining the future direction of the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the difficulties, the parties have not wanted to forfeit the progress achieved in spite of everything. In Taba, the parties negotiated directly with each other and without any third party present. The atmosphere on that occasion was serious and results-oriented, and both parties declared themselves optimistic about the opportunities for achieving a final settlement. However, time did not permit any such final settlement to be reached in Taba, but the parties agreed upon a joint concluding statement on 28 January which may constitute a platform to build upon further whenever the negotiations for a final settlement are resumed. I would draw the honourable Members’ and Parliament’s attention to the fact that this statement particularly emphasises the European Union’s role in the continued work for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency is not alone in receiving requests from many quarters to see a strengthening of the European Union’s already major commitment to the whole Middle East issue. The EU has an important role to play in as much as we are the most important trading partner of practically all the countries in the area, as well as the largest donor of public aid to the Palestinian areas. Through its Special Envoy, Mr Moratinos, who has been present the whole time, the EU has of course been able to follow the negotiations in Taba. The very fact that Mr Moratinos has been able to participate and show the European Union’s support for the negotiations and its readiness to assist the parties has been of great value to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to emphasise that, in recent weeks, the presidency has had regular contacts at the highest level with both the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships. A recurrent theme for the presidency in these contacts has been the European Union’s desire to assist the parties in whatever way they wish. Throughout, these contacts have taken place in close collaboration with the High Representative and the General Secretary of the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to emphasise the significance of the fact that the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Mr Solana, is part of the international commission under the leadership of Senator Mitchell which is investigating the current violence in the Palestinian areas and which, hopefully, will eventually submit proposals to prevent a recurrence of this violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The ever lengthening crisis has presented the Palestinian population with severe economic and humanitarian problems. The Palestinian Authority has also been grappling with major budgetary problems since the Israeli Government stopped the transfers of tax funds it is obliged to make in accordance with the ‘Paris Protocol’. In a statement of 22 January, the General Affairs Council called upon Israel to resume these transfers. On the initiative of Commissioner Patten, the European Union has also used extra appropriations in order to make funds temporarily available to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights situation continues to give cause for concern. The European Union has intervened with the Palestinian Authority in connection with the death sentences recently carried out. The Union has also intervened in Israel to condemn the extra-judicial executions of Palestinians, corroborated by military sources. We shall continue to monitor these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, there is no new information about initiatives or progress in the peace negotiations between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">In dialogue with the parties and also in close collaboration with the new American administration, the European Union will continue to do what it can to bring all aspects of the peace process to a successful conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solana,</span></span>   <span class="italic">High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, I would like very briefly to try to add some more specific elements, from a political point of view, to the speech which the presidency has just made.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that today’s debate is crucial given the time at which it is taking place. I believe that we should focus the debate on at least three questions. The first is what will the political scene in Israel be like after the elections on 6 February? The second, which the presidency also mentioned, is how can this cycle of violence that we have witnessed over recent months be brought to an end? And the third, and perhaps most important, is what direction must we give to the peace process in 2001?</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2000 was a year of hope. It began with the idea that a definitive solution could perhaps be reached. Certain significant measures were adopted in relation to Syria. Unfortunately, however, 2000 ended without us being able to achieve peace. Let us do everything possible so that 2001 might truly be the year in which we do achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation is, of course, still very fluid. I must tell you that I spent this very morning in Stockholm holding a meeting with the Swedish prime minister and President-in-Office of the Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We were talking practically until lunchtime when I took the plane to come here and be with you this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">Many initiatives are taking place at the moment; initiatives which we hope will bring success, with the possibility of a final and definitive summit before the elections of 6 February. I believe that there is still the possibility that this summit will take place, and also the possibility that it may take place in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As the presidency has clearly pointed out, we have seen some truly significant activity since 23 December of last year, and we have all been involved in an enormously active sense. So much so that, if you will allow me, Madam President, I will tell you that I spent the first day of the year in Israel, together with Mr Barak and Mr Arafat, and we made significant progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the meetings which took place in Taba, as the presidency has said, have been without doubt – according to all the participants – the most substantial negotiations we have ever had. Progress has been made in all areas.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of land, we are very close to potentially reaching an agreement – if there is actual time to conclude it – on very nearly a hundred per cent of the land, involving some land exchanges.</p>
<p class="contents">From the security point of view, I believe that a good agreement can be reached, accepting that there can be three early warning stations and that, along the Jordan Valley, international forces can be deployed to guarantee stability.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of Jerusalem, as you know, talks are continuing, with some progress, on the problem of how to define the Wailing Wall and the Western Wall. There has still been no precise decision on this. However, there is still a desire to make progress and to reach a definitive solution on Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Taba meetings, progress has also been made on the issue of the refugees, and progress has been made on specific and practical issues. The sub-committee set up for this purpose has made considerable progress on all issues relating to the refugees, although it has had to postpone, for the time being, the crucial aspect of the right to return. They have postponed that issue in order to find specific and practical solutions to specific and practical problems, such as international committees, how to find resources in the different countries to help in that direction, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, there is still reason to be hopeful that we may either reach a definitive agreement – a faint hope, to be honest, since there is little chance of reaching a definitive agreement by Sunday – or that we may gain an explicit commitment from both sides on a range of parameters so that, whatever the situation in Israel and the territories after 6 February, there will always be a range of commitments that have been agreed on, accepted by both sides, which means that we will not have to start the next negotiations practically from scratch.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you that, on the part of the European Union, all the successive Presidencies, with no doubt whatsoever, are going to maintain a commitment which is not only political but also personal. Prime Minister Göran Persson is personally completely committed – and I have witnessed this during the hours we have spent together on the telephone holding the negotiations necessary to reach a solution – and, on our part, please do not have the slightest doubt that we will remain physically, psychologically and politically involved in it, because, as you know, a resolution to this conflict in the Middle East is in our interests, very much in our interests.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to highlight the constructive behaviour of the countries in the region. Both Jordan and Egypt continue to maintain a firm and determined commitment to trying to find a negotiated and definitive solution. There are going to be difficult moments, without doubt, after the elections; there will be uncertainties and we will need to continue to have – as we Europeans have always had – the determination to continue supporting this peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">From other points of view – from the economic point of view – the presidency has already explained what we are doing. I am sure the Commission will also do so. We will continue the generosity that the European Union has always shown.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words also about the committee of enquiry, the committee which arose from the Sharm el-Sheikh meeting. The committee has worked well for some time but, as of a week ago, the Israeli Government decided to break contact with it until after the elections. Therefore, although there is still a team from the committee still deployed on the ground, we members of the committee as such will not go to the territories until 16 February. That is what I can tell you at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to repeat that we will continue to work over the remaining days with energy and determination and, if eventually a summit is held, the European representation will attend it and will do everything possible to push this process in the right direction.</p>

I do not intend to repeat any of the things I said in the last debate nor do I intend to repeat what the President and the High Representative have just said, not because it is not important, but because repetition would insult the intelligence of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we all hope for progress in the peace talks. Naturally, we all believe it would be foolish to speculate on the post-election scenario in Israel. It is for the people of Israel to make their democratic choice and then for the rest of us to deal with the consequences. Naturally, we are all seriously concerned about the loss of life on both sides. There have already been a high number of victims because of an excessive use of force and we are deeply worried about the extra-judicial killings perpetrated by Israeli security forces. Not only does this undermine the prospects of achieving a negotiated settlement, it is also unacceptable for a democratic nation to resort to such means in grave violation of human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be equally clear, we are also deeply concerned by the killing of Israeli civilians by Palestinians and by the recent executions of Palestinians. This too is unacceptable, especially given the Palestinian authorities’ earlier commitment to a moratorium on the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">We also remain concerned about the humanitarian situation in the West Bank and Gaza. The remaining closures by Israel are having devastating effects on the Palestinian economy and therefore, not surprisingly, on political stability. They are even affecting the import of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian territories. For example, the Palestinian Authority has notified the Commission’s representative in Jerusalem that the official inauguration of the Gaza Hospital – a hospital with which this Parliament is perhaps all too familiar – originally foreseen for mid-January, has had to be postponed until further notice. The situation has deteriorated further, and staff and patients are prevented from even reaching the hospital. Similarly equipment and supplies, such as oxygen, medicines and fuel, cannot reach the hospital and further building work has had to be suspended.</p>
<p class="contents">In its preliminary implementation report following the December emergency appeal, UNWRA also raises concern about serious difficulties in the delivery of food, the delivery of construction material, medical items and other essential supplies. The security of staff engaged in humanitarian assistance has been severely compromised.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much regret that the situation has continued to deteriorate. However, we have continued to make our position crystal clear. We have demanded that the remaining closures on the Palestinian economy should be lifted. We have asked Israel to end immediately the withholding of revenue payments due to the Palestinian Authority and we have reacted promptly to the crisis by addressing both the humanitarian situation and the precarious budgetary situation of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">In December the Commission provided EUR 15 million in emergency aid, EUR 14.5 million alone to UNWRA in response to its emergency appeal. In addition, we disbursed a EUR 27.5 million special cash facility in the belief that it was in the interest of both sides not to undermine the Palestinian Authority’s ability to pay salaries. In the same spirit, the Commission set up the new cash facility of EUR 90 million which the presidency referred to. I am very grateful to Parliament and the Council for making that prudential transfer possible before Christmas. Last week I dispersed a first tranche of EUR 30 million to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to look at the likely situation for the rest of this year. As our resources are limited, we need to examine carefully how to proceed further. If we continue drawing monthly payments from the special cash facility in order to meet the current administrative needs of the Palestinian Authority, including payment of civil servants’ salaries, education, health and other public services, funds will very soon run out.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian Authority is now facing an ongoing fall in revenue and a rising deficit. They will need to adjust their policies. Instead of just baling out month-to-month we need to look at how to help over the longer term. Indeed the European Union and the wider international community have an interest in preserving the economic and institutional framework of the Palestinian Authority, which we have helped to create and which we have helped to fund more generously than any one else.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Palestinian Authority collapsed, it would be a very severe blow to prospects for peace in the region, Israeli security would be threatened and our efforts to promote cooperation and stability in the Middle East would be undermined. That is why both the Palestinian Authority and the international community at large must look beyond the immediate crisis and consider how to deal with the steadily widening gap in Palestinian finances.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one other point I should make and I make it with all due delicacy, but I do not think that it is contrary to the experience of honourable Members of this House who have recently been in the region. Whatever the appalling problems faced by the Palestinian Authority, with which I strongly sympathise, nothing would justify practices that fall below the level of probity that we have the right to expect from any recipient of our funds and that citizens in any community have every right to expect from their governing agencies. I believe I am right in saying, as I mentioned a moment or two ago, that some honourable Members who have recently been in the area have strong views on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to play our part in sustaining the Palestinian Authority, but if we are to do that then we have to be able to assure the budgetary authority of the European Union, which has to answer to Europe’s taxpayers, that the money we make available is being well spent and properly spent.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat what I said just now, that we want to do what we can to assist the Palestinian Authority. I hope very much that the authorities in Israel will end the economic and financial blockade of Palestinian areas because, in the short, the medium and the long term, this will increase instability and sustain the violence.</p>

<p class="contents">However, we must not forget that, up until today, there have been more than 400 deaths as a result of the Intifada, which has taken us back to a situation which we thought we would never see again. My group also sees the increased European presence in the region over recent months as something to be greatly welcomed. As the presidency mentioned, it is true that the participation of Mr Solana in Sharm el-Sheikh and the committee of enquiry, and the presence of the European Union in Taba through its permanent representative, Ambassador Moratinos, have enabled us to make effective contributions to the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that we have to intensify this quest for political presence in the region on the part of the European Union, which we believe is compatible with the fundamental role which the United States Government must continue to play in this whole process. In Taba, both sides acknowledged that they have never been so close to a final agreement, but we must be aware that the apparent euphoria must not make us blind to the real situation. The Israelis and the Palestinians must be aware that they share a common enemy, the extremism to which fundamentalism of one kind or another leads, which is the main danger to the peace process and to stability and prosperity in the region, and which also poses an undeniable threat to the whole of the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I believe that we must be aware that we are faced with a national conflict, handed down from history, which has impregnated the education systems of some countries and has promoted hate amongst the younger generations, which means that we clearly cannot expect a magic solution and that we must confront the problem with perseverance. I think it is highly appropriate to link the debates on the Middle East peace process to the new impetus which the European Union is endeavouring to give to the Barcelona Process, as we are doing this afternoon and as Commissioner Patten has done, because surely the greatest contribution Europe can make at the moment to the peace process is to keep alive the spirit of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, strengthening its vitality and maintaining its development in the face of political pressures.</p>
<p class="contents">Both Israelis and Palestinians have come to realise recently that it is crucial to end the violence and re-establish a climate of security in the region, but they have also worked together on the development of creative formulas to solve the problems dividing them: Jerusalem, the definitive mapping of borders, the refugees and the settlements which Mr Solana referred to. The European Union has the particular responsibility of consolidating these foundations despite the internal political changes of recent days. We must support both sides in their journey towards a solution to the conflict, based on the peaceful resolution of differences, on tolerance, on respect for human rights and the consolidation of peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, although the peace process may have run out of steam, the underlying principles still apply and are indisputable. Firstly, the Oslo fundamental agreements still exist and continue to be in force. No one, Mr Sharon included, can cast doubt on their validity, in moral terms and under international law. I expressly refer to the ‘Land for Peace’ principle, among others, which has formed the basis for rapprochement and negotiations since Madrid.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Security Council Resolutions Nos 242, 338, and needless to say, also No 194 on refugees, must be fulfilled, so as to create the foundation for a just and lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I come to the crucial problems that we must solve if peace is to be restored, as you yourself said Mr Solana: the return of all occupied territories and demolition of all settlements on these territories, Palestinians to have rights to parts of Jerusalem, the possibility of the return of Palestinian refugees, which perhaps causes the biggest headache of all.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall close by repeating something that has been said and given due emphasis before in this House. The European Union has a huge moral duty, and it is vital for reasons of self-interest, to play a political role in this peace process, which is in keeping with its political commitment. The division of labour of the past, according to which the USA made policy and the European Union paid for it, is no longer acceptable. Nor has it yielded any worthwhile result to date. It is not a case of the EU stepping into the shoes of the USA in the peace process, rather, what we want is for the European Union to join forces with the USA in a bid to find a just solution. Now that would be what I would call a new peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">With your presence, Mr Solana, and that of the UN Secretary-General, Sharm al-Sheikh created a new framework for peace negotiations. We would like to think that this new model will be retained and will deliver better results than its predecessor.</p>

According to the UN, since the closures, more than one million Palestinians have been living under the poverty line of two dollars a day. The human effect of the closures is possibly even worse. Commissioner Patten stated it a moment ago: sick people cannot even get to the European hospital in Gaza because even ambulances cannot get through the barricades. It is therefore of key importance that we continue providing aid. I am delighted that the Council and Commission share our view.</p>
<p class="contents">I returned from the Palestinian territories last Sunday together with a delegation from Parliament. We are all agreed on one thing: it is important to give money, but we are not giving enough. The Union must also assume its political responsibility. It is only managing to play a valuable role in the peace process in very small steps. That is due not least to the dissension within the Union. I would therefore like to hear from Mr Solana what he intends to do in order to bring the Union to sing from the same songsheet.</p>
<p class="contents">Once detailed maps of Jerusalem are available, as well as plans for the settlements, and a scheme for the return of and compensation for refugees, I wonder whether the Union will have the in-house expertise it takes to adopt an intelligent position of its own, or will we leave this to the Americans?</p>
<p class="contents">We must make sure this discussion does not become black and white. By maintaining a certain degree of neutrality, Europe could, in fact, make a valuable contribution. Both sides of this conflict are violating agreements. We must call them both to task about this. Killing people is unacceptable under any circumstances, whether this is in the form of executions carried out by the Palestinian Authority or the Israeli army’s assassination policy. But, Mr Danielsson, Europe will lay itself open to the criticism that it is applying double standards if it takes four and a half months to call the Israelis to account, whilst this is done promptly in the case of Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament too, with its secondary delegations, one for Israel and one for the Palestinian territories, is running the risk of sending out the wrong message. We must now work on unanimity and understanding of the legitimate concerns on both sides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During my most recent visit at the start of the Intifada, it was evident that economically, there was a future for a separate Palestinian state. If you now walk around in Bethlehem or Jerusalem, it is painful to see that the economy has completely bottomed out. This is as a result of the tourist trade drying up completely and of the policy of closures by the Israeli government, which is preventing tens of thousands of workers from commuting into work.</p>
<p class="contents">The political situation too has deteriorated dramatically due to the no-compromise rhetoric. This is now prevalent on the Palestinian side, and given the liquidations carried out by the Israeli government, this is a very understandable reaction. The European Union was right to condemn this policy, all be it a little belatedly. In short, my impression after last week’s visit, if I am being honest, is a very negative one.</p>
<p class="contents">In all truthfulness, I am not holding out too much hope for the future either. In that sense, I share the view of Mr Sakellariou. My expectation is that the peace process will grind to a halt as a result of the wait-and-see attitude of the Bush administration and the fact that I think that the Sharon government – which I am certain will soon be a reality – will initially keep reasonably calm in the face of international pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">But this standstill could be a blessing in disguise if the European Union were to use that time to its own advantage. This is possible and would be possible if it were to use its role as key donor to the Palestinians and as Israel’s key trading partner in an effective manner.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Palestinians, I believe that the European Union should act as follows. It should use its role as key donor to urge the Palestinians to end the widespread corruption, which many people protest against and are indignant about at regional level. Additionally, the Palestinian authorities should respect human rights to a much higher degree, not only in terms of executions but also, for example, in its treatment of prisoners. It would be unacceptable, with regard to respecting human rights, for the European Union to finance police training if in practice nothing were to change.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to comment on the Palestinians. Local elections are required in order to enhance the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority. As for Israel, I believe that the European Union should leave Israel in no doubt that if, after the forthcoming elections, repression increases, if the settlement policy does not change and if there is no movement in their willingness to reach an agreement, then we cannot proceed in a business-as-usual manner. We cannot continue to deal with a partner who refuses to do what we have been asking for for years. We should have the nerve to draw the necessary conclusions, to refer to the rules in the Association Agreement and dare to take measures. If the European Union uses this economic position to its advantage, it could well play a political role in future, a political role which does justice to the demands of the region and the interests of the Union itself.</p>

The media interpreted this as greater inflexibility on Arafat's part with regard to peace and criticised Peres for not standing up to him. The truth of the matter is that Peres knows that what Arafat is saying is true. The visit of our parliamentary delegation to the area also served to confirm this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian people are forced to live in an open-air prison, the roads leading into and out of the villages are under military occupation and closed off, countless check points on the main roads prevent the Palestinians from reaching their places of work and collective punishments are enforced. This is just one example: Sabrine was born on 24 January at a check point. At the next check point her umbilical cord was cut. The mother had left the village of Antis at 5 p.m. and arrived at Ramallah hospital at 8.30 p.m. The journey should have taken 40 minutes. Her epic ordeal was recorded in the Israeli newspaper <span class="italic">Ha’aretz. </span>People who are seriously ill are turned back and medical staff beaten up.</p>
<p class="contents">In Gaza, we saw hundreds of metres of land where enormous palm trees and olive and orange trees had been uprooted and destroyed, and houses demolished. It had become desert land. Was there something wrong with the trees? Only in that they could have served as cover for any Palestinian attacks against the settlers who are overrunning the country and treating it as theirs, destroying Palestinian houses and crops. Meanwhile, the number of settlers and settlements is increasing every day in what ought to be the State of Palestine, the territories which have been occupied since 1967.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian Legislative Council cannot function properly. The members of the different districts are unable to move about or to meet. Arafat himself said that his movements are hampered. Others have spoken of the tragic stifling of the economy. Imports and exports are blocked, and the European Union is witness to that: every day, the Commission in Jerusalem receives notification of the various violations;<span class="bold"> </span>even<span class="bold"> </span>civil structures and schools provided by the European Union have been bombed. These are economic disasters whose effects will be felt for years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is well-known, and none of us, particularly those in responsible political positions, can say that they were unaware of the facts. Our diplomats send back clear reports on the Israeli settlement policy and also clear reports – as we told all the Palestinian leaders we met – of the violations performed by the National Palestinian Authority. But they all asked us – from Arafat to the men and women in the refugee camps – why Europe does not intervene in an active, political way. "We have confidence in Europe," they said, "and a political partnership with the Middle and Near East would benefit Europe." This is our view as well: Europe must be able to develop an effective foreign policy which is in line with the fundamental values which we always claim to hold: respect for international laws and human rights. In terms of Palestine, that means upholding the UN Resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a pragmatic strain in the Palestinians; we have witnessed it and it was evident at Taba as well: they are pragmatic in implementation but resolute when it comes to principles and rights. We, too, should have realised this, for we are always discussing it.<span class="bold"> </span>Mr Solana is right: Europe is now playing a larger role but it must do much more. The United States has failed: our task is not to replace it but to become equal partners in the negotiations. It is not enough for us to provide economic aid: what we are being asked for – and our responsibility...</p>

In my view, the real nature of the problem, illustrated and interpreted against the backdrop of the Treaties establishing the European Union themselves, from the Treaty of Rome onwards, and against history and European law, has been wiped from all your minds, except for the odd refrain, muttered like a prayer, of human rights and so on and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">The present situation places us in the same condition of complicity with the worst of the worst, with the murderers and torturers, those that abused the right to life and attempted to destroy the law, as we witnessed from 1985 onwards in what was to become the former Yugoslavia. There is no strategy, no awareness of the institutional objectives of our Union in our approach today, at least in terms of the abstract goals set forth in the human rights charters and in the charters of the rights of European citizens and others. There is none of this in what the High Representative, Mr Solana, happily, courageously and, most importantly, sincerely recommended as an EU foreign policy, a bureaucratic, ineffective operation with no added value in terms of practical implementation or foresight.</p>
<p class="contents">This is our problem: there you are, Mrs Morgantini and company, falling over yourselves to tell us about the woes and tragedies of the Palestinians, of Palestinian men and women, of Arab men and women, of the Middle East. You are so relentless, so implacable, with such clear, diligent consciences; you only acknowledge Arab or Palestinian men and women if they are on the wrong end of an Israeli bullet, in which case you give them the honour of a burial, the honour of your recognition. In the face of the Palestinian, Arab or Middle Eastern citizens, who die every day, assassinated by their Saudi or fundamentalist right- or left-wing regimes, assassinated by the firm, historic alliance of Sheikhs and Middle Eastern<span class="bold"> </span>rulers, who are allied with the great oil multinationals and with you, the more or less communist left; in the face of the situation of the Kurds, which is not just a Turkish problem but also an Iraqi problem and the problem of others as well; in the face of the everyday lives of the Saudi and Palestinian men and women, you are only concerned with them if Israel is involved, and it may have done them some serious damage. You only acknowledge the existence of the Palestinian people when they further your condemnation of your current permanent enemy, be it the United States of America, Israel or the European Union, which is acting to protect certain values, as it did in the case of Belgrade and Milosevic, as it did throughout the crisis in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, this is the truth of the matter: the greatest threat to peace is Israel's real weakness. Israel might be prepared to take a risk – and this is why the Israeli people appear, surprisingly, to prefer the old warrior Sharon to the wise, sensible, courageous Barak – but it feels that any concession could turn out to be excessive compared to the peace to be gained. This is the problem: when there are 100, 150 kilometres of territory to cross, one more kilometre conceded might, in effect, represent one more trench to fight from in a war sparked off by an unfair peace agreement. This is what they fear. But who fears, exactly? The Israeli democracy is afraid of this, but you could not care less! For heaven's sake! What sort of Europe is this? If anything, the right to national and personal<span class="bold"> </span>independence is not to have 60% of your money spent on the armies of the local dictator, on consolidating corruption and class, bureaucratic, military and extreme right-wing control of men and women everywhere! Where is it laid down that the European Union must be the guarantor of the national states, of their independence<span class="bold"> </span>and self-determination? Nowhere in our hearts and culture does the nineteenth century right to the national state exist today: civil, political and human rights with regard to any state, central or centralised authority do exist, and you are unaware of all this!</p>
<p class="contents">Israel must become part of the European Union, one of our borders. Israel does not realise either that it cannot continue to defend itself as a national State, a small bridgehead of democracy but forced for 50 years, more so with each passing day, to risk its own life and peace and the peace of others. Therefore this, Mr President, is our hope: we are preparing a written statement, which has already been signed by 30 Members, calling for the full inclusion of Israel in our Union. A battle will have to be fought in Brussels and in Tel Aviv but it is an urgent matter. As radicals, this is our aim and we will make every effort to achieve it, for it is a wise course of action which will lead to freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The intention to work in close cooperation with the new American Bush administration within this diplomatic minefield deserves the support of the European Parliament. This view bears witness to an understanding of the political constraints of the European Union in the Middle East. This realism was expressed very aptly by the High Representative of the CFSP, Mr Solana, in a recent interview with the <span class="italic">Süddeutsche Zeitung</span>: “We can be persuasive, exert pressure, and grant financial aid, but we also know our limits. The only country which can provide credible security guarantees for both sides is the United States.”</p>
<p class="contents">In its conclusions, the General Council also particularly urges Israelis and Palestinians to make every effort to bring the current negotiations in Taba to a successful end. According to spokespeople from both camps, these have now been concluded, and not without hope for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, how, in this specific context, have the Council and Commission taken the harsh accusations which the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mr Arafat, levelled at the state of Israel and its armed forces, in Davos at the beginning of this week? Against the backdrop of the Israeli presidency elections to be held on 6 February, this verbal attack thwarted conclusively the plan for a meeting between the Israeli Prime Minister Barak and Arafat in Stockholm today.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would therefore like to hear the view of the Council and Commission on Mr Arafat’s international stance, which was anything but constructive.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of its conclusions, the General Council lectures Israel on its economic and financial policy <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Palestinian Authority. However, an equally critical tone on the public execution of two so-called ‘collaborators’ by the same Palestinian Authority is missing from this document. Why is this? After all, the Palestinian human rights organisations dared lodge a protest against a highly deficient judicial process which was challenged with good reason. I take it that the Council and Commission are not applying their own standards of democratic rule of law on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the clear stance taken by the Swedish Presidency and Commissioner Patten in this debate have not betrayed my confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union must accept its due responsibilities, alongside our American counterparts. This is what you are striving to achieve, Mr Solana, in close collaboration with Mr Moratinos and many of us welcome the work that you have undertaken to this end. Whilst waiting for the results of the changes taking place in Washington and those which will inevitably follow the results of the forthcoming elections in Israel, we understand that you are bound to be cautious and that it is difficult for you to make any sort of forecast at this time, Mr Solana, even if we might have detected a note of optimism in your speech, something we should be only too delighted to share. The view of the Group of the European People’s Party, one I am sure is shared by many of the Members in other political groups, is that, through your work, the European Union should be involved, perfectly impartially, in the current Conciliation Procedure in order to enable the expected appeasement that comes before the hoped-for reconciliation to be reached. The European Union can put itself forward as mediator only on condition that it is impartial. It cannot be neutral, as if it were not already directly involved. Yet, unfortunately, this is not the impression that was recently given by the European Union, when it showed that it was divided in its opinion in the vote within the United Nations General Assembly of 20 October 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, if you are to speak on behalf of the European Union, we must show a united front. So what is the state of affairs? I direct the question to you as well as to the Council representative. In your work with the governments of the Member States, have you noticed any commitment to harmonising our points of view? That is my first question.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is directed to both the Council and the Commission. It is the same question that I asked you in the previous debate, Mr Solana, when you could not find the time to give an answer. Do you not think that the time has come for the European Union to take some intelligent action on the status of Jerusalem? As I recall, we heard the Speaker of the Knesset and his Palestinian counterpart make some courageous proposals at Strasbourg. Mr Solana, can we count on you to make it clear to your fellow negotiators, in the necessary diplomatic and firm manner, that Jerusalem is not just a city sacred to Judaism and Islam but also to all forms of Christianity? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Peace is a dangerous word if the European Union is required to use it but is not able to follow it up with action. The action called for is political action, the full, direct assumption of political responsibility in the Middle East peace process. The European Union, Mr President, must be fully involved in the peace process as more than merely a trading partner or a major contributing country, or it will not be involved at all. I would remind you of the context which a number of other Members have already illustrated clearly: on the one hand, three United Nations resolutions on territories and displaced persons, disregarded by Israel even in terms of the affirmation of the principles they contain; and, on the other hand, a permanent state of emergency in the Palestinian territories: 120 thousand workers prevented from working, three billion dollars worth of damage already done, salaries only paid to government officials and administrators thanks to the intervention of European Union ready cash, half the civilian population under 18 years old killed. Mr President, I do not care which side fires the bullets: whether they are fired by Israelis, Iraquis or Turks, it is the duty of the European Union to condemn the killing of children.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I am extremely concerned about apartheid, a word which should have no place in a discussion on the Middle East or Palestinian issues but which, I regret to say, applies to the situation we have to focus on. My impression is that a system exists in the region whereby an Arab life and an Israeli life have different values, particularly in terms of humiliation and submission to the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of all this, it is impossible to preserve a neutral stance. We must uphold rules and principles, especially if the Bush government is going to prove incapable of guaranteeing the affirmation of these rules and principles or unwilling to do so. It is true – as Mr Solana said – that the negotiations are advancing, but, alongside the negotiations, the Israeli government is also proceeding with the establishment of fresh settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we cannot fully share Mr Solana's optimism. Commissioner Patten tells us that we must look beyond the immediate crisis. We agree. Today our political duty is to achieve a peace agreement; tomorrow it will be to ensure that the agreement and international law are respected: the Middle East is relying on Europe, Mr President, because it has confidence in Europe. If we do not believe in Europe ourselves, then their confidence will be of no avail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is critical, first of all, because the election of the Israeli prime minister is imminent. This week, all sense of time has been suspended, pending the election results. The talks at Taba were also suspended, at least officially, even though they did manage to make progress in terms of setting up committees on matters such as borders, Jerusalem, and Palestinian refugees. Finally, although I picked up on Mr Solana’s optimism, the possibility of holding a summit this week in Stockholm has been put off too, following Mr Arafat’s statement made at Davos on Sunday, which was aggressive, or to put it more diplomatically, was unhelpful, to say the very least.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a critical time too, as I was saying, because of the transition in the United States. Bill Clinton is no longer in office. President Clinton had made the peace process one of the priorities on his agenda. Only time will tell how George Bush and Colin Powell now see their role in the Middle East. At any rate, this is the first time for years, as Mr Danielsson said, that high level talks have taken place, as they did most recently at Taba, without American officials present, but with Mr Moratinos, our EU peace envoy. This may be Europe’s opportunity to make progress and to play a more prominent political role in this matter, to gain recognition for its voice and its know-how, since we are keen to do more than just bankroll the region. We know that our aid is vitally necessary for the Palestinians whose economic situation is desperate, but we would like to export much more than just euros. We would like to export our values, such as democracy, respect for human rights, education and tolerance. At this point, I welcome Mr Patten’s commitment to transparency in the use of European aid. In the words of Albert Einstein, “Peace cannot be kept by force but can be achieved by understanding.” Let us work together from now on so that the European Union can be a factor in spreading this understanding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say that, not because I am scarcely an enthusiast for a European foreign policy, but because I believe that at this present time in Israel we are in a very difficult situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an election and I must remind the House that the State of Israel is the only democracy that exists in the region and that is something that is worth noting. We have an election for a prime minister which will be crucial in relation to the future of the peace process so we must take care not to be seen as interventionist or interfering. I remind the House, because I gather there is much fear that Mr Sharon may be elected prime minister, that the peace process in the Middle East, from the Israeli point of view, has always advanced under the Israeli right and it was Menachem Begin who started the rapprochement with Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the House and I ask the Commission and the Council to proceed with caution. I ask the European Union to do what it does best. It has an influence over the Palestinians and it should exercise that influence. It should be asking Chairman Arafat, for example, why the Palestinians permit in their textbooks the sort of anti-semitism which I hoped we had long put to one side in this world. We should be asking Chairman Arafat to ensure that the aid that goes to the Palestinians goes to those who really need it.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in small measures and not in large – because the United States must take the lead in these matters – the European Union can play a role, but it should not exaggerate its importance. The role is with the parties themselves, assisted by the great republic across the Atlantic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Time and time again we feel as if we are slowly and painfully climbing a slope and then, when it seems as if we are about to touch the sky, we plummet sharply back to square one. This is a hellish and never-ending rise and fall – and it is also a bit like the legend of Sisyphus – which threatens to sap the strength and even the hope of almost everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">At the current time – and despite having heard optimistic words – one has the impression that we are once again at the bottom of the curve, with an Oslo Process which has been forsaken by many, with the conflict on the ground at an impasse and with elections in Israel which promise to offer an outcome which is far from favourable to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is now that we have to recharge the batteries of our confidence and increase our efforts. Today this process can be summed up in two affirmations: firstly, we cannot lose sight of our inescapable objective, which is peace in the region, a peace which must be established and consolidated on the basis of an acceptance by all sides of the rules of international law and decisions of the UN Security Council: and, secondly, Europe must once and for all, in attempting to resolve this conflict, assume the responsibility that befits our political influence, our values and our interests.</p>
<p class="contents">It is neither dignified nor coherent to continue to renounce the leading role which we should play, restricting ourselves to being, rather than negotiators, mere spectators to what the United States does or does not do. We are, unfortunately, still in the old situation of ‘paying but not playing’. The actions of Ambassador Moratinos have been magnificent but, in order to be more effective, he needs political support which, unfortunately, he is not being given.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Union should no longer delay in taking a leading role, and it is not enough to make statements but it should be precisely defined and filled with content including firm economic and political commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A great deal will depend on the forthcoming elections in Israel. Whatever the outcome, we must call for the new government – whoever the winner may be – to continue the peace negotiations without delay and to do so with renewed energy and, if possible, intensify these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a unique moment for the European Union to gain influence and importance during these talks, given the current situation in the United States, where the new administration has probably not been fully established. It is our duty as the European Union to reinforce our position in the peace talks, in view of the exceptional interests – mainly humanitarian – which are at stake, in view of our geo-strategic position <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> that region and in view of our important mutual trade relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent wave of violence and terror must be condemned in any event. The demand for repatriation of the 3.7 million migrants will definitely not make the peace talks easier, nor will the distribution by the Palestinian authorities of schoolbooks which, instead of preaching the language of reconciliation, preach the language of hatred and animosity, or Arafat’s tough stance in Davos, for that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, I would express the hope that peace and stability in that region can as yet be achieved in the relatively short term, but I would add at the same time that it would be extremely regrettable if the European Union had not contributed to this in a major way. It is a test of our credibility at international level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am still reeling from the shock. I travelled there believing myself to be well prepared through radio, TV, press and Commission documents as well as personal conversations I had had beforehand, but the reality was altogether different. The living conditions were dreadful and shocking. The situation was explosive to an unimaginable degree. The concept of a state of war best describes the situation. The situation of the people in the occupied areas, particularly in the refugee camps, some of which have existed for over thirty years, can be described as unfit for human habitation. Neither human rights nor fundamental values such as dignity, freedom or democracy, not even the rights to freedom from bodily harm and hygiene are guaranteed and observed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the country I come from, people tread extremely carefully when it comes to criticising Israel. There, it is far easier to portray the terrorism and executions committed by Palestinians, along with the claim that Palestinian children are sent into battle. But consider this: those who have lived for over 35 years in a refugee camp of tin sheds, with sacking over windows and doors and no form of infrastructure, will have little faith in negotiations, especially when these same negotiations have dragged on for seven years now to no avail, and not even UN resolutions are recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, gatherings of people are dispersed by Israeli soldiers often enough. We experienced this at first hand because our group came under fire. Fortunately no one was injured. What we found was an explosive atmosphere generated by fanatical people who are incapable of reaching compromises and for whom principles rule the day. They are there on both sides, I might add, although there appear to be more of them amongst the fundamentalist settlers, many of whom are still fairly new to the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To use the word ‘tragedy’ for situations such as the spread of mad cow disease – which is certainly heading towards disastrous proportions – or for the situation in Palestine is, in my view, inappropriate because, in both cases, specific people are responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">The horrific earthquakes that have struck El Salvador or India cannot be compared with the situation of frustration and humiliation suffered by the Palestinians at the moment. This situation was absurdly aggravated by specific and identifiable people on 29 September on the terraces of the mosques in Jerusalem. I am a friend of Palestine and I am not an enemy of Israel. I believe that the provocation by Ariel Sharon in September, which was permitted by the people who could have prevented it, and the hundreds of Palestinian deaths since then, have created a climate in Palestinian society which makes it difficult for President Arafat to accept late – although maybe reasonable – peace proposals which, had they been presented earlier, would, in my view, have lead to an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, a thorny issue, such as the right to return of the Palestinian refugees, could have been presented by the Palestinian Authority to its own constituents as an issue involving sensitive details which had to be dealt with in conjunction with the Israeli Government on the proviso, of course, that that government agreed, in time, to Palestinian demands that were easier to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">It remains to be seen whether, on the international stage, the new United States administration will adopt more of an isolationist approach than the previous one. However, I believe that the departure of Clinton has meant that, for the moment, United States diplomacy in the region will be less active. With all due respect and consideration for our American friends, I believe that this is an additional reason for the European Union to make an even greater effort to truly promote its role in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to make a couple of points. Firstly, let us hope that the High Representative, Mr Solana, is right to predict that an agreement may be possible before 6 February – <span class="italic">Inshallah</span> – but let us not forget that Sharon is still casting his shadow. Secondly, I have just returned from a visit by the European Parliament delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council and I would like to encourage all of those who are able to do so to go to Palestine, to go to Gaza and the West Bank, to go there, to have meetings, to look people in the eye and listen. Perhaps they would come to understand better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am encouraged by the statement of Mr Danielsson, the confidence of Mr Solana and the excellent analysis of Commissioner Patten of the situation on the ground. I was horrified to witness in the delegation last week the extent to which Palestine is a military occupation. People of Europe have no idea of this. It is unbelievable that there is a situation where the Palestinian Legislative Council cannot even meet.</p>
<p class="contents">Mayors of towns like Hebron were not able to escort us to places that our ambassador had arranged for us to see. There is wrong on both sides, of course there is. What I am against is the 33 years of negotiations which have led to nowhere, no solution, no peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I believe that we in the European Union should take a more active role: supportive – not to replace the Americans in the peace process – but to support and give confidence to both sides that we are a fair, just, impartial broker. We should also support the United Nations and the resolutions, because if UN resolutions are to be respected by countries like Iraq and Cuba, then they must also be respected by Israel and the Palestinians. That is something that I hope Mr Solana and the Council will impress on both sides: if there are international agreements where there is international law, then both sides should abide by them.</p>

If that were to be the case, and it was solely down to the warring parties, then I ask myself where is peace to be found? Where have they managed to secure peace, and maintain it too? No, I believe there is a need for mediation – and I would agree with all those who have made this point – especially with robust European participation. Because unfortunately, hatred, coercion and attempts to put the partner under pressure using these methods, have regained the upper hand. I do not feel, as has been said here, that we can expect to see the situation improve after the elections in Israel, particularly if Sharon takes over, bearing in mind what happened under Menachem Begin. The point being that Mr Sharon has done nothing recently that could lead us to conclude that he is prepared to agree a peace deal. On the contrary, his road to power is paved with various measures that prove the opposite to be true.</p>
<p class="contents">I completely agree with Commissioner Patten. During all attempts to engage in talks – with both parties, of course – and indeed, that is the only way to perform a mediation role, we must make it crystal clear that we cannot tolerate a situation where the resources we deploy in the Middle East cannot be used productively because Israel, in particular, is putting Palestine under such pressure and cutting it off. I have already come across this several times before in Parliament – the more Israel endeavours to cut off Palestine’s lifeline, the more aid Europe will send, which means that Israel can save on financial input to the peace process to a certain extent, and Europe alone then has to pick up the tab. This is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">If we must shoulder this financial burden – and I, for one, truly feel that we must – then obviously there must also be strong political engagement. Notwithstanding all the pessimism, which unfortunately, I myself share, I hope that the High Representative will ultimately prove justified in his optimism, and that he will be able to strengthen Europe’s role. If the US were to withdraw from the process or keep more in the background, clearly this would be Europe’s big chance to play a fitting political role in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, some of the participants in the peace talks believe that both parties have never been so close to reaching an agreement. The High Representative also seems to share this optimistic point of view. On the other hand, one of the candidates in the Israeli elections declared the Oslo peace process to be dead in the water. The fact is that we are, once again, at a crossroads where the European Union should send out a message and a warning. I address my comments to the Council and to the Commission. The message should be that it will not be possible to not reach a fair and lasting solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine without reference to international law, such as that laid down by the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The requirements that Israel must evacuate the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees must have the right of return, Israel must have the right to live in peace within secure and recognised borders and Palestinians must have the right to their own sovereign, viable and undivided state, whose international borders are open and which is not under military control, are inextricably linked and all these rights must be fulfilled at the same time. Jerusalem is an historic city and, as it were, part of the heritage of the entire human race. It must again become an open city again, to which everyone has access. The world community, particularly the European Union, would not allow the fair balance to be upset, putting either party at an advantage or at a disadvantage. Under these circumstances, the warning could be formulated thus: that the European Union formally calls for an end to violence and for talks to go ahead but, at the same time, as commercial partner and financial sponsor, it will take the necessary action against any parties who believe they can pull out of the talks and abandon the attempt to find a global and definitive compromise that is universally acceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The recurrent theme of the contributions from the majority of the honourable Members is that the European Union must play a greater political role. The major role we already play in terms of economic cooperation with this conflict-stricken region must be supplemented by a greater political role.</p>
<p class="contents">In all humility, I should like to state that, right now, the European Union is playing a greater political role than it has ever done before. Why do I say this? Partly in response to Mr Morillon. I believe there is today a greater desire than in the past for what Mr Morillon calls a harmonisation of policy <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Middle East. True enough, there may still be differences of degree in the way this is felt. Nonetheless, there is a very strong common desire, noted by the presidency in its contacts with all the other Member States, to work together for a peaceful solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that, during the first 30 days of the Swedish Presidency of the European Union’s Council, no issue has occupied the Swedish prime minister, as President of the Council, more than that of the situation in the Middle East. Nor has there been any issue that has occupied the Swedish Foreign Minister, as President of the General Affairs Council, more than the situation in the Middle East. I believe the same applies to the High Representative, who can certainly answer that question for himself. The European Union is, then, also engaged in the political process in the most intimate way possible, but we are still awaiting the practical results.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the High Representative’s, Mr Solana’s, cautious optimism, but we have to remember, of course, that what we are dealing with in the Middle East is a basically very difficult political conflict. If we are to be able to achieve any kind of progress, it is genuinely necessary for the European Union to be closely coordinated internally, to cooperate closely with the United Nations and its General Secretary and to cooperate closely with the United States, which has been indefatigable in its attempts to solve this conflict. If this happens, then I believe our optimism may also be rewarded with practical results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solana,</span></span>   <span class="italic">High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I only wish to clarify certain issues, without getting into a great historical debate, since I do not believe that this is the moment to do so nor is it the moment for us to all to start discussing problems that are not germane. Ladies and gentlemen, some of you have recently visited the region. I must tell you that I have been visiting it since 1991, more or less continuously. We have seen an enormous amount of suffering. Those of us who have seen so much suffering want to try to reach a peaceful and lasting situation. That is the commitment that those of us who are involved in trying to find a solution at the moment wish to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that it is not advisable at the moment to appeal for frenzied optimism. It would not be sensible to do so, but I honestly believe that the connotations of the problem have never been so well defined and we are therefore in a better position to move towards a solution. Why do I say this? We all know that, in order to find a solution to this immensely serious problem, we must define the territory and be prepared to talk about it, we must define the security conditions and be prepared to talk about them, we must define the future of Jerusalem and be prepared to negotiate it, and we must negotiate the issue of refugees and be prepared to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time the four or five most important parameters have now been defined, and both sides have accepted them as the important parameters to be defined and accepted, and they have begun to negotiate them seriously and in depth. This is an historic step forward. The problem that leads me to be less than hopeful is that, unfortunately, time has not been well managed. If we had had a rather longer period of political calm, I sincerely believe that we could be optimistic at this time. But now I am not so optimistic because time unfortunately depends on the electoral and political calendar and there is little we can do about it.</p>
<p class="contents">But anybody who wants to negotiate, in this case with the European Union, must accept the challenge of reaching agreements on the basis that there will be two states in the region, which are capable of defining the four parameters which I have mentioned: territories, security, the capital and the refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has proposed possible solutions to these four issues. Please do not imagine, ladies and gentlemen, that the people involved in the various presidencies, in this case the Swedish Presidency, have not put forward suggestions and ideas for making progress. The problem is that the proposal does not always miraculously coincide with the exact solution necessary at any particular moment. However, Mr Morillon, with regard to Jerusalem, you must believe me when I say that many suggestions have been put forward. These suggestions cannot perform miracles, they cannot fall outside a particular framework with which we are all familiar, and you have clearly indicated what this must be.</p>
<p class="contents">I will also say that, with regard to the settlements, the European Union has taken a brilliant and generous position. This position indicates that a policy of settlements such as the current one is not acceptable. We have said so, we will continue to say so and I can assure you that, for my part, I will always condemn the current policy. There will be no definitive solution without a solution also to this issue of the settlements. We know this and anybody who has been involved in this horrific conflict knows this.</p>
<p class="contents">The concern which I do have and the cause of the deep sadness which I also feel is that, as some of you have said, the Oslo Process is beginning to lose the political support of both sides, which it had a few years ago. It is true that the Oslo Process – not peace – is not accepted as intensely and in the same way by all the parties as it was a few years ago. For some, it has not offered the security that they wanted, and for others it has not brought the change that they expected and wanted in their everyday lives. Hence the frustration of some and the lack of security of others. And that, to a large extent, explains why the current debate is experiencing such difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that, on the part of the European Union, we will do everything possible, with your support, and with the support of the governments and parliaments, to continue making progress, but it is true that there is a limit to what all of us can do to promote the process. It is the parties directly involved which have to reach an agreement, and the rest of us can only try to put in place the economic, social and political conditions for that agreement to be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">My own experience over recent months has shown me that the parties have never before spoken in such a devoted and generous way and have never come so close to solving the problems. And that was my hope. Unfortunately, you are perhaps right and it has been a vain hope. I would be extremely sorry if that were the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At least one of the honourable Members who made the point today is in the Chamber and perhaps I can deal with it now, for the record, and we can regard it as having been sorted out. It is the question of textbooks, which I know has been of concern to a number of honourable Members of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make it clear that the Commission rejects any attempt to use the educational system to promote intolerance or hatred. It is worth noting that the main focus of the Commission’s assistance has always been to promote a culture of peace, tolerance and human rights in the Middle East. For example, in recent years we have financed several projects, worth about EUR 4.5 million, to foster dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian youth.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make this point absolutely clear. The Commission has never allocated funds for the development of a new school curriculum nor for the printing and distribution of school textbooks. The development of school curricula and the preparation of textbooks are the responsibility of the Palestinian Centre for Curriculum Development. It was established in 1995 with the assistance of Member States through UNESCO. Since then the Centre has undertaken the charge of harmonising the hitherto separate educational systems – the Egyptian for the Gaza Strip and the Jordanian for the West Bank – and of organising a new curriculum that meets the needs of the new situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Only last year did the Palestinian Authority issue their own textbooks for Grades 1 to 6. No sign of anti-Semitic content has been found in these new books. Books used prior to that were, I am advised, the official textbooks in Jordan and Egypt and were authorised by Israel for the West Bank and Gaza until 1994 at least – after they had been subject to some editorial control.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that has made clear the Commission’s position on this issue. The Commission has had nothing to do with textbooks and we deplore any promotion of intolerance particularly among young people and particularly through the education system. It was worth making the point at this stage, because it has been raised before. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
