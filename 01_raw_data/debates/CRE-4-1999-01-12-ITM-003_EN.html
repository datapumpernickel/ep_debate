It shows how the CFA franc has been drawn in under Community authority in spite of the Treaty, how national prerogatives are violated, and how French interests are gradually going to be compromised.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, these exchange rate agreements do not involve the Bank of France, because they relate to a fixed rate convertibility guarantee granted to the CFA franc by the French Treasury, that is, by our country"s national budget. Under the circumstances, even when the franc is replaced by the euro, one might assume on reading the Treaty that these agreements would continue to be an entirely French responsibility, given that it is our financial guarantee that is involved, and that, <span class="italic">a priori</span> , the European Central Bank will have nothing to do with it. That was certainly the interpretation of the French, at the time of Maastricht, of Article 109(5) of the Treaty, which states that ‘without prejudice to Community competence and Community agreements as regards economic and monetary union, Member States may negotiate in international bodies and conclude international agreements".</p>
<p class="contents">But that was reckoning without the appetite for power of the European institutions, notably the Commission. Even though the management of the CFA franc will present no risk whatsoever to the stability of the euro, given the tiny sums involved, the Commission decided, against all likelihood and against any legal logic, not to apply Article 109(5), but to apply Article 109(3), which sets out the arrangements for approval of monetary agreements signed by the Community. Thus, the first paragraph of the recommendation generously grants us the right to maintain the agreements relating to the CFA franc, despite the fact that this is our right anyway. Added to this, we should inform the Commission and the Economic and Financial Committee of any plan to amend these agreements, and even in certain cases submit them to the Council for approval. This all constitutes a flagrant violation of French national sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">This legal violation comes on top of the violation of French interests that will result from the euro replacing the franc in relations with the CFA franc. In fact, the financial guarantee that France granted to the CFA franc involved an important commercial advantage for our country, since economic agents could organise their transactions more easily on the basis of fixed exchange rates. In future, France will still grant its financial guarantee, but this will be of commercial benefit to every country in the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the exchange rate agreements for the CFA franc used to be reasonably coherent, because the French Treasury"s guarantee could be activated by variations in the franc, which was itself managed by the Bank of France. But in future, the French guarantee could be activated by variations in the euro, over which the French authorities will have virtually no control, except on the margin. Part of the internal logic of the system has been broken.</p>
<p class="contents">This abandonment of French sovereignty, added to the loss of our commercial advantage, is bound to mean a gradual reduction of French influence in the African countries involved.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schörling </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, we have now voted on the Lööw report, and I should like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur. It is a notable report which has come out at just the right moment, in view of the discussions that have been taking place both here and in the other EU institutions during recent months, weeks and days.</p>
<p class="contents">We began our work on openness and transparency in the Committee on Institutional Affairs long before the Treaty of Amsterdam. At the time, Mr Bonde was responsible for the working document that was produced. The report sets out the measures that are needed to increase the openness and transparency which form the basis of the democratic control that Parliament in particular should be exercising. It covers public access to documents, the registering of documents, open meetings of the Council and, in particular, greater use of the Internet and a new and truly accountable administrative structure.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the need for openness and transparency is not confined to allowing the public access to documents; it also applies to the entire decision‐making process and to public‐sector activities, as well as to how public money is spent. Without openness and transparency in these areas, we shall never have democratic institutions that function effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The report states that the Amsterdam Treaty can be regarded as a first step towards establishing a genuine principle of public access in the EU. However, there is still a tremendously long way to go. I only mention this so that we do not think that we have produced a report that is all‐embracing. In my view, it contains no definite proposal on guaranteed freedom of speech, and I believe that Mrs Lööw agrees with me on this. Unfortunately, the House did not adopt the amendment tabled by Mr Sjöstedt and myself. Guaranteed freedom of speech for officials, which is a freedom accorded in the Nordic countries, in other words the right to make information public without the risk of sanctions and the right to remain anonymous, must become the legally accepted practice. I believe this is a basic element in any genuine principle of public access. Parliament must see to it that the Amsterdam Treaty, or any future treaty, is amended to this effect.</p>

<p class="contents">First of all, while it is true that the Amsterdam Treaty recognises the citizen"s right of access to the documents of the European institutions – this right should, of course, have been granted long ago – there are grounds for concern about the lack of symmetry in the treatment of the Council and the Commission. A specific article – the newArticle 207 – defines the principal obligations of the Council in terms of transparency, but curiously the equivalent does not exist for the Commission. The Commission should not take advantage of this omission to try to perpetuate the obscurity that surrounds the management of its dossiers. We now see the appalling consequences of that in the endless frauds and scandals that have come to light.</p>
<p class="contents">What is even more serious is that the Lööw report is careful not to broaden its perspective and does not raise the fundamental question, namely, is it not true that the entire policy on European integration that has been implemented in recent years is by its very nature based on non‐transparency? There are two sides to the Monnet method, which was given so much praise by the German Presidency just this morning. There is a policy of integration based on small successive technical steps, but there is also, and we often forget to mention this, a policy whose final objective is never clearly expressed to the citizens, even if the strategic players are themselves completely in the know.</p>
<p class="contents">By its very nature, this method is undemocratic. Perhaps it was of very little importance when the Community was in its early days, but now it has dramatic consequences in the shape of essential quasi‐clandestine transfers of sovereignty and a complete sense of isolation from public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy must be restored in Europe, and that means going against the Monnet method. Of course, that may put the brakes on European federalism. But today we have to prioritise between integration or democracy.</p>

We are in favour of the public right of access to documents in the EU. We also agree with the amendments which emphasise that national rules on openness should be respected and that it should be possible to appeal to the European Court of Justice if public right of access is denied. However, we do not agree that all Council meetings should be public. But that is not the same as saying that afterwards the Council can keep its decisions and minutes secret. Similarly, we believe that civil servants should follow certain rules when speaking about internal matters, such as sensitive personal information, as in the Danish civil service.</p>

<p class="contents">The anti‐Europeans disparage the Amsterdam Treaty and yet it explicitly introduces the concept of transparency into the Treaty on European Union, by guaranteeing the public"s right of access to European Union documents and by stating that Community decisions are to be taken ‘as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen".</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore grateful to the rapporteur for her work in preparing the way for the post‐Amsterdam period by attempting to lay down the necessary requirements for improving transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Her report calls for the new code of conduct to be applied not only to Commission, Council and Parliament documents, but also to those of all the other institutions of the Union. It also asks that the practice of holding Council meetings in public be extended considerably and that the practice of making secret declarations be ended.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the report calls for legislative proposals, comitology texts and other important documents to be put on the Internet, thereby making information more readily available to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a whole range of measures that, in my view, are essential to improve the running of the European Union and to ensure that the citizens of Europe have a better understanding of what it does. I will therefore vote in favour of this report and I urge Parliament to do the same.</p>

She was a German student researching a dissertation, and she had been able to consult Commission documents without difficulty. However, she found the door of our institution barred. I naturally signed an authorisation pass and she was able to make contact with our librarians who did everything to help her with her research on Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">But I wondered then about the transparency of the European institutions in general and our own in particular. Public access to documents is essential for transparency and has been provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty in Article 191(a)(2). So the rapporteur is quite right to question our own system. Who makes the rules? The Conference of Presidents takes these decisions without involving any committee. I admit that the decision of 10 July 1997 on public access to European Parliament documents is certainly a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">More recently, on 17 April 1998, the Bureau took a decision on the costs involved in forwarding documents. That is all very well. But the question of access is so important that it actually concerns all Members, because it is closely linked to the citizens" trust in the European Union and the image they have of it. Are we trying hard enough to make our work public? I am struck by the contrast that exists between the mass of documents from the often excellent work of our committees and their impact on the media and on public opinion. How can we improve that?</p>
<p class="contents">The Dury/Maij‐Weggen report ahead of the IGC wanted access to EU documents enshrined in the Treaty. On that point our two colleagues won the day. They also wanted the documents to be easy to read, they wanted the Treaties to be summarised, restructured and simplified, and they wanted the special comments and reservations of the Member States in relation to Union legislation to also be made public. We need to make progress on all these points.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must remember, too, that other reports must also follow on transparency. It is not limited to access to documents, important though that may be. When Maastricht was ratified, some states distributed the Treaty to each household. They forgot that European jargon needs to be simplified and translated so that the citizens can understand what is at stake. This simplification is just as necessary at the level of decision‐making. The closer Europe is to the democratic model of the states that form it, the more the citizen will relate to it. The Amsterdam Treaty represents progress in that direction, but there is still a long road ahead of us to achieve transparency and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a problem linked to the construction of Europe, in transition between nation states and a federation. But there is no doubt that the principle of transnational lists is likely to develop the sense of European awareness.</p>

<p class="contents">The report we are considering today therefore comes at the right time. Transparency is more necessary than ever if the construction of Europe is to make good progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that our rapporteur does not restrict the idea of greater transparency merely to public access to Community documents, and extends this concept to include ensuring more open meetings of the Council when meeting in its legislative capacity, making fuller use of modern methods of rapid or real‐time communication, drafting simpler texts, retaining the use of all languages within the institutions, and improving the quality of information campaigns about the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I would lay particular stress on the fact that current exceptions to transparency need to be better defined with more restrictions laid down. This must be the case although it is obvious to everyone that a certain level of confidentiality – and even absolute confidentiality – is sometimes not only desirable, but also highly essential in the management of difficult or critical issues.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, I share the view that the drawing up of a new code of conduct and its extension to all the Community institutions will certainly provide necessary clarification and help them regain much‐needed credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am glad that our rapporteur calls for agreement on ‘improving the quality of the drafting of Community legislation, leading to clearer and simpler ... texts". Unfortunately, incomprehensible legal documents and regulations are not the prerogative of the European institutions. Indeed, many Member States would gain by consolidating and codifying their legislation. This is another reason for the Union to set an example!</p>

<p class="contents">I am convinced that a genuine principle of public access to EU documents would be an effective instrument in combating deception and fraud in the EU institutions, and would help to overcome the justified suspicion and lack of confidence currently felt by EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">What is still lacking is the so‐called guaranteed freedom of speech for officials, without which, in reality, openness and the principle of public access cannot function properly.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent suspension of the official who informed Parliament of certain notable occurrences in the Commission demonstrates with admirable clarity the need for guaranteed freedom of speech. I therefore hope that this freedom of speech will be introduced in the EU with all possible speed.</p>
