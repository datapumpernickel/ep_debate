<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicholson of Winterbourne (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, it is an honour to present this report on Iraq to Parliament this evening. I commend it for the vote tomorrow and I hope and believe that as many colleagues as possible will support it.</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq is a country that is riven by tragedy: it is fraught with trauma, and the pain of its people stretches across the world. It is ruled by a tyrant, a predator, whose hunger for territory has led his army across into the Islamic Republic of Iran; he initiated the Iran-Iraq war – a million people died. Later, he moved into Kuwait, with the results that we all know so well and into the north of Iraq, where he chemically bombed the northern Iraqis. And in the south of Iraq, he has drained the historic Iraqi marshlands. The actions of one man and his regime have destroyed 5000 years of unbroken human civilisation, causing the worst humanitarian tragedy since the Second World War, according to the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights of Iraq. He is a man of deep cruelty, he runs a reign of terror and, as a recent émigré who fled from Iraq said, he has made a modern concentration camp out of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">With such a situation, what can the European Parliament offer? We need to think how different Iraq could be. Iraq has the capacity to be the wealthiest nation in the globe per capita with her oil and other resources. She has the example, in the three governates of northern Iraq, of democracy and the Rule of Law. Iraqi people are highly talented, most able and, until Saddam Hussein took over, they had a high standard of education and health and some democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">So what does the report recommend that is different, that adds value to this very long-running debate? We make a number of proposals that I commend to this House. First, we recommend the establishment of an ad hoc international criminal tribunal. That has been called for before – I called for it myself in 1988. What is different? We are recommending that it is set up to try not just Saddam Hussein but all of his officials who have carried out gross violations of human rights, both inside and outside of Iraq's territory. Since that is difficult to set up, we recommend strongly and powerfully that the European Union takes the initiative and sets up an office for inquiry into the huge violations of human rights. We should be able to collect and prepare the necessary evidence and to produce an official register of the numerous violations perpetrated by the Iraqi regime. We want this to be set up without delay. We call upon the Commission and the Council of Ministers to facilitate this and to make it happen. This would make a tremendous difference to the future of the Iraqi people.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we call for the nomination of the Iraqi marshlands – drained down to the last 10% now – as a world heritage site. We believe that this could be done; it could be restored. We call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to take charge of the small patch of the marshlands still undrained that remains within its country.</p>
<p class="contents">Again we ask the international community and the European Union to take special note of the 3.5 million refugees who fled from Iraq in the last 11 years. Those refugees are being given insufficient support. None of the oil-for-food programme goes to help them and they get very little else. We call upon the European Union, and the Commission in particular, to look at and review their programme and to provide good support for those refugees so that they can be retrained and can bring democracy back into the future Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are recommending a rehabilitation agenda. I have ignored the comments, the amendments that talk about war. This House has no competence over war or troops, so we are recommending that we should provide training and civilian support. We should call upon everyone to put every possible pressure upon the regime of Iraq to let in the weapons inspectors and give them untrammelled access throughout the country. We see the future for Iraq, and I call upon this House to support the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The policy of aggression pursued by Saddam Hussein and his accomplices has taken large numbers of their own people hostage. The insidious thing about this situation is the way that genuine human and economic distress, much of it artificially made worse, is exploited for political purposes. Generally, this hits the weakest members of society the hardest, but this should not lead us to confuse cause with effect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the sanctions that cause the sufferings of the vast majority of the Iraqi people, but rather the aggression, cunning and incompetence of the totalitarian regime that provoked these sanctions. Every other approach and every attempt to dispel the facts from people's minds has to be firmly resisted. Every utterance focusing exclusively on the direct connection between the consequences of the embargo and the effects on the population falls dangerously short of the mark even when – indeed, especially when – it is well meant, for it thereby shifts and obscures the manifest political responsibility of Iraq's rulers. Anyone who talks about the ruination of the social and technical infrastructure, and about the lack of food and medicines whilst leaving the regime's responsibility out of consideration, passing over it or keeping quiet about it, is behaving naively or irresponsibly, to say the least.</p>
<p class="contents">The right way ahead was shown by the UN Security Council at its meeting yesterday, when it resolved unanimously to step up the arms embargo and simultaneously to make it easier for Iraq to import goods for civilian use. This is further evidence of the broad agreement that exists between, on the one hand, the report before us and Parliament's resolutions to date, and, on the other, the resolutions of the Security Council and of the UN Commission on Human Rights. This consensus should be emphasised, deepened and built on rather than being tested to breaking point by assertions about the alleged failure of the embargo.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne's report also picks up and deepens a proposal made as long ago as November 2000 concerning the setting up of a tribunal to punish the Iraqi regime's offences against human rights. I am convinced that trials of this sort can have a deterrent effect – if not on every dictator, then on many of their willing accomplices – and contribute to destabilising their regimes. I therefore unreservedly support the call for the establishment of an investigation authority to collect and assess witness statements and documentation and document evidence that will stand up in court.</p>

The United States is openly preparing for a military intervention in Iraq and is searching among the opposition in exile for successors to Saddam Hussein. It is neither the habit nor the task of Europe to overthrow regimes, and clearly we shall not be voting for the Nicholson report until there is no longer any doubt on this point. Obviously, my group unreservedly condemns the human rights violations described in the report, but it is astonished that Baroness Nicholson has said so little about the humanitarian tragedy caused by the embargo and about the one and a half million deaths that it has caused. My group also believes that the report’s insistence on the Iraqi exiles should not make us forget the existence of a civil society within the country, which is still surviving, and with dignity. I have just returned from Iraq and I can bear witness to that fact. Fortunately, these imbalances in the report can be corrected by the amendments tabled. However, in my view the most important question is missing. The most important question is the nature of the role that Europe wishes to play in this matter. Is it a pacifying role, opening up the way to a dialogue with Iraq, or is it a detonating role? Depending on how the vote goes tomorrow, the outcome will be clear. We Socialists will therefore be asking that the UN should play a vitally important role in seeking a regional peaceful solution, and that the economic embargo should be lifted as a matter of urgency. Resolution 1409 of the Security Council of the United Nations, adopted yesterday, is still very restrictive, even though it has made the sanctions more flexible. We are asking that Iraq should open its doors, without any restrictions, to the UN inspection missions, but that they should then serve as an example to Israel. We are asking that Europe should become involved in the reconstruction of the country, provided that the Iraqi Government implements democratic reforms. For heaven’s sake, let us not isolate Iraqi society. For that society, and for the regions, the consequence of an armed conflict would be incalculable. I am personally shocked by the proposals of a British diplomat at the UN yesterday, proposals which are published in tomorrow’s <span class="italic">Le Monde</span>, when he said that Iraq must be aware that when these talks with the UN come to an end the missiles will fall, whether or not Baghdad accepts the return of the inspectors.</p>

For years he has dragged his people into wars and sacrificed prosperity and social and economic progress to this cause. Let us remain mindful of this. The invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent Gulf War represented an all-time low. The Iraqi regime has survived it all, despite the suffering of its people, who, apart from an inhuman regime, have also had to suffer the effects of international sanctions. The sanctions, however, were opportunely used by Saddam Hussein to boost his popularity. In the eyes of many ordinary Arabs, he became a symbol of Arab opposition to American supremacy. We should remain mindful of all of this. We would also like to see four key elements retained when assessing the Nicholson report.</p>
<p class="contents">The indictment against the continuous violations of democracy and human rights perpetrated by the Iraqi regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, criticism of the sanctions, which do not affect the regime but the Iranian people.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, guarantees for the cultural minorities from the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, a solution to the conflict between Iraq and the international community by non-military means in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">War is not a solution. War not only means that there is a risk of new victims being created among the civilian population; even the Kurds reject it. The Arab countries dread an insurrection of their masses. Europe must adopt its own stance in this regard, and not blindly follow the American policy which poses great risks to stability in the world and only generates hatred and frustration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to preface my remarks with a comment directed at you, Mr Gomolka. I believe we have to go a bit deeper still if we are to show cause and effect as they really are. When I was a scientific consultant at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, I saw how, in 1985, the USA, the principal western European powers and the Soviet Union kept quiet when it was reported that the Iraqi army was using chemical weapons against Iran. Policies like that, of course, build up dictators and facilitate their access to weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is, of course, inconsistent. There are contradictions in it. I would, though, highlight three things about it. For a start, it criticises Saddam Hussein's irresponsible policy towards his own people and towards the international community in a way that cannot be misinterpreted. It draws up demands that are necessary. Secondly – and it is this that I read in a quite different light – it raises what for me is the crucial issue of how the conflict is to be resolved, by emphasising, and I quote: ‘the importance of achieving a multilateral political solution in the region, under the aegis of the UN, as the only means of guaranteeing stability and peace in the region’. There must be no war. In this region of all regions, it would have the most menacing consequences, which would extend to every aspect of our relations with the Islamic and Arab world.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, thirdly, calls for the lifting of economic and trade sanctions, at any rate in all cases without military interest. They are counterproductive and have catastrophic effects on Iraq's civilian population, above all for children. Hence, Baroness Nicholson, our esteemed rapporteur, I would like to thank you for this report; even though it might sound strange coming from this side of the chamber, I did find it a report written in the truly fine tradition of liberality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In her solid report, Baroness Nicholson makes no bones about this. Her first concern, in this connection, are the citizens of that country. In this she is in good company, in the person of the renowned Arab world expert, Professor Bernard Lewis. Based on his own experience, Lewis sings the praises of the standard of Iraqi students.</p>
<p class="contents">The entirely inhumane regime of Saddam Hussein, however, has done terrible damage to Iraq's national development capacity. At the same time, the Iraqi autocrat’s inextinguishable vindictiveness and thirst for power continue to pose a serious threat, both for the region and for international order as a whole. How else can his secret programme of weapons of mass destruction be explained? The same applies to Saddam's open support for Palestinian suicide attacks on Israeli citizens. The Nicholson report is outspoken about this destabilisation strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore with force that I wish to counter Mr Sakellariou's Amendment No 6. It is first of all not very sportsmanlike to belittle the Nicholson report as being "merely the rapporteur’s personal opinion". Moreover, the allegation is, in fact, altogether incorrect. After all, this is a report that has been adopted by this Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy by a large majority, without any dissenting votes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I can fully identify with the proposal on the issue of preparations on the European side for an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> International Tribunal on Iraq. The effectiveness of such a tribunal, however, does presuppose the fall of Saddam Hussein's reign of terror. And do the Council and the Commission, along with the Bush administration, really wish to face up to this wish? There is certainly no shortage of reasonable, nationally representative alternatives to Saddam's entourage.</p>
<p class="contents">In that case, the sanctions could be lifted wholesale with immediate effect. The country's rich potential could then once again develop fully for the benefit of the Iraqi citizens and for the benefit of regional and global stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The possibility cannot be excluded that various items of information on Iraq are still being disseminated for strategic reasons. This should not be imputed to the rapporteur, nor is it a justification of Saddam Hussein. We must not forget, though, that, until he invaded Kuwait, Saddam Hussein was a very good friend of the West. Today, the people of Iraq need peace, and sanctions, as a senior UN official reported only recently, are leading to a kind of genocide in that country. I dare say that the report in its present form will not help to alleviate the suffering of the people of Iraq. The amendments tabled by Mr Wurtz and Mr Sakellariou are very much to be supported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Any assessment of the situation in Iraq is of course difficult for two reasons. Firstly, the internal structures of all dictatorships make them difficult to evaluate, and the second reason is certainly the attitude of the USA. There is no doubt about that. The USA once supported Saddam Hussein, the very same Saddam Hussein that they are now vigorously fighting against, and they did so vehemently, but the USA's behaviour should not obscure the fact that here we have a regime at work that we must condemn with all our strength and might, simply because it oppresses its own people, whatever their social class or group. I am thinking, for example, of the Kurds. I have just returned from a visit, as part of a delegation, to the Kurdish part of Turkey, the object of which was to campaign for the rights of the Kurdish people, yet how much more must we make it our concern that the Iraqi Kurds are not wiped out! Whereas in Turkey their language and so on are not, perhaps, sufficiently provided for, in Iraq, though, they would be exterminated, and the same is true of the Shiites and other population groups. We can of course add to that the danger to the neighbouring countries – not just Israel, but also Iraq's Arab neighbours, such as Kuwait or Syria. These are plain facts that we must not forget.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, there are a number of things that need to be changed. As far as the sanctions issue is concerned, Mr Gomolka, both the things you referred to are in fact the case. It is to do with the indiscriminate nature of the sanctions and, of course, their misuse by Saddam Hussein, who very deliberately uses part of the resources that he receives for himself and for his ruling elite rather than for the people, the result being that the people have to suffer even greater starvation. We must nevertheless get back to sanctions involving those components that are really necessary, so as to bring the regime to its knees, and the unnecessary sanctions, those that tend to affect the people and harm them, must be lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must support all the groups inside and outside Iraq that are working to change the regime and to bring about a decent situation. Even though the analogy is not quite exact, I sometimes compare this with Yugoslavia, where we of course put everything into getting rid of Milosevic, and where we supported organisations in the country and also outside it in order to bring about a change of government.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point, which is of great importance to us Social Democrats, is that we do not want unilateral military operations that are not backed up by UN resolutions. We do not want war; we want the UN to care as much about all the other activities as it does about sanctions. That is our greatest concern. We want to restore the United Nations' authority and we want the United Nations to make it its concern that a change of regime should come about here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur for the rapprochement we have experienced over the past few days, and I am indeed firmly convinced that, tomorrow, her report, with a few amendments, will be voted for by a large majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that the regime in Baghdad is a dictatorship based on terror. At the same time, however, it is obvious that the West’s reactions and sanctions have failed totally, hitting civilians instead of the dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a light in the darkness, in the autonomous Kurdish areas in the north. The Kurds have no sympathy for Saddam Hussein. They want a new regime. On the other hand, they advise against military intervention as they know they would be the object of Saddam’s revenge. I believe we should listen to them, and consequently we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are resolutely opposed to any large-scale American attack.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne’s report is, unfortunately, particularly characteristic of the type of misguided reaction to the Saddam regime that has helped him to be on the verge of celebrating his 35-year anniversary as Iraq’s true dictator. It is not our intention, here, to adopt a stance towards Baroness Nicholson’s statement or her analysis, but towards the resolution itself. I believe we will also be able to vote for the report following amendments from the Greens, providing, of course, that Article 7 remains as it is in the report and is not deleted as proposed in certain amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we need to discuss are the policies to be applied. The European Union does not agree with the "axis of evil" policy. Nor does it agree with policies of violent, controlled crisis; in the final analysis, they are not in its interest.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let us take a look at the results after 11 years of applying a specific policy. Saddam Hussein and his regime still in place, a beleaguered nation and citizens whose problems were described earlier in the most eloquent of terms. But then there are the side effects which we do not discuss here. We have never discussed how many smugglers have benefited from the embargo, we have never discussed which companies here in the European Union are collaborating with the regime and snapping up every project on offer in Iraq on very good terms. This being so, the various committees being proposed should include a committee to write a who's who of Iraq's financial and commercial trading partners so that we can see whether or not sanctions need to be imposed and, if so, where.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, I just wanted to say that to describe certain circumstances as entirely Saddam Hussein's fault is wrong. Not every bad thing that happens is an opportunity to heap censure on a specific regime. I would like to point out here that the well-known problem of the estuaries of the Tigris and Euphrates and the problem of the marshlands are not of Saddam Hussein's making. The Ataturk dams are to blame, the 17 dams already up and running at the sources of the Euphrates and the Tigris, the purpose of which is to gain strategic control of water resources in the area. This is another matter we have not discussed and, in 2, 3 or 5 years' time, it will be the main factor in political tensions and armed reckonings. That is the problem. Τhe problem is not a few arrangements downstream at the estuaries of the two rivers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a good moment to take stock of the conditions in which the Iraqi population is living; the way Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship is operating; and the continued threat he poses to his own people, to the region and to the world at large.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree very much with the thrust of the report. Our aim should be to focus international action, including sanctions, to maximise their impact on Saddam Hussein and his henchmen, and to minimise their effects on the people of Iraq. The report highlights many serious problems in Iraq, including the victimisation of political opponents of the regime, the humanitarian crisis, the systematic refusal by Saddam Hussein to comply with UN obligations on weapons of mass destruction, and the destabilising influence of Iraq on the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Particular attention is rightly given to human rights in Iraq. The report offers a horrific account of human rights violations. There is widespread persecution of every kind of political opposition to the regime, as well as of the particular cases of the Shi’ite inhabitants of the Lower Mesopotamia Marshland, of the Kurds and of other minorities living in the northern regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Saddam Hussein has built up a double system of power. Alongside the regular army and the administration there is a sort of “shadow state”, supported by family and military forces under his direct control, exerting pressure through abuse of power. It adds up to a permanent state of violence and unpunished illegality.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only acknowledge the weak results achieved by UN sanctions over the past eleven years. Saddam Hussein is still firmly in power. Indeed, he bears down on the Iraqi people more viciously than ever. UN inspections have been suspended unilaterally by Iraq and there is good reason to suspect that the regime has re-started its chemical and biological weapons programmes. The economic situation has worsened not so much as a consequence of the international embargo as non-cooperation of the Iraqi authorities with the “oil-for-food” programme.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear where the fault lies. Saddam Hussein has shown a reckless disregard, not just for his international obligations, but for his own people. The suffering of the Iraqi people could end tomorrow if Baghdad would cooperate, credibly and constructively, with the international community, giving unrestricted access to the inspectors in charge of verifying the implementation of UN resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq must also respect her international obligations on the protection of human rights. The Nicholson report proposes an ad hoc international tribunal on Iraq. This is an idea we need to examine carefully, also in the light of work under way in other relevant international fora.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this European Parliamentary initiative will help to identify common elements of a policy which could enable the European Union to play a more active role on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming to the specific recommendations the honourable Member will know the limits of our role and competence in the Commission, but I can recognise the case for effective freezing of financial assets of the Iraqi leadership and denial of access to Iraqi leaders. There is also a strong argument for closer monitoring of human rights, making more information publicly available and for putting more pressure on the Iraqi regime for protection of the population and of minorities living in the country, in the framework of the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the strengthening of democratisation measures in cooperation with the Iraqi exile community, I must say that in present circumstances I am unclear as to what the scope and impact of such measures might be.</p>
<p class="contents">The plight of Iraq’s population has highlighted the difficulty of dealing with a regime which is as ruthless as it is reckless. I note and welcome the invitation in the report to explore every avenue for initiatives in favour of the Iraqi population and refugees, and to reinforce the present activities carried out in the field of humanitarian assistance. We are ready to examine further measures to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi population. Such action could also give encouragement for the organisation of opposition forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Gulf War in 1991 the European Commission has been the major donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq with over EUR 270 million. Over the last three years we have provided assistance of around EUR 10 million annually. In this year we will provide some EUR 13 million.</p>
<p class="contents">But the impact of our help is reduced by the limitations placed upon it by Saddam Hussein’s regime. We need to think harder about how we can help the population by lifting restrictions on trade in non-military and non dual-use goods, while ensuring that we deny the regime the potential for weapons manufacture and enrichment. That is why we strongly welcome the agreement reached yesterday in the UN Security Council on a resolution for a “smart sanctions programme”, refocusing the present efforts of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that there is no chance of any serious improvement under the present regime. A different regime – almost <span class="italic">any </span>other regime – would be better for the Iraqi population. But we must not lose sight of our own fundamental values and principles in our quest to help the Iraqi people and to bring stability to the region. That is why I am absolutely convinced that we must continue to operate within the framework of the United Nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
