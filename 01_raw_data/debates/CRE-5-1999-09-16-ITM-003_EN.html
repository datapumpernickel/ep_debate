<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgantini (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur (IT).</span> – Mr President, the era of peace and prosperity, to which Mr Arafat and Israeli leaders have referred to since 1993 following the Oslo Accord, is still not here. The revival of the peace process after the fall of Mr Netanyahu’s government, the election of Mr Barak and the new Accord signed in Sharm el-Sheikh undoubtedly mark a step forwards in respect to a dark past, after the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin. But there are still difficulties to overcome before stable and lasting peace can be achieved and before the Palestinians can live in a Palestinian State, as sanctioned in the UN Resolutions, that I hope will be democratic and will peacefully co-exist with the Israeli State.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a lot of on-going problems. 70% of the West Bank and Gaza territory is still occupied by the army, the status of Jerusalem has not been established, there is the question of the Israeli settlements and the confiscation of land and water, more than 2,200 political prisoners are still incarcerated and there is the issue of the Palestinian refugees from the first exodus in 1948 and 1967 who amount to around four million. Without a positive response to these problems, peace will always be at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and, in particular, the European Parliament have always expressed their unconditional support for the attempts to help the Middle East peace process and to assist the Middle East. In the Resolution of March 1999 on the peace process and future aid for the Middle East, the European Parliament stressed with good reason that if the Wye Plantation Accords are confirmed – as they have been – the main problems must still be resolved, including in particular the status of the refugees. The Commission voted for the need for a steady and rigorous commitment to the refugees and accepted the tenth EC-UNRWA Convention which refers to 1999-2001. This has been submitted to the European Parliament and represents an important contribution. The proposed Convention, like the other nine signed after 1972, sets the EC’s contribution to the budget of the normal programmes of the Agency for the next three years, 1999 – 2001, and provides for annual talks on the EC’s contribution to the food aid budget. Naturally, the amount of food aid will be the subject of separate talks.</p>
<p class="contents">UNRWA is asking for an overall contribution of EUR 120.82 million for the period up to 2001. Part of this contribution will be used for UNRWA’s educational programmes. Within the health programme, the majority will go towards the education programme. UNRWA’s regular programme aims to help 3,500,000 Palestinians in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. And as I said before, it provides aid to essential social sectors. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to take into account the development of the political situation in the region, Article 6 of the Convention lays down that, at the end of 2000, developments regarding refugees will be re-examined and possible UNRWA programmes concerning the Palestinian authorities gaining more power over their own affairs will also be evaluated. However, since the Palestinian authorities only control their own territory in the West Bank and Gaza, we must pay careful attention to UNRWA’s actions regarding the refugees who are still in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan and in all the countries where Palestinian refugees can be found.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, I would like to emphasise once again that the refugee question is not only still unresolved but is now becoming worse, as I learnt from my recent visit to the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, from the various UNRWA reports and also from our colleague, Mr Menéndez del Valle, the European Union’s representative for humanitarian aid in Jordan.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is essential for this EC-UNRWA Convention to be adopted and implemented as soon as possible. This is particularly important, especially in view of the current crisis in which we are discussing UNRWA’s budget. Austerity measures have been introduced which suppress various appropriations for teachers, hospitals and medical equipment which has provoked, amongst other things, strong protests in the Palestinian refugee camps.</p>
<p class="contents">One last matter – while underlining the need to continue providing humanitarian aid through UNRWA, I think that the European Parliament is particularly interested in finding a fair and balanced political solution to the Palestinian refugee problem. This solution must be in accordance with UN Resolution 194. In this respect, I think that the greatest efforts must be made to invite the authorities concerned in the region, especially the Israeli and Palestinian authorities, to contribute to this solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Just two more points: the Committee on Budgetary Control has proposed two amendments on greater transparency, which we subscribe to, and finally, there is a legal question of the way in which our vote is requested by the Commission, and this is something which we will have to examine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is extremely important and it is a subject in which I have been very interested for many years. Mrs Morgantini has produced an excellent report which I and my group support and the two amendments are very important because they ask for an annual report and for access to the sites and information on the aspects of the financing.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to raise a few points. One is that we are helping 3.5 million refugees. I accept that these are people in refugee camps now and I hope that the European Union will play a very positive role in helping them to rehabilitate once they come across from neighbouring countries into Palestine for resettlement. I hope the European Commission will take the initiative, with the close cooperation of Parliament, in being more of an active player in the Middle East and not take a back seat and let the Americans lead.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at the aid we are giving, EUR 40 million, that is not a lot of money. I accept it is quite a large part of the EUR 120 million that are being given and 85% of our budget of about EUR 40 million per annum is for education, which I consider the right way forward. We are helping to educate half a million children.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this proposal will be acted upon quickly because as Mrs Morgantini pointed out there is urgency, teachers are losing their jobs or not being employed and education and medical help is essential. I hope that the Commission will do its best to speed this on.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Morgantini has really covered this subject extensively. I do not want to waste Parliament’s time and I thank the President for giving me the opportunity to speak on this subject.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report has been prepared by Mrs Morgantini, and concerns the signature by the Commission of a Convention with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">The achievement of a just peace in the Middle East, which we advocate in the Socialist Group, is only possible if, together with the negotiations on the items on the peace agenda in this complex conflict, the problem of the refugees is resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues to be dealt with in relation to this problem, which is a necessary one although not the only one, is aid for the refugees, without prejudice to the achievement of a permanent solution within the framework of the peace negotiations which goes further than the therapy of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the European Union in aid to Palestine is undeniable. And, in this respect, the communication of the Commission, which has given rise to this report, simply continues our coherent approach to our contribution to peace by means of the said aid.</p>
<p class="contents">This should not be an obstacle to the European Union’s, and in particular Parliament’s, more direct participation in the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of the refugees, together with the status of Jerusalem, the problems of water and the settlers, is one of the key factors relating to peace in the Middle East. Every effort should be made if we want to reach a satisfactory agreement on the refugees and thereby bring peace closer.</p>
<p class="contents">Between the extreme positions, which demand the recognition of the right to return, ignoring the real problems which, in reality, would be caused by the mass return of refugees and the uncompromising positions, which do not even accept that the problem exists, there are intermediate options which should be studied, developed and implemented. One of these options is this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we know it is not a definitive solution, we must approve this report as one more European Union contribution to the difficult peace process in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For five long decades the way back for the Palestinians was closed off and the way forward was blocked too. All that time UNRWA was doing extremely useful work under extraordinarily difficult circumstances. All the endeavours to bring education and health care up to standard, no matter how valuable in themselves, were still unable to solve the political problem of the refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">UNWRA has suffered a great deal on account of financial problems in recent years. Increased costs were not covered by additional revenue. Consequently, it had no alternative but to develop illegal secondary economies, much to the discomfiture of the Palestinians. Unfortunately there is nothing about the refugees in the Wye agreement. The Palestinians now feel desperate, forgotten about and left to their fate. Uncertainty about the future, high unemployment and restricted mobility cause tension and fear, which creates a breeding ground for fundamentalism.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, giving support to UNWRA as proposed does not just serve humanitarian ends but is also of political importance, i.e. by bringing stability to the region. Israel must demonstrate more flexibility in the peace process. The Arab host countries, in turn, must take responsibility and stop misusing the Palestinian problem for political ends. They must assist in integrating the Palestinians into their country. The European Union, in its turn, should provide financial assistance here.</p>
<p class="contents">Up until now, Europe has not known how to convert its financial assistance into political influence. It has given the refugees financial assistance for 25 years. It is high time for Europe to at last bring its political influence to bear in order to make UNRWA redundant once and for all.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is the leading donor of economic and financial aid in this region. In this way, we shall, in the future, too, have a considerable responsibility for the Palestinian refugees. For the period 1999 to 2001, UNRWA has requested an amount of EUR 120 million. The major part of this amount – EUR 102 million – is earmarked for UNRWA’s education programme, and EUR 18 million for the health programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We Greens welcome the fact that the new programme is being discussed promptly by the EU Commission and by the Committees of the European Parliament. We ought to be agreeing to its submission to the plenum equally promptly. Above all, there should be no reductions in the budget, and discussions about the programme’s legal basis should not further obstruct its submission. These problems appear now to have been solved, however, just as the justified criticism by the Court of Auditors of the lack of supervision in implementing the old contracts has been removed. Transparency is the basis of our budgeting. This must be guaranteed even in urgent cases of humanitarian aid, for all we are in fact doing in the end is passing on taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme is urgently necessary, for health care and the education programme are basic services. The education programme has become UNRWA’s biggest single area of activity. 445 young people are being educated at school and 6000 are receiving training. We also welcome health care based on needs. This is provided at local authority level, directly to the people, through a network of 123 health centres. The Palestinian refugees are in need of this help, for the refugee situation, which has lasted for years, has serious psychological effects on many people. To these are added many forms of social and economic discrimination. Now as before, a political solution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees is urgently needed. Peace negotiations have finally begun again, but cease-fires and status negotiations are not enough because the Palestinian refugees are still ignored. We must offer them prospects for the future. The EU can contribute a lot here.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, day-to-day deprivation must however be at least partly reduced by means of this programme. Our group is therefore fully endorsing Mrs Morgantini’s report. The Palestinian refugees can count on our support and our solidarity.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is evidence of the fact that young people are extremely interested in politics. At 21 she is seven years younger than I was when I went to the House of Commons. I can only offer the hope that Ms Schröder matures better than I did and I am sure that she will.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I begin by expressing the Commission’s gratitude for the thorough report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation and for the support given throughout the consultation procedure for the Commission’s efforts to conclude the Tenth Convention between the Community and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees in the Near East. In particular, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Morgantini for her work. The constructive involvement of Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and Committee on Budgets also deserves thanks, and I will in a moment comment on the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets about which Mr Khanbhai spoke.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1972 the Community has signed nine conventions with UNRWA governing the EC contribution to the organisation’s regular and food aid budgets. The tenth triennial convention covers the period 1999 to 2001 and provides for a contribution of EUR 120.82 million to UNRWA’s regular education and health programmes. It also allows for the annual negotiation of the contribution to the food aid budget. That EUR 120 million includes a 5% annual increase which reflects the operative principle of indexation that takes account of inflation and population growth. That arrangement has governed previous European Union contributions under the successive conventions and has been repeatedly praised by the United Nations Agency because it prevents erosion in the value of the Community’s contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has made efforts to improve and to clarify the Convention being considered before the House today in order to make its application more transparent and also to take into account the relevant agreed provisions in the European Community-United Nations global arrangement. Other innovations in this convention including Article 4 on payments, Article 8 on visibility of the Community’s contribution, Article 9 on arbitration and Article 12 on entry into force, all aim at enhancing transparency and accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to advise the House that the Commission cannot accept the two amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets for two reasons. Firstly, the purpose of the draft Council decision is not to regulate an interinstitutional information request. It is to approve the text of the EC-UNRWA Convention and to authorise the Commission to sign it on behalf of the Community. Secondly, the obligation to inform is inherent in the Commission’s responsibility to implement the Community budget. The annual report submitted by UNRWA will certainly be provided to Parliament as well as to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress on this issue is now urgent. UNRWA is facing a severe cash shortfall and we, as donors, have to do our utmost to accelerate the procedure to help out UNRWA and ultimately the Palestinian people. The House will be conscious that, in the context of the Middle East peace process and the Oslo peace accords, the refugee issue was specified for final status talks. Under those accords, the parties were supposed to have negotiated the final status issues by 4 May this year but sadly that has not happened. Let us hope, however, that the signature of the memorandum in Sharm el-Sheikh will reinvigorate the peace process and ensure that the outstanding issues on final status are tackled without great delay.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I conclude by saying that until the refugee issue has found a just and comprehensive solution, the Union’s support for UNRWA, as a provider of para-governmental services in the West Bank, Gaza, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, to alleviate the very difficult lives of 3.5 million Palestinian people in the refugee camps, is absolutely crucial. Far from taking a marginal role, the European Union, and therefore, the European Commission will sustain a strong engagement to ensure that the conditions of those people are significantly improved.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not do it again. I certainly do not want to show disrespect to the House. However, I am afraid I have made another mistake, by speaking too quickly. So I apologise to the people who work so hard for us, the interpreters, because one of my colleagues told me that I was speaking too quickly. I was emotional but I think that as I am a woman and emotion and reason go hand in hand, next time I will use reason more.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would simply like to say that I am extremely pleased with the interventions that my colleagues have made because something has emerged very clearly. Despite the need to carry out this programme quickly, the important point is for the European Union and the European Parliament to play a stronger, more active role so that in the Middle East, stable and lasting peace will come about, especially between Palestine and Israel. This will allow us to find a solution to the refugee question and enable a Palestinian State to live peacefully with the Israeli State too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
