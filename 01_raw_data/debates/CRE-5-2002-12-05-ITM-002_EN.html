To avoid any misunderstandings created by press reports, I would like to make it clear from the outset that, today, I am here to present, as agreed, only the text that the Commission has adopted. The document on the Constitution of the European Union, which has been reported by the press, is nothing more than a working document, a feasibility study that Commissioner Barnier, Commissioner Vitorino and I commissioned from a group of legal experts in the Commission, in order to have an initial idea of how a Treaty could be organised. The document was essentially drawn up on the basis of the structure of the preliminary draft presented to the Convention by the Praesidium. As it is simply, I repeat, a technical working tool, it was neither discussed by the College nor submitted for its approval, and the College has therefore no political responsibility for its content. Although it was formulated mainly for internal use, I thought it my duty to inform Mr Giscard d'Estaing of its existence, and, for the sake of transparency, we have decided to post it on the Internet by the end of the day in order to make it available, as others have done in the past, as a working tool for the Convention and for all those interested.</p>
<p class="contents">To set the tone for my presentation and the subsequent debate, I would like to recall someone who played a leading role in laying the first foundations of the European project. This is what Jean Monnet said about his famous method: ‘I never thought we could change human nature. But by changing the context in which people live, by giving them the same rules and the same democratic institutions, we can succeed in changing the way they behave towards each other. Within the Community, Europeans are learning to live together as one and the same people. We are not merging states, we were uniting human beings.’</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to look ahead, far ahead into the future, we need to climb onto the shoulders of the great statesmen who have gone before us. That requires a responsible and humble approach, and it is with humility that I propose to follow Jean Monnet's intuition in order to meet the great challenges of the future. To unite all the citizens of Europe, we must create true harmony between the States and between the peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate that has taken place in recent months since the Convention opened has already clarified many unclear areas and answered many questions. First, the debate has made it plain that citizens do not want the Union to withdraw from areas where it is present. On the contrary, people want the Union to be more prominent in foreign policy, in justice and security and in social affairs. Moreover, there is broad agreement on the Community method, which is at the heart of so many of our achievements. Relations between the main institutions certainly need to be streamlined and clarified, but even the most sceptical have realised that without a strong Community element, Europe would become less effective and less democratic too.</p>
<p class="contents">Our contribution to the Convention seeks to respond to these concerns. In short, it has three objectives: the Union must become more democratic, more effective and clearer. The path to these goals has not yet been marked out in detail, but we already know where the starting and finishing lines are. The reshaping of the Union must be grounded on its twofold nature as a Union of peoples and of States, together with a third source of the Union's legitimacy, the fact that it safeguards the common interest. Our path must lead us to build the world's first true supranational democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">To give more democratic substance to our structure, we need to establish the roles and responsibilities of the main institutions more clearly. We therefore have two proposals for reform. The first<span class="bold"> </span>concerns the appointment of the Commission. The President of the Commission should be elected by the European Parliament by at least two-thirds of the votes cast in a secret ballot. Once it has confirmed the appointment of the President of the Commission, the Council, by common agreement with him or her, will designate the other members of the Commission. The European Parliament will then approve the whole Commission, as appointed by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The second innovation concerns the Commission's dual accountability to the European Parliament and the Council. We propose that both institutions should have the right to pass a motion of censure on the Commission. This will give the institutional triangle more balance and will strengthen the Commission's position as guarantor of the general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, this is a particularly delicate and bold proposal, but, in my view, the proposed arrangement divides decision-making power more fairly between the representatives of the national governments and the representatives of the people, that is, between the Council and Parliament. For the same reason, we propose to make codecision the rule. All European legislation must be put forward by a Commission proposal, adopted by a majority vote in the Council and codecided by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as I have often said in this House, the time has come to put Parliament on the same footing as every other democratically elected parliament, by reforming the way the Union is financed. Its responsibilities are typical of those of all the world’s parliaments. We want to give the European Parliament more power to make decisions on resources. The Union's budget must therefore be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council by a procedure derived from codecision, as I mentioned a moment ago. As the Praesidium also acknowledges in its draft Constitutional Treaty, the Union must have its own resources. This would remove the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the key points in the Communication form a single unit. The democratic legitimacy of our institutions, for example, is closely bound up with their functions. Our main proposals in this respect can be summed up in three points. The first point is to abolish unanimous voting, as this rule has played a part in the darkest periods of the Union's recent history. If the veto has frequently paralysed decision-making with 15 Member States, just think what could happen with 25 or more. That is why I believe majority voting should be the rule. However, the current system of weighting is extremely complex and a mystery to the citizens, and not just to them: experts find it impossible to understand too. We therefore propose that the Council should take practically all decisions by a twofold, simple-majority vote, that is, a vote which represents both a majority of the Member States and a majority of the citizens. More sensitive decisions would clearly require enhanced majorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the Presidency of the Council, an issue that has caused rivers of ink to flow. I believe that the proposal for a President of the Union, put forward by several quarters, creates more problems than it solves.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, it enhances the continuity and visibility of the Union, but, on the other, it denies the Member States and deprives us all of the opportunity for involvement at European level. There are other concerns too. Who would elect the President of the Union? Who would this President be accountable to? And above all, as Mr Verhofstadt remarked, what would this President do for the other 360 days of the year when the Council is not in session and George Bush is not calling? It is clear that such a position would open a rift in our institutional structure. We therefore recommend maintaining the system of rotation for the Presidency of the European Council, the General Affairs Council and the Committee of Permanent Representatives. For all other Council configurations, we propose a new formula, that members of Council configurations should elect a president from one of their number, with a one-year mandate. This formula will bring greater continuity to the Council's work and put the Presidency in the hands of persons who enjoy the full confidence of their peers.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns our external representation. The Union must act as one in the international arena in order to defend its values and promote its social model. In terms of trade, the Union is already on an equal footing with the other leading players on the world stage. Why, then, can we not be equally credible in the political arena? This requires imagination and courage because it is vital for the Union to speak with a single voice in international politics. What we propose is a new post of Secretary of the Union for Foreign Affairs. The Secretary will be appointed jointly by the European Council and the President of the Commission, and will also be a Vice-President of the Commission. It follows that the Secretary of the Union must report personally to both the European Council and the President of the Commission. As a member of the Commission, though, the Secretary will be jointly accountable along with the other Commissioners before the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, this is a major innovation, but, I repeat, it is unavoidable. Given the magnitude of the change – and this is important – we plan to have a transitional period, at the end of which the Secretary of the Union will take full charge of his duties. I would like to outline these briefly. The Secretary of the Union will autonomously exercise the Commission's right of initiative in foreign policy in accordance with the Council's guidelines. The Council, or a group of Member States, may, however, ask the Secretary to present suitable proposals to the Council to achieve common objectives. The Secretary of the Union for Foreign Affairs will also be responsible for implementing common decisions and, most importantly, the Secretary will be the Union's sole representative for foreign policy in relations with non-Member countries and other international bodies. Various Union activities, such as trade and development cooperation policy, are connected with foreign policy. Continuity in these areas will be ensured by collaboration between the Secretary of the Union and the President of the Commission who, in this respect, will coordinate matters. The issue of the Union's external representation is also relevant to economic affairs. Representation of the euro area<span class="bold"> </span>in the international arena needs to be settled. The euro's economic strength is now recognised: it also needs to become a force politically and make its presence felt in the wider world.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final key point of our proposal is simplification and clarity. The current volume of directives, decisions and regulations that combine to form our body of legislation is possibly the biggest barrier citizens face in understanding the European institutions. The Commission believes it is time to put in order the instruments at our disposal. We propose, therefore, to classify legislation into just three categories: organic laws<span class="bold"> </span>adopted by enhanced majorities by the European Parliament and the Council; laws adopted by codecision by Parliament and the Council; implementing regulations adopted by the Commission in order to put these laws into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Constitutional Treaty must make a clear distinction between laws and implementing regulations. Moreover, it must be clear who implements European legislation in practice. We propose that the Commission should have exclusive competence for implementing – I repeat, implementing – European legislation, and, as I said, it will be accountable for this to both Parliament and the Council. The principle of transparency must also apply to what is known as comitology. We therefore feel that only advisory committees should be maintained. When the legislator decides to adopt laws at European level, I repeat, the Commission alone should have responsibility for their implementation. However, where the Commission is to perform a legislative role by delegation, then it is only right that both branches of the legislative – the Council and Parliament – should be on the same footing as regards the possibility of monitoring the Commission's activity, referred to as ‘call back’.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, When I quoted Jean Monnet at the start, I said that, at this stage of European integration, we need to look far ahead. The debate aroused by the Convention in recent months has already widened our horizons. The national parliaments and governments have believed in it right from the start, and sent major figures to represent them. The goal of the Convention has become more ambitious. It is no longer just a question of ensuring that the institutions work well after enlargement: it must establish the overall shape of the Union for generations to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see this development. The Convention that Parliament and I too wanted so keenly is providing our fellow citizens and the whole world with an analysis of all aspects of our institutions. I am also pleased that this is taking place in the light of day. The coming months will see the emergence of a new, united Europe, and we can be proud that it will have come into being democratically and transparently.</p>

I am pleased for him personally, but I am also pleased about the case he has been making. We cannot always applaud the President of the Commission so enthusiastically. Mr Prodi, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats wishes to sincerely thank you and the whole Commission for the work you have done.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to add that our group very much supports the Commission as regards the future of the European Union and its institutions. That does not mean that there will not be differences of opinion between us on points of detail, and today's debate is one which forms part of a process in which we need to exchange views, and a process in which others are also involved, such as governments, with whom we ultimately need to achieve a result as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the most important thing in the debate over the coming months will be for the Commission and Parliament to ensure in no uncertain terms that the outcome of the Convention is underpinned by the Community method. The Community method means the institutions of the European Union acting together and it particularly means that we must very firmly reject the intergovernmental method. I want to make this point crystal clear, and in the full public gaze: if at the end of the Convention the intergovernmental method wins the day, we could not support that. In that respect, we are totally at one with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We want a democratic Europe, and as far as we are concerned a democratic Europe means a representative democracy at EU level. That means the European Parliament being closely involved in all legislative issues, as a 100% co-legislator, as Mr Romano Prodi said. However, a democratic Europe based on representative democracy also means that we recognise the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not want a chamber at EU level consisting of national Members of Parliament, then we also need to strive to define what tasks are European tasks. All other tasks are tasks for the Member States of the European Union and it is the job of the Member States of the European Union to define what are national matters, what are regional matters and what are matters for local authorities. The principle of representative democracy must apply at all four of these levels – local authorities, regions, nations and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That implies that we need to link the Community method at EU level with the principle of subsidiarity. We need Europe to be effective – let me emphasise that point – and to be clearer and easier to understand. As far as we are concerned, a key issue and one linked with the Community method is that the Europe we are building should be a legal Community. Because if it is not a legal Community it will be an intergovernmental Europe, and that would be opening the way to political opportunism, and history has shown that to be a very bad thing for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not possible for me to talk very much about the many points of detail in the four minutes I have at my disposal, but I urge us all to consistently be guided by the issue of method when we have individual decisions to make. My request to the members of the Convention, and let me repeat it here, is this: make sure that the Convention achieves results. If we do not manage to achieve any results in the Convention, and transfer this task to the Intergovernmental Conference, the outcome of that conference will owe less to the Community method than what we can achieve in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am calling for our work in the Convention to be completed and for a willingness to compromise to be demonstrated in that forum, so that by the end of June 2003 we will be able to present a reasonable proposal for a European constitution.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to inform the House that I have written to President Prodi, as I did on 14 August to ask for solidarity with the Germans, the Austrians and the Czechs, telling him that now that the oil slick has reached Galicia we have to remember that the Galicians are European citizens. I am not asking you to take four Commissioners, as you did when you went to Germany, to wade around in the mud, but I would ask you, Mr President of the Commission, to make a clear gesture of solidarity. Furthermore, bear in mind that you have important responsibilities which affect many areas. For example, it would be good if Commissioner Fischler, who is an inland person, could see that 60% of the world industrial production of turbot is in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Commission’s proposal on the Convention, I would say first of all that the Socialist Group, President Prodi, welcomes the fact that the Commission has done its duty as a driving force – although you have come to Parliament on foot − and as guardian of the Treaties. You have presented, at an appropriate moment, a proposal which my group considers to be positive and which, furthermore, must contribute to making the work of the Convention more dynamic. We believe it is a good proposal. There are many aspects on which we are in complete agreement: the removal of the unanimity rule in the Council; the proposal of a democratic budget with the removal of obligatory expenditure and, with regard to the issue of revenue, I can tell you that my group has voted and the majority of us are in favour of a Community tax; the proposal for European lists for elections, a harmonised electoral process, promising positions on comitology. There are other proposals which we welcome as working proposals. One of them is that the President of the Commission should be elected by the European Parliament, something which I believe a large majority of this House advocates. We are not convinced that the unanimous approval of the European Council is required. I would point out that the European Council already voted in Corfu and since then votes for the President of the Commission by majority. Although in your case it was by acclamation. </p>
<p class="contents">Similarly we approved the merger of the High Representative of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission for External Affairs, and this may give us more strength. In any event, we have to take a decisive step towards a common foreign, security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">And now I will mention those proposals with which we clearly disagree. Firstly, we cannot accept the idea that the European Council can pass a vote of no confidence in the Commission. This would ruin the balance between the institutions. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must move on from co-decision to shared legislative power. To this end there must be a Legislative Council which is truly a second Chamber, that is, one that legislates in public and democratically, transparently and clearly. We must tackle the problem of the Council’s combination of executive and legislative power. I would suggest that in this regard we incorporate the Trumpf and Solana proposals and the contents of the Poos report, which are very sensible.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point, Mr President of the Commission, is that Parliament asked last month for a proposal to the Convention for a legal basis for the protection of pluralism in the European media. There is nothing of this sort in your proposal and I hope that the Convention will include it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, with regard to the <span class="italic">Penelope</span> document, I believe we must work like Penelope but in shifts. Certainly the Commission and Parliament will have to work by night to try to redo what others are going to undo by day. And I would remind you that the time for transactions, pacts and compromises is at the end, that is, at the end of the Convention. In the meantime, we will have to work shoulder to shoulder for the common Community cause.</p>

I can, therefore, say with some authority that I strongly welcome it. It is a strong assertion of the Commission's orthodox function and it should shift the debate about where a power lies, centre stage inside the Convention. It represents a challenge to those Prime Ministers who prefer to opine on the fringes of the Convention but who seem far too frightened to contribute official proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">As most of the items in the Commission's programme appear also in my draft for a federal Union it is clear that I shan't be your fiercest critic and, while I commend the firm rejection of an idea of a Super-President of the Council, I do have concerns and reservations about the proposal for an executive Presidency of the Council. I wonder if this would not lead to more of the inconsistency and the conflict with the Commission that we have at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely it would be an improvement to follow the logic of what you propose for foreign and security policy, which is the virtual cloning of Mr Solana and Mr Patten, and to follow that practice in the other two areas where the Council enjoys executive authority. Why not let the Commissioner responsible chair the Council in its formations for economic policy and interior affairs?</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, despite some reserves the Parliamentary delegation in the Convention will follow the principal lines of this proposal and I look forward to future close collaboration inside the Convention with Mr Barnier and Mr Vitorino.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to specifically mention that I welcome the fact that the Commission is at present making a substantial and constructive contribution to the Convention and has presented its views to us here at the appropriate time, because that guarantees that the Commission's contribution can be taken on board in the Convention's work. In January we will be starting work on the actual content of the constitutional treaty, and I am sure that the Commission's proposals will play an important part then.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, I am in agreement with the objectives you mentioned, because this is a matter of making the European Union more democratic, more efficient and more transparent. I specifically welcome the fact that you highlighted the dual nature of the European Union as a union of Member States and a union of peoples, and I think that it is indeed one of the Convention's jobs to make the European Union the first genuinely supranational democracy in the world, as you just called it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would very briefly like to mention those points which, on the basis of what you have just said, I support. I have in mind the clear commitment to the Community method, your proposals for enhancing and strengthening the role of Parliament, and the extension of the codecision procedure to all legislative decisions. I support the proposal for the European Parliament to elect the President of the Commission in future, and I also agree with your rejection of the creation of a permanent President of the Council. I also support the proposals for law making that you have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to touch on a problem that you did not mention in your speech, and that is the issue of dividing the treaty into two parts. It is generally assumed that this is connected with the fact that the whole constitutional treaty is to be primary legislation. However, no one has explained yet how that justifies splitting the constitutional treaty into two parts, and the question naturally arises of the different procedures for reviewing points of law stipulated in these two parts of the treaty. That is why I would be interested to know, Mr President of the Commission, whether your proposal today provides for different review procedures in the constitutional treaty. I ask because one thing is clear: under German law it would not be feasible, for example to facilitate adjustments to the ‘second part’ of the constitutional treaty, that is to say if it emerged that the EU was in practice to be given a ‘competence competence’. In other words, it must be clear that the second part of the treaty must also be subject to the ratification procedure by national parliaments in future, in which case, as I have already said, I would be interested to know what the Commission's line is on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Voggenhuber (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (DE)</span> Mr President, it is a case of better late than never as far as the Commission is concerned! There has been virtually no major stage in the history of European integration so far that did not begin with a vision on the part of the Commission, underpinned by a major plan and a White Paper. This constitutional process is in fact the first major step where the Commission has lagged cautiously behind and has, if anything, been reactive instead of leading the way.</p>
<p class="contents">I nevertheless welcome what President Prodi has said. He has summarised the results of the Convention so far, and he has come down on the side of the angels on some contentious issues – by which, if I may be so bold, I mean on the side of the European Parliament – and in particular he has come down on the side of a Community Europe, and against an intergovernmental Europe, and he has presented a whole raft of intelligent proposals. I too have been unable to read this document as quickly as our friend Andrew Duff has, so I can only make a few limited comments.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing needs to be said about this paper – it does not make any sparks fly! It does not generate any great enthusiasm or paint any broad canvases. It does not attempt to involve the public, the citizens of Europe, in this mighty battle for power. It is a very cautious, perhaps technocratic and certainly intelligent, and sometimes even clever paper. Yes, you have come down in favour of the Community method, but in that case you should also have presented a bolder picture of European unity. There are major tasks and important horizons involved in this process of European integration, but you have not presented them here.</p>
<p class="contents">The social dimension, which is may be the main issue on which the Convention will founder, scarcely gets a mention. The same applies to European democracy. This paper talks, for example, about a ‘constitutional text’ rather than about a constitution as such.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, you are in favour of scrapping the unanimity rule, but it is nevertheless to be retained when it comes to modifying Commission proposals. Unity and democracy are all very well, but being given power is a little more important. As regards the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I cannot find any reference here to access to the European Court of Justice, which rules on fundamental rights. The role of Parliament is to be enhanced, but the right of initiative remains exclusively that of the Commission. Parliament is to elect the President of the Commission, but the President is also to be accountable to the Council. And the responsibility of the Commission is far from clear, with the Commission being given greater scope for tactical manoeuvring, while the public is to gain relatively little.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to allow this to become too much of a critique. This is a proposal that also makes the Commission Parliament's ally, but I would have liked to have seen more determination to tackle the really important tasks and to respond with a sense of vision, particularly as regards Europe's response to the dangers of globalisation, to the unprecedented intellectual and political challenge of developing a supranational democracy, of taking the separation of powers seriously, of taking the rejection of an intergovernmental Europe seriously, and of making the legislative process more open and giving the public access to all documentation.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we can still persuade the Commission not to be merely cautious in making common cause with us, but also to be our ally as regards new horizons in European integration.</p>

This is to be expected and is healthy in a democracy. What needs to be emphasised is that this is a significant contribution to the definition of the Europe of the future, which, alongside other contributions, will enable the Convention to continue its work to achieve a result which is based on consensus and which is politically realistic. This is the only way in which we can hope to wield some power and influence over the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to various proposals and concrete solutions that we will be discussing in the Convention and which of course reflect the position of the Commission and its idea of increasing internal power within the existing institutional framework, the main conclusion we drew from your words was the concern to answer one key question. The fundamental issue that everyone, including the Commission, has to face is how to maintain an enlarged European Union’s ability to pursue its fundamental aims of development and economic and social cohesion and freedom and security for the present and future citizens of its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must acknowledge that European integration is an increasingly complex process, not only as a consequence of its internal dynamic, which is a victim of the natural conflict between national sovereignties and the concept of consolidating a European sovereignty, but also because this is happening against an international backdrop that is increasingly subject to the consequences and dangers of globalisation, to the threats of terrorism, to violent conflicts more or less everywhere, to financial, environmental, and energy crises as well as unemployment, exclusion and poverty. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that, in the Convention, all issues have been discussed openly, frankly and fairly. We cannot have closed issues and nor must obstacles be thrown in the way of the debate. The peoples of the current and future Member States demand and deserve this.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that confidence in the Convention is, in fact, growing, because, in addition to the now traditional Community institutions, it also encompasses national institutions, in other words, the governments and the parliaments of the Member States and of the candidate countries. Without wishing to state that there are two sides involved, not least because, as a result of circumstance, all parties have become mixed up together within the Convention, and rightly so, the fact is that this national component provides added value to the debate. I say this because, instead of there being one European public, we now have fifteen, soon to be twenty-five and later there will be even more national public opinions and it is to these that we should be addressing our words, because these have the ability to influence the direction Europe will take.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us speak, however, in practical terms. What is at stake here? In political terms, what is at stake is questioning, debating and defining ‘things’ as simple as the democratic legitimacy and the governability of the European Union; also at stake are the aims of the Union and its place in the world, the allocation and the definition of EU competences and their adaptation to the Community acquis, the simplification of the Union’s instruments, its democracy, transparency and efficiency, the role of national parliaments, the efficiency of the decision-making process and the functioning of the institutions in an enlarged Union and the drafting or otherwise, of a European Constitution. Everything, then, is at stake and rightly so, because this is how debates should be undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the first question that we should ask is: what sort of Europe do we want to build? To this end we need to define this European model in political terms. This task is the responsibility as well as the duty of everyone. The Commission has today once again performed this task and I could add that we have confidence – still – in the nations and, consequently, we believe in Europe. We trust in the Nation-State, and consequently believe in a Europe based on its nations having the freedom to take decisions which is underpinned by the States having equal legal status. We have confidence in the peoples of Europe and therefore believe in a Europe that means greater democracy and not the opposite, which is greater bureaucracy. We have confidence in diversity and we therefore believe in a Europe that respects the traditions of its Member States, preserves their cultural heritage and safeguards their respective languages. We have confidence in subsidiarity, and therefore believe in a Europe that does not seek to retain for itself decisions that could more advantageously be taken by the Member States. We have confidence in solidarity, and therefore believe in a Europe in which economic and social cohesion also results in the prosperity of the peoples and of all the remote and outermost regions without exception. We have confidence in peace, stability and security and therefore believe in a Europe that is united but not uniform, which can be mobilised by great causes, and which is governed by values and guided by principles.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by saying that the obvious target of the Commission’s contribution to the debate here is the Convention. The Convention is now entering the critical stage of its work, and so we hope that the proposals that it puts forward, which we would like to be politically realistic and consensual, fulfil their task of enabling the Heads of State and Government who are present at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take the best decisions on behalf of the Member States and the peoples that they represent. This is, furthermore, our duty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament and the EU’s prime ministers are also agitating to be given more power. It is not difficult to foresee the compromise at the Rome Summit in December of next year. The prime ministers scarcely wish to relinquish foreign and security policy, so they will choose someone from the European Council to represent the EU to the outside world. They may, for example, get Tony Blair to become the EU’s first president and then make Mr Aznar President of the next Commission. Instead of concerning itself with foreign and security policy, the Commission would be given power over the developed cooperation on juridico-political and police matters for which, of course, Mr Aznar has a special predilection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission may also be given increased executive powers, and Mr Aznar’s leadership become a proper government that stands accountable. Yes, but to whom? It will scarcely be the European Parliament alone but, presumably, Mr Giscard d’Estaing’s proposed Congress in which the national parliaments too may be taken hostage and find themselves with nothing but a congress of yes men, designed for applauding the prime ministers’ election of commissioners by majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">In return, the European Parliament will see the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure abolished and so be given more power over expenditure. It will also see common decision-making extended to include more areas and so be given greater influence over legislation. The EU’s prime ministers are being given more power and the Commission is being strengthened, as is the European Parliament. When all the supranational institutions are reinforced, someone must lose out, and it is the voters, who will no longer have the final word concerning legislation in quite a few areas. They are left with less democracy, every time that more supranational and undemocratic power is handed out in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This ‘innovation’, however, serves as a pretext in all areas to increase the powers of the body, previously considered to be the sole guardian of Europe’s general interest. That, however, is a biased approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take the case of the monopoly of initiative that the Commission is proposing to consolidate and to extend to the whole of what it calls the legislative domain. Why should 20 commissioners have a better understanding of Europe’s general interest than all of the governments within the Council? Admittedly, it is said that each government protects its national interest, but their debate makes it possible to go beyond that. The same applies to the market: each consumer protects his own selfish interest, but nevertheless, all their transactions set prices which provide the best general approach. The Commission, with its monopoly of initiative, therefore finds itself in the position of a planner who claims to know prices better than the market. In a world of openness, freedom and democracy, this is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The monopoly of initiative, strengthened by the requirement for unanimity within the Council in order to dismiss the Commission’s proposals and by extending the majority needed to accept them, distorts the entire European decision-making process and certainly contributes to the rift perceived between the Union and the citizens. In our opinion, we must reform it by taking an overview of the institutions. Either we open up the monopoly of initiative to other players such as the European Parliament and the national parliaments, which possess an undeniable democratic legitimacy, or we maintain it, but then, in return, we are making<span class="bold"> </span>a right of veto official for each national parliament. In any case, it seemed that the recent debate within the Convention on the Commission’s monopoly of initiative was drawn to a close even before it had started. Let us hope, Mr President, that the Commission’s new document will have the unforeseen effect of re-launching the debate.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Méndez de Vigo (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, it seems to me that a document like this Commission communication, which carries the slogan ‘peace, freedom and solidarity’, is a good omen, and I believe that that slogan could be the slogan of the European Constitution. By the way, although I have read the text very quickly, I notice that the Commission is being a little timid and talks of a text of a constitutional nature. Let us talk of a Constitution. The skeleton presented by Parliament in the European Convention talks of a treaty which establishes a Constitution for Europe; let us talk happily about a Constitution, which is what it is going to be.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe, Mr Prodi, that what you have said here, what your communication seeks – efficiency, democracy and clarity – are good objectives. I believe that for these to be at the forefront of our considerations is a good thing. So is the idea of double legitimacy, although I believe we must give this some careful thought. The European Union is traditionally a union of States and of peoples, and I believe we must begin to talk about a union of States and citizens, because ‘peoples’ is a concept from the 1950s. In Maastricht we introduced the concept of European citizenship, and we must therefore begin to talk about European citizens as subjects of the European Union. Therefore, a union of States and citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">My group’s spokesman, Mr Poettering, has defended something which this Parliament has always had as a first priority, and here we are in agreement with you, which is the defence of the Community method. If we were to make an analysis of the last fifty years of European construction, it seems to me that the most important thing is this Community method and we will therefore be with you.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community method, however, also means something which I learned many years ago from a person who I admired, Émile Noel, which is institutional balance. Ours is a Community system, which is difficult to explain outside these four walls; and it is a system in which the balance between institutions surely does not correspond to the usual notion of the separation of powers which we know in our own Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that in the Convention – and this is a good thing – we are following the formula of George Washington, who said for Philadelphia that the Convention can debate everything and propose everything. Therefore, the debate is an open one. If you will allow me to use the expression, there is a ‘free bar’ in terms of considering constitutional models. </p>
<p class="contents">But I believe that on this issue, and of course I must read what the Commission is proposing carefully, we must be prudent, because if we interfere with constitutional mechanisms, we may find that there are surprises in store. I believe we must consider whether it is in the Commission’s interest to be elected by the European Parliament and to be able to be dissolved by the Council. Because the important thing for the Commission is to be independent and autonomous, and I believe that to establish more links with other institutions could eventually make a Commission which should be independent into a partisan Commission. I therefore believe we should give this some consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, Mr Prodi, I believe that this is a good document. You have done what you had to do and we are going to debate it in the Convention. On the other hand, let me tell you something which I did not like, which is the famous Penelope text which you mentioned earlier. My friend, Mr Barón, spoke about Penelope, the wife of Ulysses. There was a song made famous by Serrat in Spain which was also called Penelope, about a woman who is waiting on a platform for a train and ends up going mad. I believe that by bringing out this text at the same as your declaration, you have not done yourselves a political favour. Today everybody is talking about this Penelope project and nobody is talking about the good document you have presented.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is at long last before us, and we welcome that. Your paper makes a further interesting and important contribution to the work of the Convention, but it does not provide a total solution for all institutional problems. It does cast some light on the Commission's position regarding a whole raft of issues. For example, majority voting in the Council as a general rule, which we welcome. Majority voting by Parliament on legislation as a general rule, which we also welcome. Bringing justice and home affairs within the Community framework, which is also good, and the creation of a Secretary of the Union for foreign affairs as Vice-President of the Commission with a special relationship with the Council, that is fine, and it represents a workable compromise as a means of solving a difficult problem. And there is much more besides.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see many positive points in your proposals. However, in some areas, Mr Prodi, your proposals do not make things clearer – they just create greater confusion. Let me pick out one of them in particular. This is the issue of the appointment and political responsibility of the Commission. You are suggesting that the European Parliament should elect the President of the Commission. That is a good proposal, and a much-needed step forward. But at the same time you say that this President of the Commission must be elected by a two-thirds majority of the European Parliament, which prevents the results of the European elections from being reflected in a decision regarding an appointment at European Union level. In other words it prevents something from happening that is precisely what you want: it prevents voters from deciding who they want as Commission President for the next five years. This means building in a permanent compromise, rather like the permanent grand coalition in Austria. We cannot and we will not go along with that!</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is that the European Council is to confirm the election of the President of the Commission by the European Parliament. How is that to happen? By a majority or unanimously? What do you have in mind? And if the Council does not confirm the President, what then? Does Parliament have the right to dissolve the Council? That is what I would suggest. Your proposals do not include any mechanisms for resolving conflicts. Ultimately, and this really takes the biscuit, the Commission is accountable to both Parliament and the Council. So how will that work out in practice? Will you resign every time? If Parliament says that it has confidence in you, will you stay, and if the Council says you must resign, will you resign? What sort of message does that send about building the institutions of the European Union? It is simply a recipe for confusion! Mr President of the Commission, your proposal in this respect creates more problems than it solves, and the European Parliament regards what you want to tell us is a step forward as actually being two steps back!</p>

Adhering to Jean Monnet’s vision and the Community method, the Commission is today reinvigorating its ambitious and forward-looking role in European integration with a blueprint that meets our expectations. I would like to focus on three issues: firstly, Europe has to become a global political power. The new position of Secretary of the Union for Foreign Affairs would represent a strong Europe, able to set out its position in international bodies through a single representative. Mr President, you are aware of my personal desire to see faster work and a substantial increase in the quality of our capabilities in the area of defence. I am saying this as a friend of the United States: the world will be a better place if it contains a strong Europe, capable of acting on the strength of its values.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission has to become the sole repository of executive power, reinforced in its role as the expression of the common interest of the Union; in other words, we must move towards a genuine Union government, elected by the democratic representatives of European citizens and accountable to the institutions which represent the citizens and the States. Other institutional figures, lacking a clearly defined role and which would undermine the unity of representation abroad, must not interfere with the government of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Europe must become more effective and coherent, capable of vigorously rebutting the attacks launched by eurosceptic groupings which, in my country too, use Europe as a scapegoat for domestic failures.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, to create a partnership between Europe and its citizens, we need to simplify our procedures and make them more transparent by making codecision the rule, reducing the number of legislative instruments, abolishing unanimous voting and reforming the way the Union is financed. I would add that we must strive to combat corruption and promote the pluralism of information.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, only if we proceed on this basis will we be able to conclude this process, at the end of 2003, with a Constitution and a second, high quality, credible Treaty of Rome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He also represented opportunism on a large scale. If you swear by the Community method you are not supposed to suggest that the Council has a right to dismiss the Commission. To use President Prodi’s own language, the proposal is stupid – <span class="italic">stupide</span>. The Commissioners are a collection of civil servants who do not need to inspire parliamentary confidence. If there are abuses they must be penalised just like other civil servants.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wants to increase its power at the expense of political decision-makers. It was unclear as to whether the earlier proposal to grant the Commissioners unequal status is to remain in force. If it is, it means the EU would have its own ‘Politburo’, consisting, one assumes, of representatives of the big countries. From the point of view of the small countries, that is not democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s demand to withdraw the system of consensual decision-making, or Member States’ right of veto, is an attack on the Member States. The right of veto is the last defence against supranational, unequal systems of decision-making under the Community method. Those representing the Commission in the Convention’s working group have been militarising the Union and creating a new European legal area in which there would be Euro-law and Euro-order. The Commission is calling for the common foreign and security policy to come under its control, with competence to be transferred from the Member States to the Commission. We must not allow the last vestiges of Member State independence to be crushed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission had and still has support here for its proposal from the European federalists, whose aim it is to erode the independence of Member States and turn the EU into a federation. There is already a federal currency. The federal army will commence operations next year. Federal law and order are being got ready. The federalists are over-represented in the Convention on the constitution of the EU. Member States should not approve draft proposals for a federation drawn up by the Commission or the Convention simply as they are. We must not make compromises over the Commission’s status as a body of civil servants as opposed to a political government.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, power wielded by the Commission is not democracy. You are a servant, who has now adopted a position on matters that are the business of your masters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is one of the important features of the situation as it obtains at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Prodi has said, what we are looking for is a supranational democracy in Europe and that will be, in important ways, a democracy <span class="italic">sui generis</span>, not exactly like that of any pre-existing state or society. I welcome a lot of what he has said today about the way the Commission should take office and hold office. This is an attempt to retain the kind of balance between the three institutions which ought to characterise Europe and which does not at the moment in anything like the same way characterise many of our Member States, where the government has become the controller of the legislature of the parliament rather than the other way around. That is a good feature of his proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Mr Hänsch has pointed very accurately to some difficulties and potential contradictions that will mean that these proposals have to be more fully thought through to deal with the question, what about the risks of deadlock in the system which you are suggesting?</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that picks up what Mr Poettering said and which nobody else has spoken of is that a European democracy must be a democracy at many levels. One of the great disappointments of the Convention so far has been the tiny attention it has given to those levels of democracy which exist within and below the level of the Member State. If we do not take account, adequately and properly, of substantial constitutional regions with legislative powers - the internal nations of the Member States - then this Union will not work as a successful democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Napoletano has prepared a report today to the Constitutional Affairs Committee of this Parliament. We have amended it in committee and we believe that we have strengthened it. He is not fully happy with all that we have reached there but I hope that the Commission and the Convention are going to listen to this because if they do not also attend to this vital level of democracy in Europe all will fail.</p>

<p class="contents">With your comments, you launched a genuine debate on the economic and social goals of the European Union, which is struggling to find real legitimacy amongst the European citizens and nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I regret to say, you are paving the way – prematurely, I feel, given the work of the Convention and, especially, the attitude of Europeans – for the European Union to pick up again its most characteristic bad habit, namely, institutional navel-gazing. This debate is premature and you are, I am sure, launching it because the Commission has a gun held to its head. If I may say so, I think that your proposal sounds rather like a swan song of federal institutions that are on their knees and devoid of inspiration at the dawn of the twenty-first century. I hope that the Europe which is taking shape will be a Europe of nations that are once again entrenched, re-rooted in the national democracies and nourished by the national democracies. I hope that we will put an end to what I called – I shall say it again today and you illustrated this point very well in your report – the attempt to create a kind of ‘off-shore’ State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He himself and other Members have mentioned the name of Jean Monnet. Now, I believe that there is a fundamental difference between Jean Monnet’s work and the proposal before us today. In my view, Jean Monnet always endeavoured to focus on the essentials and to achieve the – albeit modest, sometimes even miniscule – goals he set, and, in 40 years, many of his proposals have genuinely been brought to fruition. Now, with regard to this proposal, over and above the acclaim it will certainly receive in the media<span class="bold"> </span>and its success throughout most of this House, I genuinely wonder, without wanting to be antagonistic, how many of these proposals will actually be carried through, as would have happened when Jean Monnet was at the helm. There are some differences between the two cases, I feel.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do I say that? Of course, it is lovely to be able to say ‘What good proposals the Commission is putting forward on many points, with codecision for these matters, a different procedures for others ...’ but, clearly, all this must actually work in practice, and I therefore wonder whether the present Commission, the Prodi Commission, as opposed to the Commissions which preceded it and contributed to Maastricht, the Single Act and so on, will have the same ability to succeed. We will see in the coming days. I wish President Prodi and his proposals every success, although, frankly, Mr Prodi, I want to make it clear that what concerns me, what concerns us, the Radical Members, what I personally consider to be the Achilles’ heel of this proposal and would alone weaken it considerably, is the question of the President being elected by two thirds of the Members of the House. That means that all it would take is for the Mr Poetterings and the Mr Barón Crespos of the future to meet in private and ...</p>

I particularly appreciate the fact that in the key areas the Community method has been adopted as the guiding principle. The issues of the decision-making process, codecision and the extension of qualified majority voting, and the replacement of the Council decision-making process stemming from the Treaty of Nice by the simple dual majority are essential approaches that could lead to improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">As I only have limited speaking time, I would like to follow up these initial comments with some critical observations concerning the Commission's attempt to have itself legitimated by both Parliament and the Council. I see this as running counter to Montesquieu's division of powers. It creates a confusion of executive and legislative roles, a muddle that is really the opposite of transparency and accountability. It would lead to a marked weakening of Parliament's role, as up to now the Commission has been accountable to Parliament alone, and Parliament alone has been able to dismiss the Commission. The question of accountability remains. The right to dismiss the Commission by a two-thirds majority also remains, but now we are also supposed to elect the President of the Commission by a two-thirds majority! That is a total repudiation of the role of this House – the European Parliament is being emasculated! I regard this as a very difficult situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if the Commission will get what it is looking for here, because once it has the same relationship with the Council as it has with Parliament in all these areas, the natural alliance between Parliament and the Commission will cease to exist. That means that we will be losing something without gaining anything, because Parliament in its day-to-day technical work will have to take up the cudgels with both institutions, with the Commission and the Council alike, whereas up to now the Commission and Parliament have been in agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth considering the fact that the role of the EU Secretary for foreign affairs, which is viewed positively in the paper, will of course appear in a very different, and rather negative, light in this institutional context. The point is that this will also have another consequence: the European Council has the power to remove the Commission from office, yet the Commission President is a member of the Council. It does not seem the right approach to me to allow the Commission President alone not to take part in such a discussion about possible dismissal. If the European Council is to have an almost parliamentary right of control over the Commission, then the President of the Commission should not be a member of the European Council. That follows as night follows day: he can in no way be a member of the European Council, because how can a body have a right of control and hold someone to account if that person is a member of that body himself? I think that does not seem to work at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge the Commission to reconsider this very carefully, especially as it is extraordinarily weak on such a key issue. The key issue facing the Convention is whether the Council, in its role as legislator, is a legislative Council, with a second chamber that meets in public. The Commission's response to that is that this proposal should be examined. That is all it says! I would have expected the Commission to formulate a clear position on that point. The fact that it leaves the issue of the legislative Council so unclear and presents the relationship between the European Council and the Commission in such a way seems to point to a weakening both of the rights of Parliament and of transparency in general. That is why I regard this proposal on such a vital issue as being highly questionable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The struggles for power and for the social face of Europe have now really broken out. There is of course a battle between large and small, between technocrats and democrats, between results-orientation and bureaucracy, and everything revolves around the question of who is going to be pulling the strings in the Europe of tomorrow. And with more power for the European Council, as some want, we will of course be breaking the balance between the institutions. That means the triumph of the back-room politics of the big countries, and this will have a paralysing effect. Just look at migration policy – fewer results, less democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also vote for democracy, however, for a Europe that its citizens can understand – in other words, the Community method, in which the Commission is the elected European government and the premier is chosen by Parliament, the direct representatives of European citizens. This is the best guarantee for small and medium-sized Member States such as the Netherlands that their interests count too. At the same time we can make effective European policy. Consider migration and in particular the Vitorino proposals. Result: democracy and citizens over against this continent's Sun Kings. <span class="italic">Aux armes democratiques</span>, President Prodi. And at the same time, the struggle over the choice of whether or not we have a social Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Conservative, free-market thinking Europe, even here in the European Parliament, refuses to anchor the European social model as a task in the European constitution. And it is precisely on this that citizens, social organisations and we as social democrats want to do battle, because it goes to the heart of the matter. Are we going to choose a Europe as social protection for our citizens or are we going for the Europe of the free market, which is powerless in the face of globalisation, in which citizens feel alienated and at times of mass redundancies are regarded as disposable items? Once again President Prodi: <span class="italic">aux armes democratiques, Commission et citoyens</span>. Convention, seize your opportunity! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new constitutional engineering work can only be based on in-depth, responsible dialogue between the representatives of the European and national institutions. The Convention will therefore increasingly have to become a forum not for thrashing out different positions but for finding the best compromise, a compromise which confirms the two forms of legitimacy in Europe – the Community and the intergovernmental. The new Europe, founded on the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, must be politically strong and have economic credibility. To this end, we need to give it a single voice in foreign policy. It must be a Europe with a small number of effective, well-defined competences, including, in addition to foreign policy, defence, security, immigration control, the single market and the management of the economy. It must be a federation of nation States but not an interfering Superstate. It must be an institution with a stable balance of the powers of the three institutions: Parliament, Council and Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the principle of the six-monthly rotation of the Presidency of the Union will have to be changed. The Commission’s proposal, outlined yesterday in <span class="italic">Le Monde</span> and today in this House, is reminiscent of the French model, with the Commission in the role of Mr Raffarin and the Council in the role of Mr Chirac. I wonder whether it might be possible to achieve a compromise whereby there would be a single Commission and Council President, who would be put forward by the Council and elected by two-thirds majority vote in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point. The Europe we are building cannot afford to lose its Judaeo-Christian roots, which are the guarantee of the secularity of the institution. If, in the future, we were to attempt to build a Union without taking into account our history, that would be tantamount to building a castle with no foundations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also looking forward to the end of this never-ending task because I believe that, with everyone adopting a position, with everyone drafting their own Constitution, it is fortunate that some members of the Commission are concerning themselves with this common task and are making their contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you too for your proposals regarding the appointment of your successors and of the Commission’s three-stage appointment procedure. We feel it is worthwhile and relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a question to ask, however. I understand that you are in a negotiating position, but it seems to me that, when we speak of preserving the Community method, and this is obviously what the Commission desires, this method is based on the role of the three points of a triangle, with a necessary balance. From that point of view, I must admit that your proposal to satisfy the desire of the Heads of State and Government and their ministers to strengthen and go beyond the rotating Council presidency will be badly handled and will be viewed as a weak point of your contribution. Consequently, the positions that you adopt regarding the Secretary of the Union will be regarded enthusiastically and be reproduced in other sectors. From this point of view, the idea that the Secretary of the Union would not chair the Council responsible for these issues seems to me to be a weak point. You say that the president of the Council could not seek compromise at the same time as making proposals. We all know many assemblies where these two roles are carried out by the same person. I therefore believe that this is a point that we should examine in greater depth and I think that, in the area of external representation of the euro zone, these proposals could be reproduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I thank you for calling our fellow Members to order. What you need is a loud speaker so as to be able to broadcast this message to those outside the Chamber, as it is those who are coming back in who are disturbing our work.</p>

<p class="contents">I wanted to start by complimenting the Commission President on the excellent document that has been presented. I am also pleased that this document is so very much in keeping with Parliament's position and that it is also so much in tune with the Benelux Memorandum that has just come out.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all I am pleased that Mr Prodi does not favour a President of the European Union as Mr Giscard d'Estaing has proposed. We mainly see the President of the European Union in the role of President of the Commission. These two positions must coincide as far as possible. If there is to be a President of the European Union, then it must be the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">What seems a good idea to us, or at least what seems a good idea to me, is that the future Commission will certainly have three, if not four Vice-Presidents. For example, one for foreign policy, that could be Mr Solana’s role. One for internal security, Mr Vitorino’s range of responsibilities. One for socio-economic affairs and one for the more technical Commissioners. If you divide the work up in this way, then the President of the Commission will have rather more freedom to take on these presidential duties.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also very pleased with the emphasis on the Community method and that there are proposals for legislative simplification. There are good proposals for this in the Convention, that go a little further than what the Commission has proposed. We think that in the future there should really only be talk of regulations, of directives, of decisions and of the implementing legislation and that will be enough. And that as far as possible everything must be done by way of codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are also pleased that the Commission has not put forward the absurd idea of a Congress. We think this Congress a bad idea. What we do think important is that there should be greater involvement of citizens and that greater transparency should make citizens better aware of what is happening in the European Union. This is what the Commission is proposing. Consequently, Mr Prodi, you have our full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The communication you have presented to us is extremely interesting and is broadly compatible with the positions of the European Parliament. However, there is no clear proposal on one fundamental point, namely the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights – its integration, not the inclusion of a reference to it – for there is no modern Constitution which does not enshrine human rights. I hope that the Commission will not go against the development of modern constitutional practice and take the line that Europe should have a short Constitution with human rights hidden away in an Annex.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the proposal to generalise the Community method, codecision and majority voting. I welcome the idea of a single spokesman for foreign policy, who is part of the Commission but is personally accountable to the Council too. There are many other points which need to be clarified and discussed but we agree that we should not create new, unnecessary institutions and that the decision-making power of the Eurogroup and the Union’s financial system should be strengthened. Lastly, we welcome the fact that a proper distinction is made between those who make laws and those who implement them: Montesquieu has come to the European Union at last.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Union’s future Constitution will be that of a supranational democracy, as called for by the European Parliament, the Commission and the majority of the citizens, and that a way will be found to avoid a few eurosceptics preventing the countries that wish to move forward from doing so.</p>

I have read a document running to 23 pages. Mrs Kaufmann thought just now that there were more than a hundred, so I do not know how things are precisely, but those 23 pages are very interesting. They contain relatively little on socio-economic issues, and, as for what they do contain, I do rather wonder whether we might agree with it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to say a word about open coordination. This is a particularly thorny problem in the Treaty at the moment and it is actually poorly provided for. And what does the Commission say? It says that it must be decided by the Council, having been prepared by the Commission, and then in brackets we have 'where appropriate after consulting the European Parliament'.</p>
<p class="contents">This is of course quite impossible. If the Commission wants to crush open coordination at some time, then I think this is how they must do it. One of the three institutions on which this Community is based cannot simply be disregarded in this way on such an important issue. That is the principal message.</p>
<p class="contents">The second message is that in general the social element in the Convention has so far had rather too little attention paid to it. It is very fortunate that a working group has now been set up with particular concern for the social issue. I think it is possible for the major parties in particular to reach agreement on this, based on the experiences we have acquired in the European social model; it is possible, but we must be careful. There is one major difference between the two parties, the PPE-DE on the one hand and the socialists on the other, and this difference is where you start. Do you start with the economic or do you start with the social? This is important if we are to bring this to a successful conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a fantastic project, and people understand it and support it. In any democracy, the government is elected by parliament, and that is why I also welcome the proposal that here in the EU the Commission and its President should at last be elected by this House and not by the European Council. The present approach is really topsy-turvy, and I think that we need to reinstate Montesquieu's principles. So I congratulate you on having managed to get there. This is a really important point, and one where Parliament and the Commission can now pull in the same direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate you on clearly advocating that there should be just one executive and not two. There cannot be an elected President of the European Council alongside the elected President of the Commission. We do not want the institutions to be renationalised, what we need is to apply the Community method, and in this paper the Commission and Parliament are on the same track.

I will just make a few brief points, the first of which is addressed to Mr Barón Crespo. We have been looking into the problems in Galicia very carefully and are continuing to do so. Commissioner de Palacio has already visited the area, Commissioner Wallström is going there tomorrow and Commissioner Fischler has already recommended the measures that should be taken. Most importantly, we are summoning and coordinating all our resources so as to be able to take the broadest, most cohesive action possible. We can confirm that, in our opinion, this incident could and should have been avoided. We must therefore address this matter as thoroughly as possible because, if similar incidents occur in the future, it will be our responsibility. The Commission has already put pressure on the Member States to limit the circulation of obsolete vessels, and we will continue to work on that.</p>
<p class="contents">A few very brief comments. I would like, first of all, to thank you for your enthusiastic support for our proposals, for your enthusiastic support for the Community method and for your understanding of the very simple fact that this is not a final proposal – it is neither the Commission’s initial nor its final proposal – it is a major step forward which will allow us to discuss the issues together. The points on which there is dissent are extremely important points which we will have to discuss. As regards what Mr Brok said, for instance regarding the issue of the Commission being accountable to both the Council and Parliament, this is an area we need to explore, but we believe that it is fully in line with what he called the Montesquieu rule, although it is true that, should the Council have to adopt measures affecting the Commission, in that case, the President of the Commission would not be part of the Council and the confusion described by Mr Brok would be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, moreover, a common concept underlying these proposals, and it is the concept of countries and peoples: we have taken a coherent, fully cohesive approach in this regard. In this respect, we often find that we are in almost complete harmony with the Benelux document – not that we developed this approach together, we just seem to have the same perspective on these issues, the same belief that this is a union of nations and peoples, or, as Mr Méndez de Vigo rightly says, of citizens, and that is the approach we are pursuing.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not go into specific points because I know you are pushed for time. I would just stress one essential point: the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I can confirm that the Commission intends to propose that the Charter be integrated into the future Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we have already proposed this in the feasibility study I commissioned, and we demonstrated that it is entirely feasible. As regards this feasibility study, I would stress that it is just a technical working document: it was not submitted for the Commission’s approval and it was not discussed. It is a feasibility study which is an extremely useful working document. To avoid it being confused with the document we have proposed and endorsed in the Commission, I will not distribute it at the Convention today either: it will be posted on the Internet immediately afterwards, like all the working documents we have used during this phase. I assure you that this is a working document, nothing more, nothing less: just a working document.</p>
