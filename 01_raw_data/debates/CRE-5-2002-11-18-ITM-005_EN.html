<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I am pleased to be here today to present the Commission's proposal for a directive on tobacco advertising and sponsorship.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a long time since the Commission adopted this proposal – 18 months to be precise.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be an understatement to say that I am disappointed with the slow progress on this proposal so far. There have been delaying tactics, misinformation and, very often, misleading statements.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a great pity that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was unable to work more quickly, in contrast to the much quicker response from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, whose members are the true experts in the European Parliament on public health and consumer protection. They at least clearly understood the importance and urgency of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Worldwide, almost 5 million people die every year from tobacco-related diseases. This is two and a half times the number of deaths from AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">Of those 5 million half a million are European – the equivalent of the population of Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">Advertising plays a major role in promoting tobacco use, especially amongst young people. The tobacco industry needs new recruits to replace those whose consumption of the deadly product has caused their early deaths.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against this background that I invite you to look at the present proposal. This directive is important for the operation of the single market. Without it the single market for print media, radio and the Internet cannot be guaranteed on account of variations in national legislation on tobacco advertising across the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is intended to replace the previous directive on tobacco advertising and sponsorship, annulled by the European Court of Justice two years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous directive included a ban on all forms of tobacco advertising and sponsorship. The Court considered that this general ban did not have the legal support of the Treaty. However, the Court was not entirely negative in its ruling. Far from it. It helpfully confirmed that a directive prohibiting certain forms of advertising and sponsorship could be adopted on the basis of Article 95 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The new proposal therefore follows very closely the guidelines set out in the Court's ruling.</p>
<p class="contents">The logic behind the present proposal is clear: all Member States have adopted national rules to regulate the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products. These regulations, unsurprisingly, vary considerably between Member States. This divergence has, ironically you might say, been exacerbated by the annulment of the previous directive. This gives rise to increasing barriers to the free movement between Member States of products and services that serve as support for such advertising and sponsorship. We aim to eliminate these barriers by harmonising the rules relating to the advertising of tobacco products and related sponsorship to the extent possible in the light of the Court’s ruling.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal foresees a general ban on tobacco advertising in the press. This is an important vector for tobacco promotion, and one that has strong cross-border implications.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also includes a ban on tobacco advertising on the Internet. Advertising of tobacco products via radio and the sponsorship of radio programmes by tobacco companies would also be banned on the same lines as television advertising under the television without frontiers directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the proposal deals with sponsorship – banning this for events or activities with cross-border implications. Overall, the proposal has a much more limited scope than the previous directive. I know that many of you regret this and I sympathise with this view. I make no secret of the fact that I would have preferred to present a proposal for a complete ban on advertising for tobacco products. But, unfortunately, the legal framework does not allow us to go that far. We have to live in the real world. We have to recognise the legal constraints.</p>
<p class="contents">Our common concern must be to ensure that this new directive can and will stand its ground against any possible future court challenge and to eliminate the market distortion by harmonising current national rules, whilst at the same time promoting public health.</p>
<p class="contents">A final thought for now. This proposal has been very carefully constructed. Any weakening of its legal position would open the door to challenge which, if successful, would play directly into the hands of the tobacco industry. We simply cannot afford to let that happen.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner Byrne has made an enormous effort to bring forward a proposal for a directive in a field in which the Court of Justice had rescinded the previous directive on the complete prohibition of tobacco advertising.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of health, I believe that the Community is in a situation worthy of Kafka, because, although we have competence in the field of animal health – from stabling to feedingstuffs and transport – in contrast, in practice our competences in the field of health are minimal. In other words, the European Union has hardly any competences in the field of human health. It is able to adopt certain measures, certain recommendations, certain promotional initiatives, such as cooperation between States and with international organisations, but when it comes to legislative harmonisation, in practice we are faced with deadlock.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been intelligent enough to try to take maximum advantage of the conclusions of the Court of Justice, what I would call the <span class="italic">obiter dicta</span> of the Court of Justice, in the judgment which rescinded the previous Directive on tobacco advertising. And from the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs, the rapporteur in particular has had the greatest sympathy for the efforts of the Commission and Commissioner Byrne to bring forward this proposal for a directive which, as he has said, is much more modest than the previous one.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the rapporteur must acknowledge that there have been enormous difficulties within the Committee on Legal Affairs and, in order to make the negotiation of this directive possible, has had to accept a series of compromise amendments that make up the current text, which has been adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not yet know what the result of the votes next Wednesday on this issue will be. My impression is that, at the moment, this House is very much divided, since, as some Members claim, certain amendments may even weaken the legal basis proposed by the Commission and, at this moment, specifically, the opinion, for example, of the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy – who I believe we will hear next – is, of course, opposed to the introduction of amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the impression that certain of the amendments, at least, are justified, since they are intended to correct some of the aspects of the directive which would benefit from improvements. For example, a generalised extension of the prohibition of the use of certain trade marks could prejudice companies which, in reality, do not produce tobacco; all that happens is that some of the trade marks coincide with those of other companies who do produce it. I believe that each of these amendments will have to be studied carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">I share Mr Byrne’s concern at the delay which has taken place within the Committee on Legal Affairs. We felt obliged to hold a hearing as a result of the enormous disparity in opinions which had been expressed in committee and, at that hearing, I must acknowledge and point out that the majority of the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs were critical of the Commission’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has therefore felt obliged to do some rather deft work, trying to bring together positions in order to produce a first text that would reach the plenum in this House. It will therefore be this House which really decides next Wednesday on the fate of each of these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain subsequent amendments have been presented, which the rapporteur considers to be acceptable in principle – the amendment by Mrs Hautala, which is intended to strengthen the Commission’s legal basis by means of a recital. I hope that, next Wednesday, regardless of what happens with each of the amendments in the different votes, the text of the directive as a whole can be approved. In other words, I hope that the report is adopted so that the negotiation may continue. Since we are undergoing a co-decision procedure, we all have the opportunity to carry on correcting the deficiencies which may be contrary to the objective of being sure that this new proposal for a directive may pass the test of a further hearing before the Court of Justice, which will undoubtedly take place, because in the field of tobacco there are always hearings before the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can rest assured that I have an entirely constructive approach towards the object of achieving a final result in relation to this. But I will say again that this is a democratic House and the opinions of the Members vary widely. I even have the impression that there are significant differences between the national delegations within the various parties. The task of the rapporteur in this case must therefore be one of coordination, of good will, if you like, and above all of coordinating the results obtained next Wednesday in this House with the good intention of the Commission and the Commissioner of adopting a Community regulation in the field of health.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, it should be remembered that the inclusion of a clause on health in the forthcoming European Constitution is still to be dealt with, and I have the impression that the work of the Convention is not moving in that direction at the moment, which is rather worrying. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Every second, someone dies as a direct result of smoking. This adds up to over 3 million victims a year worldwide, 500 000 of whom are European citizens. Forty-two per cent of the Community population smokes and they are starting younger and younger. Sixty per cent of smokers start smoking at 13 and 90% start before they are 18. The gender gap between smokers is narrowing, with an increase in the number of girls smoking and 500 000 babies are born prematurely and underweight because their mothers smoke. Children in homes in which both parents smoke run a 72% greater risk of respiratory diseases such as asthma.</p>
<p class="contents">These are just some of the reasons why legislators in the Member States of the European Union have felt compelled to restrict tobacco product advertising rights, in order to protect public interests in general and the health of European citizens and young people in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Health Organisation framework convention currently being negotiated, which should be completed within the next few months, takes the same approach, stressing that a tobacco advertising and sponsorship ban is one of the most urgent political rules which needs to be applied internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House knows, this Commission proposal replaces Directive 43, the directive which, albeit after ten years' negotiations, was finally passed by the European Parliament and adopted by the Council in 1998 but, unfortunately, annulled by the Court of Justice in October 2000. The purpose of the directive being debated today, eighteen months after the Commission submitted its proposal, is to approximate the various laws, regulations and administrative provisions adopted by the Member States, in order to remove obstacles to the internal market and safeguard the free movement of goods and services and this is in keeping with the rules set out in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The present directive, which takes account of current legislation in the Member States and the case law of the Court of Justice, adopts parts of the previous directive and bans advertising in printed media, on the Internet and on the radio, together with sponsorship of events with cross-border effects. It also bans the free distribution of tobacco products, but does not cover indirect advertising. However, unlike the previous directive, it is not based on the principle of a total ban on all forms of advertising and sponsorship. I should point out here, however, that the Commission has submitted this more restricted proposal, which takes account of the legal framework set by the Court of Justice, in tandem with a proposal for a recommendation containing the elements which, as I said, have been excluded from this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Committee on Legal Affairs has adopted 25 amendments which could lead to further annulment by the Court of Justice and which restrict the scope of the directive still further. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the other hand, agreed with my proposal not to submit any proposed amendments and voted unanimously in favour of the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, our decision on Wednesday will have tremendous political implications because it concerns an issue on which the European Parliament and the Council have already expressed a view and taken a decision. I therefore call on you to vote against all the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs. This is the only way to guarantee a fast procedure and, more importantly, to ensure that we take a decisive, firm, legally tenable step towards a Community policy to control smoking. According to the scientific data available, this will promote high health standards, especially among the young, who are not just the main target group; they are the very future of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lechner (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to try, in these three minutes, to set out, at least fragmentarily, my view of this problem. The protection of health and the curbing of tobacco use are certainly important political commitments. It is right that their significance should have been so extensively set out today, but every political level has its own specific responsibility. Now it is the case that there is no legislative function specifically applicable to this at European level. Rather, Article 95 must always be applied, as it has been here today, which means that it must first be considered whether the internal market is affected, be it by such things as distortions of competition, trade barriers and similar. Only when this has been found to be the case can – and must – the protection of health be taken into account in this context, and, if these conditions are fulfilled, there is no dispute about it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is well known that it was because of breaches of these principles that the ECJ suspended the former directive that banned advertising. Venues are in competition with each other for large-scale events with a cross-border impact, so there should be rules on this, and, as that is where distortions occur, we agree with this part of the proposal. Rules on radio broadcasts across borders are also acceptable. The same goes for the Internet, although it is not clear to me how this can in practice be made to work where the material is input in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a ban on newspapers and magazines would, however, not be permissible. As we have heard in the consultations, the proportion of copies sold across borders is small to the point of invisibility in relation to the total print run, and these copies sold across borders are, moreover, not in cross-border competition. This means that there is no conflict affecting the internal market, and that such a regulation would not be successful. The Committee on Legal Affairs' proposal therefore provides for this part of the Commission proposal not to be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference is constantly made – the Commissioner has just done so – to the ECJ's comments on newspapers. To put it very briefly, my view is that the ECJ distinguishes between, on the one hand, advertising media that are strictly immobile – billboards would be a typical example of this – where the very nature of the thing excludes the possibility of cross-border competition, and then explains that, on the other hand, something else might apply to other media such as newspapers, and that this does not have to be excluded as a matter of principle. That is right, but one must add what the ECJ said at another point in its ruling, that distortions actually have to exist, that they have to be perceptible, that they may not merely be alleged to exist – and that is simply not the case with newspapers.</p>
<p class="contents">To say this is not to take a formalistic approach towards jurisdiction and certainly not to indulge in any sort of legal nitpicking. I believe this question of law to be eminently political in nature, and would simply remind you of the importance that the Convention attaches to the question of the division of powers, and of the discussions about the possibility of members of national parliaments making their views on these questions known in a forum set up for them. We should be putting down a marker and, as legislators ourselves, respecting the powers of our counterparts in the national parliaments, rather than again leaving this matter to the ECJ. This will also enable us to dismantle prejudices against Brussels' centralism and <span class="italic">dirigisme</span>. I cannot end without warmly thanking Mr Medina Ortega for his efforts at reaching a compromise, and, in particular, expressing my congratulations on the legislative quality of his text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposed directive seeks to protect public health but takes the ban on the distortion of competition as its legal basis. This ambivalent situation needs to be borne in mind by everyone championing more effective ways of protecting health from the spread in the use of tobacco which, unfortunately, does not have its own article in the Treaty. It is therefore only logical that the new proposal should be more modest when it comes to protecting public health than the annulled directive, which also included indirect advertising.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs felt the ban needed a cross-border dimension, not just for sponsorship, but also for the press, in order to strengthen its validity. By definition, national advertising and sponsorships do not affect the internal market. The legal basis selected only allows advertising to be regulated where it impacts on the internal market. Consequently, printed matter circulating solely within the territory of one Member State has no cross-border effects and cannot create any obstacle to the internal market or serious distortion of competition. This is clear both from the proposed arrangements for event sponsorships and from the fact that the proposal for a directive makes no reference whatsoever to outside advertising of tobacco products or advertising in cinemas.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the Committee on Legal Affairs has expressed reservations about certain amendments from the purely legal standpoint. Mrs Hautala, on the other hand, is operating on a different wavelength altogether and has called for health protection arrangements to be strengthened. Given that no one here is against health protection measures, the bottom line is that the two sides have to calmly decide which amendments are needed in order to rescue this as a valid directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us focus on content first, because it is obviously all too easy to overlook this aspect in a legal discussion of this kind. Is a ban on tobacco advertising effective if the aim is to prevent its use? Yes, of course it is. Hardly anyone takes up smoking because they like it. They do so for other reasons. They may take it up because of peer pressure in the playground, children of parents who smoke take up smoking, and people take up smoking because they associate it with a certain image. They want to emulate the man making his way through the jungle in a rowing boat, for example, or that other man on horseback somewhere in the wild west with pleasant music playing in the background. This is why people take up smoking. Image has everything to do with it. This is why a ban on tobacco advertising is good. It is a legitimate product, so why should you ban it? Last month, an overwhelming majority of people in this House voted in favour of banning advertising for pharmaceutical products, but, unlike tobacco, these are produced to make people better. I am in favour of legalising cannabis, but I would not dream of allowing this product to be advertised. So the problem is more complex than at first sight.</p>
<p class="contents">As it happens, there was already an opinion from the European Parliament – and also from the Council, in fact. In 1998 we stated that we were in favour of a ban on tobacco advertising. In this connection, the Court said that we had gone too far, with good reason, in my view. This was completely unrelated to tobacco but had everything to do with the question how far we, as a Union, could go in respect of the Member States. I believe that the Commission was right to say: okay, this is what Parliament and the Council wanted, they wanted to go as far as possible. The Commission subsequently consulted the judgment by the Court, and also the opinion of the Advocate General, and copied almost verbatim what was suggested. I therefore believe that the Commission has done a sterling job, and I shall therefore advise the majority of my group to reject the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. These do not appear to be essential in order to make the directive more acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make two final observations. First of all, I do think we ought to be careful not to start a smear campaign against the use of tobacco, for example by introducing a complete ban on smoking in public places, or by banning children's toys, chocolate cigarettes, liquorice pipes and suchlike. This is taking matters too far, and by doing so we would also lose our allies in the fight against tobacco.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to once again draw your attention to an unacceptable anomaly, namely that we are discouraging the use of tobacco products on the one hand and are continuing to heavily subsidise tobacco production in Europe on the other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We therefore prefer the directive which was approved in 1998. As the Commissioner has already said, five million people die each year from diseases related to smoking. Other Members have said thousands of young people start smoking every year, with all the consequences that addiction has in store for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Several studies have demonstrated very clearly the effects of this advertising and the sponsorship of certain sporting events in terms of young people starting to smoke earlier. In fact, 60% of smokers, according to the statistics, begin before they reach 13 years of age and around 90% before 18 years. We therefore much preferred the 1998 Directive, which unfortunately was rescinded by the European Court.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case in hand, various Members in the Environment Committee have decided that they are not going to present amendments to the Commission’s proposal because it is better to have a limited directive than no directive at all. We are therefore only presenting one amendment, which proposes that, in accordance with the Treaty, the Member States should retain competences and be able to regulate this type of issue and even go further.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment points out very clearly that this is one step and that surely, in the future, the European Commission will be able to present proposals on indirect advertising, on the control of expenditure on advertising and on tobacco vending machines.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, Mr President, it is better to have a limited directive in this area than no directive at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We might also say that there are very good grounds for bringing in this directive now, even though it is rather less comprehensive in its legal scope than before.</p>
<p class="contents">We must proceed in such a way that the Commission’s original proposal is approved in its entirety as far as is possible, and I was very glad that the Commission has shown its support for the cross-party amendment to Recital 1 which we have proposed in this House. Its purpose is to clarify the fact that indirect advertising remains within the competence of the Member States and that they may enact advertising bans in this area. In general we want to protect the national bans on tobacco advertising.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with great sorrow that it has to be said that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have watered the Commission proposal down totally. It is also to be hoped that every single amendment accepted by the Committee on Legal Affairs will be rejected in this House, because they complicate the issue in many ways. They obscure the proposal’s legal basis. They completely rule out the possibility of restricting tobacco advertising in the press and on the radio. They hamper global efforts to achieve a ban on tobacco advertising, and they also allow the possibility of the indirect advertising of tobacco. I would especially like to focus attention on Amendments Nos 17 and 24, which are extremely dangerous. Hopefully, too, the rapporteur will return to his original position and reject these amendments, which were accepted as compromises by the Committee on Legal Affairs, as they are not compromises at all: they just make this directive utterly pointless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, this new directive outlaws tobacco advertising in the printed media in the whole of Europe and will also prohibit the advertising of tobacco products on radio and on the internet. Equally, sponsorship by tobacco companies of events or activities involving several Member States will be outlawed. As EU legislators we must bring forward proposals which will help to protect the health of our citizens and I believe that the dangers for our health from cigarette smoking must be vigorously highlighted at every opportunity. In fact we have a moral obligation to do more than to warn young people, in particular teenagers, of the acute dangers of cigarette smoking for our health.</p>
<p class="contents">A recent survey has suggested that child smoking in Germany alone has increased by up to 50%. The cigarette industry claimed that their cigarette products are for adults, yet every piece of practical evidence suggests that clever marketing and advertising only results in recruiting the next generation of smokers, who are teenagers.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget for the European Commission to highlight the dangers of cigarette smoking is only EUR 6 million and this pales into insignificance when one looks at the staggering levels of money available to the tobacco lobby to put in place innovative pro-tobacco marketing and advertising campaigns. We need to do more to spell out clearly to young people the brutal consequences for one's health from cigarette smoking – that three thousand people in Europe die every day from cigarette smoking. This means that a half a million citizens die needlessly in Europe each year because of an addiction to tobacco products. Cigarette smoking is the single biggest cause of premature death and illness in the whole of the European Union. A recent study shows that American male smokers lose 13 years of life to the habit of cigarette smoking and that woman smokers lose 14 and a half years of life from smoking.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are going to put in place comprehensive marketing campaigns to warn young people of the dangers of smoking, we need the necessary financial resources to oversee such a programme. The Commission, Parliament and the EU governments must substantially increase the financial budget for public health campaigns which highlight to teenagers the real dangers of smoking. Preventing tobacco-related illnesses would do more to help the citizens of the Union than any other life-saving measure, and tobacco companies are wrong to claim that advertising does not promote smoking but only promotes brand loyalty for a legal product. Advertising does have an influence in promoting smoking; that is why all Member States in Europe have rules which restrict or ban tobacco advertising in some shape or form. Advertising for other legally sold products including pharmaceuticals and alcohol is similarly restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive does not mean that Member States cannot bring in more stringent measures to curb cigarette smoking if they so wish. Matters falling outside the remit of directives, such as indirect advertising or billboards and cinema advertising, remain within the competence of the individual Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Customer relations of this kind do, however, take their toll. Given the harmful effects smoking has on health, including for non-smokers due to passive smoking, our group is in favour of a total ban on advertising for tobacco products. These products are dangerous and can, upon lighting up and inhalation, cause serious diseases which can even prove fatal. We are therefore very disappointed with the Commission's new proposal. Although we realise that, given the judgment by the Court of Justice, the Commission's options are very limited, this proposal largely overshoots its goal, namely to protect public health. I shall thus reluctantly endorse the Commission proposal without any further amendments. This is at present the most viable option in the fight against tobacco advertising. Six months ago, we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy held an extensive discussion on this topic. It is therefore beyond me why the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market should still be tabling all kinds of amendments which will ultimately frustrate the coming into being of this legislation. If these amendments are adopted, the chances are that the Court will once again declare the directive invalid. I should, however, like to urge the European Commission to continue its search for ways of reducing the use of tobacco, particularly where young people are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incomprehensible that we should remove all kinds of less dangerous products from the market, but not tobacco. Once again, the use of tobacco is a euphemism for the injudicious incineration of dangerous carcinogenic substances. If this involved other products, we would have banned them a long time ago. I cannot imagine that we would bring toys into circulation which claim 5 million victims annually. Or that we would accept other products in food which result in 5 million deaths annually, but we do turn a blind eye where tobacco products are concerned. This is an example of extreme inconsistency. This is nothing to do with the precautionary principle. We know that smoking has harmful effects such as these, and this is why we should simply introduce a complete ban on this advertising. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Tobacco, which kills hundreds of Europeans every day, is a scourge that we must combat in the name of protecting the health of our fellow citizens. We will not be satisfied with half measures. Either tobacco is a deadly poison and everything must be done to reduce its use, even eradicate it totally, or tobacco is – mistakenly – believed to be like any other ordinary consumer item and so, there are no grounds to legislate. In fact, because of the persistence of these opposing views, which Mr Maaten pointed out, people are now beginning to say that Parliament is supporting the growth of a product that it is repressing in other ways.</p>
<p class="contents">The text presented by Mr Medina Ortega is heading in the right direction, but the proposed amendments weaken it considerably and we reject them. It is heading in the right direction because it has been proven that the ban on advertising helped to cut smoking and that there is indeed a link between advertising and excessive consumption. Strangely enough, the amendments give cross-border problems more attention than is their due. Thus, some Members seem to think that the existence of borders can have positive economic effects, whereas in many cases, it is the same individuals who are recommending the same borders be broadly opened up, regardless of the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, given our extensive knowledge about the damaging effects of tobacco, it would be criminal to make no attempt to deter increasingly young consumers from becoming addicted to a product the advertisements for which boast of its benefits. Negligence, indifference and a lack of political courage in the area of public health sow the seeds of crimes against humanity. It is this irresponsibly lax approach that caused the contaminated blood scandal in France and the mad cow disease scandal in Great Britain. Today, no one can say that they are not aware and this means that everyone is to be held responsible. That is why we shall support Mr Medina Ortega’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are divisions within groups, relations between committees are soured and Members who are usually friends treat each other with mistrust. Tobacco is a divisive subject for debate because of the many different sides there are to the argument.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which, it would seem, is not particularly concerned with public health and gives more importance to the internal market rules. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy would appear not to be aware of the fact that there is no legal basis for proposing a public health policy. It is all a pretence. In actual fact, both committees are quite aware of all the facts, but this has now degenerated into role playing. In any case, whatever line we take, we cannot disregard the fact that Directive 98/43 was annulled by the Court of Justice because it lacked an appropriate legal basis. Therefore, we now have the chance to remedy the situation, if only in part.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, as the Commissioner himself admitted with great frankness a few minutes ago, the Commission’s latest proposal is decidedly inadequate to provide the kind of protection of public health demanded by the Committee on the Environment. In any case, as it stands, it seems to be limiting its demands, to be prepared to settle for very little<span class="bold"> </span>in order to avoid another rejection by the Court of Justice because of the innovations it proposes, although they are very well balanced. As others have said and I want to reiterate, it would still be an appreciable result if we were to go home with the Commission’s proposal. As on past occasions, a little is better than nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">As shadow rapporteur, I too have recommended that my group vote for the Commission’s proposal without amendments. We will see what happens tomorrow. The important thing is that we do not start proposing once again to cut Community aid to tobacco growers on the pretext of protecting their health or, now, to ban advertising. It is the smokers – and I stress, the smokers – not the growers who must be the targets of these measures to persuade people to give up smoking. Indeed, the strange thing is that even if the entire Community production were to be terminated, the number of smokers would not have fallen at all; on the contrary, the smokers would just switch brands and start buying products from third countries. This change would not bring any improvement at all in conditions of public health, just an increase in the revenue of extra-Community companies, and, worst of all, it would have a considerable negative impact on employment levels in European tobacco-growing areas, in other words in the south of Europe, where more unemployment is the last thing they need.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, it is right to oppose advertising in the interests of public health but, for goodness’ sake, let us not start proposing once again to cut aid to Community growers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can therefore support the essence of the lines the committee has taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we should take another look at one or the other of these amendments, if they really do, as it were, again jeopardise the legal basis as given. In essence, the considerations on which our amendments were based were that the internal market has a legal basis that allows us to make regulations on advertising only if that advertising has an impact across borders, and, moreover, to a substantial degree. I agree with Mr Lechner that this is not automatically the case with newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think we are insisting that sponsorship agreements both in culture and in sport have to make allowances by means of proper transitional periods. I also think that the right to freedom of information is meant to matter to us. On it, indeed, depends the economic basis of both the traditional media – and major daily newspapers are telling us what is going on here – and also the new media.</p>
<p class="contents">I join with Mr Medina Ortega and with all those who regret the fact that we have no better legal basis for health policy in the European Union than that which currently governs the internal market. I would also like to observe that the Convention working party on the powers of the European Union proposes that it should in future no longer be possible to have recourse to legislative measures relating to health policy in the EU, but that only so-called support measures should remain feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Commissioner, that this will give you a reason to drum up support from the Commission for a reshaping of the Convention's proposals on this subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we know, with regard to tobacco advertising, this court of law has previously nullified a directive on account of there being an incorrect legal basis. That does not surprise me, because during the debate of this first directive, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, under my chairmanship at the time, had clearly stated that the European Union had no powers to issue a directive of this kind. In short, the law has rights too. I should therefore like to thank Mr Medina Ortega warmly on his achievements as rapporteur on this occasion. I should like to stress straight away that I shall be backing him during the vote. After all, the rapporteur has ensured that the directive to be issued now is legally watertight. It is true that the European Union can impose a ban on tobacco advertising on the Member States if there is a clear cross-border effect. However, I should like to add that it seems to me to be necessary that the ban on tobacco advertising, if it has a cross-border effect, should be put on an equal footing across all Member States. Member States that take their own initiatives at present distort the internal market's organisation and often cause a competitive disadvantage for themselves. I would take the example of my own country, Belgium, and the sponsoring of major sports events in Belgium. Our country has already issued a law which bans any form of tobacco advertising from 2003 onwards. As you can see, this goes much further than the currently proposed European regulation. Is this wise? I think that a general European regulation, as proposed by our rapporteur, should, on account of its general application, ensure that unilateral measures with often unfortunate consequences are avoided in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that my group and I share her point of view. I would simply like to add to what Mrs Berger said.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the Commission should put forward a proposal to the European Convention to change the Treaty’s existing legal bases in the area of public health. Mrs Berger was right to stress the fact that the working group to the Convention has submitted its conclusions which attracted severe criticism in the Convention’s plenary session. I feel that we absolutely must be able to legislate in the area of public health, as the arguments put forward here regarding subsidiarity do not hold water. On the one hand, the Council and the Community institutions are preserving their powers of appreciation as to whether or not it is appropriate to legislate. On the other hand, if we look at the studies carried out by the World Health Organisation, it is evident that in order for a ban on advertising to be effective, it must be applied thoroughly and comprehensively. The solution to be followed is that of global legislation in this area. We must at least have the means to pass European legislation, without which – and I refer back to the previous debate on media concentration – what will happen is that economic players will play the national legislation card against the others. This argument also puts the case for European legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it is easy to let emotions take over when we discuss matters such as this, but I would remind you that this is a legislative House and that we have to respect the rules we make. I therefore agree with the position expressed by Mr Medina Ortega in the conclusion to his speech to the effect that, when we draw up the new version of the Treaties, we must reflect once and for all on the European Union’s competences in this field. The lengthy analysis in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was a very serious process. With the first advertising directive having been annulled, the second proposal, although less comprehensive, is still wide-ranging and, in our opinion, it still leaves ample room for further recourse to the Court of Justice. In terms of primary law, the draft presented does not fully respond to the issues arising from the Court decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that, if we are to do the job properly, two minutes are not enough to go into the complexities of legal issues. I will therefore limit myself to two very brief points. The first concerns the prohibition on advertising in the press, with regard to which the general statement deriving from the decisions of the Court of Justice on the advertising of tobacco products to the effect that a ban on advertising can be contemplated, in principle, on the basis of Article 95, should probably be understood according to the very narrow Court interpretation of the Community’s competences in the area of the internal market and not as a kind of <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> for the issue of a general ban on the advertising of tobacco products in the press. This is as the current legislation stands.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the ban on Internet advertising. As regards the ban on tobacco advertising through information society services, it is difficult to perceive<span class="bold"> </span>any potential future barriers to the freedom to provide services or distortions of competition. At best, such a ban can be based on the need to avoid the possibility of a further ban, and at this point, this means that the principles of Community competence and responsibility are being overturned and reduced to competences in principle, and that is extremely dangerous from a legal point of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does seem strange that we appear to be finding excuses for how we might continue advertising at European level to make this product, as wretched as it is in terms of public health, more tempting for people.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in a situation where we have to pass a directive that is unsatisfactory, but we have already heard the history of this matter. It was unfortunate that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market got no further in this: we have had to accept a very unsatisfactory outcome as a compromise. On the other hand, this directive is being dealt with under the Hughes procedure with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the Commission proposal was unanimously supported by that committee, so we might say that, as a result, the majority strongly back the Commission proposal. These unfortunate decisions, which the Committee on Legal Affairs has arrived at, can certainly then be amended in the vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="contents">As, however, we cannot be satisfied with this proposal, even though it is all we now have, it is vital that we should accept Amendment No 26 tabled by Heidi Hautala, which would make it possible to preserve legislation in those countries where it has advanced further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this connection, I regret that his report is not being debated together with that by Mr Medina Ortega today. I think that this would certainly have benefited the scope of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Tsatsos pointed out, tobacco kills. In Europe, it claims 548 000 victims a year, or one every minute. Mr Maaten was right in saying that a tobacco advertising ban works and is lawful. May I add a few examples? Norway has had an advertising ban in place since 1975. This has led to a drop in consumption by 31%. There have been similar trends in Finland and New Zealand, where a ban since 1978 and 1990 respectively has led to a drop in consumption by 34% and 33% respectively. We should also condemn the anomaly that, although we give tobacco growers EUR 1 billion every year, we find it difficult to produce a comprehensive strategy to restrict the use of tobacco.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should also like to draw your attention to the link between the tobacco lobby and politicians. I would ask you to endorse the amendments by Mrs Stihler and others, also backed by myself, which call for the introduction of a registration system of donations from the tobacco industry to political parties and politicians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What it is about is the extent to which, and the way in which, we can, and are willing to, remove the existing barriers to the organisation of the internal market in the field of tobacco advertising. Anyone who has read the judgment of 5 October 2000 knows that the Court of Justice has specifically opted for the first directive to be repealed altogether, because, on the one hand, it recognises that there is actually room for the legislator to take harmonising action and, on the other, because, as the Court, it did not want to take the place of the legislator. This was a wise decision on the part of the Court. I hope that we as co-legislators will act as wisely.</p>
<p class="contents">This means for me that we should endorse the Commission's proposal without any amendments, for the alternatives are inferior. If we were to restrict tobacco advertising even further than has been proposed by the Commission, our ambition would run up against the bounds of our authority, and we would risk a new judgment. If we do not go as far as the Commission, then we would be making a political U-turn, for did we not indicate in 1998 that we wanted to go all out for maximum public health protection? The Commission's draft directive respects the bounds of the authority. This is not simply my political, but also my legal conviction. It may be a light-weight version of the first directive, but we have to live with it for legal reasons. We should not go as far as turning this light-weight version into an ultra-light-weight version, however. This is unnecessary and would affect our political credibility. Let us therefore approve the proposal as it stands. This is what people expect from us and that is also what we are definitely competent to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very important to create common basic conditions and rules for tobacco advertising. In a situation where these do not exist, there is often scope for discretion, and different actors proceed as they themselves think best. That is why it is good that we now have proposals that are also considered capable of operating legally. There are many difficult considerations that must be taken into account if we are not again to end up in the same situation as we did with the previous proposal for a directive on tobacco advertising.</p>
<p class="contents">The public health perspective is very important when it comes to the way in which tobacco is marketed. By regulating the marketing of tobacco, public health can be protected. At the same time, it is important, however, to send out the right signals, above all to children and young people. Tobacco is an addictive product that causes over half a million deaths per year within the Community. By being very restrictive when it comes to tobacco advertising, we can help stop young people taking up smoking, prevent suffering and save human lives.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Article 95.3 of the Treaty, the Commission ‘will take as a base a high level of protection’ in its proposals concerning the setting up of the internal market and its operation. It is undoubtedly the case that tobacco advertising increases consumption, both by encouraging children and young people to take up smoking and by deterring existing smokers from giving up or reducing their daily consumption. Studies have also shown that children and teenagers are particularly vulnerable to tobacco advertising and tobacco-related sponsorship. A partial ban on advertising is not, therefore, enough to protect public health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to focus on the principles behind the proposal, rather than the detail, which has been covered very comprehensively by colleagues. This is a long-standing issue and it arouses understandable emotions. It is perfectly reasonable that Member States should wish to control tobacco advertising and sponsorship and the Commissioner was quite right in his opening statement where he particularly focused on directing advertising to young people, to try and control new smokers coming into the smoking market. But I would argue still that the zeal to do this must not override the principles of the European treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the first time this was tried the Commission was too greedy. It exceeded those treaty powers and it lost the entire directive. In the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market – and I remind colleagues that this committee was right the first time round – this proposal runs the same risks. That is why we invite you to support our amendments. If you do not support them, you carry the risk of the whole directive falling.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wish to make concerns the whole question of subsidiarity. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's proposal ensures that Member States take that responsibility. It derogates those powers to Member States. Mr Fiori said earlier on that it is not what we want to do, it is what is appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot of talk about subsidiarity at present. Many colleagues are engaged in debates on subsidiarity in the ambit of the convention. This is a real test of that. You may want to do something, but it is not necessarily in the competence of the European Union to do it. That is what we are saying in this case. That we should not discourage Member States from doing it. This is the real test of how serious you are about the principles of subsidiarity. That is why you should support the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's line when we vote on Wednesday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Let me first of all deal with some of the technical issues. Looking at the important question of the Commission's attitude to the various amendments, there are 26 amendments being proposed. The Commission can accept amendments 3, 10, 22 and 26 in full and amendments 8, 11 and 17 subject to some minor rewording. All the others, the Commission rejects.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout this debate, we have heard from many speakers and it is quite clear there are different views. Indeed there are different views in Member States. They have in fact sought to regulate the advertising of tobacco products. I am convinced that there is a correlation between the legal rules in Member States on advertising and the figures for adult consumption of tobacco in those Member States. If you look at one of the Member States with the highest level of tobacco consumption, Germany, with 37%, it has a fairly lax approach to advertising in its national law, as compared with Sweden, one of the Member States with the most restrictive advertising legislation. Sweden's rate of adult tobacco consumption is 19%. So there is quite clearly, in my view, a correlation. A number of you spoke about that in your contributions. It is a question of attacking the image of smoking.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Alvarez Gonzalez referred to the different views of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the Environment Committee's desire for public health to be promoted as an important basic consideration in determining these issues. Those who spoke on the other side of the argument, if I might describe it as such, are seeking to have legal certainty, which, as a lawyer, I would say is not at all unreasonable. It is an objective that I would seek to pursue myself, not just as a lawyer but as one of my responsibilities as a Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">We have done that. We examined very closely the judgment of the Court of Justice in the first advertising directive case. When the Court looked at the facts of that case and gave its judgment, it clearly said that there were good parts in the legislation and bad parts. It went on to say that because they were so inextricably bound together, to attempt to extract the good from the bad, to retain the good and eliminate the bad, would amount to legislating by the judiciary and that cannot be done. That is why the legislation was annulled. I brought the judgment back to Brussels. I told my staff to follow it closely and we brought a new draft regulation. Referring only briefly to one part of the Court's judgment, paragraph 98 says in principle that a directive prohibiting the advertising of tobacco products in periodicals, magazines and in newspapers could be adopted on the basis of Article No. 100a – now Article 95 – of the Treaty with a view to ensuring the free movement of press products on the lines of Article 13 of Directive 89/552, the television without frontiers directive prohibiting television advertising of tobacco products in order to promote the free broadcasting of television programmes. The Court has spoken clearly on the subject. We have followed that carefully in our drafting.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Lechner, who said earlier that there was no evidence of a distortion in the market, I must say that there is plenty of evidence of this. In the Commission we get letters regularly from people complaining from both sides of the argument, indeed even from the industry, about a distortion in the market because of the different regimes in Member States in relation to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr De Clercq made reference to the movement away from Spa of the Formula 1 championship race. That is another clear distortion of the market, because Belgium brought in a law which they are saying forces them to move away from Belgium. That supports my argument that we need to have a level playing field in Europe. We need to have harmonised legislation on this issue throughout the European Union so that one Member State cannot be played off against another.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also my answer to Mr Harbour. It is not a subsidiarity issue for the very reason that a Belgian has been pinpointed in a particular way and has suffered a loss.</p>
<p class="contents">So not only does the Court say it can be done, the Commission says it ought to be done. But do not just take my word for it. The Committee on the Environment Committee says that we should have this legislation in the way I have described and I am sure it would agree the few amendments that the Commission concedes. Even when we look at the first report from the very hardworking Mr Medina Ortega, the rapporteur, there were three suggested amendments and I would have accepted any one of the three. If I read between the lines of what he has said, and forgive me if I misinterpreting him, I certainly got the impression from his reference to the compromised amendments that he was not speaking with great enthusiasm but was identifying the fact that this House was divided. Of course, it is. So maybe we can draw the conclusion that the first thoughts of the rapporteur on this issue, which are closer to those of the Committee on the Environment and to mine, might well be the ones to follow in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not leave it there. We have had a number of discussions on tobacco in the Council, including the preliminary discussions on the framework convention on tobacco control, and the breakdown there is 14 to one. One Member State takes the view that this legislation either should not go through or it should go through in such a form and with such amendments that in my opinion the heart is cut out of the legislation or amendments are added that leave it vulnerable to challenge in the Court of Justice yet again.</p>
<p class="contents">So what do I say to those Members of Parliament who are undecided about this? I would say to them they should follow the views that are expressed by the Court. Follow the advice of the Commission. Follow the views of the experts in this House, the Committee on the Environment, and follow the first thoughts of the rapporteur. Think to what extent will Parliament be on its own if it either votes down this legislation or votes it through with the kind of amendments that are being proposed. It might not be quite alone, but it will be alone with one Member State, the Member State that happens to have the highest consumption of tobacco amongst adults in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the choice and therefore I would suggest to those who are undecided on this issue how you should cast your vote. I would suggest you cast it in a way that puts people's health first, rather than becoming engaged in a pointless debate about the legal niceties when the issues have been resolved by the Court of Justice and those who have examined this issue closely and believe that legal certainty does exist, to the extent that is necessary to support legislation designed to protect public health, as Articles 95 and 152 say. Both the Commission and Parliament have a duty and an obligation, in this decision-making and law-making, to promote the highest levels of public health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
