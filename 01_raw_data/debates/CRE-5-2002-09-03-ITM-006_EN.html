<p class="contents">At the opening session yesterday afternoon, on behalf of the House, I sent our deepest sympathy and condolences to all the victims of the floods, who are so many: those who have lost their lives and those who, in terms of their homes and their businesses, have been so tragically displaced.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, on behalf of Parliament, to say to the Commission that its speedy recognition of the need to exercise and show solidarity on behalf of the European Union is greatly appreciated by this institution. I hope, in the course of today's debate, as we develop our thinking on the matter, that we can agree to find an early way forward to deliver on our promise of solidarity in the course of this budget year and to reflect on how we can be flexible enough to offer that kind of solidarity in the future.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, in recent weeks we have witnessed a terrible natural disaster in Central Europe which has led to damage the scope of which is almost beyond comprehension. Both Member States and candidate countries have been affected. Particularly in this six-month period as we face enlargement, it has almost symbolic significance in reminding us that the Member States and the candidate countries have a common destiny and share the same problems which we shall do better to solve through joint efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the European Parliament for this opportunity on behalf of the Council to express deep sympathy with the victims of the disaster. Many millions of people are affected. Some have lost relatives, and many their homes. The material destruction will make itself felt in everyday life for a long time to come. We must all do our utmost to help. It is important, especially in the light of the importance of enlargement for the European Community, that the EU, which is also a community of values and of solidarity, should help deal with the extensive damage. That was also emphasised in the letter received on 21 August by the President of the European Parliament and the Heads of Government of the Member States from the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, Chancellor Schröder and Chancellor Schüssel. The Presidency was closely involved in the deliberations which led to the letter’s being sent.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like, on behalf of the Council, to thank the European Parliament and the President of the European Parliament for the commitment and good will which Parliament has shown in ensuring a rapid and effective response on the part of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is, in the same way, to be commended for the considerable vigour it has shown in regard to this difficult matter. The Commission deserves praise for the fact that the EU has quickly been able to take the initiative regarding decisions that will benefit the affected regions in Germany and Austria, as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as candidate countries. A number of actions have already been set in motion, and it will be possible to make a start on others in the very near future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my understanding that there is broad support within the Council for making flexible use of existing instruments such as Structural Funds, agricultural aid and Trans-European networks, as well as for making exemptions and more rapid procedures available to the affected areas when it comes to state aid and invitations to tender. The Council had a first opportunity to discuss the Commission’s statement at a meeting of the Permanent Representatives Committee on 29 August. The Commission proposes, for example, that an EU disaster fund be established of which it will be possible to make use in connection with the floods in Central Europe and future disasters. I should like most gratefully to thank the Commission for the proposal, which is being debated by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that there was political backing for setting up the fund at the informal meeting of foreign ministers in Elsinore last weekend. That is a good starting point for the intense discussions between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament over the next few weeks. The matter will be put on the agenda of the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council to be held between 30 September and 1 October when we shall take stock of the matter and, if possible, arrive at some practical decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency is very keen that the Community should play its part in solving the problems created for our fellow citizens, both in existing and future Member States, by the severe flooding. We must act quickly and effectively, and we look forward to constructive cooperation with the European Parliament on this important matter which cannot help but affect many of Parliament’s rules and procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we were all both concerned and moved by the extent of the flooding that so badly affected Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia a few weeks ago. On 18 August, in the company of President Prodi and my colleagues Mrs Schreyer and Mr Verheugen, who are here today, I was able to see for myself the scale of this disaster in the region of Dresden in particular. President Prodi and Mrs Wallström went with Mr Verheugen to Prague, and Mr Fischler was also able to observe the extent of the damage in his own country.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, today, first of all, I would like to offer my deepest sympathy to all the families affected, but I also wish to recognise in particular the civil defence forces, the thousands of volunteers we saw, and the local, regional and national political and civil leaders who have shown such admirable dedication in this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">On 28 August, the Commission announced a series of initiatives under the various Community policies to help the countries and regions concerned to cope with this disaster. Not only has the Union shown its solidarity with the communities concerned, but it also intends to demonstrate its capacity to act and react quickly. Mr President, all the Commissioners present were particularly affected by the proposals you made at the beginning of this part-session, and by Mr Haarder’s speech a few moments ago. I would like to point out, with regard to natural risks, that two subjects always go hand-in-hand, prevention and repair. Allow me, first of all, to say a word or two about prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that prevention requires both funding and political courage. For example, the desire to control land use planning, to avoid waterproofing excessively large areas, in short, to manage rather than to develop land use planning. I also know, however, that prevention always costs less than having to repair the damage. At Community level, it is clear that the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds act as a financial lever for prevention. Allow me to give just one example. Many countries were affected by the Rhine and Meuse floods during the first half of the 1990s. We then mobilised over EUR 140 million under the Interreg programme, and that money made it possible to develop flood-monitoring and warning systems, and identify risk areas, build flood control reservoirs and facilitate water run-off.</p>
<p class="contents">For the current period, 2000-2006, many programmes also contain risk prevention actions. This, for example, is the case of the objective 1 programme for Brandenburg, which lays down the construction of flood protection. More than forty projects will be implemented within a budget of EUR 230 million. This, for example, is also the case for the Austrian Tyrol. Following the Galtur disaster of February 1999, in which 31 people lost their lives, almost EUR 10 million are to be allocated to an avalanche prevention measure.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that these efforts, in their current form, are not equal to the risks we face. Together with you, we have held discussions on the future of regional policy after 2006. When the time comes, I shall propose that natural, technological and environmental risk prevention should become a high, almost inevitable priority of future regional policy programmes after 2006. We can see that the frequency of these disasters is increasing, even if they are not all such serious ones. Furthermore, regions such as Germany, which, with the support of the Structural Funds, have made considerable efforts to boost their economy after reunification, to restore towns and villages, have now seen their work wiped out in a few short hours.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why regional development cannot take place without natural, technological or environmental risk prevention. The Commission, mainly on the initiative of Mrs Wallström, will propose a European risk prevention strategy by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude this point, I would like to say that it is quite appropriate that we are discussing this subject at the moment, today, while the Heads of State and Government are meeting in Johannesburg. It is plain that our planet needs global thinking and collective courage, as advocated by the Brundtland report at the end of the 1980s, before the Rio Summit. It is also clear that global thinking, either at world level or at European level, must be implemented in practical and local terms, in the field. That is the ecological challenge, the sustainable development-meets-regional policy challenge to which we have the obligation to respond.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am now going to talk about the urgent need to rebuild, to prove swiftly our solidarity with the German and Austrian Länder, but also with the Czech and Slovak regions that have suffered damage. First of all, we need to mobilise all the instruments already available to us to address this challenge. That was the commitment given by the Commission on 28 August, a commitment that led immediately to decisions in the first area, the agriculture sector, under the impetus of Mr Fischler.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing instruments, of course, include the Structural Funds for the Member States affected and the pre-accession instruments for the candidate countries. For eligible areas and regions, Structural Fund credits may be reallocated among the various priorities of the regional programmes, and we are prepared to increase the cofinancing rates as much as possible. Meetings will be held over the next few days with the national and regional authorities to specify the amounts that can be reallocated according to requests from the Member States. We shall be as flexible as the regulations allow, in particular with regard to State aid. I would also like to confirm that the disaster areas will not be penalised by the application of the N+2 clause if, due to the floods, the credits are not used within the period stipulated by the regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Here again, however, the instruments available to us have their limits. The Structural Funds cannot be used outside the eligible areas. Although most of the disaster areas in Germany can benefit from these Funds under objective 1, this is not the case in Austria. Furthermore, these instruments are governed by provisions with which you are familiar, which do not always allow the necessary aid to be quickly released.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is why the Commission proposes the creation of a disaster fund for the regions and States in case of a major natural disaster. I would emphasise that this solidarity fund will be available to benefit both current and future Member States. We considered it preferable to call upon a new, flexible instrument that could mobilise at least EUR 500 million in 2002, and EUR 1000 million in future, which would be added to the Fund in case of a disaster. The aim of this Fund would be, on the one hand, to help normal public life to resume, for example by repairing energy, transport and telecommunications networks, rebuilding or building temporary accommodation, and, on the other, to limit damage by consolidating preventative infrastructures, for example dikes and dams.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, this proposal is, therefore, different. Both in the amounts in question and the type of interventions envisaged, it differs from the emergency victim aid system that existed between 1977 and 1996. I believe, however, that this Commission proposal fulfils the wishes I have heard here myself, in this very Chamber, over the past three years, for example following the disasters that affected Greece, the Azores, the Canaries, France and the United Kingdom. In a few days, on 18 September, we would like to adopt a proposal for a regulation specifying the conditions and implementation methods for this disaster fund. This tight deadline shows the Commission’s determination to act swiftly, just as you yourself, Mr Cox, clearly expressed your desire to act.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission and my colleagues here present, I would therefore like to thank the Committee on Budgets, its Chairman, Mr Wynn, your rapporteurs Mr Colom i Naval, Mr Podestà and Mr Färm, for the quality and speed of their cooperation. This support and understanding are essential as our joint objective is to make this fund operational in the next few months. The Ministers for Foreign Affairs, as you said, Minister, reacted positively to this proposal at Elsinore.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say once again that prevention is always more effective and less expensive than repair. Sometimes, however, as is the case at the moment, urgency is paramount and it is important for the European Union to be able to provide help and practical solidarity to the affected communities and regions of Germany, Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. This shows that European solidarity, in conjunction with local, regional and national solidarity, is far more than just words. For the past fifteen years it has been the basis for cohesion policy. It has a purpose. And today, we are showing that this purpose is being confirmed, pursued and even consolidated.</p>

Many people are still missing. Not only in two Member States of the European Union – Austria and Germany – have we seen great destruction and devastation, but also in two candidate countries, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Haarder and Commissioner Barnier – representing the Commission – and also our Parliament's representative, have already had occasion to give expression to the present need for European solidarity. Clearing up the flood damage is primarily, of course, a task for the regions and nations, but the events with which we have had to deal here have has such a dramatic impact that people have looked to Europe to give an expression of solidarity, and so, even though Mr Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, is unable to be here today, I would like to express loud and clear my heartfelt gratitude to him for having been to the disaster zones with other representatives of the Commission, and for having represented the European Union there in a way that was right and fitting.</p>

<p class="contents">I attached great importance to this. I have not been to the disaster zones and have only been in telephone contact, but many have told me that Mr Prodi's presence – and the humanity he personally embodied – enabled them for once to perceive the Commission and Europe in a quite new way, and not as the distant bureaucracy they had always thought it to be. His quite personal human presence on the spot meant a very great deal to all of us. I kept in touch with President Prodi during this time and, on behalf of our group, told him – he was, I believe, in the Czech Republic at the time – that I supported him in so far as I could, and assured him that any commitments he might make would have our group's support.</p>
<p class="contents">I want my expression of thanks to include the whole Commission, including Commissioner Barnier, who has just spoken, Commissioner Fischler, Mrs Schreyer, Mr Verheugen and all who have played their part, but also especially to the Danish Presidency of the Council under Mr Haarder, whose government, in its capacity as the Presidency of the Council, has shown such an open-minded attitude to this matter. We are all of course aware that there is a constant tension between solidarity and subsidiarity, but, in this instance, it is solidarity that has had a challenge thrown down to it. If the follow-up measures are now completed as promptly as they should be – and what the Commissioner has said gladdens my heart – then we have done our duty as the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Before turning to a number of somewhat practical matters, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to those who gave assistance on the ground. Mention of, for example, the fire brigade, often raises a smile in our society, as people think that the things fire-fighters handle are toys. In a situation like this one, though, experience teaches us just how important it is to have a fire brigade, how vital are the soldiers who are deployed in a domestic emergency situation, how important the police are, how important civil defence is. At any rate, I have seen, in Germany, the country from which I come, innumerable young people getting stuck in and giving help, and, at a time when anonymity and egoism often seem to be predominant, it is a good sign that it is young people who manifest this solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to certain aspects of the emergency aid, on which Mr Ferber will also have something to say, we take the view – admittedly in contrast to the Commission – that EUR 1 billion should be allocated to emergency aid. I would like to express my gratitude to the six groups who agreed on this document – Mr Karas and Mr Ferber did so on our group's behalf – for being willing to come to an understanding about a joint text. Aid for agriculture had already been under discussion, then came the Structural Funds' efficiency reserve, followed of course by the disaster fund that now has to be set up for the future, and there will of course have to be a flexible approach to the rules on competition. Commissioner Monti and the Commission as a whole have committed themselves to this.</p>
<p class="contents">What people now expect of us – and here I am particularly addressing Mr Wynn, the chairman of the Budgets Committee – is that we now implement all this without delay. If we now hesitate and spend weeks disputing among ourselves, we will be throwing away the goodwill that the European Union, especially in the person of Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission, has garnered. I therefore ask that we act with decisiveness and commitment in setting the follow-up measures in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make an observation with only indirect relevance to this issue. Deliberations are in progress on the subject of the Stability Pact. Even in a catastrophic situation such as this one, the Stability Pact must not be jeopardised, for this is an issue of confidence in the European currency, of confidence in the ability of the European Union as a whole to deliver the goods. I therefore urge us all – Commission, Council and Parliament – not to shake the foundations of the Stability Pact, but – to return to the catastrophe – to do our duty by the people who have been hard hit. This European Union of ours will then enjoy far more popular acceptance than we often take to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">In this spirit I commend cooperation to all the institutions concerned!</p>

<p class="contents">On 14 August, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I expressed our solidarity and the need for the Commission to act, and please allow me to mention the fact that President Prodi and the Commissioners not only put their boots on and walked around in the mud, but that, furthermore, Mr Prodi accepted the invitation from Chancellor Schröder, who took action from the outset to hold that extraordinary Berlin Summit, which I believe was a strong sign of will and action.</p>
<p class="contents">Other colleagues of mine will speak more extensively about the situation in Germany, in Austria, in the Czech Republic, in Slovakia and in Hungary. But please allow me, on behalf of the Socialist Group, firstly to express our condolences, our concern for the victims and also our sincerest thanks to all the volunteers who have taken action, not only those who come from the regions in question, but also those from many others. I have had the opportunity to see volunteers in my country from the Canary Islands, which are rather far away, who were on their way to Central Europe to lend a hand wherever necessary. This demonstrates that there is a common spirit amongst us.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is the time to point out that we must change our past behaviour. Solidarity must be expressed equally towards everybody, and that is a lesson we must learn from the Azores.</p>
<p class="contents">We also learnt a lesson, for example, from the Greek earthquake and that is that joint action by Greeks and Turks allowed past barriers to be overcome. It is at times of difficulty that will must be shown.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the decision taken by the House – I am glad that it is unanimous and that the Committee on Budgets has acted seriously – I believe that there must be decisive support. Clearly disasters cannot be planned for in the budgets, but what we can do, as we have with ECHO and as we are now going to do with the fund, is try to create a system of safeguards which allows us to act.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out, now that the Convention is under way, that the time has come to remove this absurd distinction between obligatory and non-obligatory spending. It appears that we have to pay what goes towards cows and wheat but not what goes towards disasters. I believe that this is an important political lesson. This also applies to the stability pact. The application of the stability pact can be discussed when there is a disaster, but what is not acceptable is that the stability pact is being discussed in countries which have not suffered disasters. I believe we must be very firm about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I believe that, in terms of our approach to sustainable development, we must be humble and respectful towards nature, which has a memory and may return to haunt us. We must act more firmly on the way towards a policy of sustainable development and, above all, of strengthening solidarity between us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The financial losses were colossal. The floods caused fatalities, injuries and distress. In such circumstances the European Union also has an obligation to help. For that reason, my group, the ELDR, supports the Commission’s actions and plans to help flood victims and help finance reconstruction, and is calling for a vigorous programme of further action.</p>
<p class="contents">The distribution of competence means the EU’s responsibility is greatest in the area of agriculture. Thus, the measures the Commission has taken to bring forward payments of direct agricultural aid are right, as are their other plans. The ELDR Group furthermore believes the following measures are also the right ones: the partial reprogramming of the Structural Funds, a temporary increase in Community funding, and channelling the performance reserve to the flood area. There is also every reason to use the TEN funds for the reconstruction work. Action to help candidate countries also has the support of our group. It must be made possible to use the emergency aid reserve in the budget to repair the damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is in favour of establishing a European emergency aid fund. Technically it may be appropriate to establish it in accordance with a flexible instrument. Its purpose would have to be clearly defined and the rules made clear. Compensation would mainly have to come from the Member State’s national share and insurance companies. Our group is prepared to promote the fastest possible implementation of legislation and technical preparation concerning this fund.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the European Union should make a more intensive effort to overcome climatic change, implement the Kyoto agreement and reduce greenhouse gases. It is important to promote the use of renewable energy sources. At the same time, we need to consider the risk of natural disasters, such as flooding, at different levels of the social structure, and try to reduce them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to again express our dismay and our grief over the victims and express our sympathy to their families.</p>
<p class="contents">The immense material damage and the destitution of thousands of people call for extensive and coordinated aid on the part of the European, national and regional forces and institutions. The members of the public, communities, businesses and faring installations that have been affected expect the European institutions to provide immediate and tangible aid to alleviate their need and also to deal with the extensive consequences of the emergency.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union can do a great deal to polish up its image and reputation in the eyes of the public by acting speedily and without bureaucracy. The remarkable wave of solidarity and unselfish mutual assistance that showed itself in the struggle against the floodwaters, must be supplemented by clear and substantial indications of the European Union's solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken the right step in proposing the possible reallocation of European resources within the European funds, but this is not sufficient. Alongside the Community Disaster Fund, which the Commission has proposed and which will mobilise aid money in the long term, there is a need for emergency aid supplied from the margin of as yet unused European budget resources. Over and above that, we propose that, in the event of disasters, it should be possible to examine the legal option of reducing the share of national cofinancing, at the same time suspending the putting of contracts out to tender in order to mobilise local and regional enterprises. This would make an effective contribution to supporting and promoting small and medium-sized enterprises in the region or local area affected by the calamity.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the European Investment Bank's initiative, under which EUR 1 billion is to be made available in the first instance for the purpose of granting credits under special conditions, with the option of topping them up at a later date. Making these interest-free would be a greater help to the recipients. This brings us to the proposal that the European Union, using a specially created fund, could take on the cost of the interest incurred.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out by way of conclusion that these disastrous floods are not an isolated and extreme natural occurrence; the incidence of natural disasters in various parts of the world is increasing. For us, this should be – indeed must be – a clear warning signal, calling on us to give environmental issues, in all relevant areas of Community policy, a far higher priority than we have done to date.</p>

Never before had the Elbe, the river that runs through Dresden, my home town, broken its original banks with such brutality. It destroyed much of the reconstruction work of Germany's post-reunification period, destroyed new homes, and, above all, took all the possessions of young people starting businesses and homes – they will be in debt for generations – and largely wrecked the newly-renovated city centre to a truly massive degree.</p>
<p class="contents">No words of mine could be equal to the task of describing the losses, the suffering and the despair of the victims. When I refer to my home town, let it be taken as a symbol representing the many small towns that have also been affected as much as the great cities of Germany and its neighbouring countries. For my own part and on behalf of my group, I would like to express my deep sympathy with all of them. My desire is that this discussion may become a real sign of solidarity and that a disaster fund may come into being, founded in a spirit of solidarity with all regions rather than with only a few of them and including the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Both residents and visitors always had a healthy respect for the Elbe. The city has come to terms with the spring floods, but now the newly-emerging plans for the trans-European networks will make it into a basin with fast currents endangering the people on the riverbank. So I call on the Commission to reconsider whether their plans for the development of the Elbe and also of the Danube are still justified in the light of current experience.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a development plan for the Danube, one that is sustainable and will preserve the alluvial forests. It is now for the Commission to deal with the question of whether they will finance this plan alone or enter into some sort of arrangement for the financing of dams. As regards the Elbe, it is still an open question to what extent the Commission will take on responsibility for the plans that exist to develop it, which have been shown to be unworkable. That they have not yet been implemented – which was a great good fortune, as the flood would otherwise have been even more torrential – is due to the initiatives emerging from civil society that have to date prevented these plans from actually coming to fruition. The coming weeks, though, will see the question raised of whether it will be possible to preserve the important alluvial forests and their resources, and hence also to keep the waters back, or whether the Elbe development will proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true of the Oder, for which there are similar plans; there are nature reserves near the Oder as well, and it threatens to flood villages. The question facing the Commission is whether a new plan can be successfully drawn up and whether all existing plans can be reviewed, so that the Commission, too, may take full responsibility in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, the need for emergency Community action was blatantly obvious if we consider the exceptionally widespread effects of the atmospheric phenomena which have affected the whole of Europe. When he visited the disaster areas, President Prodi himself could only, in expressing the Union’s condolences, declare its ready availability to intervene with both exemptions and financial aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, there are other considerations which point to the need for the creation of a stable credit line. Although many would not admit it, I am afraid it is becoming obvious that our world’s climate is changing, and it is not necessary to subscribe to the theory of alarmism to see this. Of course, meteorological statistics through the years have consistently done their best to show us encouraging comparisons, making the scale of disasters seem less large, but it is not their – still large – scale which is disturbing now so much as the increasing frequency with which they occur, on the one hand, and the fact that they repeatedly occur out of season in Europe, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of a stable credit line in the Union’s budget would, therefore, help the States to take the necessary action to address the damage caused by these events. There is no doubt, however, that the other, more important part of the Community’s action must relate to prevention. It is certainly useful to reconsider at both national and Community level agricultural production policies, forestation policies and policies for managing hydrological risk areas. In any case, the key issue, the essential consideration, is certainly the greenhouse effect and its harmful consequences<span class="bold">,</span> which, I am sad to say, have been scientifically proven beyond all reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">We must reflect on the fact that the issue of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions – addressed for the first time as early as 10 years ago in New York and for the second time six years later in Kyoto in the famous Protocol – is still far from being resolved in any significant way because of the failure of a sufficient number of States to ratify the Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The call for Russia to ratify the Protocol is certainly an important step, but it falls within the scope of the political and economic relations which are being established with that country. We still have an unquestionable duty<span class="bold"> </span>to insist more firmly that<span class="bold"> </span>the candidate countries ratify the Protocol, starting with Poland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, however, warn against having the EU take part in the aid work. The victims of the hurricane in Latin America did not receive the money we had allocated. The EU often contents itself with accepting the public relations benefits of a major appropriation but is in no position to take effective action. That could also easily happen this time. It would be wiser to pay a portion of the bill for the aid programme that has now to be undertaken by the local, regional and national authorities, and I personally am prepared to go a very long way down this road, for it is in times of need that friends show their worth.</p>
<p class="contents">We are wealthy in the EU, much wealthier than, for example, the badly affected Czech Republic and Slovakia. We should now be resolute in showing our solidarity in practical, cash-down terms. We ought also, however, to look at the causes and take the greenhouse effect and other human assaults upon the environment seriously. France’s President Chirac is right, of course. He deserves great praise for his speech in Johannesburg. I am not yet in a position to assess the Danish Presidency of the Council’s contribution to Johannesburg, but it is scandalous both that we should continue to dump EU-subsidised goods on developing countries’ agricultural markets while refusing fully to open our own markets to those countries’ products and that it has not even been successfully agreed that 15% of energy should come from sustainable energy sources by the year 2015. It is presumably by means of this absence of decision-making that we are laying the foundation for the natural disasters to come.

We believe, though, that the aid measures put forward by the Commission at the present time will, unfortunately, prove to be inadequate to help the victims to a sufficient extent. Moreover, the funds are to some extent granted on the basis of unequal criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">We are deeply affected by the extent of these disastrous floods. In Austrian regions alone, over 10 000 homes have been destroyed, innumerable bridges and roads have been destroyed or have sustained major damage, with the infrastructure of communities and regions suffering serious consequential damage. Hundreds of businesses were seriously affected by the floods, their plant and buildings badly damaged or wrecked. In Upper Austria alone, thousands of jobs have been affected or put at risk by the flood disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall extent of the damage is increasing on a virtually daily basis, as we get a better overview of the degree to which the regions have been adversely affected. It is currently assumed that the total damage will amount to over EUR 800 billion, which means, as has already been frequently said, that the sum of EUR 500 million proposed by the EU as emergency aid will not be sufficient. We are therefore working on the basis that at least EUR 1 billion will be allocated to emergency aid measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we would also remind you that a surplus for the year 2000 totalling EUR 11.6 billion has just been repaid to the Member States. If billions are again repaid to the Member States in respect of 2002, it will not look good from where we stand, as the people affected by the floods will take it as read that the EU honours the concept of solidarity more in word than in deed. So I do believe that the Commission should indeed make up the cash and that this year's surplus should be cut back accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot be, or rather it should not be, the case that Europe's poor are treated unequally. I do not consider it right and proper for aid measures, in the final analysis, to be allocated according to the region for which they are destined. The situation in Upper Austria is that many businesses are not in the target region at all and certain aid measures are therefore denied to them. It goes without saying that we must also spare a thought for farmers, who should, speedily and unbureaucratically, have funds made available to them for the purchasing of feedingstuffs, be enabled to use set-aside land and should have cereals in intervention provided for them at cheap rates for feeding purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that we have to think of the thousands of private citizens whose homes were destroyed, and we should also, in a spirit of solidarity, make funds available for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me specifically mention in this connection Commissioner Fischler, who has rather less of a problem with budgets. Not only does he have to make proposals, but he can at the same time take decisions via the Austrian Upper House. It is a great help to the farmers affected by the floods that this has been done so quickly in the aftermath of the events.</p>
<p class="contents">Three things are needed. Firstly, we must make emergency aid available, and do so quickly. To do so is an expression of European solidarity. I will deliberately emphasise that this must be quick and, indeed, immediate. It will not be enough for people in the affected regions to be sitting in houses and dwellings that they have laboriously decorated, having put up a rough-and-ready Christmas tree, while we in this House are still discussing issues such as legal bases, reallocations and more of the same old thing. Rapid emergency aid means that the procedure by which we act must be the speediest available – we in the PPE group propose that this be based on the procedure used in the 2002 Fourth Supplementary Budget – so that, by the end of October at the latest, funds of the order of EUR 1 billion can be on their way.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the legal circumstances need to be created. The Structural Fund – Michel Barnier has been mentioned – the law on subsidies and public procurement; all this has to be taken into consideration. What we have to implement here is a complete package of legislation, in order that European law does not stand in the way of rapid reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have to equip ourselves to face the future. How can we set up a disaster fund for the future? That is the question. We ought to do that calmly and unhurriedly, in order to get everything right in budgetary and legal terms. If we do these three things, aid will get to people fast, and Europe will discharge its long-term responsibilities to its people.</p>

<p class="contents">It must be said in all honesty that many of us were sceptical, believing that it would prove to be a drain on our resources, but the great disaster over the past few weeks has, I believe, convinced us that solidarity is a proper response to such calamities. This is not just about financial support for countries that suddenly find themselves faced with a gigantic task; it is also – as already mentioned – a spiritual and moral issue, and also one on which this European Union of ours, which no longer evokes great enthusiasm, can gain added public support if it shows that it is acting in a spirit of solidarity. My group is therefore unambiguously in favour of the creation of a new financial instrument with all the precautions that honesty requires that we take in a disaster situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the disasters concerned must be of major dimensions, and we must not encourage the delusion that we can supplant the efforts of the nation states; we can and must supplement them, but that is no substitute for effort at a national level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like again to underline what Commissioner Barnier said with reference to prevention. Not only must we – where this is possible – provide for a return to the natural state, but we must also put preventive measures in place using all our technical knowledge, as for example happened in my home city of Vienna, where we have again been spared disaster. What this means is that the states cannot take it for granted that they will keep getting money when disasters strike, and then, for years on end, carry on with planning and population policies that have failed utterly.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I would like to make has already been mentioned a couple of times, but it cannot be too clearly emphasised, namely, that we must help speedily. I know we all have certain time limits to keep to and so on, but I see some plans which state that the present is perhaps to arrive before Christmas or only after it, when it is too late. It is too late for people to have an experience of the European Union as a real help. So I am asking everybody in Parliament, but especially the Commission, to prepare matters as speedily as possible and in so efficient a manner that both the Council and Parliament can give their prompt agreement. If we can tell people that this has been done, then, I believe, it will be with greater enthusiasm that they will be able to say ‘yes’ to this European Union of ours.</p>

<p class="contents">The disastrous floods in Central Europe have been, and remain, appalling. Something has happened to the climate. Imbalances in the frequency of drought and rainfall are becoming more and more common, and winds are becoming more and more violent. In Johannesburg, an attempt was made to find global solutions. The country which causes the most pollution per head of population – the United States – does not wish to participate. The way the world is at present, it is the EU which must now assume the leading role in bringing about a sound environmental policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder, stated that this will affect our processes and decisions. I believe that that is the case. Major issues have arisen within the EU which have required common solutions and have welded countries and peoples together. That has applied in the cases of the Coal and Steel Union, agricultural policy, the internal market and Economic and Monetary Union. I am convinced that we must pull ourselves together in order successfully to cope with the world’s future environmental problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The next major project for the European Union should be to create a common environmental policy that is both tough and directly binding upon countries and individuals. In that way, it might be possible to raise the standard without anyone’s being able to lower it again, and the EU would be given the opportunity to play a leading role when it came to improving the global environment. That is the most important issue for humanity and the EU combined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although there is as yet no definite account of the damage, provisional reports from the Federal States of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, which have been particularly affected, give some indication of the colossal extent of the flood damage, the present position being that the damage done by floodwater to agriculture and forestry amounts to around EUR 287 million. In Saxony alone, some 1 900 farms have been directly affected by floodwater, and another 640 in Saxony-Anhalt. Far greater, though, is the damage done to residential property in the villages, to the infrastructure of rural areas and to the dikes on the rivers. My home area, Prignitz, lies right on the Elbe, and damage there has been great; even though it was possible to prevent disaster itself in the form of flooding or the breaching of the dikes on the Elbe, the inhabitants of thirty-eight Prignitz villages had to be evacuated, with some 20 000 head of cattle being rescued from the flooding – a massive achievement for neighbourly aid in the sparsely-inhabited Prignitz.</p>
<p class="contents">A massive amount of work was done in Havelland, where many thousands of helpers did their best to counteract the artificial flooding of Havelland even though the polder dikes had been burst. The environmental and financial effects will become apparent only in late 2003 and 2004. It is my express demand that the advance payment of the EU's 50% per-hectare premium be proceeded with speedily, but I do ask Commissioner Fischler to review its payment to businesses, even though this is not within his remit.</p>
<p class="contents">The application forms that have come into my possession are drafted in the language of bureaucracy rather than that of solidarity. There is, then, a need for additional money. Special credit facilities and guarantee programmes may well be helpful, but many farmers no longer have it in them to get into debt again, as these programmes all have the characteristic that they become effective after a time delay. We know that this year, EUR 1 to 1.3 billion of the EU's budget will be left unused. I ask as a matter of urgency that consideration be given to the possibility of the unused funds being used as non-repayable subsidies to benefit the farmers in all the affected areas which have suffered severe damage, rather than being repaid to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">When the EU implements its measures, it is subjected to intense scrutiny by its citizens. What is needed, and in short order, is money, not sleight of hand or political evasive action. With that in mind, I hope Parliament, and all of us, will be able to do the right thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These sad events have brought us closer to achieving the proximity to our citizens for which we have often longed. It has been possible to give Europe a slightly better image. Brussels, that bureaucratic monster, seems to embody solidarity, and may that not remain merely an outward show. Disasters have more than a merely national dimension. European solidarity is called for, and the EU has come up with the right response. Alongside the countless victims, whom we mourn, there are so many individuals and families on the brink of ruin; we have businesses both small and large, farmers, the environment, agriculture, public services, historic buildings, art treasures, including in the candidate countries, in need of prompt and speedy aid, given on a joint basis and without strings attached. It is of little interest to the public whence the money comes and how we do all the restructuring. We have to tackle this promptly, speedily and swiftly. Aid must be visible.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the follow-up measures and to the long-term measures, I would like to underline what my fellow-Members have said, namely that climate change has become a brutal reality. Man-made climate change has arrived. Mr Barón Crespo said that we must have greater humility where nature is concerned, but to do so demands more effective action, more effective political action, on our part. Commissioner Barnier repeatedly emphasised the need for preventive measures. Not only are these necessary and cheaper, they also take greater care of the environment. I hope – and it is in these terms that I appeal to all the Member States, to the Commission and to this House – that these do not merely express pious aspirations, but will be implemented in all relevant policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the light of this that we should give ourselves time to engage in detailed discussion of the Disaster Fund. There is not much point in simply blundering into the rebuilding of what has been destroyed if we have not previously gathered all the available information we need, especially in environmentally sensitive areas. We simply have to rebuild in a sustainable way. Public expectations of this EU of ours, of this community of solidarity, have grown and will carry on growing. So congratulations on these ad hoc measures; we should be equally zealous in identifying the structures for the future, for our solidarity should be not only with those who are the victims now, but with everyone, and not only today, but also tomorrow.</p>

The last time Austria experienced a flood disaster of this magnitude was over a century ago. We are especially grateful to the Commission and the Presidency of the Council for their prompt action in response to this catastrophe. I would also like to thank all the Austrian MEPs for the solidarity and cooperation which have been manifested without regard to party political boundaries, and also all the voluntary aid workers, the voluntary fire brigades, the Red Cross, the Austrian Federal Army for their tireless endeavours. I am myself from an affected area in Lower Austria and have personal experience of their superhuman efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">It took no time at all for many livelihoods to be destroyed, with, for example, over 20 000 hectares of Austrian arable land inundated. The damage done has been enormous, meaning, among other things, that harvesting cannot be completed in the areas where threshing is done late, and that many fields and meadows cannot be mown as they are still under water as a result of the continuing high groundwater level. Machines and equipment are sinking into the fields, and shortages of animal feedingstuffs are to be reckoned with.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's immediate authorisation of measures to help farmers is therefore a matter of life and death for us, and for it they have my heartfelt gratitude. In a study, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research puts a figure of over EUR 7.5 billion on the damage. The destruction of many businesses and of the infrastructure in these regions has set the areas' development back by years. Parliament and the EU as a whole must give aid, actively and with all speed. The time has come to demonstrate this. I see this as a chance for the Europe in which we share to prove itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I really do welcome the emergency aid that the EU gives, one of the most important features of which is, as many of the previous speakers have already said, the transparency of the process and the absence of bureaucracy involved. This is an area where – to speak very frankly – the governments of the affected areas also need to make the necessary funds available without delay. Emergency aid must find a place in the Supplementary Budget. We have to set up an efficient disaster fund, give it sufficient funds and define criteria for it. It must be possible to give this fund an endowment of a billion euros.</p>
<p class="contents">Disasters will happen over and over again, but our society is distinguished by the way we treat nature and live in harmony with it, and by our solidarity with those visited by misfortune, for we can all be in their position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It pains me to even think about what has happened there and two minutes is far too little time in which to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">12 August marked the start of one of the worse natural disasters this country has ever known. To give you just one statistic: on 12 August, the Erzgebirge had 360 litres of rain per square metre within 24 hours. I think many a Member State would be quite happy with just a fraction of that rainfall in summer. The swollen streams and rivers carried off everything in their path. Thousands of people lost everything they owned within a few hours. Retailers and tradesmen lost not just their shops and businesses but all their stock and materials. 21 people are thought to have died in the floods.</p>
<p class="contents">The floodwaters have receded and what are we left with: devastation and mud. Initial estimates put the damage to infrastructure and public buildings in Saxony Free State at EUR 16.5 billion. By way of comparison, the annual budget of Saxony Free State is around EUR 15 billion. Saxony-Anhalt is complaining of damage in the region of EUR 2.1 billion, although I think that the final bill will be higher.</p>
<p class="contents">Emergency help is urgently needed. The federal government has already reacted and will shortly be providing EUR 10 billion for reconstruction. However, the European Union is also being called on to help. It too has already reacted and this reaction has been welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">But may I point out that, even if we single out the Structural Funds and give priority to certain measures, we cannot stop there. There must be no let-up in subsequent Structural Fund support for Objective 1 areas in eastern Germany and I urge you to bear this in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">May I take this opportunity to thank everyone who has helped clear up and helped fight the floods. I should also like to ask the Commission not to leave the Czech Republic and Slovakia out of its emergency aid plans. They have suffered enormous damage and are perhaps not as well-equipped as Germany or Austria.</p>

Respect and admiration are also in order for the huge response to the disaster and for the way in which thousands of people stood shoulder to shoulder in combating the masses of water. It was unprecedented. There must be no doubt that the EU Member States should pull together in dealing with a disaster like this. It is therefore important to remember that aid is twice as valuable when it is offered promptly. I would also draw attention to the fact that many people are looking to see how we help the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic is a candidate country, and it is therefore very important that we deal with it in such a way that it, and thus the other candidate countries too, feel secure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally draw attention to the fact that agriculture in the affected areas is suffering losses twice over: firstly, this autumn’s harvest of coarse fodder has been lost and, secondly, the harvest of sown winter crops will not be ready for next year. I would therefore very much urge that there be no doubt about the fact that the losses sustained by agriculture in particular will be spread over at least two accounting years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Three hours later, the shop no longer existed. The same applies to 1 425 homes in the district and 711 businesses. And of course, schools, scientific establishments and, above all, public infrastructures were seriously affected and, to put it bluntly, agriculture is staring ruin in the face. As we have already heard, 220 000 hectares were flooded and the provisional estimates of flood damage to farming are enormous. Mrs Fiebiger has quoted the figures.</p>
<p class="contents">Worst of all is the loss of animal fodder, mainly as the result of the grain lost. Governments and the European Union have already given a considerable sum of money in initial emergency aid. And quite apart from that, the Commissioner responsible, Franz Fischler, with whom I am in constant personal contact, and again may I express thanks to him for that, has ordered EUR 560 million to be paid in the form of direct payments to farmers, although the final figure will be higher because, according to my information, regions in Mecklenburg and Vorpommern have now been included.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have already heard, set-aside areas have been provided, together with cheap grain for animal fodder. My request, or rather my question is this: have these EUR 560 million really been available since 1 September? To hear that from you in person, my dear Mr Fischler, would be music to the ears of the victims. Because make no mistake. This is a national emergency and, although the regions affected must make every effort to deal with it, they will be stretched beyond their financial limits. Dealing with this disaster in the short-, medium- and long-term is therefore the job of these regions, the national governments and the European Union. And action must be taken quickly because the people affected are in urgent need of financial support.</p>

<p class="contents">Europe has been affected in an incomparable way by the problem of flooding and must be part of the solution to this immediate problem we are facing. Therefore, the urgency demanded by the honourable Members and assistance which goes beyond mere words are the two elements that are absolutely essential for this Parliament to demonstrate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, fresh money is needed to provide aid; not just the money planned for, but new contributions. We must bear in mind that this House has contributed for many years to the 1.27 limit of the European Union’s budget never having been used and therefore a substantially smaller proportion than that has been used.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Mr Barnier has introduced some absolutely essential considerations and details. I am a member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and it is clear that flexibility is fundamental in reprogramming, that the efficiency reserve must be used for this task, revitalising small and medium-sized businesses, which are the driving force for normalisation and recovery and that prioritising the defence of our infrastructures must be an essential element of the new priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will end by saying that, while we have been able to save for many years, solidarity now requires that we be generous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here we are, worrying about how to get money to the victims. That shows that, as a community, the European Union basically functions on the principle of solidarity. I should also like to make a point of thanking Commission President Prodi for having visited the damaged regions in person. His visit clearly demonstrated that the European Union is alive and well and ready to help and did much to raise the stock of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The local citizens saw that Europe is a dynamic force for help. I visited some of the damaged areas last week in preparation for today's debate and spoke to citizens and those in charge. The devastation is immense and the people are in deep despair. But they draw hope for a new beginning from the overwhelming sense of solidarity already shown in Germany and from the support coming in from further afield, including from the European Union, because they cannot cope with these problems alone.</p>
<p class="contents">The bottom line – I have been told time and again – is that money is needed, and needed fast. Apart from replacing personal property lost, we need, first and foremost, to ensure that infrastructures are restored as quickly as possible, so as to minimise the losses to business. Apart from cheap loans, which the Commissioner has already mentioned, I think we need to do more to ensure the money flows quickly. One way would be to provide funds from the supplementary budget or from the disaster fund which has already been discussed here today. This money needs to be provided in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">The second way of providing funds is through the Structural Funds. I think both channels are important and are the right approach. However, in the case of the Structural Funds, we need to bear in mind that, under current legislation, the Structural Funds can only be implemented if there is 50% cofinancing. This cofinancing is entered in the countries' budgets in annual tranches and the corresponding funds are then earmarked. Additional funds cannot be provided in the short term. Which is why using the Structural Funds only makes sense if cofinancing is altered. What we need is a reduction, and I do not mean by a couple of percentage points; we need a drastic reduction just for this period, i.e. while funds are being used to repair the damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the question of providing more money from the Structural Funds over coming years needs to be reviewed, as Mrs Krehl has already said. I think that if we take this on board, we shall have a huge opportunity to help people and win their confidence in the European Union.</p>

In my home district of Perk, we had a total of three flash floods and mudslides of unprecedented magnitude within a month. The first, which, relatively speaking, was the mildest, hit my own house.</p>
<p class="contents">The time of trying to persuade ourselves that this is a one in a millennium occurrence – an unhappy combination of circumstances – is past; we are sure that this is a catastrophe brought about by climate change and could strike again at any given moment. It could strike again anywhere in Europe or the rest of the world at any given moment; in other words, even as we deal with the emergency and repair the damage, we need to focus on prevention and on protecting the climate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to everyone, including the Commission, which has put a really impressive package together and shown us how we can help at European level. All of us from the regions affected have already said that this is a message which has been very well received by our citizens. I also believe – which is why, of course, we are lobbying here for increased support – that help from the European Union should be in proportion to the damage. The total bill in Upper Austria will probably be in the region of EUR 3 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a special request to put to the Commission on behalf of my region, which is neither an Objective 1 nor an Objective 2 region and the places worst affected do not qualify for aid. It is a request for support in implementing restructuring measures within Austria, including these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank you, President Cox, for having taken an early initiative on behalf of the European Union and agreeing to open an exhibition of the damage in Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria which I have organised at 5 p.m. this evening, because I think this sort of solidarity is important. I can also report that, in my region, even people who lost everything or almost everything are saying, the poor Czechs, they are even worse off, they will probably find it even harder to cope. I believe we have seen an upsurge in cross-border solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to use this platform to thank everyone who has helped in Austria, the army, the fire brigade, the Red Cross and all the volunteers. Many agencies have been overwhelmed with offers of help. In Austria, African asylum seekers have been helping and young Muslim associations have volunteered to help. There has been a wave of solidarity, the like of which we have never experienced and which has taken many people by surprise and I should be glad to pass the message of heartfelt sympathy expressed here to the victims in my home region.</p>

<p class="contents">This summer, the torrential rains that lashed Germany and Austria as well as the Czech Republic and Romania, have caused incalculable damage. In human terms, first of all, with the loss of dozens of human lives and thousands injured or missing and families made homeless. There has been material damage too, with considerable damage to infrastructures, with roads and bridges destroyed, fields of crops flooded and the destruction of centuries-old cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, and I feel sure that I speak on behalf of all my fellow Members, I wish to use this forum to praise the total commitment and the mobilisation of the emergency services, fire brigades, police, soldiers and volunteers. On the eve of the gloomy conclusions of the Johannesburg Summit, the European Union is already facing the consequences of climate change and of the failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">For me and for my country, the European Union means solidarity, both with the Member States, and with the candidate countries. The European Union must, therefore, bring into play all the mechanisms and financial means at its disposal to help the affected areas. Aid must be direct and immediate, because the victims will not be sympathetic to bureaucracy and administrative delays.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, therefore, to state my unequivocal support for establishing, in the short term, an exceptional budget line to deal with this type of disaster, redirecting Structural Funds that have already been allocated, bearing the new situation in mind, and for freeing up credits granted under the pre-accession programmes. In the medium term, I am also in favour of the Commission proposal to create a special assistance fund for natural, technological and environmental disasters with a value of no less than EUR one billion. This fund would enable us to provide a rapid response in the event of disasters in the broadest sense of the term. I suggest that the sums in this fund that are not spent during the current budget year be added to those of coming years, so as to strengthen it. There would consequently be a greater year-on-year ability to respond. Furthermore, the size of the freed-up funding should take account of not only the extent of the disaster, but also of the prosperity of the regions affected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That good may be that people feel closer, feel drawn together and that we are all pulling in the same direction. Cooperation experienced in a European context does more in hard times than endless lofty speeches and we have seen here – and my congratulations first and foremost to the Commission on how it has kicked into action – that the European Union, which is often perceived as inflexible, is keen to show how flexible it can be by earmarking Structural Fund resources, by paying out aid to farmers, by implementing rules for funds available from Europe, by applying a flexible aid regime, i.e. where funds are not channelled directly, and by being flexible in its competition requirements. And this sends out a good message, a message that, when it has to, Europe can get moving.</p>
<p class="contents">We have our work cut out for us. The Council and Parliament now need to hand out fast, solid aid. Fast aid because the dikes which have been inundated will not hold up forever. Help is needed. And solid aid because permanent help is needed and, may I say here loud and clear, that the proposed aid fund, which has our full and unwavering support, is clearly not designed to be a quick fix for a few months or a one-off incident. Anyone who has witnessed how two countries which, economically, are usually among the strongest in Europe, have received expressions of solidarity from countries which are not among the strongest will never again be able to refuse these regions help if disaster threatens in the future. I say that in the light of what we have done in the budget in previous years. Unfortunately, there was never enough money available to really be able to help. Basically, all we did was to raise hopes and then dash them again. This must not happen with the aid fund and we shall need to act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">We need, however, to address a number of issues which go beyond these emergency measures. We need to deal with these issues in the Committee on Budgets and we shall be looking here for close contact and close cooperation with the Commission and the Council in order to get things moving as quickly as possible. But we also need to take account in our calculations of experience in formulating policies in other areas. Satellite data on flood management need to be included in the framework research programme, as does seismic research, because we are not just talking water here, we are also talking earthquakes – think of the Azores. We need to think about how to impose mandatory specifications to ensure buildings are stable. We also need to think very carefully about straightening rivers and about flood plains. And urgent help is needed. In the medium term, we need to create a solid basis for future help from the European Union – including financial help – and take preventive measures across the whole of the political spectrum which concerns us. Only then will help be credible, because only then will people take us seriously and, even then, we must not promise more than we can deliver. I should like to thank everyone who has helped and I trust we shall pull together over the coming weeks and months in order to carry out the work in hand.</p>

I personally have cleaned up, evacuated and shovelled in Upper and Lower Austria, as have many of us here and thousands, literally thousands outside this House. Together we have witnessed the material need and mental anguish caused by this disaster, which has pushed people to the brink and wiped out houses, streets and businesses. Many only realised just how bad things were once the fire brigade, the army and the emergency services had left.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like on behalf of a great many people to thank the authorities, the communes, the Länder, the governments of the Member States, the European Union and the volunteers and, as the chairman of a social organisation, the <span class="italic">Österreichisches Hilfswerk</span>, which is one of the eight organisations distributing donor money, to thank the thousands, or rather hundreds of thousands of donors. Civil society has proven its worth and has come up trumps. But its job is not yet done. The Austrian Chancellor, Dr. Schüssel, estimated yesterday that 70% of the damage has been recorded and EUR 65 – 70 million paid out directly. The leader of the Austrian delegation, Ursula Stenzel, took the initiative of tabling a joint resolution by Austrian members, which has been included in the joint resolution by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need to define this disaster; it has already taken place, which is why the European Parliament is calling for emergency aid of EUR 1 billion for the flood area. We are calling for flexibility in the aid regulation, we are calling for Structural Fund resources to be reallocated, we are calling for the national cofinancing portion to be reduced, we are calling for national limits on aid to be lifted and we are calling for emergency aid to be paid out quickly; we want specific dates, not just promises.</p>
<p class="contents">May I close by thanking all the honourable Members for the tone of this debate. There has been no playing victims off against non-victims, north against south, Member States against candidate countries, budget figures against each other, projects against new plans. It is clear from the debate that we need to act because we are all in the same boat. It is a good example of political maturity and of a willingness to demonstrate that actions speak louder than words, to help ensure there are no delays, that action is taken in the short term and that a new approach is taken in the long term.</p>

<p class="contents">winter will soon be here and our citizens’ pleas to the European Union must not go unheeded.

They should, therefore, all be compensated equally and swiftly, and not be hindered by the excessive bureaucracy for which we are often known. What can we learn from this situation? Let us prove our effectiveness and usefulness; let us also fulfil our responsibilities by immediately implementing a concerted, coordinated and binding European policy with regard to land use planning. We must remain firm over the Kyoto requirements, whatever some may say. We can create a permanent aid Fund, but we must look to the future and work on long-term preventative measures. Commissioner, you spoke of 'political courage', but I would say to you that what this Parliament needs to demonstrate is 'joint political responsibility' in order to guarantee the safety of our citizens.

I am thinking of the eye-witness reports we have heard and also of the many expressions of sympathy and willingness to offer prompt assistance. I think it can be concluded that Parliament, the Commission and the Council are united in wanting to help the hundreds of thousands of people affected, and not only help them but help them quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">We are looking forward to the Commission’s presenting practical proposals. We think the Commission has acted well in this respect. The Presidency should do everything to ensure that the Council deals with the matter promptly and, judging by what I have now heard, I am certain that matters can also proceed very quickly here in Parliament. It is important to act speedily. As one MEP said, aid is twice as valuable when it is offered promptly. I am convinced that, both in the short and longer term, we can establish an effective tool for helping all the people affected. As I said in my introductory speech, the Foreign Ministers have given their support this weekend to our establishing a tool of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task now is one of reconstruction following the extensive damage but, as many MEPs have mentioned, we must not forget the work of prevention either, for the damage could have been less serious if we had been more far-sighted in the way in which we had dealt with European rivers.</p>
<p class="contents">A friend in need is a friend indeed, says an old proverb to be found in many languages. I think it important that the solidarity of which today’s debate has been an expression should also extend beyond the existing or present Member States to include the candidate countries which would, in that way, be given a signal that they too were being considered in the context of what we were working on. It is that spirit of community and solidarity with the new Member States which, later in the year too, we shall be using to carry through one of the most important decisions in the history of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this really was one of the European Parliament's finest hours.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no wish to speak at length; I merely wish to answer the questions addressed directly to me. The main question here is, how will the measures decided for farming now be implemented? The first measure decided was to use set-aside areas. This measure is up and running. These areas can already be used in the regions in question. The second measure decided was to provide grain for fodder from intervention stocks in Austria. This measure is also up and running. Applications are already being received from the Austrian authorities. The third and most comprehensive measure is to give priority to advance payments of 50% of the area premiums in the current budgetary year. Mr Goepel asked what the state of play is here. The decision has been taken and will be processed, the money will be allocated using the normal allocation procedures used for premiums. This is the quickest method. In other words, the sums in question are released by the executive in each Member State. May I add that this has since been somewhat extended and that these advance payments already total over EUR 900 million. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this too is highly significant.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission decided what help it could give in its executive capacity, what measures we could take directly, at its special meeting after the summer recess. There is financial aid for farmers, pre-accession aid and, most importantly of course, the Structural Funds. But we can also offer greater flexibility. On this point, I should like to stress that we decided, as far as tendering rules are concerned, to allow maximum flexibility in the regions affected, so that swift action can be taken. My colleague, Mr Monti, has made it perfectly clear that no objections under aid regulations will be filed against national aid to compensate up to 100% of the damage sustained by businesses and that this aid may even include loss of earnings or orders. I think this is a very important signal to the businesses affected in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question of setting up a fund to provide direct aid in the event of natural disasters, I am most grateful for the huge consensus in the House, a consensus which cuts across the party political divide and is in step with the Council. As you know, we have had no such instrument, no aid fund for natural disasters in the past. We need to set this fund up first. That means we need agreement and a special contract between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The Commission will be tabling a proposal on this in the next few weeks. We shall then have to create the corresponding legal basis, so that money from the fund can be disbursed. I have a direct request to make of the European Parliament and the Council here: please remember the devil is in the detail when you formulate this legal basis; bear in mind that we want to get the money to the regions affected quickly. We should give the regions affected a lump sum in aid and, instead of waiting for projects to be specifically formulated, we should declare the aid as such for the region.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear from the debate that the whole House agrees that we shall need aid of at least EUR 500 million to 1 000 million per annum. We need to come to an agreement with the Council here, because the fund will obviously have to be financed by the Member States, even if we want to provide aid this year without calling up new funds.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should also make it clear that aid from us is subsidiary aid. It is solidarity aid on the part of the European Union and we should not raise false hopes. I also understood from today's debate that the House agrees that the decisions in question, the regulations in question need to be passed post haste. This being so, we shall have to set ourselves an ambitious timetable so that the decisions needed to set up this emergency aid fund can be taken by the end of October.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your support.</p>

I am delighted that we have been able to show the human face of European politics. That applies not just to the disaster areas in Germany and Austria. I can assure you that it was highly prized in the Czech Republic. The speed with which we acted and the fact that we took it for granted that action was needed have left behind a far deeper impression than much we have done for the Czech Republic over recent years. To know that, in your hour of need, you are in the same boat as your neighbour and to see help given in a spirit of solidarity has answered the question raised by a lot of people in this country: why exactly do we want Europe and do we need it?</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to the European Parliament that, like the Commission and the Council, it has not wasted time worrying about distinctions between Member States and future Member States when it comes to aid from the new emergency reserve. We can choose our contracting partners, but we cannot choose our neighbours. If it rains cats and dogs in Austria and Saxony and in the Czech Republic, which is in between the two, we cannot say we shall help Austria and we shall help Saxony, but we shall not help the Czech Republic. And people in Prague noticed that this is the general view. I was there on Thursday. It seems to me – and I say this in all caution – that the flood has also washed away a number of recent political problems between the countries affected.</p>

It is telling that several Commissioners wanted to be present throughout this debate as we have worked together, and each of us, in their own sector, must contribute to a swift, effective response.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I would like to say to Mr Ferber and Mr Markov that we are really going to use all the margins for flexibility available to us on the cofinancing rate, invitations to tender and State aid. What applies to the Structural Funds for EU Member States also applies to pre-accession instruments for the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as Mr Verheugen has already said. I would reply to Mrs Krehl that we have no intention of excluding these two candidate countries from our solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier, Mrs Schroeder spoke of the villages or regions bordering her home town of Dresden. I personally will not forget the sight of the town of Wiesenstein, which profoundly affected me. This small town had only just been rebuilt and restored after the fall of the Berlin wall, and, tragically, it has now been destroyed. We must not forget that aspect, in addition to the large towns concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to respond to Mr Virrankoski, who mentioned the Fund’s methodology. Very shortly, on 18 September, we shall present a proposal: speed, effectiveness and fairness for the distribution methods of this new Fund. I am currently working on criteria that will make it possible to characterise a major disaster. A major natural disaster, in my opinion, is a disaster that seriously affects a significant proportion of the population in one or more regions, in one or more States. It is also a disaster that severely compromises the economy of that region, group of regions, State or group of States. That is clearly the case of the floods that have recently affected many regions and four States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this spirit that we are working. Mrs Berger has mentioned the regions that do not fall within the scope of objective 1 or objective 2. The point of this exceptional aid Fund that we are creating together is that it will be able to fund regions outside the objective 1 and 2 areas that have been affected or which could be affected in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to say to Mr Swoboda and Mrs Echerer and others who have spoken about sustainable development, as I myself did in my first speech on prevention, that there is no European competence for land use planning. Town and country planning falls within the competence of local authorities, regions, or even the Member States. The Commission is not claiming new competences, either now or within the scope of the Convention. We do, however, have a responsibility. I am consciously using this word in the same way as the expression 'political courage'. Our responsibility is to ensure, as in the case of the credits managed within the framework of the Structural Funds, that the credits we are going to allocate within the framework of the total appropriations under this Fund, are used in the field, pursuant to the directives on the environment, with the requirement for sustainable development and perhaps with an additional requirement from now on, concerning prevention. This may be the case of the credits allocated within the scope of Agenda 2000-2006. I promise you that in the proposals I shall make on behalf of the Commission for future regional policy after 2006, the emphasis will be placed on this obligation to take account, with regard to prevention, of the risk of natural and ecological disasters for the future programming documents in each of the regions that are to receive credits.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the commitment I am giving. In conclusion, as Mr Karas said earlier, I have been struck by the tremendous dignity and high quality of this debate. That is to be expected and basically demonstrates the action, rapid reaction and solidarity that must exist within the European Union and the neighbouring candidate countries – one big family facing their misfortune together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
