<p class="contents">I want to say at the outset that I am very grateful for this opportunity of addressing you tonight on the subject of passenger name records. My friend and colleague, Mr Bolkestein, spoke to you yesterday about the case for a so-called adequacy finding on this issue. I want to underline once again the fact that the Commission will carefully consider the points of view expressed by Members in the debate in March, when my colleague also spoke, before making its final decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue the House knows we will have to consider is the question of the onward transfer of passenger name records data by US customs. As Commissioner Bolkestein made clear yesterday in the plenary, these transfers are a matter of concern to us. Commissioner Bolkestein and I have been in contact with Secretary Ridge of the Homeland Security Department on the kind of assurances that we want on the circumstances in which such transfers would take place. I spoke to Secretary Ridge myself yesterday evening. We look forward to studying his comments, and I can assure the House that his response to our questions will form an important part of our ultimate college decision on an adequacy finding.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my task this evening to present the case for the other part of the package, namely the international agreement we have negotiated with the United States. It would provide a sound legal basis for allowing airlines to transfer passenger data to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start by setting out briefly the background to this issue. None of us will ever forget the horrific attacks on the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001. The United States was profoundly shocked by them. In fact we were all shocked by those attacks. In Europe we have suffered from terrorist attacks for decades – most recently the appalling bombing of passenger trains in Spain last month. We stand, I hope, shoulder to shoulder with America in the fight against terrorism and I repeat that in my judgment if we had suffered anything like the attacks on the Twin Towers, we perhaps might have an even greater appreciation of how great US concern is over air transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Since those attacks the US authorities have taken a whole range of measures to provide their citizens with greater security. The requirement for the transfer of PNR data is one of these. We immediately saw a conflict between the requirements of the US legislation and our own data protection legislation. European airlines were faced with a dreadful dilemma: either to comply with the PNR requirement and risk being taken to court by their national data protection authorities, or not to comply, which would have triggered intrusive extra searches of their passengers. This would have resulted in enormous delays and a potentially serious loss of business for EU airlines to US airlines, which were supplying the required data.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission had a responsibility to do what it could to help our airlines and their passengers out of this situation. In the short term we made an arrangement with the US which provided for assurances on how the data would be used. This gave some comfort to the airlines, but we recognised that it did not provide a sound legal footing on which to proceed. That is why we have spent the last 15 months negotiating with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as possible, we wanted to uphold the concerns of our citizens for their privacy to be protected. The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs understandably had a long list of objectives that it wanted us to secure. In the real world though, we were never going to be able to secure everything they would have wished. All negotiation involves compromises and, on this occasion, we had to face the fact that the US was already obtaining the data it wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">As outlined in the Commission communication of December 2003, the bilateral international agreement with the US that we are debating today is a necessary element in the framework that the Commission is seeking to put in place both for legal and for political reasons. Firstly, there is a legal reason related to the data protection directive. Determining that there is adequate protection for personal data at the recipient's end is part of what a data controller needs to do before transferring data to a third country. In addition, the controller – in this case the airline – needs a legitimate reason for transferring the data, such as being required to do so by law. However, by law we mean Community law or Member State law. An obligation imposed by a third country cannot automatically justify processing of data within the Community. This international agreement, which will become part of the Community legal framework, creates such a requirement, but subject to one very important condition: the existence of adequate data protection in the recipient country, namely the United States. It is important to underline here that this agreement does not take for granted the existence of such adequate protection in the United States. The obligation on airlines is applicable only if an adequacy finding has been made, and for as long as it remains in force. On 31 March the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which it disagrees with the Commission that the current US undertakings represent adequate protection, and the College will decide in due course how to proceed. However, whatever the Commission decides, this part of the agreement will only be applicable if there is an adequacy finding. Therefore, there is no reason for Parliament to reject the entire agreement on this basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a legal reason for this international agreement, linked to international law. The European Commission took the position of principle that US law enforcement authorities could only get access to databases situated in the Community if they had been explicitly allowed to do so. Through this agreement the Community grants this permission, subject to a double condition. First, that there is adequate data protection in the US. Second, that a 'push' system is not yet in place. I would make it clear that the Commission shares Parliament's view that 'push' should replace the current 'pull' as soon as possible and the date requested by Parliament – namely 1 July – has been duly noted. We are doing our best to put in place the conditions that will make 'push' possible very soon. However, since the aim is to provide legal certainty today, we need to address this issue now and then work to change it as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">From a more political point of view, this agreement fulfils four additional important objectives. First, it ensures the future assistance of the US Government on the basis of reciprocity in ensuring that airlines transfer PNR data to Community authorities if the Community or any of its Member States were to introduce such a system.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, it also contains a statement that the US Bureau of Customs and Border Protection is implementing the undertakings that the adequacy finding is based upon, which is, as the House recognises, an important international commitment on the part of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the agreement also enshrines the commitment to undertake joint reviews on matters relating to the agreement. Last, but not least, the agreement protects travellers against unlawful discrimination on the basis of nationality and country of residence.</p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding, allow me to refer briefly to the report that has been submitted, which highlights two legal problems. The first is procedural. The rapporteur considers that Parliament should have been asked to give its full assent rather than just being consulted. My reply would be, as Commissioner Bolkestein explained yesterday, that <span class="italic">nothing</span> in this agreement entails amendment to the data protection directive, which is the condition established by Article 300 of the Treaty for the assent procedure to apply. There is a second concern highlighted in the report, which stipulates that: 'The real scope of the international agreement will evolve at the discretion of the US administration without any legally binding participation from the European Union side'. Let me be clear that the essential link between the three elements of the package – international agreement, adequacy finding and US undertakings – is there to ensure coherence between them. No adequacy finding without undertakings; no legal effect on airlines as regards the agreement without an adequacy finding. So any unilateral change to the US undertakings that would lead to non-compliance with the principles of adequacy would also lead to a suspension of the adequacy finding. Simultaneously, it would also lead to the non-application of the two key clauses of the international agreement, the obligation on airlines to provide the data and the authorisation to the US to pull without any need to modify or revoke the international agreement. This crucial safety valve is built into the agreement to prevent precisely what the report fears, i.e. the European Union side being forced to accept any unilateral change to the US requirements for receiving passenger name records.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to urge Members to support the adoption of this agreement, despite their misgivings about the adequacy finding. For the reasons I have explained, this would not necessarily be incompatible with the position Parliament has taken on the adequacy finding. The resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 31 March calls for a wider international agreement incorporating a series of data protection principles. I believe that such an agreement is beyond what is achievable today. That is why I would ask Parliament to back this agreement, not because it is perfect but because it is a great deal better for our airlines to operate under legal certainty and it is a great deal better for passengers to have much improved safeguards than the legal void that would result from a collapse of a package which we have worked so long and hard to negotiate.</p>
<p class="contents">I apologise for speaking at such length, but I know this is an issue of considerable importance to Parliament and I wanted to try to deal with the main issues that have been raised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all agreed that we have to combat terrorists, but that must not be allowed to become a licence for things that we ultimately cannot justify. I have to say to you, Commissioner, you have not convinced me this evening. First of all, you said that the transfer by the customs bureau is a matter of concern to you. At the moment the Commission, in recital 20 of the decision, refers to passing on to other government bodies, including foreign government bodies. A few days ago we heard for the first time that it is a matter of concern to you how this is organised. A few months ago you asked Parliament for an adequacy finding.<span class="italic"> </span>Meanwhile, both Mr Bolkestein and yourself have informed us that there is no adequacy finding as yet in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Then the question of the agreement itself. Parliament has asked for a real international agreement. Parliament has asked for non-discrimination in the use of the data for EU citizens. Parliament has asked for equivalence in the United States and efficient, independent opportunities to correct incorrect data and a clear judicial process for EU citizens who get into difficulties. You said that there will be reciprocity. Well, Commissioner, Article 6 of the agreement states that where feasible and on the basis of strict reciprocity, the cooperation of airlines falling under its jurisdiction will be actively promoted. That is not reciprocity. Article 1 states what we have to do. The CBP gets electronic access to the PNR data in the reservation and departure systems of airlines based on the territory of the Member States of the European Community. Such as is strictly in accordance with the decision and as long as the decision remains in force. This means that we are legalising something that we wanted to avoid all this time and that is the reason for asking Parliament now for a real agreement, that has the consent of Parliament. You say this is not necessary, because the legal basis that the Council has chosen is Directive 95/46/EC and this agreement would not change the content of the Directive. How can you say that now when Article 2 of the agreement provides that everything will be handled in accordance with the laws of the United States? In my view, this means we are introducing the laws of the United States here. This is not a genuine agreement. This is an agreement about which Mr Bolkestein says that many matters have still not been resolved. I have not mentioned the connection between this agreement and CAPS II, but the undertakings to that also state that this agreement will shortly also be linked to the new, advanced CAPS II system in the United States. The US Congress has said that this is no good and has sent it back to the competent bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">To cut a long story short, the way this deal has come about is not right. Mr Bolkestein promised in September that Parliament would be treated as a full partner. Unfortunately, he has not kept this promise. Indeed it is much worse than that, the European Commission and the Council have deliberately tried to sidetrack Parliament. Under the Treaty, Parliament was required to give its consent, but you have chosen not to do that. That was also the reason why I argued the case in Parliament and got President Cox to recommend through the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that an appeal be made on the grounds of Article 300, paragraph 6, of the Treaty to have this agreement tested by the European Court of Justice. That is the only way left to us to do something about this agreement and to adequately protect our citizens. At the moment they are not adequately protected. I think that is extremely regrettable. I would have liked to see you withdraw the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you that terrorism is appalling, but just to use all that as a licence to ride roughshod over our laws and give the Americans access to our data without legal protection, because the American Constitution and the Privacy Act<span class="italic"> </span>do not apply to European citizens, is going too far. I beg you therefore once again to withdraw this agreement and to come to Parliament with a real agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not believe we can contribute anything new to the fundamental issue, because our positions throughout all these debates have been made sufficiently clear. In the committee I chair, we have had the opportunity to hear the experts. Mr Bolkestein, the Commissioners involved and also the bodies directly affected, such as the air carriers, have appeared on repeated occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is our final political pronouncement on the issue during this legislature. Like my group, I believe it would be irresponsible on our part to leave without resolving a blatant case of legal vacuum and legal uncertainty which arises every time that, when travelling to the United States, airlines transmit data on their passengers to the United States authorities, without any type of guarantee or legal basis to protect the treatment and use of that data. This has now been happening for a year. This is the legal framework we are debating today, with all its defects and the criticisms we have made.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, nobody can deny that combating terrorism is an absolute priority today and that at the moment, when European society, living in fear of those people who threaten their security and stability, would not understand the absence of cooperation between those countries which are facing up to terrorism. The European Union and the United States share this common objective and it is fundamental, and absolutely urgent and necessary, that we cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I do not see this as giving the United States <span class="italic">carte blanche</span>, as some would have us believe. It is the solution to a real problem which has affected us since transmissions began more than a year ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, Mr President, also to take this opportunity to say that I hope the new Socialist government in Spain – led by Mr Zapatero – defends this agreement in the Council, because I am convinced that the Spanish citizens would prefer to give their personal data to those who need it for these purposes or can obtain it for security reasons, as the United States do, before the people responsible for the massacre on 11 March can carry out another brutal attack, whether it be in my country or in any part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, we are going to vote against the report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Contrary to what the Commission claims, the draft agreement that has been put to us is radically different from the data protection directive and therefore from Article 286 of the EC Treaty. In fact, whilst Article 7 of the Directive gives Member States the power to control the processing of personal data for security reasons, the Community takes this competence away from Member States in the draft agreement to give it to a foreign authority. The draft provides for European airlines to be obliged to process European passenger data as requested by the United States Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Customs and Border Protection in line with United States legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Pursuant to Article 300 of the Treaty, this change to the directive, which the Commission continues to deny, would have entailed Parliament – the colegislator of the directive – giving its assent, as Commissioner Bolkestein had already announced to the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on 9 September 2003, which did not happen. What is needed, therefore, is a truly international treaty that gives a legal basis to amending the directive and transferring sovereignty as is desired.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the draft violates one of the fundamental rights of European citizens, that of confidentiality of personal data, laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Not least, this law provides for access to information that has been collected and for it to be corrected, which is not guaranteed in the draft agreement. From a practical point of view, this aspect is important since data that are collected for commercial purposes, and neither checked nor filtered by a responsible authority, may be inaccurate or even deliberately incorrect. These discrepancies – which would not arise if data were intentionally transferred for security purposes – could cause serious inconvenience and actually harm our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary that the agreement text is changed and that, in any case, recourse is made to the Court of Justice to obtain an opinion.</p>

It is perfectly possible to be both tough on terrorism and true to the Treaties that we have signed on individual freedoms such as privacy. This matter has taken a sorry course. Commission Bolkestein told us on 9 September that progress on the issues had been disappointing. Commissioner Patten has told us tonight that data transfers remain a matter of concern for the Commission. The fact is that there is no real agreement between the European Union and the United States on the scope of data required, on purpose limitation, on data storage periods or on the transfer of data to third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In proposing this amendment, the College of Commissioners should be ashamed of itself. Its proposals would do justice to the authors of the United Kingdom's Official Secrets Act of 1911.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten, you normally address this House in an open style, almost ad-lib. That is something we welcome. Tonight you read carefully from your script; dare I say with your lips moving faster than those of a policeman giving corrupt evidence. You constructed a quasi-legal case that is no more stable than a house of cards. You can hardly be surprised that you face criticism from all sides of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner told us there is no reason for Parliament to reject the entire agreement. The fact is that we are not even being offered the chance to do so. Despite Commissioner Bolkestein's assurance on 9 September that the procedure would involve the European Parliament's assent, as required by Article 300 of the Treaty, neither this Parliament nor national parliaments are being given the chance to comment on this.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a disgraceful demonstration of Europe's democratic deficit. We therefore call on the Commission to withdraw this agreement and to replace it with a proper international agreement. Failing that we will have to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice.</p>

Is it a good agreement and did the Commission have the authority to conclude this agreement? My group want a legal opinion on this. The Commission really cannot be against that, even if they are convinced that everything is OK.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten just said that the agreement is better than nothing. I do not agree with that. The Commission has got a number of restrictions through, but the agreement still covers too many data and they are kept for a ridiculously long time. Privacy is not sacrosanct, but infringements must be proportionate. I think, therefore, that we must take the negotiations with the United States further. If the United States does not want to do that, then we simply do not give them those data. Of course that will mean that the US will ask the passengers for that information at the airports, but then citizens will see immediately how much information we are talking about and I think that in this way you will organise resistance on another front. I think that is very important. It is a matter of having the political will to ensure that our own European laws are complied with. I think it is the duty of the Commission to make sure that these are monitored.</p>

The draft agreement is not only contrary to the directive but also to the fundamental principles of the European Union. Even if it were a case of a Member State, it would be illegal to systematically use data collected for commercial purposes for surveillance use. That is the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, we need to combat terrorism and clearly we need to do so with rules that respect the fundamental principles of our European Union. What is untrue is that the suspension of respect for the law, which has been going on for more than 13 months, has in some way been forced upon our airlines. This is not the case, since this measure applies to all airlines, including US airlines when the reservation is made in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">You have therefore decided to adopt a weak and losing position. The rules cannot be reformed and reforms are not carried out when there is no respect for the procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will succeed only if we build stronger partnerships within the European Union and with such partners as the United States. Only, too, will we succeed if we implement all these strategies in an effective way, by which I mean that we can expect what we decide on to actually happen. The fact is that terrorists have no fear of the debates we hold in this House; nor have they any fear of regulations and directives; the only thing they fear is effective action. That is why we need to act, and it is incumbent upon us to act – including in matters related to the forwarding of flight details. Of course certain safeguards are needed when forwarding people's personal details; of course the European Union's data protection rules must be adhered to. We have to concede, though, that the data in question are being forwarded for the purposes of preventing terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are in favour of concluding the agreement with the USA on the basis of the points negotiated with the Commission, for we will thereby finally be putting an end to the lack of regulation, opening the way not only to the exchange of data, but also and above all to further improvements and further negotiations. For this reason, too, we object to Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's report, which, on the basis solely of ideologically exaggerated demands, rejects the agreement, thereby making anti-terrorist cooperation impossible by depriving it of any legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens, whom we represent and by whom we are elected, do not expect us to spend our time here in endless debate; what they expect of us is that we take action jointly with those who have kept their heads. The war on terrorism must be our first priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is what we are trying to defend, not the work of the terrorists. It is absurd to express that suspicion. That is not the problem. The problem, Mr President, is that Parliament has been facing an intolerable situation with regard to the decisions the Commission has been taking in this field. First it announced a type of agreement on which we could express no opinion, then it told us that there would be an international agreement and it turns out that this international agreement is being reached without the obligation to consult Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be no surprise that we are asking for the same prerogatives for this House as are enjoyed by the United States Congress in this field. We in plenary and in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have decided to consult the Court of Justice on the international agreement because we have doubts about the form and the content of what the Commission has done.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike Mr Hernández Mollar, I do not believe that a Spanish citizen prefers to face a situation in which they have no defence when they are not allowed to enter the United States because they are under an unfounded suspicion, of terrorism for example. In such circumstances, they will have nowhere to turn to in such a serious situation which may threaten their job, for example. I do not believe they will be less protected without the system. I do not believe that is the case. What we are asking the Commission is that it ensure that the rules are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to ask a question. Mr Patten has said in passing that the United States already received the information it wanted.

I apologise for speaking for so long at the beginning of this debate, but I would just like to respond to one point.</p>
<p class="contents">I am now drawing to the end of a rather excessively long political career and I have got a pretty thick skin. But when somebody accuses me of behaving like the policeman presenting corrupt evidence, I have to say that I regard that as an attack on my honesty and my honour. I hope the honourable Member will think pretty hard about what he said. I would like to say this to the honourable Member: what if there is no agreement? What if we wait for six months until we get an opinion? We have little doubt about what an opinion would be from the European Court of Justice. What if?</p>
<p class="contents">I will make one simple point. Taking into account the reservations that I expressed earlier about onward transfer, if the proposed package of an adequacy finding and an international agreement is suspended, it is undoubtedly the case that some data protection authorities will have very little choice but to start ordering airlines to suspend data transfers with all the consequences for airlines and passengers that this would provoke. When that happens, who will be blamed? You will not see the honourable Member and some others for a puff of dust! Everybody <span class="italic">else</span> will get the blame; everybody else will be blamed for the uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this in all conscience: we have thought about these issues extremely carefully. Nobody should think we have blazed into this with no regard for civil liberties. I happen to think that what we are proposing is much better than what we would have if we did not put these arrangements in place, and that we would have greater protection for civil liberties than would otherwise be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that when the Parliament votes on this it will not do so on the basis that the honourable Member and everybody else is moral, honest and right, and the rest of us are corrupt and dishonourable. I hope Parliament will recognise that we have tried to provide some legal certainty and that even if there is a disagreement, we have tried to behave in a way which is honourable and sensible and in a way which will be more favourable and more sensible for airlines and for passengers in the months and years ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
