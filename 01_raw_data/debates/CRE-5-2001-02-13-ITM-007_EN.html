We have now completed the process of reconciliation and we have a text for final approval.</p>
<p class="contents">The text before us meets many of Parliament's demands at first and second reading. We have the precautionary principle reaffirmed. We have tighter risk assessment of all GMO releases. We have schemes for monitoring traceability that will ensure continuous assessment of all releases throughout the ten-year life of this time-limitation for consents. We have achieved the phasing out of all harmful, antibiotic-resistant marker genes. We have a clear timetable. We have a clear and transparent process and a clear timetable for the approvals which ensure the mandatory consultation of the public which guarantees public registers of locations of GMOs grown and used.</p>
<p class="contents">Steps have also been taken on the issues of liability, traceability and labelling. Parliament can only be satisfied on those issues, however, when we see the additional legislation and flanking measures which I understand are now in preparation within the Commission. In short, we have in front of us today for our approval the toughest GMO legislation in the world, so tough, in fact, that some natural foods in common use today would not pass through this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Should we approve this legislation tomorrow it would mean the beginning of the end of the present informal 'moratorium' on GMO commercial approvals. Certain Members of the Council have, however, already made it clear that they will scrutinise individual applications for approval and may not allow commercialisation until legislation on traceability and labelling is in place. I welcome this. This is a final safeguard to the recommencement of an approval process which has been long awaited but it can be no reason for opposing the final approval of the new 90/220 legislation we have in front of us now. This legislation is an essential building block and foundation for the success of those measures still to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore commend this important legislation to the House. It is essential to ensure the safe and proper use of GMO products within the European Union. It is essential to ensure the building of public confidence in these products, it is essential to ensure that this new technology, which promises so much, will in the end deliver what we are seeking from it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to do so again today, and it is meant as more than just lip service. Mr Bowe has done a magnificent job and brought a very complicated procedure to a close. I should also like to thank you, Commissioner Wallström and the Chairman of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Ingo Friedrich. Both put a great deal of effort into finding an agreement; unfortunately, the same cannot be said of everyone else involved in the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We have brokered a good compromise. The new regulation gives Europe a high standard of health, consumer and environmental protection. The disputed antibiotic-resistant marker genes will be banned in Europe in the future. Potential environmental dangers must be closely monitored. Labelling of GMOs has been improved, although we expect further action by the Commission on this. We have not passed a regulation preventing the application of green biotechnology and the PPE-DE Group welcomes that. The PPE-DE Group is in favour of green biotechnology, provided that care is taken to ensure that rules to protect the environment and human health are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday scientists and researchers from all over the world announced that they had completely decoded the human genome. The euphoria which this announcement triggered throughout the world contrasts strangely with the emphatic rejection triggered by the release of genetically-modified plants, especially in Europe. I think that neither euphoria at the human genome project nor total rejection of genetically-modified plants is called for. In both areas there are huge opportunities, but there also risks which must be contained by suitable legislation. The application of genetics to medicine is by no means risk-free; there have already been deaths during research into gene therapy in the USA because the rules were not applied properly. The so-called reproductive cloning of human beings is no longer a chimera and is being seriously pursued by a number of scientists, as we have again seen over the last few days. The artificial distinction between clones of human embryos for stem cell research and so-called reproductive clones will become blurred in the long term and I believe that the first cloned baby will probably be born before the promised relief for patients with Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as red genetic engineering is by no means all opportunity, green genetic engineering is by no means all risk. There is a realistic chance that genetically-modified plants will allow us to make huge progress with renewable primary products. Specifically modified plants will perhaps soon allow cheaper and safer drugs to be manufactured. We should therefore make use of the opportunities in both areas and limit the dangers with suitable legislation. Developments in the release of genetically-modified plants from research into the human genome – for which we have practically no rules in Europe – will result, once the preliminary report is accepted, in a suitable set of rules for all the Member States in the European Union, which is why we should adopt this motion. The PPE-DE Group will be voting in favour of the Bowe report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone who has watched the progress made, step by step, towards this goal, as I have, cannot fail to agree that we are providing the European Union with legislation on genetically modified organisms which, in addition to improving upon the previous legislation, also places us at the forefront on an international level. Just one example is the procedures for granting authorisations, particularly in terms of transparency and accessibility to the public, which is an essential condition for the necessary research trials to be able to proceed in a favourable climate. Further examples are the assessment and monitoring of the cumulative effects on the environment, and the phasing out<span class="bold"> </span>of antibiotic-resistant marker genes.</p>
<p class="contents">The lion's share of the praise for this progress must certainly go to our rapporteur, Mr David Bowe, who has succeeded in combining decisiveness with flexibility. It is certainly the fault of the Commission, rather than Mr Bowe, if we are still labouring under the burden of being unable, at present, to adopt flanking legislation on the tracing and labelling of GMOs and GMO derivatives placed on the market and thereby present the consumer with a complete framework of certainties.</p>
<p class="contents">The undertaking, confirmed yesterday in a letter from the Commission to the Members of the parliamentary delegation, is important in political terms but does not entirely make up for the delays in preparing a clear, well-defined proposal. For these reasons, I am convinced that we should endorse the conclusions of the conciliation procedure, but with one explicit reservation: the moratorium on commercial approvals must remain in place until the gap has been filled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The public register was a fundamental and central cause for concern to us Greens. Monitoring is included, as is the testing of long-term effects. We expressly welcome all this. However, we shall abstain – and with good cause – because the main points of the directive have not been clarified. There is unholy confusion in the area of genetic engineering at European level and no steps have been taken to label derivatives and GMOs and guarantee their traceability. We have not clarified the question of exports of GMOs to non Member States. I think that we have a moral responsibility to apply the same standards to third countries here as we do to ourselves and, more importantly, we have not clarified liability as a central factor.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Commission is to make proposals here, it is true, but we do not know what they are. I rather feel that we are buying a pig in a poke. The BSE crisis should be a lesson and a reminder to us. It is just not on, expecting the taxpayer to stump up for the damage and passing the risks onto society, while the genetic engineering companies only get the profits. Which is why I do not expect any more GMO consents to be granted until legislation has been passed on liability. So far, all we have is a declaration of intent; we do not have corporate liability and it is just not on, insisting that anyone who wants to register a car must produce an insurance certificate, while someone producing dangerous organisms, some of the long-term consequences, risks and dangers of which are still unknown factors, need not.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore no reason for Member States such as Germany and France to lift their <span class="italic">de facto</span> moratoria. I think we have a huge crisis of confidence in consumer protection and unless derivatives are labelled, in other words, unless there is transparency and liability and responsibility can be taken …</p>

This position is not changed by the clear improvements due to Directive 90/220 and which we are now discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">In the conciliation, it was, in particular, we in the Group of the European United Left, together with the Greens, who fought for the improvements which have now in fact been made, for example the gradual elimination of antibiotic-resistant markers, greater transparency and better risk assessments. We have also achieved at least a half victory when it comes to public registers of GMOs, but it is still very unclear whether the Member States really see themselves as being obliged to report publicly on all GMOs cultivated for commercial purposes. Clarification from the Council of Ministers and the Commission is needed on this matter. It is not advisable to adopt laws on matters about which, right from the beginning, there are different interpretations. We have still not seen the new rules promised to us by the Commission and required for labelling, traceability and accountability. Until we know what they look like and until they have been fully implemented, we cannot contemplate lifting the moratorium. Nor do we believe that, when the moratorium is lifted, it should be possible for any Member State to be forced to cultivate genetically modified crops. We consider the strategy devised by the Commission whereby new crops are to be approved before these rules are fully in place to be objectionable and contrary to the precautionary principle. It is also significant that there is a desire here to pre-empt the reading in Parliament and in the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">There is now no demand for genetically modified food in the European Union. More and more parts of the world are abandoning GM crops. There are major differences of opinion between researchers about the risks involved in GM crops. This applies both to the risk of contaminating other species and to possible effects on human health. To insist, in this situation, upon the cultivation of more GM crops for commercial purposes would be foolhardy and lead to a very great deal of opposition. Recent scandals and problems involving food policy ought to have taught us to proceed carefully. The interests of consumers and the precautionary principle must be allowed to take precedence over the commercial interests of a few large companies.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to retain the moratorium on commercial cultivation. There is a risk that the revision of this directive may be taken by the Commission as a pretext for approving new GM crops for cultivation. That is not something to which <span class="italic">we</span> can be a party. In spite of the fact that, in the conciliation, our group has had an important role to play in making these rules as tough as possible, we cannot vote in favour of the final result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Byrne's White Paper on food safety sets the ground rules and parameters within which the practical application of genetic research impacts on public health and the environment, and I have no doubt the vigilance of Parliament is a further safeguard.</p>
<p class="contents">While I have always favoured the application of safe and tested genetic research to agriculture, equally its practical application in future must be tempered by inevitable changes to agricultural practices resulting from the unrelated but nonetheless devastating consequences for farmers and consumers resulting from BSE. The vigilance we are rightly demonstrating on the release of genetically modified organisms on the environment and food safety must be intensified with regard to research in the sensitive and ethical area of gene technology and its impact and implications for mankind.</p>

<p class="contents">It has taken three years – too many – from when Commissioner Santer, urged by Emma Bonino and Ritt Bjerregaard, the then Commissioners for Consumer Policy and the Environment, presented the proposal to amend the old Directive 90/220/EEC, a proposal which has resulted in the text we are debating today and upon which we are going to vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to vote in favour of the motion, for we feel that this proposal for a directive guarantees a rigorous legal framework for GMO authorisation, protecting consumers, economic operators and research scientists. The proposal includes the major elements of innovation, environmental risk assessment and risk monitoring.<span class="bold"> </span>The new legislation also contains the precautionary principle, the rigid, ideological application of which, all too often proposed to us, would have the opposite effect to that desired, of paralysing not only research and innovation in the agri-foods sector but even commonly accepted aspects of our way of life, as the Italian Minister for Health, Umberto Veronesi, who is first and foremost a scientist, has pointed out in the last few days.</p>
<p class="contents">Improvements have been made in the areas of labelling and traceability, and a public information mechanism has been provided for. On a more general note, it is my opinion that this directive represents a step forward in renouncing a prohibitionist approach to scientific progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I have already pointed out on numerous occasions in earlier debates, we must pay particular attention to the ethical aspects of this sensitive issue. Genetic modification of organisms constitutes interference with the characteristic properties of these organisms. Given my belief that all these organisms were created by God, I recommend that we proceed with great caution. We need to reflect on the ethical implications of the new developments in this sector. Consideration of the ethical issues surrounding human genetics demonstrates that biotechnology can have far-reaching consequences. Clear boundaries are essential in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the lion’s share of the amendments were included in the Council and Parliament joint text in the end. It is to be welcomed that the environmental aspects now fall within the scope of the directive. It is also important that the antibiotic-resistant markers are to be eliminated in the fullness of time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council should approve the Cartagena Protocol without delay. It is important for exports to third countries to be carried out in a proper manner. The argument that the development of genetically modified organisms will help to solve the world food problem should actually be put into practice. The stories about the so-called terminator gene, which is said to prevent children from growing, are very disturbing. It is my hope that abuses and incorrect practices can be prevented through effective observance of the protocol.</p>

We largely have Mr Bowe to thank for this. The rapporteur has done a fantastic job. In this connection, I want to congratulate him on the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us just remember that genetic engineering provides humanity with new, unguessed at opportunities. Just as always in the past, however, new knowledge also entails new risks and increased responsibility. It is important that we be aware of the risks and accept our responsibility. This applies both to environmental issues and to ethical considerations. At the same time, it is important to make it clear that, when it comes to improving people’s health and guaranteeing sustainable production of more food for a growing world population, we must not reject any form of science. Instead, we must make use of science. I would therefore simply urge that we make our decision in accordance with the proposal before us today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is because we are told that the implementation of this authorisation procedure, despite the fact that it is flawed, must be approved and we are also led to understand that the moratorium on authorisations, which was adopted by the Member State governments in June 1999, will be lifted pending the further information needed.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, we believe that it would be much wiser for Parliament to wait for the actual implementation of all the additional guarantees that the Commission is promising for tomorrow, such as a future text on the liability and requirement for insurance by those who release GMOs – I stress this point – or even a future improvement of the provisions on labelling and traceability. On the other hand, if we approve the authorisation procedure today, there is a considerable risk that we will have been duped, if, tomorrow, we find that the moratorium is lifted on the sly – something that the Commission would love to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
