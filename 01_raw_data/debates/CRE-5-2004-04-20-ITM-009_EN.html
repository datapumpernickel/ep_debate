<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wynn (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, when I first came in and looked around I thought people were actually here for this debate, but then I suddenly realised that former Commissioner Barnier was about to make his speech!</p>
<p class="contents">Members have in front of them a report not just from the Committee on Budgets, but one that has attempted to take on board the opinions of the other committees. In doing so, we have tried to include at least three or four priorities which they consider to be paramount priorities, and then ask the Commission and the Council, in paragraph 31, to at least look at all the Annexes to get a feel for what the other committees are trying to do. I say that because I have had a letter from one of my fellow chairmen actually complaining about this procedure, but we thought it was a fair way of proceeding and one that would give everyone a chance to have their say.</p>
<p class="contents">The thrust of the report is not to make concrete proposals, but to lay down guidelines for the next Parliament. The idea is that we in the present Parliament should not do anything definitive, but should at least give an opinion how we think negotiations should proceed in the next Parliament. My job as rapporteur for this report, rather than as chairman, is to defend the position of the Committee on Budgets. As a result, I am not here to recommend acceptance of any of the 22 amendments that we have before us, although I feel Amendments Nos 3 and 5 do help in the wording. I will leave such decisions to my political group.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fascinated by the amendments from my British Conservative colleagues in the name of Mr Bradbourn and others, especially Amendments Nos 17, 18 and 19. Amendments Nos 17 and 18 ask that there be a maximum of 1% GNI for the Community budget, and Amendment No 19 is about renationalisation of the structural funds. As a British Labour Member I very much welcome the approach of my Conservative colleagues, who are now endorsing Gordon Brown's proposals. I am sure this will please him!</p>
<p class="contents">I am still confused about Amendments Nos 20 and 21, but will speak to Mr Bradbourn about those later. However, whilst I may welcome them as a British Labour Member, I am here not as a British Labour Member but as a rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets, and cannot support them. As I said, Amendments Nos 17 and 18 asked for a maximum 1% GNI for own resources. My preference is for the existing paragraph 17, which states that we should evaluate our political priorities, then their needs, and only then should Parliament decide on what the level of own resources should be.</p>
<p class="contents">When President Prodi first presented the Commission's proposals I made the point that between 1988 and 2002, under the existing financial perspective, the amount of payments had indeed averaged out at 1% of GNP. Of course, if the average is 1% there will have been times when that 1% was exceeded. If you look at paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 of the report, it actually says that we should be looking at the priorities and then deciding what that average overall should be.</p>
<p class="contents">It could well be that after making the evaluation and looking at the political priorities we end up with a figure of 1% of GNI. Paragraph 19 would seem to indicate a higher figure, but looking at this sensibly and pragmatically, we could get any figure and 1% cannot be ruled out. However, that is a decision not for this Parliament, but for the new one, as is the timeframe. The reason for this is to ensure the involvement of the new members from the ten new Member States, along with the ten new Commissioners. As I said earlier, this report does not aim to take decisions, but to enable the new Parliament to do so while also, along with the new Commission and the Council, to at least take note of what we are saying.</p>
<p class="contents">To repeat one other point I made in the first debate on this issue, I would remind the Council that the Interinstitutional Agreement is only an interinstitutional agreement when the institutions keep to it between themselves. In other words, Parliament is a key player in this. It is not a bit-part player in the process. It is a major player and I hope the other institutions recognise that.</p>
<p class="contents">This is probably the last time I will address this Parliament as chairman of the Committee on Budgets. I would like to say what a great privilege and what a great job it has been.</p>

I welcome the opportunity today to participate in this debate on the future financial perspective, and I note the points made by Mr Wynn.</p>
<p class="contents">The report and the work undertaken by Parliament constitute an important contribution to the process of working towards the agreement on future financing for the period from 2006 onwards. The nature of the agreement on the next funding round will have a critical impact on how the Union equips itself to tackle forthcoming challenges, including those most relevant to the quality of life and economic prospects of our citizens. Each of the Union's institutions has a responsibility to ensure that we achieve a balanced and fair outcome that supports our policy goals in a financially efficient and financially effective manner.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are aware, there are no easy answers to the challenge that the negotiations on future financing will have to address. We must address the need to boost growth throughout the Union so as to capitalise on the economic recovery that is now evident. We need to target resources effectively so that we build a growth-enhancing infrastructure throughout the Union that contributes to the improvement of transport links, with investment in communications and new technologies. Similarly, the provision of support for human capital – in particular in terms of education and training – has the potential to complement our investment in infrastructure. Upgrading the skills of Europe's workforce will contribute significantly to improved productivity. Equally, support for innovation will provide added value in the demanding global marketplace, thus enhancing the competitiveness of the Union and its output.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy of solidarity is critical to the success of our Union. The European Union must consider how best to support those regions of the new Member States that will lag behind the Union's average in terms of development and access to growth opportunities, including access to employment opportunities. Equally, certain regions of existing Member States are still engaged in the convergence process, and the Union will need to consider what continued assistance is appropriate to support our shared objective of enabling all regions to converge on the EU average level of prosperity. Similarly, our debate on future financing will have to address the differing needs of urban and rural populations and regions and consider how best to create a balanced outcome that will promote greater prosperity for a wider range of Europe's citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Our debate on future financing must also consider how we can enhance the priority which we attach to promoting the principle of sustainability in respect of future growth and development. Equally, we all recognise the importance of providing appropriate resources for increased Union actions in the areas of freedom, security and justice and in support of the Union's external relations role. In short, the challenges facing us as we look at the future financial perspective are very significant indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliament is aware, we are still at the very early phase of our deliberations on the future financial perspective. The Irish presidency's approach is to build a solid foundation for the detailed work that will need to be undertaken under succeeding presidencies to achieve agreement on the level and on the focus of future financing. Its related objective is to provide Member States with the opportunity to consider the Commission communication as a whole and to outline their initial response. This process is intended to enable us to identify areas of agreement and also areas of potential divergence. Parliament will have seen the European Council conclusions welcoming the work of the Commission on this issue and endorsing the presidency's approach to handling it.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with these conclusions and analytical exercises currently under way in the Council to examine each of the areas addressed in the Commission communication, this work will form the basis for the report which will be prepared for the June European Council, outlining the outcome of the deliberations thus far.</p>
<p class="contents">The Wynn report is therefore an important contribution to work on an issue in which each of the Union's institutions will be involved. I welcome the constructive manner in which the European Parliament, as usual, has approached the issue of future financing. While there may be differing viewpoints on specific aspects of the issue, I am pleased to see that there are many areas of shared analysis and a common recognition of the importance of focusing on issues such as sustainable development, growth, freedom, security and justice, and the Union's external role.</p>
<p class="contents">We have much work to do, as I have already said. That will determine how the Union acquits itself to meet the challenges ahead. Obviously, there will be points on which we will differ as the negotiations proceed – that is the very nature of politics and political dialogue. However, I am confident that our shared commitment to achieving a fair and balanced outcome to negotiations will help us to work towards a final package that will promote effective use of resources in support of greater prosperity for all the Union's citizens in the years ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The budget for the year 2000, the first for which we were jointly responsible, was also the first budget to be drawn up under the current system of financial planning. After five years of shared experience of the financial perspective as a planning instrument, we now have a welcome opportunity to discuss this experience in terms of its implications for the next planning period.</p>
<p class="contents">Our experience shows that the planning instrument has proved well able to guarantee the orderly development of expenditure and its funding. In particular, the instrument of the interinstitutional agreement, with its consultation and cooperation mechanisms, has also managed to ensure that the discussion process is efficiently conducted and is concluded in good time. On the other hand, experience has also shown that a greater degree of flexibility is desirable, that the ceiling for expenditure on foreign policy was simply set too low and that the capping of administrative expenditure is liable to create its own problems. The beneficial effects of the Financial Perspective derive from its capacity to foster mutual trust between the institutions and to promote compromise. In this respect I fully endorse what the Chairman, Mr Wynn, has said.</p>
<p class="contents">This very point is also an argument in favour of synchronising the duration of the Financial Perspective with the mandate of Parliament and the Commission – in other words, limiting it to five years. The Commission agrees in principle with the Committee on Budgets here. The Commission, however, has proposed a further seven-year period as a transitional phase for many reasons, which I do not wish to recapitulate here. Perhaps there is room for a compromise, such as an arrangement whereby the support programmes for which the Commission is currently drafting the legal basis would not have their budgets fixed at this stage for all seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to ensure that all the legal bases can be adopted in 2006, there is simply not enough time to wait for the new Commission to create them. It goes without saying, however, that the new Commission will be able to assert its own priorities in the consultation process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Financial Perspective establishes the financial framework for the policies that will be pursued over the next few years. It is a highly significant political project, which is why the consultations must be preceded by an agreement as to which tasks the Union intends to perform collectively in the future. That, indeed, is the way in which the Irish Presidency has addressed this matter, and I should like to take this opportunity to offer a most emphatic vote of thanks for the manner in which you are dealing with this dossier and with the Commission’s proposal at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">Our common aims are ambitious: sustainable growth, greater competitiveness through enhanced support for science, research and education, the development of a European Union area of freedom, security and justice for our citizens, the assumption of more joint responsibility in the world and the successful integration of the new Member States. The new framework will apply to an EU of 27 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes that all of this be funded within the present ceiling for the Union’s own resources. We are not proposing an increase in the ceiling, even though the present limit has remained constant since 1999. We are even proposing a far greater flexibility margin below this ceiling of 1.24% of gross national income than the one proposed by the previous Commission for the present planning period. If we compare the figures from the current financial plans with those in the Commission’s new proposal for the years 2007 to 2013, it emerges that our proposed ceiling for this next planning period works out at an average of 1.14% of gross national income, while the current average is in the order of 1.12% if the EDF and the Solidarity Fund are included. If the European Development Fund and the Solidarity Fund were removed from the equation – as they are in the figures for the new period – and the values for the present period were recalculated on the basis of 25 Member States, the result would actually be a slight reduction in the percentage of gross national income to be levied in the coming years under the Commission’s new proposal compared with the present planning period.</p>
<p class="contents">How has it been possible for us, in spite of this ambitious agenda, to remain below the said ceiling? The only reason, of course, is that the Commission has reallocated funds from old to new tasks. For example, the percentage of the budget devoted to agricultural expenditure will decrease, while the allocation to sustainable growth will increase. Reallocations are proposed between the old and the new Member States. If we examine the Commission’s proposals for the forthcoming planning period for the old Member States alone, we see that they fall well below the ceiling of 1.0% of gross national income requested by some of the Member States. If, however, we were to set a ceiling of 1.0% for the enlarged Union of 27 Member States, we should have to forego the pursuit of entire policies, and the catalogue of objectives adopted by the Council and ourselves would then become unattainable.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few years, we have done much to consolidate the budget, far more than has been done in the Member States. The budgets of recent years, the budgets for which we have been jointly responsible, may be regarded as the lowest in the history of European financial perspectives. The amounts of expenditure flowing to the current Member States have been reduced in order to create, within the limits of the current ceiling, sufficient financial capacity for the accession of new Member States. In the realm of budgetary policy, we are well prepared for enlargement. We have a new up-to-date budgetary system, and we have a new budgetary structure which is far more transparent and far more political.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to very close cooperation among the institutions in recent years, our record has been good. And you, Mr Wynn, have been a magnificent chairman of the Committee on Budgets and have led the committee very, very successfully. You were, however, also fortunate in having very good committee members, who have been professional, competent and – an essential attribute in any politician involved in budgetary matters – extremely hardworking. The same applies to the bureau of the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved a lot, thanks to excellent cooperation. It was a very good experience in every way. I am extremely grateful to you.</p>

On behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I have four points to make.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is that we fear that too restrictive a budget may actually prevent the European Union from playing its part on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that while we supported a transparent, flexible and simplified budget, we also very much want the European Parliament to retain control of it before any decision is taken. So far as external relations are concerned, we therefore call for a budget breakdown that is both thematic and geographical.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is the fight against poverty. It seems to us that one of the ways, albeit not the only way, of preventing terrorism in the world today is to eradicate poverty. That is therefore one of our priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point is that, with enlargement, we want our relations with the Arab world to be maintained and expanded and the Barcelona process and neighbourhood policy to be relaunched. That is also our last priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the first place we would like the budgets to be more realistic in the future than they have been in the past. We note that large amounts remain unspent every year. There is nothing against that as such, but then why did that money have to be in the budget in the first place?</p>
<p class="contents">The second point, that is very important to us, concerns the fact that about 80% to 85% of all the money is spent by the Member States. As a way of exercising extra control over this, would it not be possible for each Member State to issue a declaration each year, stating that the money had been well spent. If things turned out later to be wrong, then the Commission would be in a stronger legal position to deal with the Member State concerned. In other words, national declarations of good conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that we would like, but that is widely known, that a positive Statement of Assurance (DAS) be produced once every so many years. On the eve of the elections, it is really difficult to explain why, after nine years, the Commission is still unable to extract a positive declaration of expenditure from the European Court of Auditors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the realm of agriculture, unless the worst comes to the worst, we shall obtain codecision, and our system of financial planning has a substantial agricultural component. We in the European Parliament want to be involved; we have no wish to accept the implication in the draft constitution that all power over money matters tends to rest with the Council, and we shall play our active role here. You also said that expenditure on agriculture would fall, while expenditure on sustainable business activity would rise. That is all very well, but if you consider the second pillar, to which rural development belongs, there is no real increase once you take account of the fact that there will soon be 25 and then 27 Member States. This needs to be rectified, particularly since the proposals formulated in the agricultural domain did not provide for capping.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is that we want to be more heavily involved in research. In the framework programme for research and development, only five of the individual programmes relate to agriculture. There is therefore a need to focus more sharply on the economic development of agriculture in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to conclude by returning to the discussion that took place on gross national income and to the contributions on that issue. I see little sense in the letter proposing a limit of one per cent. The proposal that the Commission has now made is an offer – let me just call it that, although I would personally have preferred a rather more sharply defined line to follow. We must, of course, succeed in narrowing the wide gulf between authorisations and disbursements by means of better policy – and this is naturally a matter for Parliament too.</p>
<p class="contents">One final thought: you have formed a reserve for a Growth Adjustment Fund, but there is no provision for a specific reserve to deal with crises in areas such as foreign policy or the environment. This, I believe, is something that ought to be rectified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Top priority must attach to the real Community policies. One of these is unquestionably the common fisheries policy, which continues to need a solid financial basis – a need which is now greater than ever before.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to enumerate briefly the main points which I identified in drafting the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries and which were explicitly and emphatically reaffirmed by the future Commissioner from Latvia, Mrs Sandra Kalniete, at her hearing. Firstly, adequate funding of the CFP in the forthcoming financial perspective is imperative. Secondly, the areas that depend on fishing, most of which are structurally weak regions, are in particular need of the solidarity and support of the Community. Moreover – and this is my third point – we need more socio-economic measures; fourthly, we need greater diversification and, fifthly, we need the development of new activities. I am convinced that fisheries in Europe have a future but only if they are adequately funded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There must also be adequate funds for developing the weaker regions of the current Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also grateful that the report is calling for there to be verification of how compatible state aid policy is with regional development.

<p class="contents">Money allocated to poverty eradication must be safeguarded from being transferred to meet the Community's other objectives. Therefore clear distinction has to be made between those areas of external action which have different characteristics: pre-action aid, enhanced cooperation development, cooperation humanitarian aid, relations with ACP countries, peace and security and, finally, reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">New aid and development assistance is almost invisible. The other agencies we use to deliver our money, aid and assistance take the public credit for our taxpayers' endeavours. This must change: it must stop and stop quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The plan to the budgetise the European Development Fund must not result in a reduction in the overall development finance for ACP countries. These funds must be focused by means of sub-headings, or ring-fenced in their financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I must reiterate that we must keep poverty eradication at the forefront of our development assistance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I seem to remember saying a few weeks ago that I regretted that would be the last time he spoke as chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and yet he is still here. Who knows what will happen in our new Parliament, assuming of course that we are both re-elected?</p>
<p class="contents">This debate highlights how the EU institutions seem to rush into debates before fully preparing the ground. In the brief time available, I would like to reflect on the period in which the financial perspective has been in operation. A few of us were Members of this House in the 1980s, when we had turbulent budget debates that were not over-affected by the limits imposed, and then had the financial perspectives from 1988. Since then we have witnessed an enormous rush in European history, from the disintegration of the Soviet Union to German unification, followed by the rush to include countries from central and eastern Europe, which will be complete in a few days time.</p>
<p class="contents">We have noticed over this period that the financial perspective, as Mr Colom i Naval pointed out in one of his working papers, is indeed somewhat rigid and requires certain changes. Since we are now on the brink of central and eastern enlargement, it seems to me that this period should be one for reflection as we bring in new countries, although possibly not a united Cyprus. It is slightly odd that we have had this debate without the full participation of the representatives of the central and eastern countries, when we realise there are huge problems and challenges concerning the absorption of those countries, as regards not only institutional operation but also policy making.</p>
<p class="contents">In this debate we are looking ahead to the distant date of 2013, and although useful policy documents exist we have yet to see them. We are therefore right to call for these documents so that we can see exactly what basis has been used to assess how to ensure the European Union will work for 25 countries and how to ensure that Europe will become more competitive, and indeed meet its international obligations – the members of the European Council take decisions on our behalf, but very rarely provide us with the requisite budgetary framework.</p>
<p class="contents">There are therefore three points which we should include in our message to the incoming parliament and the incoming administration of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there must be a coherent strategy for the European Union in the years ahead so that we know what the Union's priorities are to be, both internally and externally.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should avoid trying to stretch the political credibility of the Union too far in taking on ambitions that the institutions themselves are incapable of handling at the present time. I refer in particular to future enlargement for a country like Turkey, as things stand.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we need a period of consolidation during this financial perspective period, to make the European Union not only an effective operator internally and externally, but also an operator that is seen to be truly democratic and smooth-functioning. If we try to take on too many of the ambitions harboured in certain quarters, our institutions will be incapable of fulfilling them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no intention of arriving at a definitive response during this final plenary. That said, I believe the response provided by the Committee on Budgets is too ambiguous.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel the European Parliament is missing yet another chance to make a clear statement on its positions concerning key budgetary issues. Parliament already missed the opportunity provided by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">We Socialists always advocated deepening European integration because we believe it is beneficial to all the citizens. More Europe means more benefits in everything and for everyone. In our view, being part of such a Europe is a win-win situation. The Socialists favour a citizens’ Europe rather than a Member States’ Europe. This is why we have argued repeatedly that citizens should pay the contributions, not the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of this House will remember Joan Colom. He was forever saying that he felt it was unfair for a rich Spaniard to pay fewer taxes to Europe than a German manual labourer. This is what actually happens under the present system of own resources. We also believe that the fiscal principles applied in our countries must apply also at Union level. I should like to make it clear that for both the reasons stated we shall be voting as a Spanish Socialist delegation in favour of the amendment tabled by the French Socialists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time I would like to thank you, Terence, for the constructive work you have done as Chairman of the Committee on Budgets. Yours has been an amicable and constructive approach to the job, with the result that the work of the committee has been harmonious and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">The value of the financial perspective proposed by the Commission depends on what the balance of power between the budgetary authorities will be in the future. If the end result is that the financial perspective creates a jointly agreed framework in which Parliament can participate fully in drafting the budget, it will be of great value. If, on the other hand, the EU budget is to become merely a set of small-scale appropriations, as the Ministers of Finance recently proposed, that does not bode well for consistency in budget policy in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal to review the financial perspective is a step in the right direction. The number of headings has been reduced. Nevertheless, heading 1 covers an unnecessarily large area compared to the others and it might be a good idea to divide it in two. Similarly, the allocation of appropriations for agriculture and environmental protection under the same heading raises questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The priorities with regard to future policy are the right ones. EU competitiveness will only improve by promoting entrepreneurship and by investing in research, product development and education and training. The intention is to treble the figure for appropriations currently being spent in the next seven years. My group is in favour of this. There has to be investment, particularly in education, training and trainee exchange programmes, so that we will have better educated youth with a more international outlook that can take responsibility for its intellectual and material development in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The other important priority is cohesion policy. It is now vitally important to promote cohesion, as we are about to be joined by new Member States whose combined GDP is just 5% of that of the old Member States, although they make up 20% of the population. One of the EU’s main objectives is the promotion of economic, social and regional equality.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU bureaucratic machine is vast, and not only does it pose a threat to efficiency but it especially threatens to tarnish the Union’s reputation in the eyes of the public.

<p class="contents">My answer is no – this perspective is clearly not up to the task. One only has to look to the past. The financial perspectives for 1988-1992 and for 1993-1999 increased the ceiling for own resources from 1.15% to 1.27% of Community Gross Domestic Product. In both cases, the Structural Funds were duplicated in the packages nicknamed ‘Delors I’ and ‘Delors II’. Agenda 2000 maintained the ceiling for own resources and for funds, when enlargement to encompass a further six countries was already on the horizon. The Commission’s current proposal, however, maintains the ceilings set in Agenda 2000, despite the fact that the current round of enlargement involves a further ten countries, plus another two, with incomes of less than 40% of the Community average. I refer to the pressure exerted and the lack of solidarity shown by the main cash contributors to have signed the Letter of the Six, who are seeking to limit the budget to 1%.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Commissioner Schreyer acknowledges that her proposal, which is low, is only possible due to the process of budgetary consolidation that has taken place in the current 15 Member States: to the Stability Pact and to the reallocation of funds. But what and who will suffer as a result? This framework shows the risks both for the countries that are about to join, and for the cohesion countries, such as Portugal, given that the value of the Structural Funds for the current Member States will fall from 0.31% to 0.21% of Community income.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation really needs to be changed, the ceiling on own resources must be increased and a response must be given to the serious problems of cohesion, poverty and of protecting greater economic and social cohesion between all the countries of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have every confidence in their ability to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers and rural communities have legitimate expectations, to which Parliament has responded in a positive way. It is my hope that the most dramatic reform since the CAP was first introduced will lead to greater stability and provide a much-needed stimulus for young people to take up farming as a full-time career. There are some encouraging signs that this may happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as this is likely to be my last contribution in this House, I want to acknowledge the success of the European project. Ireland, perhaps more than any other EU Member State, bears witness to the practical realisation of the aspirations and dreams of the EU's founding fathers. There can be no doubt that Ireland's economic success would not have happened, and could not be sustained, outside the framework of EU membership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of the questions that will have to be discussed with regard to the budgetary policy of years to come can only be answered by the enlarged European Union, and we must also give due consideration to the adoption and implementation of the constitution. For this reason it should be re-emphasised at the present juncture that, while the Union must, of course, provide itself with the means necessary to attain its objectives and carry through its policies, as prescribed by Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, it must equally ensure that contributions and appropriations are fairly distributed and that budgetary processes are open to scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly true that, under the new headings, the Commission is concentrating on growth targets, employment and sustainability, but I must say that we should be all the more credible if this were not confined to the allocation of budgetary resources but were also reflected far more clearly in the application of the Community acquis and if we focused far more sharply on this aspect in the adoption and consolidation of European legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say at this point that it is too soon to talk about figures today – whether 1%, 1.24% or somewhere in-between – because we must first deliberate carefully on these things on the basis of the constitutional discussion. To this extent, the letter from the six leaders was neither helpful nor in any way expedient in its timing or its content.</p>
<p class="contents">I also insist on the need for synchronisation of the financial perspective with the legislative term of Parliament and the Commissioners’ term of office, and let me make one last point, Mr President. On the basis of our experiences and the turbulence that is often part and parcel of political life, adequate budgetary flexibility within each financial perspective is surely one of the major objectives that will have to be discussed, and we in Parliament shall play our part in that discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore, as my fellow Member Mr Böge said, far too soon to talk about figures, ceilings and minimum allocations, but what do we actually think of the Commission’s basic approach?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin with what we perceive to be good points. The Commission is proposing a different set of budget headings from those to which we are so accustomed. It is also proposing a somewhat different aggregation structure for the individual EU policies. One of the new categories is to be sustainable growth, and another will be conservation and management of natural resources. This is the result of the Commission having paid very careful heed to Parliament’s frequent discussion of budgetary priorities. We want to become the most competitive economic area, and we want to preserve a decent world for our children and grandchildren. About four fifths of our budget is to be devoted to this aim. ‘Wonderful’ is all I can say to that!</p>
<p class="contents">A German saying, however, tells us that there is no light without shadow. The main shadows are in those areas where the Commission has kept its own counsel. I cannot find any reference to its ideas and proposals as to how the European budget is supposed to acquire the funds we intend to devote to the pursuit of our policies. It would have been better if the Commission had accompanied the financial perspective with its ideas on how to reform the Union’s own resources. That would have forestalled several squalid discussions about Member States’ contributions, but perhaps the Commission can still plug these gaps. I hope it does. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
