Before we come to what I hope will be the conclusion to this matter, I would like to thank everyone most warmly: my fellow Members, the staff of the political groups and also the secretariat, all of whom have done such hard work on this. Parliament has been calling for many years for antibiotics to be banned as growth-promoting additives in animal feed, and today we are going to make it a reality in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In our debate on the second reading of this proposal for a regulation, it is certainly apparent that there are widely divergent views on the value of additives in animal feed. The use of antibiotics as growth-promoting additives in the fattening of livestock will now be banned in the EU once and for all with effect from 31 December 2005. I see this policy decision as long overdue in view of the growing resistance to various antibiotics used in the medical treatment of patients. Feedingstuffs imported into the EU from third states must of course take account of the requirements of this new regulation in the same way as those produced within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">One important topic in the preparatory debate was the open declaration of flavourings in feedingstuffs. Our constant watchword was ‘let it have in what it says on the tin’, but I do take the view that we must not go too far. The open declaration of flavourings in feedingstuffs has now been dealt with in a compromise between the Council, the Commission, and Parliament. At present, over three hundred flavourings are permitted, and these have been subject to the strictest controls and supervision in the course of production. It is for this reason that all the final formulations of flavourings in feedingstuffs no longer have to be declared individually. I think – and this is an important point – that, in the sphere of business competition, we should also, in the European Union, be aware of the fact that there is such a thing as corporate know-how, and protecting this corporate know-how, should be a matter of major concern to all of us in the political sphere. That is why the new rule in the proposal is an exact parallel to existing rules applicable to food for human beings. We must not apply more stringent rules to animals than we do where people are concerned. That, Commissioner Byrne, is why I see Amendments Nos 17 and 18, which deal with this subject, as particularly important, and I would be glad if you would briefly state what view you take of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The main point of the compromise is, however, the use of histomonostats and coccidiostats, which are antibiotic additives that will continue to be urgently needed in poultry farming. We are not talking here about the use of antibiotics to promote growth; these products are used to protect animals, and their use as a means of preventing disease in animals strikes me as a vitally important topic, as these are agents that we cannot, at present, do without. I speak from personal experience, having, myself, some years ago, been deeply involved in the field of turkey-rearing. It is generally regarded as inevitable that the disease known as ‘blackhead’, which occurs very frequently in poultry farming – and, I might add, in organic farming as well – will wipe out up to 60% of livestock if we are no longer permitted to use these products. So, whilst these agents will not be permitted as additives indefinitely, they will still be permitted for a limited period. Our intention, Commissioner, in this time-limit in Amendment No 16, is to bring sufficient pressure to bear on the pharmaceutical industry to get them to produce suitable alternative products or, instead, to develop new vaccines.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s vote will see us making a definite advance in the protection of consumers in the European Union, and I very much hope that, at 11 a.m., every side of this House will be able to come together to vote accordingly.</p>

<p class="contents">I want to congratulate Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her hard work on this report, which points out the major questions we are dealing with. In short, let me recall the main points of the proposal that were accepted on first reading by the Parliament and by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we will have a clear and transparent authorisation procedure. The European Food Safety Authority will be the first port of call and will be in charge of evaluating all feed additives. In future, the validity of authorisations will be limited to ten years. The new system has an in-built review and re-evaluation process in order to take new scientific information into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies must demonstrate the positive effect on the animal or in the feed and the absence of any risk to human health, animal health or the environment when applying for authorisation or re-authorisation of a feed additive.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, four antibiotics are authorised for use in animal feed as growth promoters. The EU has already phased out the use in feedingstuffs of all antibiotics that are also used in human and veterinary medicine, in order to avoid cross-resistance. The four which are currently authorised are not used in any human antibiotic drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to hear that the Parliament, as well as the Council, is in agreement with the line of the Commission to halt the use of antibiotics for growth promotion from 2006 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me a few words on the controversial issue on which views were divided for a long time. I am referring to coccidiostats, which are substances used to prevent coccidia infections. I just want to stress that the proposal contains stricter rules for their authorisation and placing on the market, and they are kept within the scope of this Regulation. The reason for this is that hygiene precaution and improved husbandry practices are not sufficient to keep poultry free from such diseases. In order to ensure the safety of these substances, I am proposing a re-evaluation of current authorisations within four years of the entry into force of this Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also accept the request for a report to the Parliament and Council before 1 January 2008, on the use of these substances as feed additives together, where appropriate, with a legislative proposal concerning further use within the time limits as established in Amendment No 14.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the solution finally reached by Parliament in order to impose a close follow-up of the use of coccidiostats and histomonostats. I can give an assurance that the Commission will propose measures in order to decide the future status of these substances.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament also proposed some flexibility on the labelling requirements applicable to flavouring compounds. I can agree to this change as I am convinced that this type of discussion should be made in the framework of the labelling of feed.</p>
<p class="contents">A full list of the Commission’s position on each of the amendments is being provided to the Parliament, and I trust that this will be included in the record for this session<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. With regard specifically to Amendments Nos 17 and 18, raised by Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, I can confirm that the Commission can accept these.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you again, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, for an outstanding report and indeed also for the excellent collaboration between our two offices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In so doing, we are making a vital contribution to the improvement of EU law on food and feedingstuffs, while also ensuring that Europe’s consumers recover their confidence – which had been lost –in the safety of their food. This case is no different. Both Parliament and the Council are agreed that the essential significance of this draft regulation is that, from 1 January 2006 onwards, antibiotics will, once and for all, be banned as additives in animal feed. What Parliament has been calling for for years, this regulation is now bringing to pass.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn, though, to the specific aspects that have concerned us in the course of second reading. Today’s vote presents us with two alternatives – firstly, the amendments voted on in the committee, and, secondly, the compromise amendments negotiated by the rapporteur with the Council and the Commission, which are intended to make a long and laborious conciliation procedure unnecessary. The Group of the Party of European Socialists has decided to support the compromise, and we did not exactly find that easy, having agreed in the committee that coccidiostats and histomonostats – the fundamental bone of contention between Parliament and the Council – would be permitted only until the end of 2008, which position was not – as is well known – supported by a majority on the Council. These substances are of great importance in poultry farming, and I have to say that I have no interest in banning their use. On the contrary, they must, in future, be removed from the category of additives to feedingstuffs and be categorised as subject to the legislation on veterinary medicines. Only thus can they be administered in a controlled way through prescription by a veterinary surgeon who knows the situation in the farm in question and can respond to it in an appropriate way. Failing that, the generalised prophylactic use of these substances – some of which are antibiotics – may well cover up any hygiene problems that exist on farms and in businesses. It was therefore of primary importance to us that we should today come to a decision in principle on what is to be done about coccidiostats and histomonostats, and, in this, the sequence of events was, ultimately, of only secondary importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Compromise Amendment No 16 fixes a date for the cessation of the use of these substances as additives to feedingstuffs, that being December 2012, and, when seen in comparison with the Common Position, that amounts to major progress. We would certainly have liked to see them stop being used at an earlier date, but, even after the compromise has been reached, that is still possible, if – as the same amendment states – we ask the Commission, in January 2008, for a report and a legislative proposal. Should further progress have been made by then on the development of usable alternatives, we will then be able to agree with the Commission and the Council on an earlier date for the cessation of use.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting the compromise and by refraining from a conciliation procedure, Parliament has demonstrated that it is willing to cooperate, and let me make it perfectly clear at this juncture that we expect the same willingness to cooperate from the Commission and the Council at the consultations scheduled for 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has met us halfway as regards another point, namely the labelling of flavourings. In this regard, we take the view that it is necessary to have a rule that is in line with the provisions applicable to flavourings used in the production of food. Why more stringent standards should apply in the area of animal nutrition than do in the field of food production, is incomprehensible. Should there be, though, in future, provisions on food that impose the labelling of all ingredients of flavourings, we will, of course, also have to apply them to feedingstuffs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this chain, the food market is vigorously contended for, and distorted, by businesses operating on a national and international scale. That has an effect on almost all feed proteins and on additives. What happens to a farmer at the feed market is exactly the same as what happens to the consumer at the meat counter. Both have to be able to rely on what is inside the pack of meat, or the sack of feed, being what it says on the outside. It is, unfortunately, not yet universally known that what you feed to animals you end up feeding to humans. That is what makes the forthcoming general overhaul of the densely entangled European legislation in this area not only absolutely necessary but also, I think, overdue, even though, when it comes to additives to feedingstuffs, it is important to consider not only the effect of appetite stimulants or of growth promoters on the animals and hence on the farm’s viability, but also the complex side-effects of such substances. Any risk of detriment to human health or to the environment must be excluded as far as possible. Only thus will it be possible to regain the consumers’ confidence in the safety of foodstuffs of animal origin, a confidence shattered by the events associated with BSE, dioxin and antibiotics.</p>
<p class="contents">It is that with which this regulation concerns itself, as does the committee’s position, which I endorse. Even though voices are raised to assert that the large-scale banning of antibiotics from the feeding-trough is excessive, since some 90% of antibiotics are used in human and veterinary medicine, it is right that we should put a stop to growth promotion, as these antibiotics are far from being essential. We already have enough problems with the increasing number of people developing resistance to antibiotics.</p>
<p class="contents">I too have some criticisms to make at this point. On 7 March this year I submitted a written question to the Council on the banning of the additive Nifursol. To this day, I have received no reply, even though Parliament’s administration has pressed for one on two occasions. Nifursol, an aromatic nitrogen compound, was the last remaining prophylactic agent against blackhead disease in turkeys, and it appears that no medication is now licensed for the treatment of this disease. There are no alternatives, and there is no prospect of a vaccine. The reason why Nifursol was banned was that the EU classed it as carcinogenic. According to interim findings published by the Austrian health ministry on 16 June, no harmful residues have been found to date as a result of the testing of turkeys from food markets. If that result is confirmed, then prohibitions to protect human health may no longer be proportionate even under the broad terms of the European Court of Justice’s ruling of 11 September 2002. The ban on Nifursol may end up being re-examined. Feedingstuffs that are guaranteed to be safe, as well as transparency in the production of food, demand that policy decisions be justified by science and taken on the basis of findings; they should not be rushed through in response to suspicions. For me, as a matter of principle, farmers must be at the centre of these decisions rather than on their margins! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an old demand by Parliament, and the ban might certainly already have been imposed years ago, but we wish to commend the process we are now completing. I must also take this opportunity to show respect for the Commission for having complied with this request by Parliament. We are part-way through the codecision procedure, and that gives me the opportunity to refer nonetheless to a number of reservations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, in your first reports, you had proposed a tougher approach to the registration of manufactured substances and to the timing of such registration, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development did of course fall in with this proposal. In particular, you had initially recommended that coccidiostats be phased out by 2008. This has now been postponed to 2012 and not even, as yet, with a view to banning them definitively but rather with a view possibly to categorising them as medicines. That seems to me to be a very long wait. Why can they not be transferred into the medicines category before that? Not that doing so would necessarily justify a ban.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the impression that, in moving in that direction, you have been considerably influenced by the industry concerned. In the throes of a codecision procedure, a large group like the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has the opportunity of using its large quantity of votes to prevent us from obtaining the 314 votes we need and, through preferential negotiations, has the considerable power to land Parliament with results that we cannot then alter. In saying this, I would indicate that codecision does not necessarily always produce good results. Instead, it must be taken seriously and handled responsibly, and – above all, in the large group – there should be no getting carried away into complying with the interests of the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we shall endorse this report, and I hope that you will reconsider whether it might not, however, be possible for your group also to support what has been decided by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the subject of registering manufactured substances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the fact that the newly established European Food Safety Authority will play a key role in assessing applications for authorisation. This represents another step in the important work of rebuilding the confidence of European consumers in the quality and safety of European food products – as the Commissioner has often said – 'from farm to fork'.</p>
<p class="contents">The lessons of the past have been learned and tremendous care has been taken to ensure that every link in the food chain is checked for soundness. Commissioner Byrne and his officials deserve great credit for their untiring efforts in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that authorisation of an additive will be valid for a maximum of ten years. It is necessary constantly to review regulation in this area, as new scientific evidence and testing is constantly being developed. Based on advice from the Scientific Steering Committee, it is appropriate that an adequate transitional period be laid down for the phasing out of the remaining antibiotics currently used in compounds for disease prevention. This should allow animal production practices to be adopted and the antibiotics to be replaced by alternative products.</p>
<p class="contents">Livestock production occupies a very important place in the agriculture of the Community. Our farming and food production sector is facing great uncertainty at the moment and we must be vigilant in ensuring that any steps we propose serve to enhance the position of these crucial industries. I can only say that I wish that Commissioner Byrne's colleague, Mr Fischler, would demonstrate the same willingness to understand the difficulties currently faced by European farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to say that satisfactory results in relation to this issue depend to a large extent on the use of safe and good quality feedingstuffs. The free movement of safe and wholesome food and feed is an essential aspect of the internal market and contributes significantly to the health and wellbeing of citizens and their social and economic interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certainly, when I try to explain to the small farmers what is happening here, they look at me as if I do come from that planet.</p>
<p class="contents">Exploring these regulations and their proposed amendments, it is clear that the underlying ethos is the control of corporate business, itself a reasonable objective in a sector which has had more than its fair share of problems.</p>
<p class="contents">What the authors of these regulations have clearly failed to recognise, however, is that many small and medium-sized livestock and poultry farmers and many family businesses also formulate feeds. Some of these enterprises operate on an extremely small scale and make up in flexibility, innovation and quality what they lose in economies of scale. None of these businesses can hope to deal with the complexities of this regulation, the paperwork, the recordings and the inspections – and they will progressively be driven out of the feed industry. They and their customers are either going out of business completely or are being forced to rely on the corporate feed producers whom they would normally wish to avoid.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, therefore, this Parliament, with its mania for regulations and its one-size-fits-all mentality, is obstructing the very things many of its Members profess to support: variety, diversity and quality, to say nothing of support for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">I voted against these regulations at the first reading and if I thought it could succeed, I would have tabled an amendment to strike out the common position. As it is, I can only leave colleagues to make their own judgements as to the efforts made. I suspect they will not be that charitable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, overall, I approve the recommendations of our rapporteur, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, on the subject of additives in animal nutrition. It is obvious that we must move towards eliminating these antibiotics, coyly referred to as ‘growth promoters’ and systematically added to certain animal feeds. If the use of these antibiotics becomes commonplace, there is a risk that resistance to antibiotics will develop, and this would be undesirable and dangerous to human health. On the other hand, it does not appear to be necessary to ban coccidiostats, which remain essential in poultry farming, and on this point I support the latest provisions proposed by our rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the issues raised regarding labelling, I am of the opinion that they cannot be resolved merely by regulation, and that the crucial factor is the trust that exists between the manufacturer of the feeds and the livestock farmer who uses them.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to use this debate on additives in animal nutrition as an opportunity to remind the House that the feeding of farm animals using compound feeds produced industrially is not, fortunately, the norm. Ruminants, such as sheep, dairy cows and suckler cows, are for the most part fed on the products of the farm itself. In the case of laying hens, over 25% of their feed is produced on the farm. It is only in the case of table poultry and pigs that, in some regions, feeding is now almost totally dependent on outsourced industrial products.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we ought to ask ourselves whether this development is advisable. Obviously it is in the interests of a powerful industry, but is it in the interests of the consumer? Is it in the interests of the farmer? Is it in the interests of the environment? Is it in the interests of society as a whole, and is it in the interests of animal welfare? It seems to me that in all five cases the answer is ‘no’, and that, on the contrary, common sense tells us that it is preferable for farm animals to eat farm-produced products. For consumers it would be more reassuring to know that they are eating animal products, such as milk, meat and eggs, which come from animals fed on farm products rather than industrial products. It is a question of image, of taste, of traceability and, of course, of food safety too, because farmers would never, of their own volition, have fed their cows on meat meals.</p>
<p class="contents">For the farmer, it would be a way of obtaining more added value for his product and of avoiding two lots of transactions, namely the sale of his plant products and the purchase of his compound feeds. It would also enable him to improve his image and go up-market. Our environment would benefit from the obvious saving in terms of transport: the lorry that comes to the farm to collect the maize or forage peas being sold, and the one that comes to deliver the compound feed.</p>
<p class="contents">As for society as a whole, the great advantage that we could expect would be a reduction in that huge deficit in vegetable proteins which threatens our food safety, by the replacement of imported soya by locally-produced oil and protein crops. I would also add that, if agri-environmental aid were granted to farms producing such crops for consumption by their own animals, it should be easy to gain acceptance for such a measure under the ‘Green Box’ so dear to Mr Fischler’s heart. Finally, from the point of view of animal welfare, it would mean the animals spending more time out at pasture, and a fresher, healthier and more varied diet.</p>
<p class="contents">It would perhaps be a good idea then, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, without, of course, denying the usefulness of adopting legislation on additives in animal nutrition, for the European Union and the Member States to expend more energy on encouraging the feeding of animals on farm-produced feeds than on regulating and controlling the production of industrially manufactured feeds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore to be welcomed that a proposal has been tabled which reduces the existing chaos into a readily understood format.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree wholeheartedly that the rules for additives in animal nutrition should become strict and unambiguous. This is certainly necessary. After all, this is about protecting the lives and health of humans and animals. It is important, though, that sound alternative products are available. Where these alternatives are not available, we need to exercise some flexibility. This is why we back the amendments which permit coccidiostatica and histomonostatica for longer than other antibiotics. This is because at present, there are certain diseases in poultry farming which are difficult to fight without these additives. I am certainly not, however, advocating the unlimited use of coccidiostatica. Although the transitional period is somewhat limited, we assume that the feed industry and poultry farming will find sound alternatives to these substances within that time.</p>
<p class="contents">We are struggling with Amendments Nos 10 and 13 which exclude mixtures and premixtures containing flavourings and appetite stimulants from the labelling requirement. The argument of the economic drawbacks for the industry does not, in our view, carry more weight than the interests of humans and animals, which are at stake here. Indeed, consumers benefit from clear and extensive labelling of the product so that they know exactly what is in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
