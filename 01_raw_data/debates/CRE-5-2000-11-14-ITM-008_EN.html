<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Western Sahara</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 13-15 September a delegation from the European Parliament’s Intergroup on Peace for the Sahrawi People, in which I participated, visited the Sahrawi refugee camps in South-Eastern Algeria.</p>
<p class="contents">There we met the highest authorities of the RASD (Sahrawi Democratic Republic), including its president, and representatives of Minurso. Minurso has done remarkable work in identifying people with a view to drawing up electoral lists prior to the holding of the referendum on self-determination referred to in the UN Secretary-General’s settlement plan signed by the Moroccan Government and the Polisario Front. However, the very large number of objections raised – particularly from Morocco – is clearly an obstacle to holding this referendum in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The delegation noted the terrible living conditions of the refugees. The constant postponement of the referendum, and the failure of negotiations in Berlin on 28 September 2000, are raising serious concerns and engendering deep disappointment among the people.</p>
<p class="contents">We also noted that there were high expectations of a clearer commitment by European Union to settling this conflict which, which is an obstacle to any prospect of stability in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Reiterating the calls made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000, what initiatives does the Presidency of the European Council propose to take with a view to playing a more active role so as to guarantee the full and complete application of the UN peace plan?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 3 by Laura González Álvarez (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0846_EN.html">H-0846/00</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Referendum on self-determination for Western Sahara</span></p>
<p class="contents">The talks under way between the international mediator, UN Secretary­General special envoy James Baker, and the parties in dispute over the holding of a referendum on self­determination for Western Sahara, are in a state of deadlock. At the meeting held on 28 September in Berlin, the Moroccan authorities suggested that they might end their support for the peace plan for organisation of the referendum. The President of the Commission is scheduled to visit Morocco and Algeria in November.</p>
<p class="contents">What action is the Council taking or does it intend to take in support of the peace plan, in order that the referendum may be held as soon as possible and the dangers for the region of renewed conflict thus avoided? What is the Council's political assessment of the current impasse and how does it intend to contribute to a fair solution to the conflict? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also supports the current endeavours of the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy, Mr James Baker – who seems somewhat concerned with other matters at present but this will soon change – to find a fair and mutually acceptable solution to the Western Sahara question. The Council seeks to help foster a climate of confidence between the parties involved and ensure that this is achieved. Resolving the conflict in the Western Sahara will help bring stability to the Maghreb and aid its economic and social development. However, the fact remains that this issue falls within the remit of the United Nations Organisation and the Special Envoy of its Secretary-General, whose perseverance in this complex matter must be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">For several months, Mr Baker’s mission has been twofold; he has sought both to resolve the difficulties inherent in implementing the Settlement Plan, which should lead to a referendum on self-determination for the Sahrawi people, and to reach a political agreement. Both parties have just been granted a new deadline of four months – by Resolution 1324 – to try and make some progress on both counts. The Council, nonetheless, remains concerned by the conditions endured by the people in the camps at Tindouf from a humanitarian point of view and in terms of food supplies. The active commitment of the European Union in this regard is worth highlighting, as it is the largest provider of humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi refugees through its ECHO programme, through which EUR 10.58 million have been allocated for the period 1999-2000. In addition to this, EUR 9 million if aid is being provided as of November 2000 for a period of eight months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You referred to a mutually acceptable solution. I myself have visited the camps at Tindouf where this extremely difficult situation has been going on for 25 years.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be noted, however, that one of the parties involved, Morocco in this instance, that has diplomatic weight and the wheels of state at its disposal, is making less of an effort to ensure that the peace plan, in other words the Houston agreements that it did, in fact, sign, is implemented. It continues to talk about the problem of territorial integrity, a term used by the King, particularly during his last official speech. Now, the issue relates to the self-determination of a nation and the implementation of United Nations resolutions. Whatever the result of the referendum – independence or annexation to Morocco – it seems to me that democracy is what will finally resolve this conflict most effectively. Otherwise, the exacerbation of current tensions and the possible return to arms would be dangerous for the region as a whole at a time when we are discussing – and we were even doing so earlier in this Chamber – the resumption of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.</p>

Mr Rabat now seems to have realised that this proposal did not meet either the UN Secretary-General or his Special Envoy’s expectations, and that it should have formed the basis for seeking a just and definitive solution to the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, Morocco dispatched its Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation to New York on 26 October to attend a private meeting with the Security Council after a similar meeting was held with the Secretary-General of the Polisario Front on 19 October. During his speech, Mr Ben Aïssa stated that a complete file on the scope and content of Morocco’s proposal would be presented the next time the parties met under the auspices of Mr Baker. According to Mr Ben Aïssa, all Morocco had done at the meeting in Berlin was to put forward a proposal for dialogue and sketched an outline of what its content should be.</p>
<p class="contents">France is of the opinion that the willingness Morocco demonstrated in Berlin constitutes an initial step towards finding a way out of the current deadlock the settlement process has reached, and it must be considered as the basis for finding a solution. However, more details need to be provided and the substance of its content improved if it is to constitute a genuine political offer that can be considered by all of the parties involved. This is the message we have given our counterparts in Morocco. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I asked that question because just three weeks after the Council's expert group, the standing working group on the safe transport of radioactive materials, published a report in April 1998 giving a clean bill of health to the way nuclear wastes were transported, the transports were found to be contaminated, as the Minister very well knows. As they are about to be resumed, so we hear – and I am glad to hear all these consultations are taking place – can we place any credibility in the working group on waste? It said everything was hunky-dory but then the transports were found to be contaminated. In the light of that, why are there only representatives from the nuclear industry and government on this working group of experts? Why cannot we have independent experts who have detailed information which could be relevant? Could I ask the Minister to answer to the point? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the International Herald Tribune of 7 September 2000, the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, Robert Kocharian and Heydar Aliyev respectively, have had at least 11 meetings with each other in recent times. The EU has so far remained a passive onlooker in the face of the two countries' endeavours and has taken no initiative, leaving the field open for other strategic players to make moves in their own interests.</p>

As you will be aware, the European Union supports the mediation efforts currently in progress with a view to finding a political solution to all of the conflicts in the region, on the basis of respect for the territorial integrity of the states concerned and an appropriate degree of autonomy. The Union is therefore closely monitoring contacts between Armenia and Azerbaijan with a view to finding a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which is why it welcomes the meetings that have regularly taken place between the two Presidents and hopes that they will lead to a political solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union remains convinced that the Minsk Group of the OSCE has a central role to play in finding a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, in spite of the fact that the solutions put forward by this group in 1997 and 1998 were both rejected by Erevan and Baku. The European Union is also using all of the instruments at its disposal within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement to help improve relations between the two countries. Thanks to the various opportunities for cooperation, it has been possible to establish regular political dialogue with the aim of facilitating exchanges between Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Union continues to provide substantial material aid to both countries through its various programmes, in particular its TACIS programme. It has offered to finance cross-border projects of common interest in an attempt to re-establish good neighbourly relations between the two countries. The commitment of the European Union has been publicly acknowledged by Armenia and Azerbaijan, who have both asserted their willingness to work towards a rapprochement between their countries and the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It smacks of formal, departmental despatches rather than political initiative. The Caucasus needs a more extensive plan and more extensive initiatives if it is to be stabilised. And a European Union which – from what I have read in the newspapers – recently changed its strategy on its energy problems and is now looking more towards the former Soviet Union – with all the implications which that has for the region in general – obviously cannot remain passive and fail to react to developments. So from this point of view, and because, of course, the question was not asked in order to elicit an expression of satisfaction that everything is just fine but in order to express a concern, I think that it could be used as the starting point for an integrated policy, such as that which we have been debating recently for the Balkans; in other words, a new stability agreement for the Caucasus, at the political initiative of the European Union and with political objectives and priorities concerning development, autonomy and democracy in this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Council in Feira last June called upon the Council to speed up the implementation of measures combating illegal rings, provided for in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures to which the author of the question refers comprise a draft Council Directive aimed at defining the concept of the facilitation of unauthorised entry, movement and residence and a draft framework decision designed specifically to strengthen the penal framework combating the facilitation of unauthorised entry and illegal residence as defined therein.</p>
<p class="contents">These texts, which have been submitted to the European Parliament for consultation, are currently being examined by the relevant groups within the Council. They are essentially aimed at combating the trafficking of human beings, which occurs through the facilitation of illegal immigration by organised rings. The aim is to disband and punish those criminal organisations that are involved in this type of traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">The question raised therefore provides the Presidency-in-Office with an opportunity to clarify several points. The texts concerned are not aimed at preventing potential refugees from exercising their right to seek asylum on Union territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sjöstedt will agree, in fact, that a potential refugee is not <span class="italic">ipso facto</span> an illegal immigrant. What is more, these texts are not designed to prevent non-profit making organisations from carrying out their work, provided, of course, that they comply with the laws in force. It is therefore a matter of fighting against criminal organisations that are involved in the trafficking of human beings, not disbanding non-governmental, charitable, political and denominational organisations, except of course – though I cannot imagine this ever happening – in the event of their activities serving as a cover for illegal acts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Danish media, we have heard a 14 year-old Afghan boy say that, if you have to become a refugee, you need an agent. The word ‘agent’ was his own, but to some extent it shows how difficult it is for refugees in fact to make their way to a place in which they can request asylum, and that is of course where the whole problem lies. I should like to ask how the Council views the fact that this further contributes to criminalising humanitarian actions. It is as if we stand midstream at a place where two currents, formed of immigrants and refugees, often combine. What is the Council thinking of? If this area is further criminalised, the result will be to have contributed to a situation in which only unscrupulous and cynical people and those out to make money from the situation will stay behind. Is it really the Council’s policy to help bring about a situation in which the money of poor and persecuted people ends up in the clutches of the mafia and similar organisations? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Every year, dozens of women fall victim to 'crimes of honour' in Turkey. Although Turkish law confers the same rights on women as men, in practice many men continue to condemn women to death for being raped, committing adultery or simply for meeting other men. The men who commit the murders rarely receive long prison sentences, some get off with as little as two years.</p>
<p class="contents">The new legislation being drafted in Turkey, which prohibits reduced sentences, is necessary but it is even more important that Muslim leaders officially condemn 'crimes of honour', which are a direct violation of Islam. There is a need both for legislation and measures to stimulate debate and increase awareness.</p>

Such practices appear to be in sharp decline and, we are told, only occur sporadically in rural areas. However, these crimes continue to be a source of concern for the Council as they are often committed in the most appalling circumstances. The Turkish Government has undertaken significant reforms aimed at fighting such acts more effectively, acts which are, of course, not permitted by national law.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that was adopted by the Turkish cabinet on 21 September as a reform programme contains several planned amendments to the law, such as the inclusion of measures in the Civil Code that are designed to enhance effective equality between men and women in social and educational fields, ways to better combat domestic violence by training judges that specialise in family matters and, lastly, measures to prevent people that have committed crimes of honour from serving reduced sentences.</p>
<p class="contents">Rest assured that the Council will remain particularly vigilant as to the implementation of these measures that are in line with the Copenhagen criteria, as discussed at length earlier on. In any case, the issue of crimes of honour is not a problem that is specific to Turkey, as these crimes occur in many other places around the world. The Council has therefore supported the Dutch initiative aimed at the introduction this year, within the framework of the third committee of the United Nations General Assembly, of a draft resolution against these crimes, which is still in the process of being examined. The Council notes that Turkey has also given its support to this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For the family – and especially for the men of the family – status, credit and honour reside in having a large number of possessions, including female family members. According to this view, male family members have a right and a duty to take the life of a female family member who, for some reason, reduces her value as an unviolated woman. It makes no great difference whether she has transgressed voluntarily or against her will, that is to say been raped.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that the Council should point out the initiatives taken. It is important to prohibit reduced sentences, but it is still more important to counter the general acceptance of crimes of honour.

He continued moreover to assert that the government coalition between the ÖVP (Austrian People’s Party) and the FPÖ (Freedom Party of Austria) was abnormal and that the FPÖ was a racist and xenophobic party.’ The author of the question continued: ‘How can the Council justify the situation where an official representative of the French Presidency of the Council continues, unopposed, to assert such a rejectionist, aggressive and offensive attitude towards another EU country which is a full member on an equal footing? </p>

<p class="contents">Not this evening, and here I come to my answer, as I know the Minister and I can give you the Council’s response. In response to the question posed by Mr Karas, the Presidency-in-Office should like to highlight the fact that the political situation in Austria and the sanctions imposed bilaterally by the other Member States and then lifted were not carried out at the Council’s instigation, precisely because they were bilateral measures. The Presidency-in-Office therefore has no answer to give with regard to this point. However, it goes without saying that, as the sanctions have been lifted, it is no longer an issue of making Austria suffer any disadvantage or unequal treatment because the sanctions are no longer in place.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, and speaking on a more personal level, I can confirm that the statements this Minister made on France 3 clearly reflect his personal opinion on the matter.</p>

This, moreover, has always been the case within the European Union, as the sanctions taken against Austria were done so on a bilateral basis, which is something I should like to stress.</p>
<p class="contents">You therefore have my full assurance that, within the framework of the European Union, the Austrian Government is considered to be on a completely equal footing with all of the other countries and it participates in all of the Council meetings that are held under the auspices of this Presidency. The term of the Head of State and President of the Republic, Jacques Chirac, will, of course, come to an end at Vienna, this is clear. I should like to mention that the President of the Republic will be accompanied, as is usually the case, by one of his government ministers, either the Minister for Foreign Affairs or myself. Next week, a meeting of the European Conference will take place on my invitation in France, in other words a meeting with the candidate countries. I have been informed that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner intends to come and I will be only too pleased to see her.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this shows therefore that we need to clarify several facts. On one hand there is the French Presidency of the European Union, which has to fulfil its duties and do so in a wholly objective manner, and on the other hand there is the political opinion that any politician may impart with regard to a political situation, which is something I am not to change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These bilateral sanctions have demonstrated their scope and limitations. They were imposed and then lifted and, in my view, show that we need to submit proposals for the creation of legal mechanism to be provided for in the treaties. In this regard, several countries, including Austria, have put forward proposals to amend Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, in order to set up a prevention and warning mechanism which would mean that a country considered to be out of step with the values of the European Union can receive recommendations while at the same time having its point of view heard. This was the proposal put forward by the Austrian Government, for example. I can assure you that this proposal has been fully considered and, in my view, we should seek to amend the Treaty along such lines, within the framework of the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the other points, I have not used the words ‘extreme left’ and ‘extreme right’ here because this would run the risk of a debate on the definition of both notions. When you say that extreme right-wing parties are banned in Austria, that is all well and good, but one might also question what does or does not constitute the notion of the extreme right. I personally wanted to talk about values: I have spoken about values as they appear in our texts and I have spoken about the values that appear in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I have spoken, in particular, it is true, about the fight against all forms of discrimination, as appears on the title page of all European texts and which is something we should ensure is respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Presidency still aims to adopt the partnership during the General Affairs Council on 20 November, which is why perhaps the issue was not dealt with in detail in the answer Mr Vedrine gave to Mr Cem. The Presidency has, however, stressed in this instance how important it is for this partnership to become a useful mechanism in defining Turkey’s future national programme for adopting the Community <span class="italic">acquis </span>and for implementing its pre-accession strategy, in accordance with the terms and spirit of the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council.

Next Monday’s General Affairs Council on 20 November will specifically debate the proposal for an Accession Partnership that the Commission has just put forward, which contains extremely clear, explicit, specific references to the Helsinki conclusions.

But the Cyprus problem is not just any old problem. It is the specific problem of the invasion and occupation of a significant part of the territory of a country which is a member of the UN and a candidate for membership of the European Union by another country which is also a member of the UN and also a candidate for membership of the European Union. Are we are saying that the Cyprus question can be resolved without ending the occupation? And what is his opinion of Mr Cem's position – the President-in-Office did not reply here – that there can be no link-up between the Cyprus question and furthering the Accession Partnership between Turkey and the European Union? In other words, is it possible that this partnership will be furthered and that Turkey will join the European Union without ceasing to occupy Cyprus and removing its settlers from Cyprus?

<p class="contents">Even though it is difficult at present to envisage the final details of such an agreement, it seems clear that we need to establish a framework for cooperation and partnership in the area of fisheries that is broader than the previous agreement, and extend it to encompass all of the fisheries sector. The agreement will also take into consideration the need to ensure the sustainable use of resources and aid the development of the Moroccan fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is still too early to assess the features of the future agreement in relation to the expectations of the sector, the Council can, however, assure Mrs Izquierdo Rojo that the Community’s priority is to safeguard the interests of the Community sector as regards the practice of sustainable fishing in Moroccan waters. The Council, I can assure you, is well aware of the needs of all of the regions concerned, particularly those whose economies are main contributors to this agreement.

It must be remembered that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is much more than a simple fisheries agreement; as he knows, if this agreement were not reached, bearing in mind its significance, this fact might conceal a deterioration in the relations between the European Union and Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask him if in the coming weeks the French Presidency is going to push for this agreement to be concluded at last.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is essential that the French Presidency should push hard along this home straight because Commissioner Fischler lacks the Mediterranean imagination needed to be able to secure an agreement. He is less likely to succeed in something which is purely Mediterranean, than Pitres, a village up in the Alpujarra mountains in Granada, is in getting its own port, or even the expansion of its port.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this situation, my question is whether the French Presidency, which does have the will and the imagination, will make it possible for us to achieve a fisheries agreement, which is now vital after eleven months of having our fleet tied up. Andalusia and Galicia, Objective 1 regions, need it and there are many other Europeans working at sea and on land who need this to succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyway, allow me to say that Mr Fischler is neither Mediterranean nor is he from the Atlantic, and what is more we are unfortunate enough to have a Director-General for Fisheries who is from the north Atlantic and only learnt about fisheries problems when he was recently appointed to that post. Thus the question I ask the Minister is as follows: the proposal we know about from Morocco would in principle seem to entail cutting the fleet from Galicia, Andalusia, the Canaries, and also Portugal, that fishes in Moroccan waters, down to 25% at least. The agreement they propose is for two years instead of five, and in addition they want the European Union to pay them the ESP 21 billion that it is currently paying. Allow me to say that the political will shown in practice – not in theory – by the Community negotiators has been absolutely nil, or in any case inadequate. I must therefore express my scepticism about the result. I ask the Minister: do you believe it is acceptable to negotiate the cuts I have mentioned and the continuing cost to the European Union of the agreement with Morocco? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries acts on behalf of all of the European Union, irrespective of whether he comes from the north, south, east or west.</p>
<p class="contents">I can simply remind you how negotiations developed on the subject of fisheries. Commissioner Fischler held several meetings with the highest authorities in Morocco. Two technical meetings took place in Rabat on 25 July 2000 and in Brussels on 27 and 28 September 1999. During these technical meetings, the Community delegation, headed by Director General Smith, put forward several initiatives that it envisaged as part of a new Fisheries Agreement with Morocco to aid the development of the Moroccan fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It also tried to set out a calendar for negotiations. On this occasion, it must be said that Morocco did not respond to the offer made by the Community. The impression that the negotiations had collapsed, which affected all of us, led Commissioner Fischler to call for another meeting with Prime Minister Youssoufi, to take place on 16 October 2000, where he met King Mohammed VI, Prime Minister Youssoufi and the new Minister for Fisheries, Mr Chbaatores. These meetings seem to have revived the negotiation process and led to another meeting with a Moroccan delegation on 30 October 2000, therefore very recently. This is why I think we must set a limit and not be overly optimistic, but neither do we have any reason to be unreasonably pessimistic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: EU's energy policy</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner for Energy said recently that the energy issue in Europe was a national responsibility, not a Community one. At the outset of discussions for the Intergovernmental Conference (1996/1997) there was a suggestion that special provisions should be incorporated into the Treaty of Amsterdam which would pave the way for the drafting of a common energy policy. The suggestion was rejected by the 15 Member States, as was also the case for the Treaty of Maastricht. There are, naturally, measures concerning energy (the White Paper, the SAVE programme, EUR 1 billion from the Fifth Research Programme, alternative energy etc.). Despite all this, however, all the forecasts predict that the EU’s overall energy dependence (gas, oil, coal and uranium) will increase in the future. Given that developments in the oil markets make it necessary for the EU to adopt a more dynamic policy in the energy sector, how does the Council think it might achieve a reduction in the European economy’s dependence on oil? Have specific measures been taken (such as security of supplies and energy efficiency) to make the economies of the Member States less sensitive to external crises, and what are the Council’s methods and short-term and medium-term priorities for energy efficiency and energy saving? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Furthermore, in the communication adopted on 4 October 2000 on the European Union’s oil supply, the Commission indicated that, at the European Council of Göteborg, it was planning to present a plan to save energy and to promote the diversification of energy sources, which should help to boost energy efficiency, especially in buildings and transport.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the security of energy supplies, the Commission is planning to present a Green Paper, in November 2000, on the future and place of the different energy sources in the context of improving the security of the energy supply of the European Union. This communication will tackle both nuclear energy and renewable energies. Once it has been presented, the Council will certainly accord it the greatest priority.

You have presented these, and I thank you for that, but I also wanted to see if you could give us any information on, or your assessment of, whether the Council could perhaps progress towards closer cooperation, towards a sort of communitisation of energy policy given that, as we saw during the recent crisis, Member States are moving forward in a disorganised array and are competing amongst themselves in terms of both supplies and prices, and that the result for Europe as a whole is rather pathetic.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor will I conceal that I was looking for, perhaps, some ideas. Some of my fellow Members have suggested an idea, which I too endorse, of investigating or drawing up plans towards, for example, a policy imposing the euro as the sole means of paying for oil in certain countries. It is these questions above all which interest me and which, I think, are of special interest to all the citizens of Europe, because this dependence is not just quantitative but also economic and financial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A new bill being voted on in the USA has given rise to a storm of protest both in Cuba and in European. On the pretext of lifting the ban on sales from the USA to Cuba of primary necessities, medicines and medical equipment , the embargo is being considerably intensified and obstacles to trade are multiplying in the form of tighter restrictions on Americans travelling to Cuba, provisions – which are contrary to international trade rules – preventing US organisations and banks from financing sales, requiring guarantees by third countries or payment in cash.</p>
<p class="contents">What steps will the Council take to stop the adoption of this US bill, which is in breach of international trade rules, and what action will it take to secure the total lifting of the embargo on Cuba and the restoration of normal trade relations between Cuba and all other countries, in particular the Member States of the European Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The position of the European Union on the extra-territorial measures decreed by the United States has not changed. I believe it is well known to the Members of the European Parliament, and the European Union seizes every opportunity to remind the United States of it. However, it must be regretfully pointed out that the US Government has not yet taken any action regarding its own commitments under the agreement concluded at the London Summit in May 1998. We call on the US Government to do so, as we believe this is essential in resolving this dispute.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of the European Union regarding Cuba, as established in the common position on Cuba adopted by the Council on 2 December 1996, is to encourage a process of peaceful “transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people.” Encouraging the Cuban regime to bring Cuban legislation and its application into line with international standards also falls within this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same vein, at the time of the vote on the resolution on the embargo as part of the Third Commission of the General Assembly of the United Nations which met on 9 November 2000, we launched an appeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with international organisations defending human rights. The European Union notes with satisfaction that Cuba has continued to be very active in various international and regional forums. It also recognises that measures have been taken by the Cuban Government to better integrate the country into the region economically. The European Union notes the need for a progressive and irreversible opening of the Cuban economy towards the outside world and reaffirms its wish to be Cuba’s partner in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is with concern that the European Union takes note of the findings of the United Nations’ agencies and programmes on the ground. It deplores the negative, and often tragic, repercussions of the US economic embargo as they affect the Cuban population, especially women and children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And, the way in which you phrased your position gives me cause to wonder if, in the final analysis, there is any difference between the ultimate aim of the policy of the European Union on Cuba and the ultimate aim of American policy on Cuba.

I recalled the very clear differences between the United States and Europe regarding the extra-territorial measures decreed by the United States. I noted with satisfaction, on behalf of the Council, that Cuba had continued to be very active in various international and regional forums. I recognised that measures had been taken by the Cuban Government to better integrate their country economically into the region and reaffirmed Europe’s willingness to be Cuba’s partner in this process. Finally, I recalled that it was with concern that the European Union took note of the observations made by the United Nations’ agencies and programmes on the ground and deplored the negative, and often tragic, repercussions of the US economic embargo as they affected the Cuban population. So I, in fact, said practically the opposite of what you have just said.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I must remind you of the European Union’s position towards Cuba as established by the Council on 2 December 1996, which is to encourage a process of peaceful transition towards pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people. No position has been taken in relation to the nature of the regime, but the regime has perhaps been given a certain amount of encouragement or incentive to move its practices forward.</p>

It is therefore up to NATO to take the steps it deems necessary to prevent further accidents of this kind. This case has not, in any case, been brought up in the Council of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On the substance of the disputes between Turkey and Greece in the Aegean Sea, the Council recalls the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council which stress the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the United Nations Charter and which insistently call on applicant countries to make every effort to settle any border disputes and any other disputes of a similar nature. Failing that, they should take their disputes to the Court of Justice within a reasonable period. By the end of 2004 at the latest, the European Council will take stock of the situation regarding any outstanding disputes, especially with regard to their implications for the accession process and so as to promote their settlement through the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, issues relating to the settlement of the disputes between Greece and Turkey are included in the reinforced policy dialogue in the context of Turkey’s pre-accession strategy and the accession partnership the Commission has just proposed and which the French Presidency – as I can confirm – hopes will be adopted quickly. Moreover, the Council is gratified that, at their meeting in Budapest on 31 October, the Turkish and Greek Foreign Ministers agreed to adopt confidence building measures in the context of NATO, and to do so bilaterally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council refers in its reply to NATO as Pontius Pilate, without taking a position on Turkey's provocation in contesting Greek sovereign rights, on this occasion during NATO exercises. Does the Council not understand that this is a supremely political problem and that it is unacceptable for it to maintain a position which is equidistant from both the offender and the victim?</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, it is a fact that Turkey contests the Greek ten-mile FIR and the air corridors over the islands of Limnos and Ikaria, both of which are regulated by the Lausanne and Montreux conventions and in intergovernmental agreements between Turkey and Italy and Italy and Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it does not take account of the fact that NATO's legal service issued an opinion upholding Greece's aforementioned rights in accordance with international conventions, even though, under pressure from Turkey, NATO changed its exercise at the last minute. NATO's legal service, no less!</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and finally, does he not think that his reply is an encouragement to Turkey, a candidate country for membership of the European Union, to continue its present policy of contesting the sovereign rights of Greece, a member of the European Union and that he has therefore indirectly admitted that there are border disputes which must be resolved, as we have said, on the basis of international conventions? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
