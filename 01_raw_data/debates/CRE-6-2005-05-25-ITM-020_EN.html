<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to take advantage of the opportunity which I have to speak to Parliament in Greek, because this is an opportunity which, unfortunately, I do not have in the Commission, and to comment briefly, of course, on today's subject.</p>
<p class="contents">When I appeared before you during my hearing, I assured you that I would promote health issues and, above all, consumer safety. The subject of debate now, and the next subject, are achieving precisely this objective: they combine the promotion of health and, of course, consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a proposal which makes a very significant contribution to health, but also takes account of the needs of industry for a clear, clarified, common European regulatory framework, which still allows for innovation and competitiveness and strengthens the internal market, while at the same time providing consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Scheele, and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Mr Stubb.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, in an ideal world, consumers would get all the necessary nourishment from a healthy, standard diet. They would get all their nutrients through their normal diet. Unfortunately, however, this is no longer the case. Under today's conditions, with today's way of life, consumers need an additional boost to their diet, which is why it is useful to add both vitamins and inorganic salts – what we call minerals – to food.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers themselves want this, because the addition of these ingredients to food helps consumers to get satisfactory levels of these nutrients and to reduce the risks inherent in their deficiency as a result of insufficient consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">This particular proposal fully harmonises rules for the voluntary addition of nutrients, but does not affect provisions at national level – usually for public health reasons – or at Community level on the compulsory addition of nutrients.</p>
<p class="contents">The usual nutrients added are vitamins and minerals, which is why it is useful that the proposal specifically regulates these ingredients. However, use has increased over recent years not just of vitamins and minerals, but also of substances and ingredients which are used in an innovative way. That is why it is right that the proposal covers the safe use of these substances and, where considered necessary, brings them under the regulatory regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karin Scheele (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, the intention of the proposed regulation is to harmonise the different national provisions on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods. Discussions have shown, and will do so again today, that this is a very, very difficult task, firstly because we have different opinions on the extent to which the addition of such nutrients is necessary for a balanced diet, and secondly because traditions in the Member States of the European Union vary considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">In one Member State, for example, unlimited additions are permitted, provided that the end product does not present a health risk. In another Member State, additions are permitted only if it can be proved that they are necessary for a balanced and adequate diet. In between there are various different nuances, such as the Member States that permit the addition of those vitamins and minerals that are listed in a particular register. A variety of upper limits are also stipulated.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to underline that this regulation only regulates the voluntary addition of vitamins and minerals, and that national provisions on the mandatory addition of nutrients to foods are therefore not affected. According to Article 3 of this regulation, there are three reasons why vitamins and minerals may be added to foods: firstly, to restore nutrient levels in the end product, as the various stages in the storage and manufacturing process cause nutrients to be lost; secondly, when producing substitute foods, the most well<span class="bold">–</span>known example here being undoubtedly margarine, which was originally manufactured as a substitute for butter, and thirdly, the addition of vitamins and minerals to fortify the food, regardless of whether the nutrient was present in it originally or not.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic premise on which my report is based is that the Community should work towards a situation in which manufacturers add vitamins and minerals to food for nutritional and health reasons. I am therefore delighted that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted my amendments stating that all vitamins and minerals that are added to food must also be able to be absorbed by the body. Otherwise consumers are being misled and in extreme cases there may even be adverse effects on health, such as diarrhoea or reduced absorption of other nutrients.</p>
<p class="contents">The two issues in this report that gave raise to the most heated discussion were without a doubt the nutrient profiles and the question of whether the so<span class="bold">–</span>called other substances should be regulated by means of a positive or a negative list. I think that the proper place for nutrient profiles is in the Poli Bortone report on health claims, and I hope that the amendments about nutrient profiles that have been tabled to that proposal – as you now the report will be debated next – also receive majority support.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that it would be wrong to establish nutrient profiles in my report. It is not a question of being consistent or saying that we need nutrient profiles in both reports or in neither of them. If we establish the nutrient profiles here, then we will not only be banning the health claims, but also the product itself. This seems to me to be wrong, although I am aware that some of my colleagues in my group will be supporting these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the certain other substances, I propose a definition of the other substances, as the vitamins and minerals allowed for fortification are listed and thus defined in Annexes I and II. Article 9a is an important contribution, enabling adequate information to be gained about the certain other substances that are being added. Within 18 months of the regulation’s entry into force, the Member States will have to notify the Commission of the other substances used in their territory to enrich foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">Annex III regulates the use of the other substances. The Commission is proposing a negative list, which I, as rapporteur, support. This means that at the request of the Commission or a Member State, the other substances are subject to a risk assessment by the EFSA and are then placed in one of the following categories: prohibited substances and substances whose use is restricted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like to raise three points for you. First, I welcome the Commission’s proposal. It strikes a good balance on two accounts: it pushes forward the internal market by making it easier for food manufacturers to trade across borders; and it enhances consumer protection and gives us more safety and confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is perhaps a slight criticism of the Commission relating to the part of the proposal where the Commission says it should apply to matters that are as yet undefined. In my mind that would amount to giving a blank cheque. My argument would be that if you know the substances, tell us. If you do not know, come back. Perhaps that is something you could rectify at second reading, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important to harmonise those vitamins and minerals that can and cannot be added and the quantities involved. At the same time, it is important that Member States be able to impose some restrictions, as long as they are based on scientific evidence that there is a real risk to public health.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the proposal is sound, especially in the light of the European Parliament’s amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The addition of vitamins and minerals to a very wide variety of foods is a response to a reality – this needs to be stated – much more than simply to a fashion, the reality of a general change in our eating habits. For example, iron<span class="bold">–</span>enriched breakfast cereals have in many cases replaced meat as the principal source of iron in children’s food, and that is just one example among many. That is why we must, in my view, show flexibility on this subject. Let us, therefore, say ‘yes’ to better labelling, but ‘no’ to protectionism and to certain derogations as proposed in Amendment 39. ‘No’, finally, to drawing up a positive list for the whole range of new substances.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish, but I could have started with this, by asking Commissioner Kyprianou a question: when do you expect to implement the better regulation advocated by several members of the Commission, including you and Commissioner Verheugen? Let me explain. Slicing legislation up like salami – fortifications, health and nutrition claims, food supplements, directives on labelling and more besides – brings nothing but restrictions to us as legislators. Technical aspects are increasingly taking over from policy ones. Therefore, particularly in the interests of SMEs and consumers who, if they are going to believe in Europe, need clear, transparent and effective legislation, I hope that the Commission will very soon adopt this overall, consistent approach that we need in the field of food sector legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Differences among countries in legislative provisions governing this issue create barriers to the free movement of goods. Moreover, regulation at the European level would ensure that the same standards be applied in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The addition of vitamins, minerals, and additives to foodstuffs is often abused. Food producers use them to increase the attractiveness of their products by claiming that they contain more vitamins than other products, which is often not true. This creates the danger that consumers may increase their consumption of certain foods in the false belief that they are healthier and safer than other foods.</p>
<p class="contents">We are often exposed to misleading advertisements claiming that the addition of a vitamin or another substance to a food product protects consumers from cancer or other diseases of ‘civilisation’. Foodstuffs that have a high content of calories, fats, or sugar do not, however, become healthier solely because they contain added vitamins or other substances.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure legal certainty and transparency, a positive list of substances whose addition to foods is permitted should be drawn up in order to avoid the enrichment of foods with substances that may be dangerous. At the same time, recommended minimum and maximum daily doses should be specified for certain substances.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the introduction of nutrition profiles. I believe it is the best way to secure the uniform control of food safety for different groups of consumers, be they children, pregnant women, or the elderly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also believe that this report constitutes a further step towards creating a European single market, precisely in the food sector, and that it also brings us a step closer to providing comprehensive consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to focus on the other substances because, given their different nature and function, they cannot be treated in the same way as vitamins and minerals. That is why I believe it is wrong to wish also to apply all of the provisions for minerals and vitamins to these other substances at all costs. We need to consider which of the provisions that are foreseen for vitamins and minerals would also make sense for these other substances. However, this regulation should not take on the mammoth task of harmonising the thousand other substances that are currently used in the European food industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In taking on such a project, we would, for years, be tying up the European institutions and above all the European Food Safety Authority with the complex task of drawing up detailed risk assessments for substances, which for the most part have never given cause for health concerns, and this would hamper them in the other work they do. I believe, therefore, that our priorities should lie elsewhere. That is why I support the approach chosen by the Commission, which simply wants to create a legal instrument for other substances that can serve, if required, to regulate certain other substances across the Community, if they are classified as possibly raising health concerns by the European Food Safety Authority, and thus to guarantee a uniform level of protection for all European consumers. For everything else we can confidently live with the present system, which leaves authorisation of other substances to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, the ‘positive list’ proposed by some Members does not make much sense either. Such a list would go way beyond our objectives and in practice would simply not be feasible. In the short term, we should therefore consider which of the thousand other substances should be included in such a list from the outset. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Numerous studies have shown that, in comparison to food produced by industrial agriculture, organic food has higher levels of easily<span class="bold">–</span>absorbed vitamins, minerals and other health<span class="bold">–</span>promoting substances.

<p class="contents">Research has shown that the consumption of fortified foodstuffs within a varied diet can contribute significantly to the ingestion of nutrients. The important thing is that fortification be based on scientific criteria and that the agri<span class="bold">–</span>food industries operating in the European Union be subject to common rules, and that is precisely the objective of this proposal: the harmonisation of the differing national provisions on fortifications, within the limits required in order to guarantee food safety, of course. We in the PPE-DE, therefore, cannot agree with the inclusion of provisions allowing for the existence of stricter rules in the States, unless they can be justified on the grounds of a proven risk to public health. Neither do we in my group agree with the introduction of nutrient profiles, and, in fact, the Commission has not introduced them into the proposal. They are neither necessary nor appropriate in this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We enjoy a very varied food supply in the European Union and we cannot imagine that we can put an end to obesity and persuade the Europeans to eat properly by means of standards and labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution is much more complex. Foodstuffs must be healthy, of course, and the consumer must be provided with reliable information, but the really important thing is the diet that each person chooses and the lifestyle they live. Consumer education, therefore, is more effective than rules, so that consumers can exercise their freedom of choice on the basis of reliable criteria. With regard to the other substances in Annex 3, I must say that their potential restriction must be based solely on safety criteria and we do not, therefore, support the amendments aimed at introducing positive lists to regulate these substances.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that manufacturers, particularly small and medium<span class="bold">–</span>sized businesses, must be given sufficient time to adapt to the new provisions laid down in the Regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposal which exists today basically covers three issues. Firstly, it regulates the composition of foods by creating a list of acceptable vitamins and minerals with upper and lower limits, in order to ensure, of course, that products are safe. There are provisions relating to labelling, advertising and the presentation of fortified foods which provide a basis for analysis and, where judged necessary, for regulating the addition of certain other substances.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as food supplements are concerned, I would reiterate that they are foods; other relevant legislation only regulates their vitamin and mineral content, but not other substances which they may contain. That is why they should not be completely excluded from this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the question of vitamins and minerals is concerned, the proposal is aiming for their full harmonisation and I think that this covers the question of better regulation, because better regulation does not mean no regulation. This is something which is dealt with precisely by having Community legislation. I agree on this point with Mrs Belohorská, who said that uniform Community legislation helps both industry and consumers in the most effective way possible and we do not have 25 different, fragmented sets of rules at various levels.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as other substances are concerned, there is limited harmonisation here in order precisely to take account of the peculiarities of these elements. However, Annex III to the proposal provides the possibility, if and where needed, for a rapid response if, of course, it is considered that the consumption of these substances in such quantities might be a health risk.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I could accept amendments which clarify the question of other substances, but not excessive additions to the number of substances examined and I believe that this approach, as set out in the proposal for Annex III, which will include substances which are considered to be a risk to human health, is the best approach, instead of having a positive list, and I am delighted that the majority tends in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say that, for me, the recommendation on better information for industry and, of course, for consumers through increased notifications to the Commission, which will also be published, is a good thing. However, we need to find the most correct and effective way of achieving this without creating an excessive administrative burden. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
