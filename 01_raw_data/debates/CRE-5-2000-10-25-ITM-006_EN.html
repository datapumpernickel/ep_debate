We have just improved Paragraph 19. But as a result of this little textual substitution we have let fall by the wayside an important principle that the European Parliament has always called for. The fact is that, whatever our opinion on either side, whether we are for or against a constitution, we all agree that our Parliament should give its assent. Thanks to this substitution, the term found in the original paragraph has been left out.</p>
<p class="contents">So, with the agreement of Olivier Duhamel, the rapporteur, I suggest incorporating this principle in the last line of Paragraph 20, which would therefore read as follows: “from the moment the process is initiated up to the approval (after receiving the assent of the European Parliament) of the final version of the Constitution”.

It is extremely important and we commend the European Parliament which played a very important role in the campaign to ban anti-personnel mines. The NGOs have played a fundamental role. They have pushed for a long time to get this through while some governments were very reluctant, saying it was unrealistic. But if the will is there a lot can be achieved. Governments must take a leading role and be forced to sign the Convention. They must insist upon the new applicant countries signing the Convention as well.</p>
<p class="contents">When you look at what is happening around the world, it is intolerable that long after wars have ended people continue to suffer as a result of landmines. Innocent civilians, women and men, and particularly children have been maimed and killed as a result of a weapon that was in place long after the war ended. The idea that industries make money out of such inhumane materials is quite unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Someone mentioned earlier the other weapons that are produced. We must look at the production of all weapons, not just landmines, especially in the European Union since we must look outside our own front door first. It is not acceptable or ethical that we are providing jobs or making money with things that kill, maim and injure people. We should seek alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that technology, know-how and money is spent on creating weapons that destroy people and the environment is unacceptable. The move on landmines shows that progress can be made towards a humane society which does not profit from death and destruction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s communication sets out what actions the Community has already participated in to combat the use of anti-personnel mines. Denmark has participated in humanitarian mine clearance on a number of occasions when the intervention concerned has been civil rather than military. There has therefore been no conflict with the Danish opt-out in the field of defence.</p>
<p class="contents">The actions were financed with resources from many different budget lines. The Commission therefore proposes that initiatives be taken to set up a horizontal budget line.

It is therefore also difficult right now to predict whether the initiative will clash with the Danish opt-out.

For the rest, the rapporteur calls on Parliament to approve the supposed social policy the Commission has proposed to the Council, in other words, to approve a total vacuum, for there is not a single practical measure likely to improve the situation of the workers. There is nothing to force big firms to create jobs and they can even carry on shedding jobs when they make big profits.</p>
<p class="contents">The leaders of the European Union are asking the two sides of industry to play a greater part in the areas of employment that come within their remit, but that is pure cynicism. As if employers and employees were actually on an equal footing when it came to hiring. It is like accusing the jobless of being at least partially to blame for their own unemployment. So, while we voted to endorse the elementary social rights, in abstaining, we have rejected the general policy of complicity with the brutal practices of big business, which, throughout Europe, is making workers redundant, holding wages in check, creating more widespread job insecurity and weakening social protection.</p>

<p class="contents">This agenda, which goes back to an initiative by the French Presidency, is a genuine programme of work for the next five years. It is in keeping with the decisions of the Lisbon European Council, whose main conclusions relate to establishing a more competitive knowledge-based economy and achieving full employment.</p>
<p class="contents">It was drawn up in consultation with the European institutions and the NGOs, which were kept fully involved. The Van Lancker report takes account of some of the proposals made by civil society and experts at the joint conference on the subject between the European Commission and the European Parliament on 21 and 22 September 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">So this agenda sends out a strong political message to European citizens, who all too often perceive Europe as merely the creation of a large market. It highlights the existence and reality of the European social model, but also the need to bring it up to date.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have the right to disappoint our citizens. The social agenda must therefore be very ambitious in order to confirm that social, economic and employment policies are closely interlinked and interacting, and that they must have equal status in the Community policy triangle, with the aim of improving the social quality of life for all. Indeed, social policy must be a policy in its own right, with its own objectives. It cannot be seen solely as an adjunct of economic and employment policy or as a by-product of creating a large single market, and even less as mere “dross”.</p>
<p class="contents">In the five years to come, we will have to create quality jobs, anticipate and manage the adjustments to the new social environment, draw on the opportunities offered by a knowledge-based economy, modernise and improve social protection, promote social inclusion, encourage gender equality, reinforce fundamental rights and combat discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the adoption at Nice of this social agenda, which, together with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, shows that we have reached a turning point in European integration, which, at present, seeks to strengthen the social and civil fabric of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that key social problems within our community are solved and tackled head-on. In this regard, I welcome the acceptance by the European Commission of the Irish Government’s Human Resources Operational Programme for the seven-year period 2000-2006.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very fair and balanced social programme and is one of the very central planks of the Irish Government’s National Development Plan for the seven-year period post-1999. It will ensure that opportunities will be given to those who are unskilled and uneducated. Particular emphasis will be placed on putting in place schemes to help the long-term unemployed as well as to help those who are early school leavers.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a recognition in this plan, which is reflected in the EU Social Policy Agenda 2000-2005, of the need to ensure that re-training opportunities are given to people in the existing workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Social Policy Agenda recognises that re-training opportunities must be given in the field of technology and Internet activities for the existing workforce. Technology is changing so rapidly that if the European Union is to keep a competitive edge then our European Union workforce must be equipped with the necessary computer skills.</p>
<p class="contents">Adaptability of the workforce and the encouragement of entrepreneur skills are also central planks of the Irish Government’s plans for the next seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">For this policy to be a success at home and for it to succeed within the broader European Union context then it is an imperative that second-level and third-level institutions put in place policies to implement entrepreneurship in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It offers a global and coherent vision of what a genuine social policy could look like, by linking economic, social and employment aspects. It uses all the instruments that now exist at European Union level – the Social Charter, the employment chapter, the legal base of Article 13 – to combat all forms of discrimination, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur endorses the European Commission's proposals, while supplementing them with a call for stronger European social legislation. He calls for the role of the social partners concerned, and dialogue with them, to be reinforced in the framing of legislation. However, in the event of dispute, our committee urges the executive Commission to make use of its right of initiative and to propose adequate legislation. It is important to achieve a more social Europe, therefore to have more European social legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the rapporteur asks us to support the Member States in their endeavours to establish a minimum wage and the right to a minimum pension so that every individual can live in dignity.</p>

Rarely do such conservatively socialistic reports find their way into the European Parliament plenary sitting as this report of Mrs Van Lancker’s on the EU’s socio-political programme that we voted for. In her programme declaration, Mrs Van Lancker says she would like to implement all those measures whose very implementation people sought to prevent by voting in a non-socialist majority in the European Parliament in the last elections. I repeat, ‘prevent’.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall be quite appalled if the Commission really intends to support these totally unrealistic, almost absurd demands, which have just been approved. Parliament’s proposals could not be more at odds with the aims of Lisbon. At Lisbon the mainly socialist leaders of the EU governments declared aloud their aim to make Europe the world’s most dynamic and competitive economy.</p>
<p class="contents">If Mrs Van Lancker’s proposals are adopted we shall definitely be stepping back light years in terms of our ability to achieve the important, ambitious and indispensable aims of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">What then does the good lady propose? According to Mrs Van Lancker, working hours in Europe must be shortened significantly, the body of EU socio-political legislation must be increased substantially, the levels of social protection in Europe must be raised massively, the power of the Trade Union movement increased and supranational labour market negotiations made possible, labour organisations must be given greater rights to be heard, and socio-political influence must be a priority in all sectors of the economy, in competition policy and in public procurements.</p>

Your concept of open cooperation is a reversion to an institutional system dominated by Commission officials. The only thing that is truly open, wide open, is the possibility of extending the powers of Brussels to infinity, without ever referring back to square one and the Treaties.

<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal for a new social policy agenda is a good document. The Commission’s work defines a number of areas within which cooperation and coordination between the European Union’s Member States is important. The Commission’s new political agenda proposes a framework in which all important actors can play a role and in which the differences between the national systems are respected. The Commission will use its right of initiative and support the Member States in bringing necessary changes about.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Van Lancker wants Parliament to decide whether to alter the Commission’s proposal, mainly through, firstly, adding a number of areas to which legislation is applicable and, secondly, through establishing a number of rights at European level. Mrs Van Lancker believes that significantly more use should be made of compulsory instruments. The Commission must not be prevented from using its right of initiative in those areas in which it has the power to act and to propose compulsory instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Our basic attitude towards the European Union is a very positive one. In our capacity as Swedish Liberals, we see European integration as a possible way of achieving solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across the borders, human rights and conflict management. In these areas, Europe’s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions must be made as close as possible to those they affect. That is why we are actively pushing the issue of a constitution for the European Union in which the distribution of responsibilities is clear to everyone. It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU must only deal with those issues it is best placed to deal with, namely the cross-border issues. All other issues must be dealt with at local, regional or national levels.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that the Commission’s proposal for a social policy agenda ties in well with our view of how the EU needs to operate. A form of European cooperation which leads to coordination and more prosperity is the right course of action. The European social systems differ from each other to such an extent that compulsory legislation will not lead to an appropriate result. We wish therefore to support the Commission’s proposal and are consequently voting against Mrs Van Lancker’s report on the social policy agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst in view of global trends the European single market is developing in a dynamic way, and there is ever closer economic and monetary union, social union is generally treated like a ghost at the feast.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Treaty of Amsterdam was agreed in 1997, the Union has had new instruments for enhancing social policy. And since the Lisbon Summit in March 2000, it has been the Council's intention, in addition to high growth and more skilled jobs, also to aim for greater social cohesion. With the third social action programme, the Commission is underscoring the recognition that economic policy, employment policy and social policy need to be more closely interlinked.</p>
<p class="contents">Employability is providing evidence of this interlinking. In order to make the transition from the industrial society to the knowledge society, people – and not just young people – need better knowledge and skills. This means that the Member States have to invest more in education and training, multilingualism, mobility and communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the demands made in the Van Lancker report are not acceptable. For example, the Luxembourg process which applies to employment policy is to be extended to social protection and social exclusion. This method of determining Community objectives and implementing national action programmes which are assessed annually – including by the European Parliament – is so successful precisely because new qualitative and quantitative objectives are formulated whilst simultaneously strictly adhering to the principle of subsidiarity. It cannot arbitrarily be transferred to other areas, as specific procedures are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Christian Social Party does not support the right to a minimum income or a standard pension. Nor do we accept the renewed demands for a reduction in legal working hours at European level. It is far inferior to flexible working arrangements, as the experience of many European companies has demonstrated.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the request that there should be a legal basis for NGOs to regulate a "civil dialogue" is not acceptable. The rapporteur has departed from the principle of subsidiarity out of a sheer desire to adopt centralist solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as the Group of the European People's Party's key amendments have just obtained a substantial majority, I have voted for the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We find that statement rather disturbing and at this point I would like to refer, among other things, to two matters that cause us serious concern. Firstly, the Commission has proposed communitising – i.e. introducing by means of qualified majority voting in the Council without ratification by the national parliaments – international trade negotiations on services and intellectual property, a possibility indeed already opened by Article 132(5) of the Treaty of Amsterdam. But we regard this transfer as very dangerous, for it would deprive the national parliaments of any right of inspection in regard to future WTO negotiations on these areas that are vital to the life of our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is worse to come. The Commission added negotiations on investments to the list of subjects to be communitised. If that proposal were accepted, we may be sure that in the coming six months the Commission would impose another version of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment on us, the infamous MAI which it was possible to reject, two years ago, only because it came under strictly intergovernmental procedures. So, once again, the Commission is behaving shamefully in trying to strip the national democracies of their powers, without at the same time making us stronger, contrary to what it says.</p>
<p class="contents">The second category of decisions that would cause us concern if they were to be decided by qualified majority voting relates to immigration and the international movement of persons, which, under Article 67 of the EC Treaty, require unanimity for at least five years after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam but can then be decided by a majority. The Commission is calling for this changeover as of now. We energetically reject it. In this field, we have learned from experience that any transfer of power to the Commission encourages a lax attitude, while any maintenance of Member State power encourages attitudes that promote security, relatively speaking. We opt for security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The major powers, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and, to some extent, Italy, are all agreed in their desire to dominate the small countries of Eastern or Southern Europe that are applying for accession to the European Union. At the same time, each country is seeking to ensure its own supremacy and to guarantee the interests of its own industrial or financial groups. The way is being prepared not just for a two-speed Europe, but for the introduction of less developed countries into the arena dominated by the large predators of the European economy. On the outside, these countries are already preyed on, and they will continue to be so on the inside.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the only reason the meeting of Heads of State and Government signed it was in order to be seen to make a statement. The signed document remains vague on elementary human rights, social protection and the freedom of movement of third country nationals. The only area in which it is precise is on the right of ownership and entrepreneurial freedom, which only concerns owners of capital. We have no intention whatsoever of accepting either the Biarritz Summit decisions or what will be decided at the coming summit in Nice.</p>

In fact, I do not agree with the inclusion in the Treaty of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, since that would be the first step on the way to its constitutionalisation, a federalist pathway that I will not go down. Secondly, nor do I agree with the indiscriminate generalisation of qualified majority voting, a measure which if divorced from the others on the table may conflict with important national interests, and which even contradicts the request expressed in Paragraph 7 of the resolution. It was precisely this Paragraph 7 that enabled me to abstain.</p>
<p class="contents">By not voting against the resolution I am trying to support any initiative that will put an end to the antagonistic atmosphere between large and small countries in which the debate on institutional reform has taken place, and which unfortunately has to a great extent been instigated by the French Presidency. As Paragraph 7 says, it is absolutely necessary to ensure that solutions are valid and acceptable to all Member States, regardless of their size or economic weight.

The demand that the Charter be incorporated into the Treaties is therefore all the more premature. This is also true because in contrast to the European Human Rights Convention, which was ratified by the Member States, the process of formulating political demands and objectives in this respect has not taken place in national parliaments.

<p class="contents">From 1951 in Paris, to 1997 in Amsterdam, via 1957 in Rome, what has been going on? Europe was created by Treaties concluded, obviously, between equal states. Moreover, over and above the legal aspect, Europe is a great family of civilisations in emotional terms. We all have the same home. Now, the idea of closer cooperation means that in crucial areas, such as money, defence and taxation, some members of the European family would have more rights and obligations than others.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, among those sitting round the table of the common European home, some would eat <span class="italic">à la carte</span> while others would get the dish of the day. Some would have a say about money while others, like Denmark or Sweden, would have to hold their tongue.</p>
<p class="contents">As we saw before the existence of total, universal suffrage, there would be active “peoples” and observer “peoples”. There would, in a sense, be “males” with the right to talk war, taxes and money and, as in pre-1945 France, “females” sitting round the table with no right to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in this ‘variable-geometry’ Europe, the number of guests with the right to eat <span class="italic">à la carte</span> would vary depending on the subject under discussion in the European Council of Ministers and this state of affairs would create further complexity in a Europe whose way of operating is already quite obscure.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the philosopher's stone of closer cooperation, which would allow the rule of unanimity and the right of veto, which protects national interests, to be circumvented on the sly, would achieve the amazing feat of violating the principle of equality between states, excluding minority nations from key issues, thus opening up cracks in the democratic foundations of European integration, making the European institutions even less transparent and spreading confusion, if not disarray, within the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the technocratic smokescreen and verbal fog are conceal machinations intended to foist on the peoples a military and fiscal Europe that they do not want and to deprive them of their right to say no to the loss of their national freedoms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Biarritz Summit was heralded as the decisive Summit which would affirm fundamental rights, all rights, even rights never conceived of previously, as if the European Communities and their constituent States had hitherto lived in total chaos. And yet our countries do not appear to be the least attentive countries in the world to human rights. There is always room for improvement, of course, and democratic control must not be found wanting in this respect, but we did not feel that cataloguing these rights and including them in the Treaties should be the European Union's top priority. Moreover, even the Heads of State and Government have not been able to reach agreement on this issue, and it is to be carried over to the forthcoming Nice Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet there are so many urgent issues to be dealt with: 1) the need to define an economic policy which will rescue the euro from the stagnant depths to which it has plunged and boost employment; 2) the need to attract investment to the Union in order to break out of the economic slump; 3) the need to revise employment regulations to make the market more dynamic and more responsive; or 4) the need to define a common line for a coherent diplomatic action to safeguard peace in the Middle East, etc. All of these issues are extremely important and urgent in terms of the Union's future and the function which it ought to be performing in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as is often the case with these summits, the celebratory final declarations conceal a reality which is much more banal: the Fifteen have not succeeded in establishing a common policy and the progress made with the unveiling of rights does not take away from the need to tackle the practical problems encountered by millions of families and entire categories of producers and workers. A summit which tackles these issues would show the validity of such an institution once and for all, and would send a signal of confidence and hope to the citizens of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the explanatory statement, the rapporteur says a little more about this and maintains that the Treaty is already broadly supranational, largely as a result of the Court of Justice’s case-law interpretations. In our view, however, the interpretations of 15 judges, which go beyond the Treaties as ratified, are clearly improper and we are still waiting for them to be submitted for the approval of the peoples of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Elsewhere, the rapporteur repeats the new theory in vogue in Brussels of the supposed dual legitimacy of the European Union: that of the citizens represented by the European Parliament and that of the States represented by the Council. That is not the theory as set out in the Treaty, which recognises only one form of legitimacy, namely, and I quote, that of: “the peoples of the States brought together in the Community”, according to the wording of Articles 189 and 190 of the EC Treaty. This wording means that the Community brings together only the States, each of which depends on the support of its people.</p>
<p class="contents">In no case do the MEPs represent the European citizens in general. They represent their respective peoples and, by that token, cooperate in the European scrutiny of the States, but that scrutiny remains complementary, because the main power of scrutiny falls within the remit of the national parliaments. In other words, the fact that MEPs represent their respective peoples in no way modifies the nature of the Community. It in no way has the effect of placing some phantom European citizen above the national citizens, even less of placing an artificial European democracy above the national democracies or even on the same footing with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with what Mr Berthu has said, that the idea of a single state with a single constitution completely undermines the national sovereignty of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This project has been sold on the idea of a constitution for the people, which is all well and good, but if you have a single constituency you are diluting the power of the individuals in the Member States. There has been talk about referenda and the amendments that were made to this report in relation to referenda. Referenda are very important, but in the case of a single constituency, where you ignore almost 50% in a Member State who may vote against it, this is not democratic. It is interesting to see people putting forward the idea of a referendum in this way because if you consider the changes that have taken place in the treaties over the years, the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty of Amsterdam, very few citizens in the individual Member States have had a say and, as a result, we are not sure what the citizens in the Member States want.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent referendum in Denmark on the euro shows there are very many people who, given the opportunity, would make different statements to those made in this House, but they do not have that opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Only 40 per cent of people voted in the 1999 elections to the European Parliament, if countries with voting duties are discounted, as well as those which had national elections at the same time as elections to the European Parliament. This just goes to show how little enthusiasm there was for the EU federalist project in 1999. Now, in September 2000, the Danes have voted against membership of EMU, and people in a number of other Member States would certainly have voted against the EMU project, given the opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting to note that, on the night of the EMU referendum last month, the Danish Social Democrats were exultant when the votes from the upper class areas had been counted and disappointed when they saw how people in working-class areas had voted. This ought to act as a wake-up call to the fact that something is going wrong in the development of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of these setbacks for the idea of a federal EU State, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has now produced a further report designed to produce a constitution for the EU, in spite of the fact that this is not in any way something which people are demanding.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed instead is a clearer definition of the ‘proximity principle’ in the European Union. At present, this principle is merely a tool for the EU itself, for it is at present at EU level that it is decided where the political decisions are to be made, with the result that the EU is claiming policy area after policy area for itself. What is more, there is a need to simplify the flexibility rules so that they do more to facilitate European cooperation in accordance with the wishes of the people of Europe. Moreover, those areas which do not concern the European Union and in which the Member States have the sovereign right to make decisions ought to be carefully demarcated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To this end, it is essential that the European Union should move towards a Constitution that incorporates the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The experience of a full democracy in the European Union has everything to gain from the approval of a Constitution that is clear, simple, readable and a source of reference for all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese socialist MEPs do not, however, agree that ratification of this ‘Constitution’ should necessarily be carried out by means of a referendum.

<p class="contents">This choice should be made independently and freely and should not have to depend on an imposed measure that might clash with the constitutional practice of an individual country.

<p class="contents">It is not built for the people, for there is not a single word on the social content of Europe.

<p class="contents">This own-initiative report by Mr Duhamel can be classed as one that were better not written, especially at this point in time. For as things stand in the various Member States, it risks being rather counterproductive at a time when the top priority is not a very broad debate on a constitution but rather the drafting of a treaty that will allow the European Union to digest enlargement without endangering the Community method, which is the key to the success of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">In this ‘constitution versus treaty’ debate, I tend to place more trust in Jacques Delors than in Mr Duhamel and those who supported him in submitting this report. As Jacques Delors rightly pointed out at a meeting of our Committee on Constitutional Affairs scarcely a month ago, the term ‘constitution’ is extremely ambiguous.</p>
<p class="contents">He told us that he, like the majority of politicians, had been given to believe that we would prefer our relations with other countries to be governed by international treaty. In a framework of that kind – and I am still referring to Jacques Delors’s words – we would agree to exercise joint sovereignty in certain fields.</p>
<p class="contents">But a constitution is something else entirely. It refers to a single state. A constitution would commit the Member States to venturing onto very dangerous ground, which could lead a constitutional court to gradually deprive the nations of the prerogatives the states intend to continue exercising. A good treaty is worth more than a treaty that can be dubbed a constitution. That is the last of Jacques Delors’s observations.</p>
<p class="contents">In complete agreement with the common sense of Jacques Delors’s words, I did not vote in favour of Mr Duhamel’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">By its very nature a Constitution may, in the form in which it is sometimes contradictorily put forward for Europe, both serve as a way to ‘civilise’ the Union, on the basis of democracy and citizenship, and also be the instrument for a ‘clarification’ of competences, a chalk circle which formally and definitively constrains the Union and its bodies to very particular and specific competences.</p>
<p class="contents">The constitutionalisation of the Treaties may either bring about the development of the Union and uphold its political competences, or in contrast it may be no more than an enshrined formalisation of the principle of subsidiarity. Strangely, many MEPs and even Prime Minister Blair support a European Constitution.</p>

It has been noted – rightly so – that over the years, there has been a useless build-up of long and complex treaties, and it would be good if these were to be re-written as one brief and readable framework treaty, which makes it clear to everyone what has been agreed so far. At the same time, a case has been made in favour of a European Constitution, comprising this framework treaty as well as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and laying down the role of the European political groups. Despite the recognition that the national identity of the Member States must be respected and that national citizenship need not be abolished, this report has a strong leaning towards a centralised European superstate according to the US model. I gladly support an extension of the social fundamental rights and a structure of political decision-making which is understandable and accessible to all European citizens. For this purpose, all we need is for the existing treaties to be rewritten and for the EU to sign the Council of Europe Convention on the protection of human rights and dignity of the human being which has been in existence for a long time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is true in terms of the understanding shown both of the national parliaments and their constitutional committees and of the European Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs. In practice, the Convention’s presidency has produced its own summary of the views which the various participants are taken to have arrived at.

<p class="contents">Until the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, Europe was an intergovernmental super-syndicate. With the Treaty of Amsterdam and the extension of the codecision procedure, the European Parliament has effectively set Europe on the road to political integration and supranationality.</p>

<p class="contents">We agree with the general principles laid down by the report, to the effect that closer cooperation should be developed within the European Union’s institutional frameworks and that the political and legal conditions established by the Treaty of Amsterdam for introducing closer cooperation are aimed at limiting the risk of a breach of the ties of solidarity between the Member States and the risk of a disintegration in the common legal area.</p>
<p class="contents">We recognise that, where the pace and scope of European integration are concerned, a certain degree of differentiation within the process may be useful in so far as the common objectives are preserved and the differentiation is perceived as a tool used on an exceptional basis, in a transitional period and with due respect for the fact that it is entirely up to those countries which are not a part of the enhanced cooperation process to decide whether – and, in certain cases, when – they wish to accede to those areas covered by closer cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">If we cannot vote in favour of the report, it is because we cannot support the proposed changes to the political and legal conditions required for closer cooperation. Removing the conditions which state that closer cooperation must remain within the framework of the Treaty and removing the right of veto and the opportunity for bringing the issue up in the European Council would constitute a breach of the quite fundamental principles according to which European cooperation in the EU operates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report proposes abolishing the right of veto, which would in reality mean that countries which are very keen on further integration could forge ahead without having broad democratic support. The ulterior motive is to be able to continue the development towards ‘ever closer union’ without being hampered by the enlargement to which the EU countries have committed themselves. Enhanced cooperation would cause most policies, including the most sensitive ones, to be centralised to a still greater degree than they are already. In this way, Mr Gil-Robles proposes discontinuing the common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider, however, that future development will increase the need for far more varied and flexible cooperation in Europe. To allow decisions on ever more important topics to be made on the basis of qualified majority voting would be in conflict with basic democratic standards. Countries with a tradition of holding referendums before surrendering sovereignty may in future be in danger of finding themselves in a situation in which a proposal that is rejected nationally is adopted at EU level. Those countries which are not so keen on integration are left with a poor alternative, namely that of copying the legislation without having any real say in it. What they cannot do, however, is avoid the pioneer countries’ legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities wants a freer and more flexible Europe in which there is no pressure to be involved in everything.

In fact, although this report tends to introduce a little more flexibility into the highly inflexible system laid down by Title VII of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is welcome, the final result is still far from adequate. It reflects far too monolithic a concept of the Union, under which all forms of cooperation would have to operate within a ‘single institutional framework’ and would necessarily be directed towards the objective creating a super-state.</p>
<p class="contents">The Gil-Robles report even proposes bringing the common foreign and security policy and the common defence policy within the purview of reinforced cooperation, thus centralising those policies even more than they are at present (Paragraph 4).</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals are not acceptable; the need for cooperation within Europe is genuine, but also diverse and multiform, and it can no longer be locked into a uniform Community framework based on majority voting. Furthermore, the report, and this is a significant omission, contains no explanation as to how cooperation procedures involving one third of Member States could actually be made to work within the existing institutions without reforming those institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, the European Parliament is practising delay tactics. Parliament wished earlier to prevent the emergence of differentiated forms of cooperation in the Treaty of Amsterdam, but was finally forced to give way and accept ‘reinforced cooperation’. It is now attempting to prevent reinforced cooperation being made more flexible, but here too it will eventually lose.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that what ought to be termed ‘differentiated’ cooperation procedures should not have to follow predetermined lines in their objectives; nor should there be limits on their creation or constraints on their operation. Some procedures could use the Community framework should this be found desirable, others could create their own ad hoc institutions, linked to the Union only by a liaison secretariat. Finally, differentiated cooperation should preferably operate on the basis of the unanimity principle, thus avoiding any relapse into the disadvantages of the Community method. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, some Member States that wanted to deepen their cooperation and go beyond the integration provided for in the Treaties developed various instruments, such as the Social Chapter, the Schengen Agreements, Economic and Monetary Union, etc. This enabled them to advance at different rates and/or with different objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the use of these instruments was formalised by the introduction of the concept of ‘closer cooperation’ into the Treaty on European Union (Title VII) and the Treaty establishing the European Community (Article 11).</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this form of cooperation is to allow a limited number of Member States that are able and willing to move forward to deepen European integration, provided they respect the European Union’s single institutional framework. In fact, Europe is finding it more and more difficult to move forward at the same pace. So we must avoid slowing down the general pace and therefore allow some Member States to move forward by developing the mechanism of reinforced cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Resorting to this instrument is tied to conditions designed to avoid turning the European Union into an <span class="italic">à la carte</span> or multi-speed Europe, a legitimate anxiety which lies at the heart of debates on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We must point out that reinforced cooperation, as provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam, must in particular concern an area that does not come within the Community’s exclusive purview, must be aimed at furthering the objectives of the Union, must respect the principles of the Treaties and must be used only as a last resort while concerning a majority of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Reinforced cooperation could have an important role to play in the framework of an enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as these provisions now stand, this mechanism cannot function correctly. That is why the reform of this instrument has been entered on the agenda of the IGC with a view to making it easier to use. The report before us tends to consolidate Parliament’s position in this respect (resolution of 13 April 2000).</p>

In its simplest terms, what this means is that larger Member States can integrate more closely and over a shorter time-frame than smaller Member States of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, the proponents of such a policy want to put in place a two-tier Europe. They want the European Union to be built at two different paces: one for countries that wish to integrate more closely and one for countries that want to tread more carefully on the issue of economic integration.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think it will be a necessarily healthy move forward for the European Union if EU leaders were to accept and implement the principle of enhanced cooperation to its fullest. I believe that this would fly in the face of both the founding objectives and spirit of the Treaty of Rome and of all subsequent Treaties thereafter.</p>
<p class="contents">One should recall that the Single European Act in 1987 laid the groundwork for the implementation of an internal market. Large scale EU Structural Funds were put aside to help Objective 1 countries within the European Union so as to guarantee that these countries could become more competitive over time. EU leaders stated that they did not want an internal market of only a few countries. They wanted all participating countries within the European Union to actively engage in a competitive manner within the environment of a new single market.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the large allocation of EU Structural Funds was made. The operating structures of the internal market have been a success ever since the early 1990s. This principle of equality between poorer and richer nations was transcended into policies that were implemented to put in place a new European single currency regime. Once again, if poorer and smaller countries of the European Union could not reform their economic structures they would not be able to meet the economic convergence criterion as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">EU leaders financed large-scale EU Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund programmes for smaller and poorer countries so that as many countries as possible could participate in the European single currency structure.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for institutional equality in the context of the negotiations on the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. The influence of smaller Member States cannot be dissipated by a set of larger countries within the EU that seek to implement, as I have said, the principle of enhanced cooperation. This would not be healthy for the European Union now and into the future. It certainly would not be healthy in the context of the impending enlargement of the European Union itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By allowing a group of countries to go ahead and deepen cooperation within a particular area and, at the same time, preventing one or more Member States from curbing flexible integration, then integration throughout the European Union can go forwards.

<p class="contents">We are also opposed to creating duplicate defence structures within the EU and consequently to flexible integration within the EU’s foreign and security policy. Following the EU’s failure in the Balkans, it is incredibly important that the EU as a whole should have the ability to act in its own immediate vicinity and be able to make personnel and resources available in time for conflict management and peace-keeping measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The WEU’s institutional and operational structures ought to be fully integrated into the common security policy. The EU must acquire a credible foreign policy.

It is therefore important to retain the transatlantic link, even if there might, of course, be better coordination and a better distribution of labour. We believe that, in the future too, a credible common European foreign policy must be developed within the rules that apply at present.

What could be more natural, therefore, than cooperation between neighbouring states, such as the cooperation which existed before the founding of the European Union in the form of the Benelux counties and the cooperation between the Nordic states? Such cooperation between neighbours is often preferential to expensive, impenetrable EU structures which are also difficult for the electorate to influence. Not one single EU rule should stand in the way of far-reaching cooperation, subject this to conditions or require that others join in. That is why I am in favour of a minimum number of rules and limitations affecting reinforced cooperation between neighbours, as long as such cooperation is not intended to disadvantage third parties. In practice, we can already see Euro countries and non-Euro countries emerging within the EU. They are not leader groups but reflect a diversity which, with 30 Member States, will only increase. That is why it is better to take inter-parliamentary cooperation and the right to diversity as a guiding principle throughout the EU: the Commission submits proposals, Parliament makes the final decision and national parliaments decide whether the Member States endorse that decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problems raised by the report have been identified; there is no further need to go into the details. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is disappointed, however, disappointed that the report did not seize the opportunity to bring about environmentally, socially and culturally sustainable development in these regions and that the amendments adopted during the vote are not such as to improve the text in that respect. We regret that the positions Parliament has adopted in the vote are the European Union’s positions concerning these regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance regrets the report’s rather defensive attitude to the ACP and candidate countries. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is also opposed to granting permanent derogations. We are in favour of applying the principle of derogation to the common policies applied in the outermost regions on a case-by-case basis. I am thinking here of state aid and fiscal policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret the fact that the call to moderate the ‘polluter pays’ principle was endorsed, for that could open the door to misuse in the application of this specific prerogative.

<p class="contents">In the face of the Commission’s hesitancy and contradictions, due to which REGIS has disappeared, the review of POSEI has been postponed and the corresponding funding has been reduced, the Sudre report comes at a highly appropriate moment. The European Parliament is reasserting itself by adopting measures in various fields – from agriculture to fisheries, from the environment to transport and energy via the information society – with the necessary budgetary support. At the same time, production sectors stand out, which in the case of the Azores means that the dairy and sugar disputes must be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I quote Paragraph 7 of the Sudre report: “[The European Parliament] believes that specific adaptations of the common policies must be developed where the outermost regions are heavily dependent on a limited number of economic activities or even on a single economic activity, in conformity with Article 299(2) of the Treaty.”</p>

In the Middle Ages, those regions and their people did not belong to Europe, and even today, they are not really considered to be European. Even before the nineteenth century, Spain, Portugal, France, England and the Netherlands had already conquered substantial colonial empires and Belgium, Germany, Denmark and Italy tried to follow in their footsteps for a short while. This colonial era has now passed. The suppressed peoples have fought for their freedom, or were given their independence as a preventive measure, because the former rulers had no appetite for a war of liberation which they would end up losing. All that the EU Member States have left outside Europe in terms of territory are small or sparsely populated sections of their former colonial empire.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Member States deal with their outermost regions in very different ways. Spain and Portugal consider their islands in the Atlantic as remote regions. Those islands can, given their present composition of population and their relative proximity, be considered normal parts of their countries. Similarly, the Netherlands and Denmark each have two regions in, or on the other side of, the Atlantic, but those areas are expressly not included in the European Union. France, on the other hand, owns overseas departments in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean. This proposal has confronted my group with a difficult choice. On the one hand, we want to support disadvantaged areas in and outside of Europe so that they achieve the same standard of living and level of amenities that is now current in the EU. That is a question of solidarity. On the other hand, we have serious doubts as to whether or not former colonies should be declared outermost regions. A case can be made for the Spanish and Portuguese islands, but not really for the more remote regions. These should ideally be given the same status as the current ACP states which, after the same kind of history, have ended up in a different type of relationship with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In assessing the amendments, my group has tried to tread a middle path between the most far-reaching demands of those protecting the interests of the outermost regions and the indifference towards, or even repugnance for, this topic felt in Member States which cannot relate to it in any way. In any case, we have, however, subordinated our repugnance for this topic’s colonial backdrop to the interests of those living in the regions concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us not be too ambitious, however. The more progress that is made in scientific research, the more new questions are raised. We need only look at developments involving BSE. New cases are being identified week after week and in new geographical areas that had been spared in the past. This applies in particular to the Vosges department in the Lorraine region.</p>
<p class="contents">With all the measures proposed in the White Paper, we will still have to flesh out a number of points in order to guarantee food safety and in particular restore consumer confidence. The most important points include the creation of the European Food Safety Agency, which we welcome and of which we expect a great deal. It is vital to its credibility that it is independent. This authority must be totally dissociated from the interests of private companies or the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">That independence also implies financial independence. The Union will have to free up funds to run it, but will the EFSA be enough to reassure consumers who are worried about what they find on their plates and will soon find in their drinks? The authority will have to be set up by 2002/2003 and we very much hope that the question of where it will have its headquarters will not be an obstacle to its establishment.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the Union must continue to assess and manage food safety risks. That means it must be vigilant day in day out. It means guaranteeing that the policy-makers and the policies that have been put in place really do deal with what people want. The use of animal meal, which is triggering a new food crisis, is unacceptable. Henceforth we must ban all animal meal. That is the strong stance our citizens expect, rather than the kind of tolerance that can end up seriously damaging consumer health.</p>
<p class="contents">This kind of recognised scientific risk must not be tolerated in any way. Mr Bowis’ report takes that line. That is why the Green Group fully supported his work and voted for the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But on reading the report or perusing the European Parliament's resolution on the same subject, the picture becomes far less pleasing.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact it becomes clear that the purpose of the agency is to take over national defence powers, or to paralyse them, and to put them at the service of the Commission's objectives. Now that is absolutely intolerable. The French must remember that despite the Commission's splendid declarations about its resolve "to assure the highest standards of food safety" in the Union, it is actually the Commission, and none other, that is giving precedence to the demands of the free movement of products over public health requirements; it is the Commission, and none other, that has, for example, just dragged France before the Court of Justice for maintaining its ban on British beef. It is unacceptable that we should abandon any part of our national right of decision and right of protection, in relation to food safety questions. However, the creation of that agency is imperceptibly guiding us in that very direction.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we must remember that the power to provide advice plays a capital part. In the mad cow affair, the reason the French Government continued the ban was because it was backed up by the independent opinion of the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA), even though the supposedly scientific European committee saw nothing wrong with allowing British meat to be imported into France. Consequently, if a European agency is necessary, it must be complementary to the national agencies and in no way reduce their legitimacy. That is not at all the direction taken by the White Paper, which wants to make the European agency into a "scientific point of reference for the whole Union" (page 5).</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European agency must be completely independent. The director of the agency should certainly not be appointed by the Commission, contrary to what the European Parliament is proposing (paragraph 21 of the resolution). Nor should the Commission appoint the scientific experts, even following what appears to be a rigorous selection procedure. Moreover, the agency must be able to criticise the Commission itself. That is not at all the view of the White Paper, which calls for the agency to develop very close working links with the Commission services because, as it explains with a certain aplomb, "it will allow the Authority (Agency) to be responsive to the needs of the Commission services" (page 20).</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Agency must not encroach upon the management of risks and regulatory power. The Commission's White Paper has the grace to admit that, but on closer perusal we find that the regulatory power it is so keen to protect is that of... the Commission, and not the states. That does not prevent the Commission and Parliament from christening the agency a "European Authority", a title totally contrary to the philosophy that supposedly inspires it. The European Parliament even adds, in paragraph 6 of its resolution, the phrase "while subjecting the powers to be transferred to detailed scrutiny", just when we thought that no powers were to be transferred.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that the White Paper and Parliament's report are traps, which is why we are opposed to them. The Member States must retain full responsibility for food safety, because they are close to their people and will react more rapidly than the Commission, which, moreover is constantly blinded by its free-trade prejudices. There is without doubt a need for an agency that takes a European view of the situation, but it must be strictly consultative and totally independent. The best idea would be for it to emanate solely from the national agencies and to network with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Therefore all the measures proposed to change the situation and protect consumers deserve our support, particularly the setting-up of a European food Safety Agency to analyse the risks scientifically, working in close collaboration with existing national agencies in this field and the main European consumers’ organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">But we need to go further than this. We have to bear in mind the type of practices employed in farming and the food industry, the problem of imported foodstuffs, the composition of the ingredients of animal feedingstuffs, the maximum levels of dioxins and pesticide residues, food additives and other matters, giving priority to food safety. It is equally crucial that we support regional crops and products, family farming and rural development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issue has now become particularly acute, not just because of the advances in our methods of scientific investigation but mainly because the consequences of a certain type of farming aimed at boosting productivity at all costs and inspired by a free-trade philosophy have come fully to light. So today we need to correct the adverse effects on public health of a policy very largely inspired by the Commission, as Mrs Thomas-Mauro quite rightly pointed out this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is what kind of mechanism will protect our citizens most effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take a look at recent events, we find that with regard to BSE, for example, and taking only the case of France, it is the existence of a competent and independent national Food Safety Agency that allowed the French authorities to rapidly take the decisions needed to protect the health of its people.</p>
<p class="contents">But the contribution of the European institutions has, so far, been singularly negative. First there was the refusal by the Council and the Commission to take on board the French scientists' warnings, and we now see how relevant they were. Next came the incredible ruling by the Court of Justice against maintaining the ban on British beef, which France had decided at the express recommendation of the scientists. So that shows that the European institutions' behaviour on this issue that is vital to the food safety of our fellow citizens comes down to genuinely putting the health of Europeans at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lesson to be learned. In the name of respect for subsidiarity and effectiveness, we must give pride of place to measures taken in a national context, where independent agencies can rapidly provide genuinely scientific opinions undiluted by other considerations and the political authorities can take the necessary risk-management decisions for the benefit of the people who have given them a mandate to protect their safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, a European agency can play a useful role if it really is independent, especially in relation to the Commission services and the various pressure groups at work there, and if its role is to complement and support the national agencies (from which it should emanate), in particular by acting as a forum for the exchange of expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not at all what the Bowis report is proposing; it gives the impression that basically it regards food safety as another pretext for fuelling the well-known process of strengthening the Commission's powers at the expense of the national authorities and public safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, without batting an eyelid the report endorses the new wording the Commission wants: we are no longer talking about a European agency but about an authority. The report seems to regard it as a matter of course that the Commission should appoint the director of the authority: no doubt that is the best way of guaranteeing its independence! It has no problem with the location of the authority in Brussels: so it will be right next to the Commission services and therefore perfectly "responsive" (sic) to its wishes, as recommended in the White Paper... On the other hand, the authority must be "given powers to require" Member States to provide reports, statistics and papers... As for paragraph 6 of the report, it quite classically announces the transfers of powers that are bound to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking behind the apparent and certainly sincere concern to improve food safety in Europe, in fact we thus find ourselves faced with the usual logic: the aim is to get control over the Member States, in this sphere as in the others, to strip the national authorities of their powers and effectiveness and hand them over to a large, limp and flabby European institution, theoretically independent but in reality controlled by the Commission and its philosophy of absolutely free trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is it not the intention, in due course, to entrust the authority with managing the food safety aspect of the RAS?</p>

<p class="contents">We voted for Amendment No 15 because we are very strongly committed to defending the European cultural heritage in relation to locally produced food.

Small local producers will be unable to gain access because this certification is so cumbersome, complex and costly.</p>
<p class="contents">We voted against Amendment No 7 because it would mean, even now, going beyond the field of risk assessment and encompassing risk management. It is not up to the authority to advise the states to adopt this or that type of control procedure. That is outside its remit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
