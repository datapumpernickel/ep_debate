<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamassoure, Alain (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, since the last resolution adopted last November on the basis of the report by Philippe Morillon, which I welcome, Turkey has been through a year of great contrasts: it was a black year in terms of the economy, a tense year politically, and a year of progress, though unequal progress, in terms of the pre-accession process. On the one hand, we should welcome the real advances. Given the very serious financial crisis in Turkey since the beginning of the year, the government has had to play by ear. At the instigation of Mr Dervis, a radical stabilisation and recovery plan was signed by the three coalition government partners. It came into operation in the spring, under relatively satisfactory conditions, which have made it possible to undertake basic reforms, which had been put off for too long, and, more generally, to establish a healthier relationship between politics and the economy. In the short term, however, one of its unavoidable effects has been a severe drop in GDP, of 8% this year, which may have serious social consequences. The worsening of world economic conditions, both before and after 11 September, can, unfortunately, only make efforts to recover more difficult. During 2001, Turkey has been genuinely committed to a process of bringing itself closer to European democratic standards. We should welcome the fact that, at a particularly difficult economic time, a large part of government and parliamentary activity has been devoted to basic reforms linked to this European process. In March, the government presented its national programme for the adoption of the <span class="italic">acquis. </span>It is true that this first list of reforms is still vague as to the timetable for implementation and the exact scope of the proposed measures. However, since September, the Grand National Assembly has begun to consider several dozen – around 34 – constitutional amendments, the first half of which were adopted at the beginning of October. The results still lag behind current democratic standards: the death penalty has not been totally abolished, the non-Turkish languages are no longer banned, but are not fully recognised, the National Security Council remains, but civilians play a more significant part within it. Above all, most regrettably, the principle of the supremacy of international law – and thus, possibly, in the near future, of European law – over national law has been expressly ruled out. Undeniable progress has nonetheless been made, which the European Commission and the Council of Europe have welcomed as such. Furthermore, on 8 October, the government tabled a second legislative package of rights and freedoms, which relate to the penal code and penal procedure and the laws on anti-terrorism, the press, political parties, associations and demonstrations. The third advance outside parliament was that this summer saw the beginnings of a public debate on the taboo subject of the role of the military in political life. Finally, I would also like to highlight President Sezer’s courage in denouncing corruption, an endemic disease of Turkish society, and in using his legislative veto against texts which represented a step backwards for democracy. Because there are also delays and even retreats.</p>
<p class="contents">In the political sphere, the year was marked by dramatic events in Turkish prisons. I will leave it to Mr Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who chaired the parliamentary committee which visited Turkish prisons, to express our views on this subject in a moment. The draft reform of the audiovisual legislation was rightly criticised by the president of the republic, since it did not comply with the principle of the independence of the audiovisual sector in relation to the political powers. The dissolution of the main opposition party (the Virtue Party) demonstrated that the political system has not stabilised and that changes in the law regarding the status of political parties are required as a matter of urgency. In general, a gulf persists between good intentions and reality in the human rights field, where progress is too slow: the torture and degrading treatment of detainees continues to be widespread, freedom of expression is still unusually restricted and several thousand people currently in prison for offences would, under our laws, be considered prisoners of conscience. The main groups working to defend human rights remain subject to what amounts to legal harassment. In the South-East, the end of armed terrorism by the PKK has not yet been turned to account in embarking on an overall policy towards the south-east provinces and Kurdish identity, and, likewise, the unambiguous European Court of Human Rights judgment has not been used as an opportunity to set free Leyla Zana and the other former parliamentarians from the Democratic People’s Party (HADEP) who are still in prison. Finally, since the consideration of the Poos report by Parliament, we have seen Mr Denktash’s surprising refusal to restart the negotiations proposed by Commissioner Verheugen, which I welcome, and the UN Secretary-General on the status of Cyprus. And we note that Turkey continues to block the draft agreement between the European Union and NATO, a draft which is all the more urgent given current international tension. In this area, as in others, the impression remains that the signs of openness which are, on occasion, expressed by governmental authorities, may be challenged by military powers, which still have an unusual influence on Turkish politics. Since our resolution of 15 November 2000, which is cited in our current motion for a resolution, our Turkish partners have been aware of the importance our Parliament attaches to the official recognition of the Armenian genocide. We hope that the processes of dialogue, such as those which bring together former diplomats and academics from Armenia and Turkey, will lead to a common understanding based on scientifically-recognised historical facts.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the coming year will be crucial in testing the real desire of Turkish political leaders and Turkish society as a whole to move closer to the European Union. Over the coming weeks it will be possible to gauge the exact scope of the constitutional and legislative reforms regarding the rule of law. Coming months will be vital in judging efforts to modernise the economy. Finally, on the crucial issue of the status of Cyprus, after 27 years of political deadlock, the moment of truth extends from now until autumn 2002. The end of negotiations on Cyprus’s accession to the EU are set for that date, and this will make it necessary, finally, for both parties to adopt a clear position. Our judgment will be based on the facts. Turkey wishes to have its own models for society and democracy. This is a perfectly legitimate objective. The European Union does not impose one single model. On the contrary, its special achievement lies in bringing about the coexistence and collaboration of peoples who have had very different histories, for a long time mutually hostile, and who, on occasion, have very different ideas on fundamental subjects such as the organisation of society, changing moral values, relations between religion and politics, the status of minority communities or races and the application of the subsidiarity principle. But there are two needs which we all acknowledge. First of all, that there are universal values which make it necessary that fundamental human and democratic rights are guaranteed in the same way everywhere; secondly, that the models conceived in previous centuries must be adjusted to the needs of this one. European integration is a way of helping one another to comply with these requirements and to preserve our special qualities in an exciting and dangerous world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Allow me, therefore, to point out that very little progress has been made with women's rights in Turkey, rights which we, the Committee, consider to be a <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to the integration of Turkey into the European Union, because women's rights are human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the Turkish National Assembly started a debate today on the reform of the Civil Code, numerous articles of which infringe the United Nations convention on abolishing all forms of discrimination against women, despite Turkey's having ratified the convention. I trust parliament will pass this bill, as adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs in June.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the crucial question which arises is whether the law will also apply to existing families because, unfortunately, the Justice Committee submitted an amendment exempting existing families at the last minute. It is quite unacceptable to introduce changes to the Civil Code that only apply to future generations and I know that women's organisations in Turkey have expressed their total opposition to this.</p>
<p class="contents">The national programme for integration into the European Union talks of revising the constitution so as to guarantee sexual equality; however, there are no plans, whatsoever, to adopt positive measures which, as the women's organisations have pointed out, would allow all the laws which institutionalise discrimination against women to be amended.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as women's right to work is concerned, I should like to highlight both the high rate of unemployment among women – 39.6% and even higher in agricultural areas – and the limited number of women who benefit from national insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to call on Turkey to abolish all forms of discrimination against women and I should, of course, like to call on Europe to provide the economic and technical assistance needed to put this into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite all of the criticism which we have rightly voiced in the past and still do today, in respect of the constitution and human rights, we have to say that, compared with most of its neighbours, Turkey is a country which is exceptionally pro-western, democratic and respectful of human rights. Everything is relative and must be seen in its context.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to recognise that progress has been made in a number of areas and that, despite the severe economic problems which Turkey is currently experiencing, it is still attempting, by amending its constitution and changing the composition of its security committee, to ensure that the civilian political forces are given more powers to act in more areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have to check to see whether all of this is sufficient. Commissioner, you will have to help us to respect the Copenhagen Criteria. The Copenhagen Criteria explicitly state that we need to see developments on the political aspects for accession negotiations even to be justified. We will have to assess this on a case-by-case basis. If further negotiations get underway we will also have to answer the question of whether Turkey is in a position to meet the conditions of the European internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, I should like to mention just two points, which will provide a tangible touchstone as the European Union embarks on this very complex development against the background of a very dangerous situation for security policy. Personally, I cannot understand why Turkey refuses to seek a compromise under the European security and defence policy over the issue of the conditions under which it will be involved and what kind of cooperation there will be with NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">For me this is a test case. We should not allow there to be any blackmail on this issue. I believe that there has to be a willingness to accept a compromise which was negotiated in Budapest and blocked by the military. Surely we should now be in a position to find our way back to these criteria and agree on them.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns what should be done about Cyprus. Is Turkey prepared to seek a constructive solution in Cyprus? If a solution is not possible, how will it react when the European Union enlarges? I believe that these are two very tangible issues on the basis of which Turkey's credibility can be judged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very good report. Some people think that it is too soft. I do not believe that it is too soft; it simply uses a language which leaves the way open for a dialogue with Turkey and we want to enter into this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of hard points, however, which we need to discuss with Turkey, and certainly there is still a need to discuss the issue of human rights, in particular. It has been mentioned that people are in prison who should not be, first and foremost Leyla Zana. Turkey could and should, particularly in the light of rulings made by the European courts, ensure that they are released without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of Kurdish rights too, much remains to be done. It is obvious that the language, which, thanks to constitutional amendments, can now be used, should also be employed in the official media as soon as possible. The state of emergency could then be lifted relatively quickly in the provinces in which it is still in force. The constitutional amendments which Turkey has made are positive steps. We definitely wish to take note of them. However, now it is a question, firstly, of removing the constraints still connected to them, for example the death penalty, and, of course, of ensuring that the constitutional amendments are also implemented. A major task for Turkey is to do this in the very near future.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of time, I should like to come back to an idea which I put forward when I had the honour of drawing up a report for this Parliament comprising a road map or timetable, and that is why tomorrow we will also be proposing that Turkey, itself, should table a timetable next year showing how it intends to meet the political Copenhagen criterion. Satisfaction of this political criterion is the precondition for our also being able to negotiate with Turkey. After all, this is the aim of the whole exercise, of which this report is also a part.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also, however, like to address two points, which continue to be crucial for relations between the European Union and Turkey. The first point is Turkey's assistance in shaping an active and efficient external security policy. We know that at the end of the day this also presupposes that we are able to use NATO resources and this is still a stumbling block for Turkey. Turkey needs to know that this is damaging its prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">The final problem is Cyprus. Here, too, I should like to say quite clearly that it is important to resolve the Cyprus problem, firstly, for the Turkish population of Cyprus and secondly, and undoubtedly, for the Greek population of Cyprus, the whole of Europe and Turkey itself. Turkey simply has not realised this. I would stress something which I have said repeatedly in the past: Turkey's path to the European Union is via Cyprus. Its assistance with resolving the Cyprus issue is not a precondition for our accepting Cyprus into the European Union, but it would be a basis on which we could enter into serious discussions about Turkey's membership of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">So far the majorities in the Grand National Assembly for reform are great, but could I urge our colleagues inside the Turkish parliament to respond to this report in a truly parliamentary fashion? Why not pass a resolution calling for their government fully to respect the rulings of all the international courts, including the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg? Why not pass a resolution supporting the setting up of the Rapid Reaction Force and why not pass a resolution to bring pressure to bear upon Mr Denktash to work towards the integration of Turkish Cypriots into the European Union?

Yes, Mr Pasqua, you will have the right to speak. That will be very interesting. It is not late. It is the morning for you. As you know, in any event our political leanings vary from morning till night. So there is no problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say, not to repeat what we have said amongst ourselves since Mr Lamassoure began his report, that it is actually not only a well-packaged report, but also one which rightly says things clearly, being wise and measured. It is also based on a high degree of consensus, since Mr Lamassoure has really tried to bring together all the opinions in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is clear: Turkey is trying to make reforms, Turkey is making efforts, but, nevertheless, things are moving very, very slowly. And things are moving very slowly not out of wickedness but because of the fact that democratic culture, the culture of openness, is not a culture which, in a still very authoritarian society, has been imposed on the behaviour of all parties; on the behaviour of governors, on the behaviour of certain political forces or on the behaviour of the military.</p>
<p class="contents">Our role as the European Union is not, therefore, simply to give lessons, but, rather, to accompany Turkey on the journey towards democracy, in other words, to have positions to defend. And that is why I will make a comment, and I would ask all those who still wish to tell Turkey that there was a genocide seventy-five years ago – which is true – in what way does that help the debate in Turkey today? I do not think that that helps it.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what we have in today’s resolution, in this report, is the possibility of holding a genuine, heated dialogue with Turkish society, with the Turkish government, on our notion of democracy, on the notion of freedoms, on our notion of the enlargement of Europe, and, therefore, of the place that Cyprus can and must hold within Europe, and the place which Turkey can and should hold in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we should be clear, however. This evolution will perhaps be more discouraging at some times than at others. The European Parliament, the societies of the Member States of the European Union, will not show indefinite patience if the situation does not appear to be improving.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to end by appealing to the Turkish parliamentarians up there in the gallery, and say to them that if they really want the Turkey which they love and govern today to join the European Union, they must be aware that the efforts which our notion of democracy requires of Turkey are efforts which go beyond what is being undertaken at the moment by the Turkish Grand Assembly. They are efforts which go beyond what seems acceptable to the Turkish military.</p>
<p class="contents">If they do not go further, our future will perhaps not be a common one, which would be a shame. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first must be that we want Turkey as a member of the EU and as a member of the European family. It will be good for Turkey, but it will also be good for ourselves. The second message must be that Turkey is faced with a number of tasks, including that of being honest about its history and its genocide of one and a half million Armenians, half a million Assyrians, Chaldeans and Syrians and several hundred thousand Greeks. In addition, there are the tasks – not only on paper but also in practice and in the real world – of improving the conditions in Turkish prisons, ceasing to keep prisoners in solitary confinement, guaranteeing the rights of minorities and ensuring democratic progress not only for minorities but, I would emphasise, for the whole of the Turkish people. There are the tasks of completely abolishing the death penalty and of getting the political process under way that is necessary if political life in the Turkish state is to be democratised.</p>
<p class="contents">I have read my fellow MEP’s, Mr Lamassoure’s, report very carefully. I have to say that he is very diplomatic. I think the report is excellent, but I also think it needs to be more precise on a number of points, and a number of amendments have, therefore, also been tabled, not only by my group but also by other groups, and I believe that most of them must be supported. There is a single exception. I do not think that the EU should interfere in the matter of where Turkey has embassies. However, I also think that the report is sound, and I shall recommend voting in favour of it, but also, of course, in favour of the amendments tabled by, for example, my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will surprise nobody by reminding you of the position of the French delegation of my group. I have tried in vain to understand why the majority of this House have an absolute desire for Turkey to join the European Union. For a start, most of the territory of Turkey is not in Europe. You have decided to urge her to join us. In reality, this decision has but one justification, which Mr Brok has just confirmed, and that is that Turkey belongs to NATO, and that it is therefore desirable for there to be a certain resemblance between the European Union, as some people imagine it, and NATO. I have just listened to what Mr Lamassoure said, and what he said in his report, which was full of reservations, of observations which should lead us to ask questions, and while I believe that we should be careful about trying to promote or impose our institutional system or our value system, which is too often our tendency, there are naturally things which are not acceptable. And it is true that while we are perfectly aware of the difficulties faced by Turkey as a result of the presence of Islamic fundamentalist elements on their territory, which are a danger, which require certain measures to be taken, at the same time we must accept that,<span class="bold"> </span>in terms of democratic principles, the journey they have to make is still, to say the least, very long. And besides, many of you have said so before me. But I will add something else. What I do not understand, even though a certain number of countries have, unanimously in some cases, such as France, condemned the genocide suffered by the Armenians, is why the current Turkish government and Turkish people, who are not responsible for the past, but who are responsible for a collective history, are determined not to accept responsibility for that genocide. Other countries which have been responsible for genocides have been better able to accept their responsibilities. I think it is justifiable, here and now, to ask them to do the same. In any event, as long as it has not been recognised, as far as we are concerned, we will remain firmly opposed to Turkey’s entry into the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Could this be an arresting and, therefore, not very truthful headline? Not really, for the enlightening interview with an anonymous member of the extreme-left terrorist movement, Dev Sol, was in total agreement with this disconcerting title.</p>
<p class="contents">The outspoken Turkish terrorist left the reader in no doubt as to the fact that his organisation makes full use of the EU’s territory as their base of operation for their murderous actions against the Turkish state and as a willing reservoir of funds, as and when required. ‘For in Europe, anything is possible’, the man simply declared. And should Europe be serious about fighting terrorism, then action will also be taken here, he threatened.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lamassoure hardly touches upon this highly topical and acute problem in his report. Despite this, it has been Turkey’s criticism of the EU Member States for years. The rapporteur’s appreciation, expressed in Paragraph 29, of the Turkish contribution to the fight against international terrorism counts for very little in this. About terrorism in Turkey, the Lamassoure report concludes in recital G “that Turkey has largely overcome the difficulties posed by various forms of terrorism in the past”. I should like to find out from the Council and the Commission whether they share this, in my view, far too rash, conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Official Turkish sources produce very different noises. These are voices which, following the satanic terrorist attacks on the US, have gained a great deal of support. They express the feelings of authorities that are deeply hurt. For years, they could not even count on European solidarity in their bloody fight against Turkish terrorist organisations. Quite the reverse, in fact. EU Member States offered, and still offer, the activists of those movements shelter. And while the Ankara authorities condemn the West’s specific policy of tolerance, this time round, Turkey <span class="italic">is</span> allowed to take part in the international coalition against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">After the memorable date of Tuesday, 11 September, Turkey considers that the time has come for the European Union and its Member States finally to issue effective anti-terrorist measures. In specific terms, this translates into meeting Turkish requests to extradite Turkish terrorists instead of offering them asylum or a residence permit. The European Union and its Member States should, at long last, recognise the permanent internal and external threat to the Republic of Turkey. The double standards applied by the Europeans should, at least from the Turkish angle, come to a definite end. The EU’s emphasis on human rights in Turkey coinciding with the fact that it turns a blind eye to the fight against international terrorism is unacceptable. At least, this is the Turkish point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this harsh criticism levelled by Turkey at Europe justified? It is a fact that various violent groupings of Turkish origin maintain organisational structures in EU Member States. Certainly after 11 September, it is more difficult for Brussels and the capitals of the EU countries to ignore this in silence. How do the Council and the Commission intend to cooperate with Turkey, a country which has, after all, formally acquired candidate country status, in future in the fight against international terrorism? Indeed, there is no shortage of legal and political pitfalls. The far from gentle criticism levelled at the Lamassoure report speaks for itself. Despite this, the progress of Turkey’s accession to the European Union will also depend on Europe’s reaction to Turkey’s ‘open flank’, also known as the country’s Achilles’ heel for terrorist attacks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say ‘with knowledge of the subject’ because I know how passionate the debates on this subject have been over the last two years or more.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to expand on just two points of the report, which have already been mentioned by Mr Brok and others.</p>
<p class="contents">The first relates to the geostrategic importance of Turkey, which has certainly increased as a result of the events which have just taken place and by the European Union’s realisation of the need to enter into a coalition to combat Islamic fundamentalist terrorism. To this end, I would like to say to our Turkish colleagues who are in the gallery, how in vain it would be, to fear that European defence might develop in competition, in parallel, and therefore redundantly, with defence based on the Atlantic Alliance. European defence is based on the Atlantic Alliance and it will continue in that direction, quite simply because Europe would not have the means to do otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns Cyprus. It has been said that the resolution of the Cypriot problem is one of the conditions, in my view a prior condition, of any possible decision on the entry of Turkey into the Union. I do not believe that the Turkish populations in Cyprus are really in danger today and I believe it would be a very important gesture for Turkey to accept, as a first step, during the current negotiations, a reduction in the number of its armed forces in Cyprus, or even better, their evacuation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am saying this, above all, because in Turkey, I often come across people making a certain assertion: those in Turkey who repeatedly accuse the European Parliament of being hostile to Turkey will now have to admit yet again that this assertion is not true.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the report of my colleague, Mr Swoboda, this report, too, is an objective opinion on the situation in Turkey. As the rapporteur states, the flurry of legislative activity in the Turkish Parliament to reform the constitution really is laudable. Given the current constraints in Turkey, our Turkish colleagues, some of whom are also here today amongst us, have really been very successful. Now, however, they are asked to continue the work which they have begun. The Ministries for Home Affairs and Justice in the Turkish Republic play an important role in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The long-awaited implementation of the reform is urgently necessary, particularly now after 11 September, but also in spite of 11 September. It is easy to ascertain through the Turkish media that people are still being tortured in some police stations. There are still strange cases of people committing suicide while in police custody. For as long as this kind of thing continues to happen in Turkey, and, for as long as Turkey is not prepared to meet the Copenhagen Criteria, there will obviously be no date for the start of accession negotiations and Turkey will remain the only country, out of 13 countries with candidate status, not to have started negotiating.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this last report will motivate those responsible in Turkey to move forward and, not only to talk about reforms, but also to really implement them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For instance, 19 people are being prosecuted for insulting state officials because they attended a conference at which victims who had suffered torture in the form of rape in custody spoke out against their tormenters. It is not only women to whom this happens. It is clearly outrageous that the state should condemn the victims, rather than their aggressors. I call on the Turkish authorities to drop these shameful prosecutions.</p>

Is this a genuine reform? I would answer, no. Turkey must not be given any special treatment in the enlargement process. I think that we run the risk of giving in to Turkey's wishes if we adopt the Lamassoure report as it stands.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is guarded on a number of issues so that we leave Turkey room for manoeuvre. We must insist that a political solution be found to the Kurdish issue and that human and fundamental rights be guaranteed. The time is right for sweeping reforms. In my conversations with people on my trips to Turkey they have repeatedly expressed a wish for peace, brotherliness and freedom. I, too, carry this message in my heart and will also do all I can in the future so that one day this wish will come true. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having said which, I think that, thanks to certain amendments approved by the rapporteur and despite certain other amendments dictated by the policy of expediency, the final report which has taken shape is generally acceptable, even to the official Turkish side. And, of course, we all know what that means, we just have to make allowances for the usual abusive response by the Turkish foreign secretary towards the honourable Mr Poos and his report, which is seen as negative towards Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">So all that remains is to ascertain the extent to which Turkey will basically respond to the good will and to the spirit which dominates the report, by which I mean the spirit of constructive criticism of numerous Turkish shortcomings, the deliberately indirect reference to the continuing Turkish military occupation of Cyprus, which is unacceptable in a civilised society, the fact that previous Turkish crimes, such as the genocide of the Armenians, have been passed over in silence, contrasting with praise for any minor progress made by Turkey or any circumstantial compliance by Turkey with its contractual obligations, such as Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Time will tell if Turkey recognises and appreciates these well-meant messages, although I fear that experience to date does not give us cause to be optimistic that we shall soon have a clear response from Turkey to the effect that it really is prepared to prove itself worthy of its candidate status and of integration into the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is its basic message. I, for my part, believe that membership is not just Turkey's right, it is vital to the country. Historically speaking, Turkey has made an admirable effort to move towards Europe. An effort which started not today but a long time ago. Turkey's efforts to modernise started at the end of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p class="contents">We Greeks, as Turkey's neighbours and ‘historic adversaries’, if I may put it thus, know this better than anyone else. We know from our own experience how difficult it is move forward from a tradition of eastern despotism towards a modern society. Turkey has a particularly long tradition in this respect because it was at the top of the pyramid of despotism in our region.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey suffered the historical accident of basically coming out unscathed – not unscathed as such, because it suffered a great deal – but it was not defeated in either the First or the Second World War. Sometimes it is better to lose than to win a war. We must not forget that France and Germany, the mainstays of the European Union, were both defeated, one at the beginning and the other at the end of the Second World War and I think that they learned that armed force and confrontation are not the way to survive in today's world. The disaster on the 11 September has taught us, I think, that today's world needs reconciliation in order to survive, by which I do not of course mean reconciliation with the terrorists, I mean reconciling tensions between us, precisely in order to isolate terrorists and establish a safe and fair world. Turkey is a third world European country which needs to learn the same lesson as France and Germany, that is, that if we want to move on, we have to stop waging the wars of the 1920s or the wars of the 1940s in the present day.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that Turkey has built up an internal mechanism and a system of external relations which is dominated by the idea of authority and it uses this to tyrannise its people – witness the terrible story of prisoners' suicides and much else besides. Of course, the move which Turkey has to make is a difficult one. But it is trying to make it and we must help it and our reception of it in the European Union must be commensurate with its efforts to move towards us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a fact. However, at the same time it makes findings which have no bearing on reality. It sees progress where there is none, it extols the famous ‘national programme’ and a number of individual reforms which, basically, do no more than pull the wool over the eyes of the world in order to conceal the continuing and, from certain sides, the worsening situation for the working classes.</p>
<p class="contents">We warned that the decision taken in Helsinki would help not to democratise but to embolden the regime. The army is still the determining factor in political life. The grass-roots movement is being dealt with in the crudest fashion. Arrests, over 10 000 political prisoners, torture chambers, murders, inhumane conditions in prisons, which are extolled in the report, are on the agenda. The hunger strikers have been fighting to the death now for 370 days and dozens have already died. The death penalty has only been abolished for criminal prisoners, not for people fighting for democracy and freedom. The report calls these fighters extremists and the Turkish state calls them terrorists, while the Kurds are deprived of fundamental rights, the occupying forces remain in Cyprus after their barbaric invasion 27 years ago and the report says not a word.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the key point of the report is Paragraph 29, which extols Turkey's contribution to the fight against terrorism, clearly dismissing the Kurdish fighters, and its peace-brokering efforts in the Balkans, obviously meaning its open support for the KLA criminals, and it incites it to facilitate the application of the ΝΑΤΟ treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to finish by saying that my brotherly love towards and solidarity with the Turkish people prevent me from voting in favour of this report.</p>

It spared me somewhat. Mr Lamassoure has submitted an excellent report, as numerous Members have said. I should like to qualify the report as a fair report, because I think that Turkey, like every other candidate, is entitled to a fair report, meaning that we duly address all the shortcomings, but we also acknowledge any progress made.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to call on our Turkish counterparts and the Turkish people to take note of the report as a whole and not just selectively, just as we are making an effort to take note of all the developments in Turkey. Finally, I take the view that a Turkey that has made a start on fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria is preferable to a Turkey which has not made a start on fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria. It is a Turkey that is motivating the forces trying to overcome the unacceptable shortcomings still remaining within the country in relation to the political criteria. It is not in a position to expect political discounts. We do, of course, realise that we rightly wish that all Muslim countries in the world were structured like Turkey and that we would then have fewer problems, especially in the light of 11 September. But this discount does not mean turning a blind eye when it comes to the candidate countries. On the other hand, however, Turkey is also entitled not to have any additional conditions imposed.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, I think that Mr Lamassoure has chosen exactly the right wording for the point on Armenia. Having expressly referred to the genocide last year, we note this year that things are clearly moving in the right direction. We realise that people are getting together to talk about the past. My own country found this a very worthwhile exercise and I think that this is an approach which we should support in this specific case, so that good neighbourly relations can develop in the future between Turkey and Armenia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am thinking, rather, of the extremely tangible progress made in the field of honesty: the courage and honesty of a President who is able to condemn the corruption present in his own country. However, we would be wronging Turkey if we did not make things absolutely clear to her – being clear, not hypocritical – and being clear means telling her that a great deal remains to be done in terms of democratic civilisation and behaviour, and that means reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, the ability to implement political and social reforms benefiting the Kurdish minority is a highly effective parameter. It is true and important that the Turkish Constitution intends to remove some of the restrictions placed on the use of the Kurdish language but, Mr President, I am appalled by this idea of partial removal of restrictions: the idea of partial removal of restrictions applied to a fundamental right such as the use of one’s own language is a quite horrific contradiction in terms. I am also appalled by the fact that only a cultural right is being recognised to a minority that does not enjoy even the most basic political and social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we expect Turkey to show signs of cooperation, and a sign in precisely this area – addressing this long-standing dispute with the Kurdish people with courage and tolerance, in a tolerant, civilised manner – would be very well received by the entire European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although I have been a constant critic of Turkey's human rights record and its treatment of the Kurds, I also strongly support the decision of the 1999 Helsinki European Council to recognise Turkey as an candidate country. I do not agree with those who believe the boundaries of Europe should be narrow and exclusively Christian. I want to see a pluralistic Europe. I have always believed that Turkey could be a very important bridge-head between the current Members of the EU and the Islamic world. This would facilitate greater understanding and mutual respect. It is especially important in the changed world that exists after 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Turkey still has a long way to go. In last year's annual assessment report the Commission concluded that, although a wide-ranging debate on political reforms had begun and Turkey had signed several international human rights instruments over the past year, the situation on the ground had hardly improved. Let us hope that the publication of next month's annual report will show significant improvement. In this context, I welcome the recent decision by the Turkish parliament to adopt a constitutional reform package to bring Turkey further in line with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire.</span> At the launch of the EU-Turkish Foundation of 17 October, Commissioner Verheugen said that these reforms are a significant step towards better protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that continued support for a closer EU-Turkey relationship, including eventual accession, is the best way to accelerate political reform and progress in human rights. However, the timetable for possible accession lies in Turkish hands alone. Negotiations can only begin when Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen criteria. It must strive harder to fulfil its obligations in that regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it also underlines another point of view that we should make very clear to the Turkish authorities: that in order for this to take place, Turkey must become a full democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with what Mr Lamassoure has said in his report. The Turks have made advances. It is also true, however, that this constitutional reform contains three elements that impair its credibility. First of all, it ceases to class as crimes actions that are still crimes because they fulfil the conditions as such. Secondly, the constitution is being reformed, but other laws remain in force, such as the Penal Code, the anti-terrorism law and the audiovisual law, which continue to uphold the existence of certain crimes of expression, of opinion, of public demonstration and association. Thirdly, and most importantly, the constitutional reform is not being put into practice. Arbitrary detentions and violations of human rights continue to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">We all receive, as I do myself, constant complaints, of which, today, there have been many, that are continually causing problems for the defenders of human rights and their organisations, not to mention, of course, the situation of the Kurdish people. Yes, the Kurdish people. It is not enough to lift the restriction of using a language if this is upheld in law and there is no recognition of the existence of a Community as a people in their own right. This is the case with the Kurds. This is even more the case, Mr President, where a Sakharov Prize winner, Mrs Leyla Zana, remains in gaol, and we must continue to strongly demand that she be freed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would particularly like to remind Mr Pasqua that he should recall where the Presocrats originate from, that Ionic art was born in Turkey, and that the truly Christian French Kings did not hesitate to call upon the Ottoman Empire to fight against the Pope and other European States in the Sixteenth Century.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if we continue to look into history, we will also see both good things and bad things about Turkey. Turkey, in the strategic position it occupies, is the only truly secular state, and Europe has been founded upon this great battle to achieve secular states. On this level, then, yes, Turkey is a totally European State. Its efforts to eliminate religious interference, whilst having truly fundamentalist communities within its borders, is something to be admired, and which could be a factor for future stability in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, under the Ottoman Empire, the Greek monasteries, the Sufis and the Sephardis all survived. This was because, at their respective moments in history, the authorities did not attempt to destroy them. Today, it is also a strong state fighting for the education of its people. On this subject I would like to remind Mrs Uca, with a heavy heart, that 30% of women in Turkey do not go to school, nor are allowed to do so, so in this way they miss out on an education.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to say that there are also bad points. The major black cloud over the Ottoman tradition is its perception of the unlimited rights of the conqueror over the conquered. This gives rise to the great problem of prisons and exterminations: the loss of rights of the conquered, the weaker party, rape, exterminations, silence and death. I think that it is in this area that we should offer our help, for Turkey is a stabilising factor in this region: it is establishing agreements with Syria and is an important element in the creation of a peaceful border with Europe. We have to contribute to the strengthening of this strategy and its improvement, with European ideas used in governance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Lamassoure has painted an objective, clear picture of the country but, despite some positive elements, he does not hide his concern that Turkey might regress to a state which is worse than the current situation. It is positive that the Turkish government has presented a programme of conditions for joining Europe and it is positive that it is working on the Constitution, but it is negative that neither the ‘road map’ nor the timetable for the reforms has been clearly defined. The European Union is not asking every country to follow the same procedure, but there are certain values, certain individual and democratic rights which must be respected – and Europe does know how to be patient – in Turkey and in its prisons too.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point: the question of the Armenian genocide is, strangely, becoming increasingly important with the passing of time. Today, humanity no longer tolerates lies or inaccurate accounts when it comes to the horrific events of history. It is not necessary to say, for example, how much the descriptions of the blood baths of the two world wars by former enemy historians helped to soothe feelings and cool emotions, and this example should be followed as soon as possible by Turks and Armenians, with a view to starting to normalise relations between the two neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I am sure that Armenia would be quite willing to erect a monument in front of one of the European institutions commemorating its sacrifice and entrusting it to history. This would also make it possible for us, too, to produce documents on Turkey without worrying about how to address the question of Armenia. It is necessary to remember the past in order to do better in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, however, I should like to thank our rapporteur. This is a superb report, couched in very moderate terms.

<p class="contents">Now to the points on which I should like to comment. First, the question of the death penalty which has not, I think, been adequately evaluated in the House this evening. The general political reforms which Turkey recently introduced are very promising and we fully acknowledge them. However, we all know, and Turkey should also know, which is why we must say so loud and clear, that they represent enormous progress within Turkey itself. Naturally, from our point of view, they are just a beginning. I must say, we always get a bit carried away when it comes to Turkey. But, perhaps, the means are basically the end at the moment, especially when we consider human rights. But, to come back to the death penalty. We obviously feel that it must be abolished completely. There can be no partial abolition of the death penalty from a democratic point of view. There can only be complete abolition. That this is difficult in Turkey at the moment for domestic political reasons is patently obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point which I think is important is the fight against corruption within Turkey. Because as long as sleaze runs public and social life in Turkey, the people will have no faith in politicians and as long as they have no faith in politicians, they will put more faith in the military. But it is out of the question in a democratic community for the military, in the form of the national security council, always to have the last word, <span class="italic">de facto, </span>on parliament's resolutions. I think that a great deal of work is still needed on this within Turkey. And that can only mean fighting corruption and ensuring that the people have faith in politicians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to put the following question to the Commissioner with responsibility for enlargement, Mr Verheugen. Is it possible for Turkey to become a member of the European Union in view of the continued Turkish occupation of Northern Cyprus, continued Turkish migration from Anatolia to Northern Cyprus and the documented destruction in that part of the island of the historic heritage in the form of monasteries, churches and cultural buildings? If, in the future, it is possible for a country, such as Turkey, to continue to occupy a part of another future EU country, namely Cyprus, and yet remain a Member State, what will have happened to that democracy and spirit of reconciliation that forms the very soul of European cooperation and the very values that underlie it? In that case, what will have become of our credibility in working for peace?</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that it is necessary for Turkey, in the same ambitious way as Germany, to deal with the dark and sombre chapters of its twentieth century history. It is not acceptable for Turkey to go on denying the Armenian genocide of one and a half million Christians. It is not acceptable for it to deny that Christian Assyrians, Chaldeans and Syrians were also exposed to a genocide in which hundreds of thousands of people were murdered following a fatwa concerning holy war on the Christians, issued in 1914 by the top Muslim leader. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. –<span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the broad agreement in this debate on Turkey's progress. I hope that we can use this common ground when assessing the work in store for us.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise that the Commission agrees with the conclusions and views expressed by the rapporteur, Mr Lamassoure, in his report. Here, too, there is a broad agreement and this, too, will be helpful as we continue in our work. Several speakers have said, and I should like to stress this, that Turkey has become more, rather than less, important to us. And this does not only have to do with its geo-strategic position. I have always warned about reducing Turkey to a locality of special geo-strategic importance. I prefer to believe that Turkey's uniqueness also lies in its cultural and historic heritage and in the political role which it can play at this global political interface. The political elite in Turkey have demonstrated that they are absolutely determined to keep modernising the country and bringing it closer to European standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The constitutional reform which has now been decided is an important indication of this. For me, this constitutional reform represents real progress. Parliament adopted these important resolutions very quickly and with an overwhelming majority. I think this large majority is particularly important, because it clearly shows that there is broad social consensus on the need for democratic and rule-of-law reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">These changes need to demonstrate that they are effective in practice, however. The crucial question to Turkey is always, what has actually changed? Which is why everyone is right who said, during the debate, that the point now, as far as they were concerned, was to see how Turkey implements these promising constitutional reforms and what actually changes. In this respect, the Commission agrees with the European Parliament's appraisal that, the constitutional reforms and further legislative initiatives announced, notwithstanding, a great deal still needs to be done if human rights really are to be securely and permanently protected in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Our relations have progressed well since Helsinki. The pre-accession strategy has been implemented. As with all the other candidate countries, the priorities for Turkey have also been set out in an accession partnership. This year Turkey adopted a national programme for incorporating the <span class="italic">acquis </span>which also includes the timetable for new legislation which has been called for on numerous occasions here in the House. This legislation will need to be in keeping with the <span class="italic">acquis </span>of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to continue the pre-accession strategy for Turkey on the basis of the principles adopted in Helsinki. This obviously means that there can be no talk of starting negotiations until the political criteria for accession have been met. I would stress here that we are not in the business of offering discounts on the political criteria for accession to the European Union to anyone anywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in keeping with the philosophy behind the Helsinki resolutions that, with the exception of negotiations, Turkey must be treated in exactly the same way in all other areas as the other candidate countries. The Lamassoure report refers to the difficult economic situation in Turkey. I should like to encourage Turkey to continue with the economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund. As for us, we shall release the first tranche of EUR 75 million from the European Union structural adjustment facility for Turkey as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Cyprus is concerned, we continue to abide firmly by the view that the peace process should be resumed as quickly as possible under the auspices of the United Nations. Turkey has promised to support this process. But I must say quite unequivocally that the European Union expects this support to translate into specific action and result in our actually resolving this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that accession negotiations with Cyprus will be concluded during the course of next year, which is why it is particularly important that the parties involved make every effort to find a lasting political solution. The components for a solution, which take account of the interests and concerns of all involved, are well documented. What we need is the political courage to grab this opportunity and resolve the Cyprus question now. The window of opportunity is open. But, it must be said, it will probably not be open for much longer.</p>
<p class="contents">A solution to the Cyprus question will benefit future relations between the European Union and Turkey enormously. Relations between Greece and Turkey have already improved considerably. The Commission welcomes the confidence-building measures agreed. I congratulate the two foreign secretaries, Ismail Cem and Georgios Papandreos on their initiative and their success. Both foreign secretaries did a great deal to foster a climate conducive to further progress in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as outstanding problems with European security and defence policy are concerned, I called on Turkey, just a few days ago, to help achieve a constructive solution as quickly as possible. In all events, this problem should be resolved before the meeting of the European Council in Laeken in December this year.</p>
<p class="contents">A little extra effort and it should be possible, and I am convinced that it is possible, to reach an agreement. We are fully aware of Turkey's concerns, especially, as regards, possible action in its neck of the woods. But I call on our Turkish partners to take a constructive attitude so that an agreement can be reached soon. We should be able to expect a country which is a candidate for membership of the European Union to support rather than block one of the most important future projects of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that it is important to improve relations between Turkey and Armenia in order to foster security and stability in the region. The Commission therefore welcomes the very recent initiative by the civil society in the two countries to bring the two nations closer together and, with the help of independent historians, to reappraise the tragic events of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the European Parliament's position on the programme of financial assistance. The proposed amendments are acceptable to us. I particularly agree with the European Parliament that care must be taken to ensure that various sources of funding and programmes are properly coordinated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we are probably now in a decisive stage of relations between the European Union and Turkey. Once the Lamassoure Reports have been adopted we shall have all the elements needed for our pre-accession strategy to hand by the end of the year. We can then go on to the next stage in which we shall have to focus mainly on stepping up and putting Turkish preparations for accession into practice.</p>
