<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haug (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we face an enormous challenge with the budget for the year 2001. The first budget of the new millennium must strengthen the social and cultural dimension of Europe and honour the commitments which the European Union has set itself vis-à-vis its citizens and vis-à-vis the international community. What does that mean in practice and what do we expect from the Commission as we draw up the preliminary draft budget, Commissioner?</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we assume that the budget will take suitable account of policies newly introduced or reinforced by the Treaty of Amsterdam. Even if we have deliberately dispensed in the Committee on Budgets from including detailed information and statements on each of these political areas, this does not imply that they are any less of a priority but merely that we wished to be as brief as possible and we expect commensurate account to be taken of them. We still consider the implementation of equal opportunities, equality and environmental sustainability to be priorities which we wish to see anchored in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The main priority for the budget 2001 must still be to remain active in the fight against unemployment. That does not mean, and let me be quite clear on this, financing huge employment programmes at European level, nobody wants that. What we do want, however, is to provide the strategic momentum needed so that small and medium-sized enterprises can quickly start using the structures of the new information and communications technologies and participating in the information society. This form of strategic initiative will safeguard international competitiveness and development potential and hence strengthen the enterprises which continue to provide the majority of jobs within the European Union and which still create most new jobs. I am pleased to report that we are at one with the Council on this point and I am sure that we shall be able to implement some of the commitments and objectives formulated in Lisbon in the forthcoming budget in a spirit of partnership and consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this core initiative for the budget 2001, we must not allow the quality of economic and political integration achieved in the meantime to eclipse our cultural identity as Europeans. This does not mean centralisation and standardisation, by no means; on the contrary, it means promoting cultural diversity. Supporting the regional cultural industry means that we shall be laying its economic foundations and securing its potential to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">We want the next budget to meet the challenges of efficient administration and guarantee the necessary transparency in European finances. We support the Commission’s efforts to introduce Activity Based Budgeting. We support efforts to allocate administrative and personnel costs openly and clearly to each budget area and this must be accompanied by efforts to improve political control of the budget and to improve the implementation of political priorities. Parliament sets particular store by this. We shall monitor these objectives closely during the reform process. But one thing must be absolutely clear: any attempt to reduce parliamentary scrutiny and control of the budget will not be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest challenge, however, is in relation to our commitment to reconstruct and secure peace and stability in the Balkans. I would stress here quite clearly and unequivocally that, as far as the objectives are concerned and the need to provide the necessary funds for them, there is no dissent whatsoever. The European Parliament also stands by these commitments. We know that the Council also stands by its commitments and, at the donor conference today, the Portuguese Foreign Minister stated, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, that the Council wished to secure lasting stability in the Balkans and that efforts would need to be made over several years in order to achieve this. In other words, the Council recognises these demands and these commitments. However, we expect the Council to set itself these new challenges and to act accordingly. Gaining the ability to act in this important foreign policy area while, at the same time, losing it in other foreign policy areas as the result of excessive savings is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make myself quite clear. The interinstitutional agreement and the budget 2001 are indeed two different pairs of shoes, but both pairs must fit, otherwise we will be unable to walk in them and we will get nowhere. I must stress the fact that we are not questioning the interinstitutional agreement per se; we stand by this agreement, but we are calling for a review which takes real account of demands in a specific area, namely the additional cost of assistance for the Balkans and certain other foreign policy measures. This call is obviously directed at the Commission and the Commission will submit its proposal accordingly; however, this message is also directed at the Council, above all at the Council. I have the very real impression that when the round of finance ministers hears the words ‘review of the interinstitutional agreement’, it immediately thinks of wasted money and sees red. But a review is not a catastrophe; it is a perfectly normal procedure which in no way questions the spirit of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Histrionics do not help, they merely create unnecessary fronts. What we need in order to finance the measures referred to is flexibility. Without flexibility we will get nowhere. I therefore call on the Council to stop adding fuel to the fire. Do not commit yourself to a blockade attitude towards the review. Take your cue from us and work together with us to find a constructive solution which can overcome exaggerated positions both here and there.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few days, the Lisbon Summit has highlighted aspects of the development and future viability of Europe which deserve support. We want to support these aspects in the coming budget and concentrate our efforts on these areas. At the same time, we here in Parliament recognise the need for an economical and efficient budget. The objectives which I mentioned, in which we, the Council and the Commission have a common interest in numerous cases, can only be achieved if we approach the budgetary procedure in an atmosphere of trust and partnership. This means avoiding an escalation of the conflict surrounding the financing of external actions at all costs. So let us use the discussion of the forthcoming Commission proposal for a multiannual programme which has been scheduled for the coming weeks in order to find a viable solution which secures our ability to act in the foreign policy area without impeding our internal priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What are the challenges which we must take into account in the small budgets for the coming year? First, and this applies to all the budgets, budgetary rigour. When I see that we alone in the European Parliament are planning an increase of 0.07% in comparison with the year 2000, then this rigour is guaranteed and we can show our face. Compared with a total budget of EUR 965 million, that does not represent too big a bite out of the cake at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the challenges of Activity Based Budgeting? Of course this is a question which we must also apply to the other institutions, as and where it is sensible to do so. If I look around me here, I might wonder what the costs are in relation to the number of members present. That is not what we mean by these questions; what we mean is transparent expenditure in the budget lines, so that everything is comprehensible. We must draw up a medium-term personnel plan in order to meet the huge challenge of the enlargement of the European Union. This is a huge challenge for us in Parliament and for the translation services in the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been preparing for this over recent years and we must start to take up the challenges and manage personnel developments accordingly in 2001. This gives rise to a second thought which we must consider. How can we work together with other institutions in the area of personnel recruitment? We shall have similar positions to fill in individual areas in the coming years and it makes perfect sense to consider organising and centralising these activities.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind that there are also new challenges in the legislative area since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force. I only have to look at the Commission’s work programme, with its 108 codecision procedures, to see that this is a challenge which we did not have to face in the past. Even in the peak years at the beginning of the 1990s, when we were implementing the internal market programme, we only had a third to a half of the labour costs now being proposed by the Commission and we must organise our work more efficiently and provide the resources so that we can carry out our work accordingly. This includes preliminary scientific work, I should like to be quite clear on that. We are dealing with a Commission which has a joint research centre. We are dealing with 15 Member States which have their own national resources and, as a legislator with equal rights, Parliament must naturally make use of its opportunities here.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest, and the Committee on Budgets agrees with me here, that we introduce improvements in the area of public relations, so that we have a starting point at which citizens who want to find out more about the work of Parliament can do so without needing to be in an official group of visitors. We suggest that we make provision for new posts in certain areas, but only where absolutely necessary. We shall have to examine this very closely over coming weeks and months because we have some room for manoeuvre. We have taken a very reasonable approach to buildings policy, as far as the costs of the European Parliament building are concerned, but it makes no sense if we again destroy our new found freedoms straight away in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the other institutions are concerned, I only have a few comments to make. I think we should try to ensure that the interpreting service starts working more closely with the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions forthwith. There is potential for collaboration here. We shall have to monitor the Court of Justice very closely. I hope that new rules will be developed for the Court of Justice during the review of the Treaty which will allow it to operate efficiently and which will ensure that there is long-term financing for personnel planning. I should expressly like to praise the Court of Auditors which not only monitors us strictly, it also honours its undertakings to the letter, and I think that we must also ensure that funds are used economically as regards the Ombudsman, especially as far as new posts are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank everyone who worked with us on this, especially our own administration, for their correct and very positive preliminary work, and all the honourable Members who made it possible for us to present a proper result to plenary despite the limited time available.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So I treat this as a beginning and not an end. As a beginning, I would say the Environment Committee would like to reiterate the demands it made last year with regard to the budget. We have a persistent and clear need to continue to work towards greening the budget in all areas of policy activity and I want to see further work on this this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we are spending a lot of money on our external policies, particularly through the PHARE and TACIS programmes, on ways of developing the important role of the environment and the sustainable development of those areas so close to our own borders. I want to see more work from the Commission showing us how that money is being properly and correctly applied and what the positive outcomes are.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to give more consideration to what the agencies are doing and take a more differentiated approach to them depending on their particular roles and activities which we have not done in the past. In particular we want to consider the problems that the Treaty of Amsterdam presents and the fact that the full financial implications of the Treaty of Amsterdam are only being realised this year and we have to take account of that.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee also wants to reiterate its support for continued financial assistance to NGO participation in much of the technical committee work of the Parliament and the Commission. Finally, Mr President, I would say that we continue to oppose the tobacco subsidies which are continuously being paid by the Commission and the sooner we get a chance to do something about it the better.

A number of points have been taken on board. We advocate making radical changes to Budget 2001, firstly by basing the various categories and types of expenditure on modern DAC 1 and DAC 2 categories. This may be double Dutch to some people, but in practice it would enable us to see which poverty eradication categories the money is spent on, and also to give an account of the situation in these terms at a later date. As matters stand, it is impossible to say how much of the money earmarked for poverty eradication is spent on primary education. We must not carry on this way.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We want to see more money in this category being spent on primary education and primary health care, and more on the least developed countries, not by increasing the overall amount, but by apportioning it differently, so that the poverty focus is taken seriously.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we want the EDF expenditure outside Parliament’s budget to be integrated, not because we have something to say about this – although we would very much like to – but at the very least, so that people can see the important uses to which the overall expenditure is being put in our efforts to eradicate poverty. Otherwise, it would not be worthwhile producing yet another annual report on this expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, our opinion makes it clear that we want to group the various budget lines together under various headings, so as to afford a better and more coherent overview of this budget, rather than having dozens of budget lines, which makes the budget opaque to anyone who cares to study it. We want transparency. And fortunately we are very much of the same mind as the Committee on Budgets on that score. It is not so much about providing more money, as spending what we have more effectively, and creating greater accountability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee highlights the importance of appropriate training for women, moving beyond the traditional mould, promoting on-going training, specialisation and the integration of women into the phenomenon represented by new technologies, so that society may gain a large number of highly qualified women whose participation at all levels – business, political and social – results from both qualitative and quantitative criteria. It also requests that a new priority line be added to the e-Europe initiative, bearing in mind that the information society has enormous potential for women, not only with regard to training and access to knowledge, but also because of the opportunity of new jobs or new working methods which may help to reconcile family life.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee highlights the need for adequate appropriations to be provided and for the relevant comments to be added to the budget with regard to the strict application of the principle of mainstreaming which guarantees equal opportunities between men and women in the planning, implementation and assessment of all European Union projects and programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee requests that the Commission support the Fifth Action Programme for equal opportunities, drawn up with the aim of overcoming the difficulties of the previous programme and asks that the principle of equal opportunities be applied in all Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee requests that a programme for employment be created, specifically targeting women and, to this end, requests that a budget line be created to finance it, with the fundamental aim of achieving equality between men and women in the workplace, not only by means of measures to protect that equality but also by means of special formulae, which will allow women to integrate fully in the labour market without jeopardising other aspects of their lives.</p>

I must emphasise that the amenability of the rapporteur, whom I congratulate, has enabled a broader consensus to be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Going back to the first four paragraphs of the motion for a resolution, which identify the European Parliament’s political priorities, and then those that contain the essence of its position, I would like to highlight the following aspects: appropriate funding is being promoted for the new policies introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam as well as for the policies that have been strengthened by the Treaty in the fields of internal and external action. In this way we are sending out a clear political message. The provisions of the Treaty are designed to be implemented. It is not merely a declaration of intent, which would be a serious example of political hypocrisy as well as completely unacceptable. The substance of the Treaty must be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The report broaches the issue of employment in terms of job creation, which in turn is connected to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as to the use of new technologies. This, for us, is the crucial approach. It is vital for new jobs to be created and this depends on the initiative and the creativity of entrepreneurs. Let there be investment, then, in a culture of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The report restates the need for a sustainable and multiannual contribution to financial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo and for the stabilisation of the Balkans as part of a review of the financial perspective. It rejects such financing if it is to be provided at the expense of existing commitments, either involving external actions or through cuts in the common agricultural policy or other policies. New money must be found for new requirements, with the condition, as always, of judiciously identifying those requirements, and the rigorous use of funds, as should always be the case. In relation to Kosovo, this concern seems to be particularly reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">The report insists on the need to reform the European Union’s administrative system, which is essential if there is to be efficiency, responsibility and transparency. This debate has launched the budget procedure and, at the end of the year, when the final assessment is made of the draft budget for 2001, it must contain the essence of this Parliament’s position. Unless that is the case, the democratic legitimacy that Parliament gives to the actions of the European Union, particularly in the budgetary process, would be an enormous confidence trick, which the public would see through and for which they would not forgive us.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gill (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to start off by congratulating Mr Ferber on excellent guidelines. I welcome the clear orientation of the report to planning for enlargement. The drive towards efficiency is especially vital in the context of enlargement. It is important even at this early stage that we have a clear strategy on how the institutions will respond to the accession of new members. We need to be imaginative about how we address the issues of staffing and building requirements. The institutions cannot respond to enlargement by just adding an extra post here or an office there. We do not want a Lego approach to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is a major rethink about management of operations and that involves all the institutions exploring alternative ways and embracing new information technologies wholeheartedly. This is especially important in relation to linguistic support. I am totally in support of the idea outlined by Mr Ferber regarding the setting up of an interinstitutional recruitment office because I believe it will help reduce costs and reduce competition between the institutions in attracting new personnel. As everybody here needs to recognise, there are major limitations in relation to resources that will be available as a result of enlargement and there are implications for the financial perspective in relation to Category 5 expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these guidelines are not just about enlargement they are about policy direction for all the institutions next year. Therefore, greater accountability and transparency have to be top priority because the European citizen does not distinguish between the different institutions. All the other institutions have to undertake a fundamental review along similar lines to those proposed by the Commission’s reform agenda because what the European taxpayers want is the reassurance that they are getting value for money and that includes not just the institutions but also political parties, Members of Parliament and staff. Any changes have to be clearly justified and transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Improvements and efficiencies need to be demonstrated by every institution and I believe that this can only be achieved through tools such as activity-based budgeting and thorough examination of current policies and systems and procedures. One of the biggest inefficiencies that we have is the location of EU institutions and if we want to be taken seriously we need to focus our work on one seat. I appreciate we have obligations under the treaties to two different locations but we should make sure that these are not expanded. Many of you are aware that the UK is reluctant to expand the scope of qualified majority voting but this is one issue where the UK would gladly see majority voting take place.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, our group’s priorities are that these guidelines are budgetary prudence, improving efficiency, more effective budgetary control, better use of resources and general improvements in services and management, so I call upon all the other institutions to take these on and implement these improvements vigorously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish them both luck in the task facing them. Drafting the budget means spending taxpayers’ money. For that reason the work is important and calls for stringent budgetary discipline. There are many areas that call for financing, but there are only a few vital ones. Only the vital areas can receive public funding.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to stringent budgetary discipline we wish to stress the following: our Group gives its full support to the package of reforms as proposed by Mr Kinnock. Activity-Based Budgeting and management will be the cornerstones of these reforms. They will emphasise the importance of personal responsibility, diminish the bureaucratic load and enhance efficiency. But the reforms will require cooperation with the staff. That is why we have to prepare carefully for the forthcoming talks regarding the reform of staff regulations. The current staffing structure has to be clarified and made more flexible, so as to facilitate the reallocation of funds, for example. The work of reform might also demand additional budgetary proposals, which we urge the Commission to be prepared for.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Haug’s report stresses the importance of culture as a means of creating jobs. Culture as such falls within the competence of the Member States. However, culture as a means of livelihood is an area which is rapidly growing in importance. For that reason we support the report insofar as it emphasises the importance of developing this within the framework of structural action. In a later debate on the budget we wish to draw attention to the matter of sufficient appropriations for science and research and financing the fight against exclusion in all its forms, within the meaning of Article 13 of the Treaty. Our group also believes that Category 1 of the financial perspective – agricultural expenditure – should not be used as a primary source of financing in response to needs that become manifest in external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Ferber’s report, we would like to remark that we are disinclined to take a position on the details as yet, including the establishment of posts. Nevertheless, we consider it vital that reforms concerning members’ rules be established promptly, in accordance with earlier agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rapporteur Haug, whom I too would like to thank for the agreeable cooperation there has been between us, states that the Commission must not enter into financial commitments, or arouse expectations without first consulting the budgetary authority. I am all in favour of this. Consultation is a good thing and it is important to know which way the wind is blowing. But this must not prejudice the European Commission’s right of initiative. It is only right that the Commission, of all the institutions, should serve the interests of Europe, although it has to be said that during the negotiations for Budget 2000 we saw all too often how one half of the budgetary authority was mainly preoccupied with the national coffers.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In fact the question of self-interest brings me automatically onto paragraph 22. I know that rapporteur Haug will shed no tears if we remove this paragraph from the text. Nor will my group. But it is a different story with the Council. At least I assume that the Council applauds the fact that we make the point in the text that special budgetary needs should be spread equally over all budgetary categories. After all, this will lead to cuts in the programmes in Categories 2 and 3, which are chock-a-block, whilst the lion’s share of the money left in Category 1 will be able to find its way back into the national coffers at the end of the year, on account of fluctuating prices or the anticipated changes to the sugar regime, among other factors. I hope that we will be able to re-think this commitment appropriation and agree amongst ourselves to first await the Commission’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word about our amendment to Mr Ferber’s report. The institutions are being asked to discontinue discrimination on the basis of the nature of officials’ long-term relationships. Some of my fellow delegates thought this was going into too much detail for the guidelines. I would like to point out that what we do concern ourselves with in this text is officials who have a duty of maintenance, and allowances for dependent children. In all probability, a guideline will be adopted in the course of this year which will ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation within the labour market. I hope you will seize the opportunity to lead the way in the fight for equal treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Haug is not to blame. Taken in isolation, a good number of her subparagraphs are acceptable, and some are even excellent, and my group will vote in favour of them. On the whole, however, without even mentioning specifically those paragraphs which we find quite simply unacceptable, I consider that this report lacks the clear political will, the strong ambition, the resolute decisions which Parliament should, in my opinion, be expressing at this stage in the budgetary battle, for this year’s battle promises, once again, to be a hard fought one.</p>
<p class="contents">Each and every one of us can remember the trial of strength we had to take part in last year with the Council because the Council wished to complete the funding of the reconstruction of Kosovo by drawing particularly on the appropriations for cooperation with the countries of the South. In the end, the majority in Parliament agreed to vote in favour of the budget in return for a limited concession from the Council but also, above all, an undertaking from the Council to accept a review of the financial perspective in the year 2000, if the development of the Balkan situation should require resources significantly greater than those for which provision has already been made.</p>
<p class="contents">This is clearly the case today, but neither the Commission nor the Council seems resolved to respect the spirit of this commitment and fund our new priorities without compromising our traditional priorities. However, while the report recitals clearly record this position, particularly recitals A, B and D, on the other hand, subparagraph 22, which has already been mentioned, advocates, ‘equal’ distribution of the financial consequences of special budgetary needs instead of a limited revision of the financial perspective, with additional resources. Once again, there are plans to rob Peter to pay Paul in accordance with the sacrosanct budgetary Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I remain convinced that we must, on the contrary, ask the question clearly: do we wish to play an active part on this continent and throughout the world? If we do, then we should provide ourselves, in moderation, but steadfastly, with the financial resources to do so. The same reasoning is equally applicable to other priorities, which have been advertised but not acted upon, such as social aspects, employment or even cooperation with the countries of the South.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, beyond this vote, there will be enough of us to relaunch the initiative in time, in this spirit, and, this time, to hold out until the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to stress from the outset that, if we want to boost employment in the European Union, it is of fundamental importance to build on the role of small and medium-sized enterprises for, when all is said and done, they are the hard core of our undertaking in Europe. With regard to the reference to the cultural economy and new technologies, this should also be included in the Lisbon report, and my view is that we will be able to use these bases to boost employment substantially. We often talk of a new economy, but if, then, at the end of the day, we ourselves do not focus on the potential core factors, which, in this case, are culture and new technology, then we will certainly not be able to produce solutions. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, I welcome the fact that the item of natural disasters occurring within our nations has been reinserted in the budget. Why? Because in this way we can help Member States when they suffer natural disasters, such as earthquakes, for example, because otherwise people will fail to understand why it is that we intervene in countries such as Kosovo, and yet do not seem able to intervene in our own States. And so I welcome the reinsertion of this item in the budget as a major step.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on a more antagonistic note, I have to point out that we cannot make cuts in agriculture as a matter of course. Naturally, we must finance the Kosovo mission as a fundamental political objective, in order to erase the effects of the war and to prove the existence of a political objective, but we cannot always do so at the expense of agriculture. I would also stress that we need constant guidelines from the Council and the Commission, for we cannot manage on the same budget as last year. It was only thanks to the patience and tenacity of President Wynn that we were able to reach the end of the year. We cannot go on like this. Finally, I would stress the need to restructure the budget – for example, we could axe TAOs – and thus secure new resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the course of our discussions on the budgetary guidelines for 2001, we are inevitably faced with the question as to what priorities we should set for European policy over the coming years. The rapporteur, Mrs Haug, cites four priorities, some of which could be described as dubious. What concerns me more, however, is that she scarcely mentions the top priority for the coming years, i.e. enlargement, and when she does it is uninformative. Does she want us to wear blinkers? More European integration, more social and cultural programmes, more employment: it is all very reminiscent of the outdated notion that social change can be effected by government policy, but neither the current Member States nor the candidate countries stand to benefit from an expanding package of tasks. The idea is gaining ground that the European Union’s package of tasks must come up for discussion, a point Commissioner Kinnock made too.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that Mrs Haug wants a report on the aforementioned package of tasks, but the outcome seems to be a foregone conclusion as far as she is concerned. After all, it is evident from paragraph 4 that she wants to maintain all the existing programmes. If that is to be the point of departure, and given that she even advocates fresh tasks, any discussion on key tasks is doomed to failure. We should enter into a discussion of the key tasks with an open mind, and be prepared to learn from past mistakes.</p>

<p class="contents">Last year, the European Parliament brought the financial ceiling up for discussion at an early stage by seizing on the financing for Kosovo and the entire Balkans as leverage in our efforts to obtain a review of this ceiling. As one might expect, the Council has not got round to it yet. What are the financial frameworks for Agenda 2000 worth when, only a year on, we are no longer honouring them? Mr Prodi’s statement to the effect that more than EUR 5 billion must be placed on the table for the Balkans in the years to come, was rash, to put it mildly. He raised hopes without consulting the budgetary authority, nor did he give any indication as to where the money was supposed to come from. Any politician should know that new expenditure must have the requisite financial cover. This point is made in two amendments, which I drafted, among others.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We await the Commission’s multiannual planning next month. It apparently intends to look to the agriculture budget to cover the first tranche of EUR 300 million. In common with paragraph 22, I am against making one budgetary category, i.e. agriculture, take all the strain of our financing needs. Agenda 2000 has just put an end to what was previously such generous budgeting for Category 1. There is more scope for this in other categories to my mind; the Structural Funds, for example. As the rapporteur herself says, the “large, the very large accumulated backlog” also continues to be the actual ceiling, the spending goal for the Structural Funds. The rapporteur even wants to see this backlog used up in one go next year! This is all very worrying, because enforced spending of funds plays into the hands of fraudsters and damages efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">On a final note: rapporteur Ferber’s request for a Commission proposal on a statute for political parties. That is a matter for the parties themselves, irrespective of the fact that European parties are widening the gulf between the general public and European politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Healthy growth and low unemployment are what we all want. Europe needs to set the framework, which is one of the reasons it created the Treaty of Amsterdam. But the real responsibility for employment, and this is not the first time that I have stressed this, lies with the Member States. A <span class="italic">greencard</span> alone, such as that for which provision has been made in Germany, is not a practice which makes perfect. It is in practice that a Member State demonstrates at home if it is being innovative or if it is hiding with an innocent expression behind the EU. That would be cheap and it would not be right.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to manage a plethora of international fisheries agreements and conventions over the coming year, all of which have budgetary implications, because if we want to keep our products on the global market, we need raw materials and imports and they do not come cheap. However, we in the Committee on Fisheries cannot really go to town, Commissioner, because you have still not provided us with the long-promised cost-benefit analyses on our fisheries agreements. How can we stand up to the Committee on Budgets’ demand for rigour in these circumstances?</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will have a new fisheries policy from 2002, a huge, fascinating venture with a global dimension. We are already making the necessary preparations, which is why we also need the strong guidelines planned by the main rapporteur in the fisheries sector. Later we will need the commensurate funds.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the first year in which the full budgetary procedure comes to fruition, we are all bound to be highly enthusiastic. Everyone wants to have their say, as we have seen in the very active and lively debates over recent days and weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union budget of EUR 90 billion represents so many hopes, the hopes of people looking for support. They may be farmers in the European Union, who obviously want appropriate remuneration, a just reward, which they have earned, for producing healthy food. They may be the regions in Europe which are lagging behind in terms of economic development and which expect much from the solidarity of the European Union, namely assistance to help them develop into a balanced system of cohesion within the European Union, as far as living and working conditions are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">There are the hopes of the unemployed, who want us to support them along the path back to work. There are the hopes of the young, there are hopes throughout the world, in which we, as the rich continent of Europe, and we are the rich continent of Europe, can give assistance. And there are hopes at the heart of Europe, where we have a cancerous growth called war, where there are people who are forced to live in appalling conditions, people who need a future, people who need hope.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want any curious divisions of tasks, as are presently becoming apparent, when this money is distributed over the coming weeks and months. It is becoming apparent that there are people on the one side who are making promises left, right and centre and raising their estimates. Contrary to what has been said here time and again, agricultural spending will not fall, it will rise by nearly 5% or even more than 5% next year. We must not upset the farmers too much in this European Union. We cannot have a situation in which people on the one side, i.e. the Council, promise money and increase the sums involved and then come to us in Parliament and say, be sure to keep overall expenditure down, make cuts in all areas and tell all other ‘hopefuls’ that there is nothing for them. This division of tasks is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can we have a situation in which the international community sits down at the donor conference, promises money and says to Kosovo and everyone living in the Balkans, we will support you, you will get money for what you want. In future, excavators will be rattling past, not tanks. You must be able to reconstruct and we want to help you. We cannot have a situation in which they promise so much and then come and say, take the money we need from the most needy. That cannot be.</p>
<p class="contents">We have stretched out our hand. Mrs Haug has stretched out her hand. She has said that we are prepared to work openly with the Council and the Commission. We want to show you that there is no need for a repeat of last year’s tragedy, with heckling and confrontation throughout the entire budgetary procedure. We can work together. You should know that. Take the outstretched hand. But I say quite clearly at this point that, if you signal that you are not prepared to cooperate with us and that we are on course for a confrontation, then this Parliament is not defenceless or powerless and we shall use our powers for the people who place their hopes in us and we shall certainly not disappoint them. Take the outstretched hand and do not engage in the same pettiness as last year, because it damages all of us in Europe, including the people who pin their hopes on us.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I could not agree more with Mrs Haug when she stated in her introduction that she favours a thrifty budget. I share this view. I believe this is the least we owe our electorate, for a number of reasons. This year too, discussion will focus on what we must do in the Balkans, and particularly in Kosovo. My position is roughly the same as the one I took last year. I am prepared to get involved, but I want to know exactly how much money it will cost first. A figure of 5.5 billion has been plucked out of the air, but no one has made out a satisfactory case for this as yet.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with many other speakers that it is unacceptable for one category of the budget to have to be saddled with covering these costs. We should use the relevant budget items for this and perhaps turn to agriculture from time to time when there is actually money left over in this category.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In short, amending the financial perspective is not an end in itself, but should only be undertaken, in my view, as an absolute last resort. My final point does not relate specifically to next year, but to the years to come. A tiny amount of the whole agriculture budget is to be earmarked for the outbreak of infectious animal diseases. I believe that if we were to have another swine fever crisis in Europe, or a BSE crisis, it would cost the earth. I therefore feel that the Commission should get down to work as quickly as possible on an insurance system for outbreaks of infectious animal diseases of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the financial situation which dictates future development. The major topics are correctly positioned in the main report, but the report lacks content. Fighting unemployment through economic growth is the greatest challenge facing Europe. The Lisbon Summit announced the direction to be taken up to the year 2010. We must therefore expect future intergovernmental conferences to substantiate how this is to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers and cooperatives expect the European Commission to reduce the amount of red tape in the agricultural economy and adopt budgetary guidelines based on calculation, reliability and progressive structures. The Berlin resolutions set out agricultural policy up to the year 2006. Farmers and politicians fought hard for this position. If a premature review should be necessary, because the social analysis uses different standards, then let it only be in comparison with facts and figures, and let us retain what was successful, i.e. reliability, rather than dismantling Agenda 2000 piece by piece until what is left is hardly recognisable.</p>
<p class="contents">The ink was barely dry on the budget 2000 when Mrs Schreyer demanded a financial review and financial perspective for the priorities, together with action on negative expenditure. Unless these funds are channelled back into the agricultural budget, Agenda 2000 will be jeopardised, especially as further technical inconsistencies are to be expected. This is a policy based on rough estimates and founded on pure observation. Of course, the Balkans must be reconstructed but, overall, in a spirit of social solidarity. Then, and I am convinced of this, the farmers and cooperatives will also make their contribution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, we would protest against the veritable misappropriation of funds which is proposed: the inappropriate use of resources reserved for agricultural expenditure under Category I of the financial perspective as a source of funding to be used to meet funding requirements in the sphere of foreign policy. We find this attempt to fund the reconstruction of Kosovo at the expense of European farmers, and to convince us that there is no budgetary solution other than this outrageous deception, absolutely iniquitous.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite the contrary, we should maintain expenditure on agriculture, the compulsory expenditure, and moderate expenditure under other categories, where there are unquestionable margins. We must therefore reject annual funding of the EUR 5.5 billion intended for the Balkans, an amount calculated by the European Commission on who knows what basis, by raising the ceiling for external expenditure and lowering that under the agricultural categories, on the erroneous grounds that appropriations would not be taken away from agriculture but that it would be appropriate to release the margins for 2001 and 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, we are all aware that the mid-term review planned by the Berlin Summit is due to take place in 2003. When this occurs, there is no doubt that if the dubious practice proposed by the Commission, and forcefully denounced by our Group, is endorsed by Parliament, it will then be claimed by many as an acquired right. It therefore constitutes an extremely dangerous precedent as far as our farmers are concerned. This, moreover, is the message clearly expressed by the European Council in Lisbon, whose conclusions unequivocally refused to incorporate the Commission’s wish to reduce the agricultural budget by EUR 300 million in 2001, and by the same again in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Regardless of the background, we do not accept the challenging of the conclusions of the Berlin Summit represented by this continual demand for the financial perspective and the various categories to be revised. We accept it still less in light of the fact that the calculations for the European Commission’s ambitious Balkans programme lack both discipline and precision, that the Union’s existing appropriations for Kosovo cannot be spent in full and that other donor states are not meeting their financial commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">So I repeat, Mr President, there are no grounds for the call for the revision of the financial perspective. We therefore reject it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, we are still lacking explicit support for such relevant fields as scientific research, technological innovation and development. Failure to take these into account in the Union’s budget is equivalent to going out on a rainy day without an umbrella. Without a constant and intense effort in these fields there will be no competitiveness and a lack of competitiveness means no new jobs will be created. We have therefore introduced an amendment to cover this.</p>
<p class="contents">Another amendment that we have suggested, in accordance with what was agreed at the European Council in Lisbon, refers to the fact that employment is one of the Union’s great political priorities for the coming years and that objective is unfailingly expressed, as Mrs Haug correctly points out, through<span class="bold"> </span>policies which favour small and medium-sized businesses. However, it is not enough simply to give them access to new communication and information technologies. The Internet is a tool, not a magic wand. Without a decisive programme for basic structural reforms, which improve the ability of European business to compete, the digital era will be a time of frustration for Europe, hence our amendment designed to remind us of this fact which is so obvious and yet so worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to what Mrs Haug describes as the “cultural economy”, we have pointed out that she mentions it amongst the political priorities, and then it fails to appear elsewhere in the text. In order to deal with this methodological inconsistency, we have proposed an amendment which expands on this thought-provoking concept. In any event, the rapporteur has, in our judgement, correctly established the bases which will set the course for Section III of the Union’s budget for 2001 and we are happy to offer her our sincere congratulations on her work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ralf Walter made the very pertinent point that agriculture expenditure will actually increase and if money is taken from 1A it will be from surpluses, but let us wait until the PDB comes along.</p>
<p class="contents">We are working on assumptions when we present this report from Mrs Haug. I am just referring to the Haug report not to Mr Ferber’s. I congratulate the pair of them but in this Haug report we make certain assumptions about the revision, about redeployment in Category 4 and about the needs of Kosovo. However, I need to remind the Council – and at least we have one willing scribe down there if no one else is doing the night shift for the Council to get the message across – that really, if the Commission makes the proposal which we expect them to make, then they are duty bound, because of the interinstitutional agreement, to discuss with Parliament what that revision should be before their first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">My gut feeling is that there will be no agreement with the Council on getting a revision of the financial perspective. Well, if that is the case, the message needs to go out now loud and clear that we will have the same bumpy ride with the budget this year that we had last year and you will not win. We will be determined to do our best for the Balkans and Kosovo but, at the same time, we will be realistic for those other policies which Parliament considers to be important.</p>
<p class="contents">The trouble with the Council is that everything revolves around what was agreed at Berlin. We keep being told that Berlin is set in concrete. Well, in the words of Hugh McMahon who was one of my colleagues up to the last Parliament, in a debate on shipbuilding, he once said, ‘We don’t want it set in concrete, we want it set in runny cement’, and I presume that what we want in this day and age is to have the Berlin Agreement in a type of runny cement so at least you can be flexible enough to agree with us that things have to change.</p>
<p class="contents">I make the point, Mr President, as I did yesterday in the Budgets Committee, in the twelve years of the financial perspective there have been 38 revisions totalling over EUR 7 000 billion of monies that have been involved in those revisions. Kosovo is one of those occasions where the financial perspective is not flexible enough and it needs to be changed and that message has to be got through otherwise there will be problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is not that it would be impossible to put an end to unemployment immediately, but it would take a proactive policy that was not reluctant to draw on the profits of financial and industrial groups or the personal fortunes of major shareholders. Then, what word other than hypocritical can be used to describe the European institutions’ claim to wish, and I quote, to eradicate poverty wherever it exists while still permitting industrial groups to exacerbate poverty right here in the richest countries of Europe, and providing political instruments for these same groups in order to promote the criminal plundering they undertake in the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that it would be futile to ask the European institutions to do something of which they are incapable, designed as they are, like the national states, to favour profits and represent the interests of the wealthy classes.

The Ferber report is a very courageous exposition of the present and future needs of Parliament. A European Parliament interested in the new information technologies, a European Parliament aware that its organisation must, as a priority, revolve around the new tasks which the MEPs are obliged to carry out under the Treaty of Amsterdam. This report proposes changes. Changes always meet resistance in institutions and we should therefore be especially grateful that the rapporteur has wished to draw up this report with the support of the PPE, and, we hope, of the other political groups in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mrs Haug, has reached broad areas of compromise in her report, which we hope will be respected in the vote, and which we hope will strengthen Parliament’s commitment with regard to employment, culture, the new Amsterdam policies and, no less importantly, the budgetary obligations and rights. This House voted by a majority for a financial perspective which respected the political balances of Berlin, even when we were all aware of its shortcomings in the face of unexpected external events. Last December, this Parliament voted to maintain the financial perspective and the interinstitutional agreement despite the fact that, at that time, the Council drew out the negotiation to unacceptable limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the Council, Parliament and the Commission are bound by a signed commitment. This is a very serious commitment. If we have to finance new policies, we have to find new funding. If the Council intends to finance actions in the Balkans at the expense of current external or agricultural policies, it would not only be showing a lack of political vision but it would also be failing in the commitments it has signed up to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Providing the quantities and quality needed therefore represents a real challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Schreyer, I should like to ask you if you can really tell us which budgetary lines create, maintain or destroy factories and/or jobs? Is there in fact a valuation which we can use as a starting point to say which budgetary lines support the creation of new jobs? Does DG IV have any scientific studies or papers on the subject? If we have a budgetary procedure, can we then establish if the main priority which we have now set at European level has been achieved, and where new jobs are being created or where new jobs are being destroyed?</p>
<p class="contents">Today in question time I asked the Commission how many jobs are lost if manufacturing plants making products which cannot be exported because they are banned in Europe are closed down. Commissioner Byrne quite rightly said that, as far as he was concerned, public health took priority. This morning we discussed environmental protection. Then it was said that environmental protection took priority. I think we should find an objective procedure which safeguards new jobs. We can only do so if there is proper representation of the confederations of industry, especially confederations of small enterprises employing up to 10 people. I think that this sector should receive far more support in the future, including at European level, because this is where jobs are created, this is where new products are invented and where the future is shaped.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that also represents an opportunity in relation to the enlargement of the EU. We must endeavour above all to include small enterprises. That is an important function and social dialogue is needed here. I would be pleased to see new initiatives in this area.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to wish the new Commissioner well in her first budget and say that I sincerely hope that we can have a smooth and effective procedure in which all of us will do the best we can to produce a sensible budget in a most efficient way.</p>
<p class="contents">If there are to be problems – and sometimes there are problems – it will be around this whole question of the proposal to finance the shortfall in Category 4 with money from the agricultural section of the budget. This proposal is more likely to create psychological problems throughout the European Union in rural areas than real problems. We have to reassure European farmers and say to them there are regulations in place, those regulations grant entitlements to European farmers and there is no possibility whatever happens that those obligations can be denied by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we do have a fall in incomes. We did have a statement by the Commission for 2000-2006 and that set out certain perimeters within which agricultural spending would be provided for. Now we hear new proposals coming forward that if we have a situation of enlargement, we have entirely new proposals for entirely new policies towards the new Member States and without any provision as to how these will be financed. We need a little bit more clarity and there is tension building up between the institutions on this question of the Balkans. The sooner the Commission can propose to us clear figures for year-by-year spending the better.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not actually think that it is necessary to take any money from agriculture in order to finance a decent programme within the amounts of money set out – EUR 5.5 billion – considering what the obligations of the Union are, what the Member States will put up and what is likely to be called upon because of the situation in Serbia. So why generate a battle about some EUR 300 million that, in the end, I do not think that we will have to call down from agriculture? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to reflect the priorities of European policy in the budget of the European Union, that is the objective of this highly premature debate on the budget 2001. It is the first budget for which the new Commission has drawn up a preliminary draft budget and the first budget in which I, as a new Commissioner, shall be involved right from the outset. I think it is really useful that we already have a joint procedure between the European Parliament and the Commission, an understanding of which priorities require financial cover in the 2001 budgetary year.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not yet at the stage of talking specific figures, not yet at the input stage; in fact what we are discussing now is the output. What do we want, what objectives do we want to achieve or support with this budget? In my opinion, setting the priorities like this is the best way of starting the debate on a budgetary year. I note in connection with the priorities being set for the next budgetary year that the reports, that the priorities which you are setting, tally closely with the priorities being set by the Commission. I think that this paves the way for bringing the budgetary procedure to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like in particular to thank the two rapporteurs on behalf of the Commission. I should like to comment on Mr Ferber’s report first and thank him for the support which he has expressed in his report for the Commission’s attempt to gradually convert the budgetary reporting procedure to activity based budgeting. The report suggests that the other institutions will also gradually follow this lead. Above all, the report expresses support for the Commission’s administrative reform and I should expressly like to thank the rapporteur for that. Of course, the Commission will be pleased if the other institutions are also called upon to consider, for their part, which administrative reforms would be advisable and which can be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ferber, you referred in your report to other problems which need to be resolved. I would like to single out the question of financing for political parties. I think that this is an issue on which we need to take joint action to find a speedy solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to Mrs Haug’s report. Mrs Haug, allow me to congratulate you on your report and on successfully concentrating on the priorities, because I can imagine that you must have received a lot of requests, a lot of letters to Santa, asking you to include everyone’s pet concern. You have concentrated instead on the real priorities and I think that is very valuable if we are to reach an understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">You laid particular emphasis on external policy tasks, which I shall come to in a moment. But you also stressed the importance of setting priorities and focal points for research – the Commission shares this view – and the fact that the development of a viable economy also needs to be fostered through budgetary endeavour. At this point, you have already debated this, I should like to comment on the results of the Lisbon Summit. I think that, on balance, the Lisbon Summit was a success for the European Union because everyone agreed that we now need to take huge steps to promote information and communications technologies and that considering how account can be taken of this priority in the budget should be a matter of common concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Haug, I should like in this context to welcome a statement which you made in your speech: you said that we do not want to compete with the Member States’ employment programmes; instead we want to consider what the special European dimension is in relation to each initiative, what can be specifically promoted at European level. I should like to comment on your question as to how great an effect the European budget has on employment. Of course, the programme financed by the Structural Funds is one of the most important instruments for promoting employment. We have again set a horizontal objective for the new period for the Structural Funds, requiring lists to be drawn up even during ex-ante evaluations, setting out and calculating how these special programmes will affect the labour market situation. I am also extremely pleased that my colleague, Mr Barnier, has said that the Commission will not be satisfied with woolly statements but wants specific calculations so that everything can be checked.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission’s priorities are concerned, I should like to point out that the Commission conducted the priorities debate at its meeting on 23 February where it came to the conclusion that particular account should be taken in the budget 2001 of the stronger foreign policy commitments of the European Union and of the important objectives of promoting rural development and supporting the transition to an information society.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment specifically now on the question of the expenditure needed for the Stability Pact in the western Balkans. It was also the central theme of today’s debate. The Commission too has based its conclusions on the priorities for the budget 2001 on an estimated financing requirement in the order of EUR 5.5 billion for the period up to 2006. It has been pointed out on several sides that demands are being made on the Commission. You demanded this of the Commission and the Council in your resolution of 16 December. The Commission is being called upon to submit specific estimates of the funds needed in April and, at the same time, to state the extent to which the financial perspective needs to be reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission came to the conclusion in the priorities debate for the budget 2001 that the funds needed cannot be found merely by redistributing foreign policy funds, although we have, of course, also considered where we can redeploy funds from the foreign policy area. My colleague, Chris Patten, took on this task together with Mr Nielson. However, we came to the conclusion that additional funds are needed which can be financed through other measures, which I shall come to in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress at this point that the figure or estimate of EUR 5.5 billion for the period up to 2006 is being analysed, and rightly so. I should like to point out in this context that EUR 4.5 billion was channelled to the regions from the budget of the European Union between 1991 and 1999. If we now quote a figure of EUR 5.5 billion, of course that represents a considerable increase, but it is not an exorbitant increase and is in proportion to past assistance. I think we are all in agreement on the fact that, in comparison with the last decade, we must focus more strongly on financial assistance and financial aid for the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment now on the financing proposal, especially the point relating to redeploying funds from the agricultural policy area. This is a matter of particular concern to me insofar as anxieties may have been aroused in the debate here which, in my view, are not really justified. Mr Walter, you referred to this in your intervention: the point is not whether agricultural policy expenditure will be reduced in 2001 in comparison with the year 2000; the point is what increase is needed. According to the financial perspective, compared with the budget 2000, an increase of EUR 3.1 billion for agricultural market expenditure would be possible from a purely theoretical point of view, according to the figures. The Commission proposal makes provision for a further increase of EUR 2.8 billion for agricultural market expenditure. I would be obliged if you could take note of this and not say that we are letting a genie out of the bottle in the area of agricultural market policy which will then jeopardise all expenditure. I say again quite clearly, and the Commission also says, that direct income support for farmers will not be affected by the resolution; on the contrary, provision has been made for an overall increase in the order of over 7% for agricultural market expenditure and a really exorbitant increase of 9.5% for rural development. I hope that this will also be supported by the budgetary authority because I think that this rural development programme offers a great deal of scope for promoting new endeavours in agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say a few words on the overall increase in the size of the budget. We have already had the opportunity to debate this twice in the Committee on Budgets. We shall doubtless need to engage in intensive debate with the Council as to the rate by which expenditure needs to be increased. I should like to point out here that a considerable increase is needed on the expenditure side simply in order to be able to honour old commitments made in the past which, of course, have to be paid for.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to note, on the question of the financial perspective, that the Commission proposes, following the European Parliament’s petition and demand, to include expenditure for promoting Cyprus and Malta under enlargement expenditure in the future, i.e. under the heading of Category 7. I think this move would seriously improve the transparency of the budget and I hope that the Council will not stand by its initial rejection of this suggestion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should perhaps come back to the budgetary procedure for the budgetary year 2000. The budgetary procedure last year was extremely exciting, to put it diplomatically. I had a good opportunity to get to know you really well and found that the Committee on Budgets was a very robust committee with excellent staying powers. I assume that the Committee on Budgets of the European Parliament is resolved to take a very decisive position on the budget 2001, but that it is also prepared to negotiate from this very decisive position. However, I hope for all our sakes that the 2001 budgetary procedure will not necessarily put our endurance to the test once again and will be marked by greater consensus. I am also convinced that, should we come to blows again, the Committee on Budgets will demonstrate the same staying powers. I can assure you that the Commission will again be at your constant disposal so that we can achieve a positive result.</p>
