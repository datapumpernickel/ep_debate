<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Laschet,</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>– <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin with a few political comments, so as to underline what the decision we are to make today is all about. After the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, in Bosnia- Herzegovina and in Kosovo, the international community set up civil institutions there – i.e. the European Union established the High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina and the UN set up an interim administration in Kosovo – that now coordinate and manage all civilian activities and all the work done out there. So far, this has been accomplished within the framework of the common foreign and security policy, under the authority of the Council, which has repeatedly decided to maintain these institutions, thereby providing a legal basis for the whole set up.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The 2000 Budget has made a total of EUR 28 million available for these projects in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and has made EUR 12.5 million available for UNMIK, which is the UN transitional administration in Kosovo. Therefore, the Committee on Budgets welcomes the fact that a new legal basis is now to be created for the enormous amounts of money that the European Union is committing to Bosnia-Herzegovina. In future, budgetary policy is not just to be determined within the framework of the common foreign and security policy, under the authority of the Council, but with the participation of the Commission, under its authority and that of the European Parliament with its budgetary powers.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">There is a very long history behind this. In Mostar, for example, Parliament ascertained that, hitherto, the common foreign and security policy had been financed in an unsatisfactory manner and that Parliament did not possess the supervisory powers it needed in this respect to be able to oversee to good effect what was becoming of European taxpayers’ money. That being the case, it is a good thing that the Commission is now to relinquish its role as paymaster and accountant and is itself going to be able to take responsibility in these matters. Parliament is firmly in favour of this.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is to be welcomed that we are to transfer this part of the interim civilian administration within the scope of the Union’s foreign policy to the first pillar, thereby involving Parliament more extensively in the common foreign and security policy. Since the Helsinki and Cologne Summits we have become aware of the extent to which the common foreign policy is changing and how much dynamism and momentum there is in this process, and we see it as very important for the Commission and Parliament, as European institutions, to be heavily involved.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This is the technical background to the text that we are to adopt today. As a Parliament, we will have the opportunity in future to put funds in this political field in reserve and to influence and play a part in the enforcement of particular measures. We will also have the opportunity to make the Commission accountable in the course of the budgetary discharge procedure and to make a better job in future of many of the things that may have gone wrong in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this respect, although the act we are undertaking today may be one for specialists from the point of view of European law, it has great political significance because it also reinforces Parliament’s role in this important political field.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make a few comments on the amendments that the Committee on Budgets has adopted and recommends to this House today. Firstly, in its first proposal, the Council recommended creating an Annex, which could be added to if further civil institutions were required. The Committee on Budgets has made a proposal on this score – and we urge Parliament to support this at the vote – to the effect that all future Community actions that are decided on should require fresh parliamentary decisions. In future, the Council will not be able simply to keep making additions – after all, this has budgetary implications – rather, a parliamentary resolution should be produced in every case. The message I am getting from the Council, the Portuguese Presidency, is that the Presidency and the Commission are very much in favour of reaching a compromise on this proposal and lending it their approval.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament also attaches great importance to the idea that, in future, it too should receive a report on what is happening in these interim civilian administrations and that we should be accountable to the public for the use we make of European Union funds, which I think would create a good deal more transparency. The new Commission has begun to focus on creating greater transparency. It is vital for there to be transparency in this important sphere too, where there is a risk of so much going wrong, as we know from past experience. The issues of ‘interim civilian administration’, ‘peace agreements’ and ‘peace in Europe and in the Balkans’ are of concern to our citizens, and if reports were to start circulating that we were not spending the money wisely, then this could lead to distrust throughout the Union. Accordingly, we are taking an important step today in deciding that, in future, Parliament will be clearly accountable for the Union’s activities in this field.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I believe that if Parliament undertakes, in this particular instance, to make a transfer to the first pillar today, then this will also send out a signal for future developments in the common foreign and security policy. There are other spheres that will require the democratic supervision of a Parliament once they are transferred from national to European level. Once Europe has wrested authority over these areas from the national Parliaments, there will be a need for democratic supervision here too, and the same goes for the common foreign and security policy. I believe we have got off to a good start today in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It looks to be an isolated case of no great significance, but as he said towards the end of his statement, this is about momentous moves to set the course for the future, as well as about sending out signals. That is why it is absolutely vital to secure supervisory powers and opportunities for participation for the European Parliament. I am grateful for the fact that the Committee on Budgets has provided proposals that do justice to my committee’s intentions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is necessary, for example when special representatives are appointed, for us to have a say in each individual case. I think it is vital for the Commission to grasp that what we are doing here is setting a course of decisive importance for future foreign and security policy. In our view, practically all the financial resources for civil crisis management have been at the disposal of the Commission’s budget to date. I believe this instrument should be used and not watered down by making this sphere, like others, increasingly subject to intergovernmentalisation.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">There are moves afoot within the Council that I would describe as extraordinarily dangerous, in that it is deemed acceptable to have matters that are traditionally the preserve of the Community and the first pillar settled exclusively by Foreign Ministers. If we were to go along with this, then we would forfeit all hope of being able, firstly, to emphasise the special significance of the civil aspect and, secondly, to communitarise the common foreign and security policy in the long term, in the context of the interplay between civil and military crisis management, because we would then be committing ourselves to going in an entirely different direction, as is very much the trend in many national capitals these days.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I would urge you and also the Commission to make a fitting contribution, not just in the interests of Parliament, so as to enable it duly to have its say, for this is about the Commission’s role in shaping future foreign and security policy. That is perhaps even more significant than the parliamentary interests we see fit to bring to bear here. Therefore, I am grateful for having 50% more speaking time! We should take the opportunity to make Parliament’s views on this clear and to enter into close cooperation with the Commission, because it is at apparently inconsequential junctures such as this that the tone is set for the future development of the entire European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am able to give Mr Laschet our full backing. I am delighted that the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Budgetary Control are taking exactly the same line for once. The proposal under discussion today is intended to provide a legal basis at Community level to cover the financing of the United Nations’ interim mission in Kosovo and of the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina. As Mr Laschet has made very clear, so far the EU contribution to the financing of these bodies has been made under the common foreign and security policy. We are talking very large amounts: EUR 28 million for the Office of the High Representative, 53% of which is actually to be funded by the European Union, and EUR 12 million to be funded by UNMIK (United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo). The advantage of this new arrangement is that the amounts will in fact be raised from the common foreign and security policy pillar.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">What have we noticed happening in the past? We noticed that the European Commission, which is responsible by virtue of the Treaties for implementation of the budget, had no control over events under the existing arrangement, which is something the Committee on Budgetary Control pointed out time and again. This meant that, in practice, the Commission was actually only acting as paymaster and accountant, which ultimately produced lax policy, lax behaviour and a lack of commitment. A recent special report by the Court of Auditors has shown what this can lead to. We know, for example, that the Financial Controller in Bosnia-Herzegovina invoiced his services to the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia as part of a contract signed with a company of which he himself was manager. That is what I call a conflict of interests. Incidentally, our Committee on Budgetary Control intends to come back to this special report at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, this draft regulation will enable Parliament to exert more influence over the financing of these peace agreements and so, for example, we will be able to place appropriations in the reserve if we want to secure better financial management. Responsibility for implementing the appropriations will no longer be shared between the Commission and the Council but will soon fall solely to the Commission. That is a positive development to my mind, because it means that in future we will also be able to use our discharge procedure as a means of control. </p>
<p class="contents">This draft regulation fits neatly into the framework of a policy that is directed at good management and which takes notice of what becomes of taxpayers’ money. I think we should give Mr Laschet’s report our full backing and vote unanimously in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Färm (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, this specific proposal concerns support for those bodies which the international community must unfortunately establish now and again, either to take care of interim civilian administration in regions affected by conflict or to implement peace agreements. As a Union, we must, of course, assume long-term responsibility for this type of task in Europe. We are already involved in two cases, through the High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina and through the EU’s participation in the UN’s transitional administration in Kosovo. </p>
<p class="contents">The major part of the EU’s operations in Kosovo, for example, will, of course, be concerned with actual reconstruction, but the EU must, naturally, also assume responsibility for those bodies which are required if there is to be a return to a society with a functioning civilian administration, able, in the long run, to become a democratic society cooperating closely with both the EU and the other Balkan countries. </p>
<p class="contents">It is equally obvious that responsibility must be shared fairly between different international players and that there must be correct and detailed regulations relating to how this is to take place. In this regard, I nonetheless feel a certain unease. We are receiving more and more information about an unduly <span class="italic">small</span> proportion of the EU’s aid to Kosovo in fact going to practical reconstruction and an extremely <span class="italic">large</span> proportion of those resources we have allocated for the year 2000 being spent in other ways. Administration of the reconstruction bureau, which is also an important measure, is one such item of expenditure, but here we are also concerned with, for example, budgetary aid and energy imports. </p>
<p class="contents">We are not questioning the significance of these measures, but it is rather alarming if the cost of those operations which constitute the EU’s main task is actually much lower than the 360 million which has been allocated. More information is required in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">In order that the work can be executed quickly, and in the absence of a legal basis, the Council has so far chosen to take a decision on the measures within the framework of the common foreign and security policy. In accordance with the present proposal, this type of measure is now to be transferred to the first pillar. We therefore demand a rethink, firstly of the legal basis for the aid provided by the Union and, secondly, of the way in which we are actually to use those resources which have traditionally been allocated within the sphere of foreign policy but which belong, rather, under the first pillar and Category 4. There appear to be a number of gaps in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission’s proposal and the Council’s wishes are to be complied with and a new budget item created, and if this is, moreover, to be provided with additional net financing, it will be necessary to consult Parliament and carry out a proper budget procedure. I want to be clear on this point: it is not a question of Parliament enjoying the prestige of being able to express its opinion on these questions, but of our now having to realise that these tasks are not of an interim character but are to be more long term in nature. Where operations are concerned, we must have a method which is fast and legally correct and which permits transparency, and we must therefore have a more regular budgetary procedure. </p>
<p class="contents">There must be a great readiness to engage in continued operations of this kind. We must therefore also clarify the way in which the budget is managed, together with the legal basis for the aid. In this way, disputes about these matters will not become obstacles to constructive operations. </p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, I believe that transparency and public scrutiny are important elements of the measures which need to be taken in future. However, these must be combined with speed and efficiency. In an area like Kosovo, decisions cannot be made on operations which are to be delayed for a long time, because the situation may already have had time to change. We should establish conditions for how the resources concerned are to be used, but we should not have procedures which are so complicated that the EU is accused of inefficiency or that important reconstruction operations are delayed. It is therefore important that support for the type of body we are now talking about should be accompanied by special agreements concerning how the money is to be used and that there should be subsequent proficient monitoring of the quality of the operations concerned. Moreover, we must subsequently be given detailed reports on how, for example, the transitional administration is working. </p>
<p class="contents">There are positive features to be mentioned. Even if the EU sometimes comes in for criticism, it is worth mentioning that the EU’s task force has received a lot of praise for the efficiency it has shown. We only hope now that this efficiency really can also be transferred to the more permanent work in the reconstruction bureau and to the EU’s operations within the framework of UNMIK. I want to emphasise that considerable freedom of action at local level is required, but we must, of course, be able nevertheless to check that the resources are being used correctly. </p>
<p class="contents">The present proposal also contains a new budget item of EUR 27 million. This is to be accommodated within Category 4 which, in turn, of course, also gives practical expression to yesterday’s proposal from the Commission for a review of the budget in order to accommodate the more long-term support for democratisation and reconstruction in the Balkans. The Committee on Budgets has a large number of questions regarding these figures. There is a definite desire on the part of Parliament to come up with the aid required and we are aware that the needs are very great indeed. We must also focus on the needs of the Balkan peoples, but then it is the task of Parliament and of the other branches of the budgetary authority to find the technical solutions to the financing requirements. I think that the sum of 27 million we are talking about here emphasises the need to review the budget. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that most people judging the issue, possibly with the exception of the Council, would consider it impossible to use this aid in its entirety within the framework of the budget’s current Category 4. It is unreasonable that support for other poor regions in the world should be affected by the problems in the Balkans. </p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I think that we must now give more consideration to the quality of the operations. Now that the Commission is presenting both the budget for implementation and this new way of dealing with the support for establishing the EU’s part in the civilian administration, it is important that we should not focus solely upon the overall figures or the formal decision-making processes. It is at least as important to evaluate the operations and to make sure that these are implemented swiftly and efficiently. In general, it is now being said that the implementation in Kosovo is more effective than in Bosnia, but there are still plenty of new issues which ought to be investigated. </p>
<p class="contents">The whole of this discussion shows how closely foreign and security policy is bound up with Parliament’s role in, for example, the budgetary procedure. In this regard, we must develop a model for guaranteeing that aid is put together correctly and transparently in accordance with our regulations and in such a way that it can also be examined and reviewed, as Mr Staes pointed out. These considerations must not lead to the aid programme becoming bogged down in vague decision-making processes. Against this background, we support the Laschet report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, I would like to congratulate him on his splendid work. Parliament is considering a proposal for a Council Regulation on a basis for financing the UN operation in Kosovo, UNMIK, and the costs of the High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina. The intention is to transfer these appropriations from the common foreign and security policy in the second pillar to the first pillar, to be financed from the Commission’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this would appear to be a purely technical measure, there are certain problems associated with it. The first concerns Category 4. Category 4 is already overloaded. For this reason, the Commission proposed yesterday that the financial perspective be revised and that there should be substantial use of agricultural appropriations for external action. This transfer will bring with it a considerable need for additional financing in Category 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem concerns competence. If the proposal for a regulation were to be adopted without amendment, it would mean that there would be a syphon for transferring second pillar funds to the first pillar in Category 4, without consulting Parliament. For this reason, the regulation must be amended so that Parliament may maintain its power of influence. This syphon has to be blocked, so the annex to the proposal should be deleted and the amendments the Committee on Budgets is proposing should be adopted. The proposal should therefore be restricted at this stage of the proceedings to just two situations: financing the UN operation in Kosovo and the costs of the High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, if the funding of special envoys is transferred in future to the Council’s administration budget, as is supposed, it will mean that the gentlemen’s agreement between the Council and Parliament will have to be reviewed. Under this agreement, the Council and Parliament do not interfere with the content of each other’s budget. If, however, what are clearly operational appropriations, such as those for financing the work of special envoys, are transferred to the Council’s budget, they will no longer be serving to fund the Council’s administrative expenses, but rather providing common financing of the work of the European Union. For this reason, these funds can no longer fall within the scope of the gentlemen’s agreement: the European Parliament must have the right to express its opinion and to influence the use of appropriations for financing the work of special envoys, even though they may have been included in the Council’s administrative budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a Regulation may, as far as I can see, be adopted only if the Commission, and the Council too, accept Parliament’s amendments, since, otherwise, the proposal will go against the present interinstitutional agreement.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is quite clear that we need to strengthen the powers of the Commission and of Parliament in matters relating to aid for Bosnia, because past experience has shown that this is fraught with problems. There is the report from the Court of Auditors for a start, but there are also the experiences of the delegates of the last legislature, and particularly Edith Müller, who kept on probing in Bosnia-Herzegovina, because it had become apparent that people’s sense of responsibility was nowhere near what is should have been when it came to the deployment of resources, spending money, investigations and the discharge procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Transferring actions to the first pillar increases the likelihood of the Commission and Parliament being able to exert a great deal more influence over the allocation of funds, to carry out their responsibilities, and also check up on what becomes of the funds in the discharge procedure. Firstly, this means that we will be able to make it clear to the European taxpayer that we are going to heighten the European institutions’ sense of responsibility when it comes to spending money. However, we will also – and I think this is at least as important – be setting the course for an important development, and I am with Mr Brok every step of the way on this point. I believe it is absolutely vital for us to make it clear, in view of the fact that foreign policy is constantly gaining in importance within Europe, that the European institutions must be strengthened and that it is not for the Council alone to bear responsibility; rather it must be made clear, by increasing the level of responsibility of the Commission and Parliament, that we want to assume responsibility for foreign policy and that we also want to be involved in shaping policy in this sphere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The draft resolution and the amendments therefore quite rightly stress the need to step up supervision of all operations to fund what are euphemistically called bodies in receipt of aid, in order to avoid any mention of a protectorate. This is what is really at issue in Bosnia or in Kosovo. The resolution indeed is silent on the key issue, which is the validity of the policy implemented in the former Yugoslavia. What is the state of affairs, five years on, in Bosnia-Herzegovina? How is the outcome of the war in Kosovo to be appraised? How much did the military intervention cost? How much did the destruction cost?</p>
<p class="contents">Through an 80% increase in the 2001 budget, the peoples of Europe are being asked to foot the bill for the parties that caused the destruction and that now want to embark on reconstruction, for the greater profit of a few industrialists. But who do they think they are kidding when those self-same Heads of State that conducted the war are now causing living conditions everywhere to deteriorate and making employment less secure? What is more, the planned solutions to assist these protectorates are problematic and harmful.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the level of the wages handed out to international organisations only serve to undermine these regions further. For example, and this is still more tragic, there are still no effective controls on the distribution of aid. Even the Committee on Budgetary Control is stressing the serious abuses in the management of European Union aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina. The deutschmark is foisted on Kosovo, and the law of the market prevails.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned, the outcome of the military intervention speaks for itself. Milosevic is still in power. Kosovo is a ravaged country. The ethnic divide is becoming entrenched, at the same time that an ungovernable protectorate is being set up which is seeking to deny the Kosovars independence without, for all that, being capable of applying the hypocritical framework of UN Resolution 1244. For all these reasons, unlike my fellow Members who have spoken so far, we will be unable to vote in favour of a resolution which makes only marginal improvements to a disastrous policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what the debate on whether it should be established in the first or third pillars is all about.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">What we are discussing here are the special administrative bodies set up by the international community that have been entrusted with the task of implementing peace agreements in crisis regions, or taking charge of the interim civilian administrations in the regions in question, and I am disappointed by your comment, Mrs Vachetta, that you consider this merely to be a cosmetic exercise. I believe there are considerable opportunities for intervention, with a view to promoting the development of civil societies in crisis regions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The EU budget is currently helping to finance two such bodies: the office of High Representative for Bosnia and UNMIK in Kosovo. In its original proposal for a new regulation, the Commission proposed creating a general legal basis for Community participation in the financing of administrative bodies of this kind set up by the international community. Parliament has pronounced itself in favour of creating a special legal basis for the two existing administrative bodies, OHR and UNMIK. I believe it is indeed necessary to reach this compromise, so as to take this step forward, and you have certainly cited exhaustive grounds to this end. All in all, I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to extend my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Laschet, and to the committees involved, for the work they have done and their commitment in this matter, which has certainly been in evidence during this debate.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As for the remaining proposed amendments, I can assure you that, needless to say, the Commission will keep the budgetary authorities informed on a regular basis. The Commission will also endeavour to fulfil the new task with existing personnel. I would also like at this point to take up the criticism that has been raised here – indeed Mr Staes went into great detail in his intervention – concerning financial management in the High Representative’s office in Bosnia. The Court of Auditors has presented a highly critical report – a special report. Whilst the Commission does not reject the Court of Auditors’ accusations as unfounded, I would like to remind you once again that the conditions under which people are having to labour out there are very difficult, and would point out that this explains a great deal, even if it does not excuse it.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, however, I would stress that the office of the High Representative comes under the aegis of the peace implementation council, and the fact that other regulations are sometimes applicable in this respect makes it difficult of course to strictly enforce the financial regulations that come from the Commission. The Commission is of the opinion that the financial and procedural regulations emanating from the High Representative’s office were improved during the course of 1999. It was mainly regulations governing personnel deployment and budgetary management that were pushed through.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to say something about comitology, because there is also a proposed amendment on this. The Council Presidency, for its part, signalled that the comitology measures could be deleted and that it could be left to the Commission to take full responsibility for implementation. Of course, that would be another way of bringing home the fact that this is a civilian crisis management measure and the Commission is responsible for its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As far as UNMIK is concerned, and the situation that has arisen there – that is to say, a new legal basis is being adopted although the necessary budgetary step has not yet been completed – I can explain what was agreed at the trialogue on 12 April: so as to guarantee uninterrupted financing of the UNMIK actions, the Council has resolved that financing will continue under the CFSP in the interim. As soon as the supplementary budget, which I am hoping the Commission will approve on 10 May – I will present it in any case – has been adopted, it will be possible to rearrange the financing in the desired manner. I hope that the Council and Parliament will discuss the supplementary budget very soon, so as to enable a clear regulatory framework and financial safeguards to be established for financing these measures, which are intended to build a civil society in regions that formerly experienced, or are currently experiencing, crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
