<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have all committed to achieving the objectives of the European Union’s strategy for the next 10 years on increasing the level of employment and reducing poverty. Today, Parliament’s plenary adopted the employment guidelines and we have asked the Council to take them into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to achieve the objectives we have committed to, if we really want Europe to lead the way in terms of competitiveness and if we really want a fair Europe to ensure its citizens’ well-being, the right of free movement of workers must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The free movement of workers is one of the EU’s fundamental freedoms. A powerful internal market can only be achieved by opening up the labour market completely.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission Communication in November 2008, mobility flows have had a major positive impact on economic growth in the European Union. The mobility of labour from Romania and Bulgaria has had beneficial effects on the economies of the host Member States without having any significant impact on the salaries and jobs of local nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic crisis can no longer be used as an excuse for enforcing and maintaining these labour market restrictions. Keeping these restrictions in place is a measure discouraging workers from Romania and Bulgaria from engaging in gainful employment within the relevant Member States. This factor makes workers bypass the legal regulations on the obligation to obtain a work permit, thereby increasing the incidence of illegal work. The direct upshot of illegal work is to block access to the rights deriving from the European system for the coordination of social security schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania and Bulgaria believe that, in the current European economic climate, removing the barriers preventing the free movement of workers throughout the EU will greatly help boost the European Union’s ability to respond to new challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I want to ask the following question because I want this European Commission to be our ally and offer full-on institutional assistance: What measures will you take to encourage Member States which are still applying restrictions to open up their labour market completely? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Together with free movement of goods, services and capital, it is a pillar of the single market and it has contributed to making European integration a success.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are well aware, for the first seven years of the EU membership of Bulgaria and Romania, Bulgarian and Romanian workers cannot fully benefit from free movement of workers. This is due to the transitional arrangements in place, as provided for by the Accession treaties, which allow the other Member States to delay the application of EU law on free movement to Bulgarian and Romanian workers for a maximum period of seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">When Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in 2007, already 10 of the 25 Member States decided to open their labour markets to Bulgarian and Romanian workers. Today, this number has increased to 15 and only ten Member States continue to apply restrictions. It is worth noting that, among the ten Member States, several apply less strict conditions or procedures in comparison to those in place before Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to bear in mind that the decision as to whether to apply the transitional arrangements and restrict labour market access is the sole responsibility of the Member State concerned. The Commission does not have any formal role to play in ending the restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission is, as a matter of principle, in favour of fully applying free movement of workers. In addition, the Commission has always worked to ensure that the Member States which apply restrictions do so in line with the conditions laid down in the Accession Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also repeatedly stressed that the transitional arrangements are, by definition, temporary, and that Member States should gradually open their labour markets, instead of delaying the application of free movement of workers until the end of the seven-year period.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2006 and 2008 Commission reports on the functioning of the transitional arrangements show that labour mobility, following the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, has had a positive impact on the economy and has helped meet labour demand. These findings remain valid, even in the current economic crisis. The Commission will continue to encourage Member States to re-examine their position on labour market access, including by referring to the findings of the reports.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no detailed information as regards the number or social situation of irregular workers coming from the Member States that joined the EU recently. This is due precisely to the hidden character of their presence in the Member States concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 2006 and 2008 reports, the Commission underlined that restrictions to free movement of workers do not necessarily result in protecting the national labour market and may delay labour market adjustments. What is more, transitional arrangements can exacerbate the incidence of undeclared work. It has been shown that enlargement has contributed to bringing to the surface part of the underground economy constituted by previously undeclared workers from the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also convincing evidence that nationals from the new Member States have had undeclared jobs due to the restrictions they face in accessing the labour market of the ‘old’ Member States. This is in line with the findings that mobility flows are mainly driven by factors related to supply and demand conditions and that restrictions to free movement of workers delay labour market adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not intend to elaborate a specific study on the living and working conditions of the irregular labour force from Bulgaria and Romania or on its impact on the domestic labour markets, notably due to the lack of information and difficulties of collecting such data. However, the issue of ‘irregular workers’ from Bulgaria and Romania will be covered, as far as possible, in any analysis the Commission may develop in the future about the functioning of the transitional arrangements for Bulgaria and Romania if, as foreseen by the transitional arrangements, one of the two countries requests it. In addition, the Commission will continue to promote specific activities to combat undeclared work, in cooperation with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission understands that the fact that Bulgarian and Romanian workers still face restrictions can be perceived as discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that transitional arrangements in the area of free movement of workers were applied in the majority of previous enlargements. In addition, transitional arrangements apply, not only to Bulgarian and Romanian workers, but also to workers from eight of the ten Member States that joined the EU in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth pointing out that the current transitional arrangements offer more flexibility to Member States by allowing them to decide when to start applying EU law on free movement of workers during the seven-year-period in the light of the situation of their labour market (the previous transitional arrangements simply deferred the introduction of EU law on free movement of workers by a number of years).</p>
<p class="contents">However, discrimination perceived by Bulgarian and Romanian workers who cannot work freely in the ten Member States that still apply restrictions does not constitute discrimination in the legal sense of the term. Although Article 18 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union prohibits discrimination based on nationality, it does so subject to specific provisions contained in the other EU treaties. The transitional arrangements laid down in the Accession Treaty constitute such provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Temporarily restricting labour market access to Bulgarian and Romanian workers on the basis of the transitional arrangements is therefore not contrary to EU law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the case of Bulgaria and Romania, Germany is also using the full amount of time permitted during the second phase from 2009 to 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dalli has said that there are 10 Member States which are still subject to restrictions. There is a valid reason for this, because the Member States have had different experiences. These restrictions are never discriminatory – you have rightly referred to Article 18 in this respect – and have specific time limits. The opportunity to get used to change gradually is an important and fundamental political choice. Our experience is that making free movement available to workers too early exposes the labour market to major risks. This concerns different target groups, such as the long-term unemployed and also low-qualified workers, and in my country, for example, the regions of eastern Germany. We will have to continue regulating access to jobs in the EU, because of the differing experiences in different areas, but this will, of course, lead to changes in the near future. However, we are not yet properly prepared for these changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Calling on the Commission to carry out a study on the so-called positive influence of illegal workers from Bulgaria and Romania is totally the wrong approach. When illegal workers are breaking the law, this cannot be played down by statistics, however positive they appear. I remain in favour of strict controls which will allow us to combat illegal working. We owe it to those people who are legally employed.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another important task which we must work on together and that is to look in detail at full freedom of movement from 2012 onwards. This involves both opportunities and risks. Only when we differentiate between them and deal with facts and only when we have an informed, detailed discussion can we stop armchair politics from coming into the situation, prevent exclusion and ensure that we are not suddenly working against rather than with each other. This is the position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats).</p>
<p class="contents">As early as December 2009, I asked the Commission whether there was any usable information available about the effects of full freedom of movement for workers. The answer was that the free movement of workers has a positive impact on the economy and no negative side-effects on the labour market. I am sorry, Mr Dalli, but that is not good enough. You were not in office at the time, but that makes it all the more important for your department to understand people’s fears and to contribute a great deal of knowledge to the discussion which we need to have on change and to giving substance to the arguments in the old and new Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reasons for this are not only linked to the principles of the European Union, one of which is the free movement of persons.</p>
<p class="contents">From an economic perspective, opening up the labour market ensures much added value. On the one hand, this is because of the larger supply of specialists in areas where there are insufficient candidates in the domestic market. I can give you as an example Bulgarian doctors and healthcare workers who are working in regions where Member States simply do not have their own staff available. This creates a problem in remote regions of Bulgaria, but resolves the problems in regions of the UK and France, for instance. It means lower costs and better public services for taxpayers. In the economic sector, employees from the new Member States are usually either highly qualified specialists whom any economy would like to use or workers who are making up shortfalls in the labour market, increasing competitiveness and preventing companies from relocating outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The assumption that citizens from the European Union’s new Member States displace local low-paid workers is absolutely unfounded and populist. A Bulgarian citizen who goes to work in another country needs money for accommodation, for supporting his family and sending his children to school. He also tries to save money with the prospect of returning home one day. There is also the language barrier problem on top of this. Reports about how low a salary this citizen would agree to work for are an urban myth for domestic consumption. This is also confirmed by the European Commission’s data, according to which the share of migrant workers from the new Member States has increased from 0.2% to 0.5% of the population of the old Member States following the European Union’s enlargement. There is obviously no migration wave. On the other hand, the problem is that there are far fewer migrant workers from Member States than immigrants from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The labour market restrictions cannot be justified with objective arguments. Equal access to the markets results in much greater transparency, yields economic gains and has a beneficial impact on Member States’ social systems. Commissioner, we are expecting the Commission to monitor very closely the processes and to inform Member States about the benefits of opening up the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Twenty-four years after the Single European Act and eighteen years after it was due for completion, the single market is still not a fully-fledged reality. To quote Mr Barroso: ‘Only 8% of Europe’s 20 million SMEs engage in cross-border trade’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Monti report identifies 150 barriers within the European Union that impede the free movement of people, goods, capital and services. This so-called ‘single market’ seems to me more like a French gruyere!</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso is now selling us the idea of a single market act and is calling for a relaunch of Mr Delors’ European idea. Let me refresh our minds about European history: if we want to create a single market effectively based on the principle of the free movement of people, goods, capital and services; if we want to avoid economic nationalism as a backlash against economic crisis; and if we want to be the most competitive economy and to boost competitiveness and create more jobs and growth, then our first and utmost priority should be to lift these unjustifiable barriers to the free movement of workers imposed on Romania, Bulgaria and the ten new Member States, which are based on irrational fears that have not proven justified.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must be extremely stringent with Member States that choose to maintain transitory restrictions. These will have to be justified on the basis of sound economic data. The alleged vulnerability, or serious disturbances, of national labour markets will have to be proven on the basis of rational figures and will have to be scrutinised on the basis of statistics and facts.</p>
<p class="contents">If Mr Barroso wants to relaunch the single market, then it is about time we acted according to our words. It is about time to tear down these shameful walls of economic protectionism and nationalism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We often lose ourselves in the legal details of this issue, and we forget that the law should only be a basic framework for the spirit of the European Union, which is one centred on freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">The law is the minimum threshold for freedom of movement. At present, the governments of various Member States are using the law as a way of countering the constitutional spirit of the EU. In Parliament, we too are mired in legal analysis, forgetting that we are a political Chamber, not a legal consultancy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be the bearers of a vision for Europe, and we must be more emphatic in stressing that freedom of movement is the goal of the EU. In the same way, I believe that the Commission falls far short of this ideal. The role of the Commission has changed recently. The Commissioner tells us that Member States have a right to impose restrictions, and that the Commission has nothing to do with it. Yet it does! The Commission is the guardian of the treaties, and I believe that it has to be much more emphatic and passionate about advocating freedom of movement. We know that large regional units such as the US or Brazil, or our competitors which, like these two countries, have internal freedom of movement, respond much better to crises, because their workforce can look for work where it is. We in Europe have had difficulty from the outset in being able to respond to this crisis quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">By acting on national self interest in this area, the Member States are forgetting the public interest. When they act this way with the capital market, the Commission speaks out forcefully, so why can it not do this when it happens to the freedom of workers? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The US economist, Professor George Borjas, disagrees. He says, ‘there is no gain from immigration if the native wage is not reduced by immigration’. In 2003, a study published by the Dutch Government said ‘GDP will increase but this increase will largely accrue to the migrants in the form of wages. The overall net gain in income to residents is likely to be small and may even be negative’. A report from the House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs in 2008 said ‘although possible in theory, we found no systematic empirical evidence to suggest that net immigration creates significant dynamic benefits for the UK resident population’.</p>
<p class="contents">Uncontrolled and unrestricted immigration into the UK has meant that the wages of native workers have been driven down, while living costs have been driven up because of extra demand on housing. The people at the bottom end of the economic scale have experienced this directly.</p>
<p class="contents">Massive immigration of cheap labour may benefit an expanding and developing economy in a country with vast reserves of untapped natural resources, such as America in the 19th century, but it will have the opposite effect on a developed post-industrial economy such as Britain, as has proved to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments should protect the interests of their own citizens first and then help other countries to develop their economies by adopting sensible international trade policies, such as Britain used to do before we joined the European Union. That is why the only sensible policy for Great Britain is that of the UK Independence Party, which is to leave the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are not ready to open our markets, including the labour market, to all European citizens, the losses will be higher than the gains. Recent studies undertaken by the European Commission have proved that opening our labour market will be beneficial and that worries concerning job losses due to labour migration are totally unfounded.</p>
<p class="contents">This sort of scaremongering has been proved wrong again and again. In 2006, British experts estimated that 300 000 Romanians would flood Britain in search of jobs. They are still looking for them. Nothing of the kind happened. The truth is that there is no rational reason to maintain the labour barrier for Romanian and Bulgarian workers. Past experience shows that workers from eastern Member States fill a gap in the labour market and take jobs that are not wanted or are not fully covered by the local workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, there is no way Romanians and Bulgarians will arrive in Western Europe to take advantage of its generous welfare system. Both Romania and Bulgaria have high enrolment rates in secondary and tertiary education. Both countries have a highly skilled resilient workforce. If the EU wants to make full use of its resources in these times of crisis, then political trust and economic openness should be properly established between Member States. To quote President Barroso’s speech of two days ago in this House, ‘we either swim together or sink separately.’ To paraphrase this, we either work together or get unemployed separately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, it states that future immigration flows to the EU from Bulgaria and Romania are highly unlikely.</p>
<p class="contents">These restrictions stimulate the creation of bad practices, due to the vulnerability of the illegal workers who are easily exploitable. As Commissioner De Gucht said, this flow of people would not change if it was made official, but the result would be that they would pay social contributions and taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">Post-enlargement flows from Bulgaria and Romania have also been significantly outnumbered by recent immigration of non-EU nationals. Obviously, non-discrimination and freedom of movement are fundamental rights for every European Union worker, and it is an unfortunate fact that some EU Member States, as pointed out in the report, have decided not to comply with these basic principles.</p>

<p class="contents">The latest events in Europe relating to the migration of the Roma minority from both our countries, who are availing themselves of the opportunity of freedom of movement to find a better future, clearly highlight that it is time for the Commission to take action. Bearing in mind the proven positive impact of mobility following the EU’s enlargement and to ensure that the internal market operates more effectively, I call on the Commission to propose a package of credible measures aimed at encouraging Member States to amend their labour market policy and at getting national governments to make a commitment not to extend the current restrictions imposed on Bulgarian and Romanian citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by stressing that any basis for discrimination in labour relations must be eliminated in order to keep the most powerful driving force for European integration going, in other words, Europe’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If my information is correct, it was even France that called for the measures implemented at the time of the accession of the first eight Eastern European countries to be extended to Romania and Bulgaria. It must be said that the French Government at that time was not very different from the one that is currently in power and was particularly mistrustful of citizens from those two countries. A huge amount of legislation was passed at that time to prevent the entry of citizens from those two countries because, as far as the French authorities are concerned, behind Romanians and behind Bulgarians there are Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have told us, Commissioner, freedom of movement is a fundamental principle of the EU. In this Chamber, we often talk of our common values, of our commitment to human rights. Why then, Commissioner, are men, and women, of course, treated less favourably than capital and goods?</p>
<p class="contents">You tell us that worker mobility has positive effects on the economy and that this holds true, even in the current economic circumstances. Why then, Commissioner, does the Commission not devote as much energy to convincing States that these restrictions must be removed as it devotes in other economic fields?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, you say to us, ‘It is not States that discriminate against these workers.’ As a Frenchwoman, I really cannot agree with you there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that most of us will agree that discrimination on any grounds whatsoever has no place in the kind of European Union which we want to see and want our children to grow up in. The restrictions on workers from Bulgaria and Romania, even if they are legally substantiated by both countries’ accession treaties, are essentially discriminatory on the basis of nationality. We cannot talk about unfair treatment to Roma while, at the same time, turning a blind eye to the different treatment shown towards workers from two full EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I support what fellow Members have said. The research carried out and recommendations made by the European Commission genuinely prove that enlargement of the labour markets has had a positive impact and is conducive to the overall development of the single European internal market. However, the fact remains that 10 Member States are continuing to retain restricted access to their labour markets until 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Fellow Members, Europe is at a crossroads and we must choose now in which direction to go: towards more or less integration. In my view, there is undoubtedly only one direction: a strong, united Europe. However, this path also involves all of us showing the clear desire to respect the fundamental European values, which means the free movement of persons and workers. I sincerely hope that protectionism does not prevail when national policies are being drawn up because we will be much stronger facing the world together than divided. I want to call on the European Commission, with the support, of course, of the European Parliament as well, to really cooperate more actively and decisively with the countries which are still imposing restrictions so that they can be lifted early. I believe that this will also help the European economy recover more quickly from the recession so that we can all look our citizens in the eye with a clear conscience and tell them that there is no discrimination in the European Union in the 21st century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission’s statistics showed that less than 1% of Bulgarians are looking for work in the old Member States. Even against the background of a severe financial and economic crisis and new fears of spiralling unemployment, the trend did not change. Workers would clearly migrate to where there is a demand for labour, but the figures show that unemployment is higher in some of these 10 countries than in Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">Retaining the restrictions encourages the informal economy and undeclared work. I wonder if you are aware that in the Netherlands alone, the proportion of Bulgarians and Romanians who work on the black market has increased by 8%. This is tolerated by employers and the Dutch because it reduces their costs. This is not to mention the seasonal workers without employment contracts and any social rights. Restrictions will not resolve the problem of unemployment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure, Commissioner, that the European Commission has mechanisms available for lobbying the 10 countries to reconsider the restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian workers. You referred, indeed, to the treaties, as is appropriate. However, let us not forget that the treaties were signed in different circumstances. There are new circumstances now which go by the name of ‘recession’. It is high time for a new discussion on this matter in the Council as well, which you could initiate. We are expecting you not only to be our allies, but also to propose concrete actions. You are guardian of the EU treaties and you must not allow double standards to be applied to Bulgaria and Romania whatever inclinations there obviously are and which are being heard even in this Chamber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is firstly because I think we would like the Commissioner to understand us directly, rather than via the interpreters; and secondly, because otherwise, I suppose that we will mostly be hearing Romanian and Bulgarian during this late debate in the Chamber tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you mentioned that several studies have shown that after the accession of the countries from Eastern and Central Europe, the problems were not in the countries where the workers were accepted. In fact, it was quite the opposite: they actually had a positive impact and GDP increased, so there is no fear about an influx of workers from these countries. The fact that you also mentioned countries other than Romania and Bulgaria is no comfort at all for us. In fact, it is quite the opposite: it shows that there is discrimination against even more EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to confess that I was surprised when you said that it is up to the Member States. If we cannot speak about a single market without mentioning the labour market, and if we all admit that this is a fundamental right, then how can it be up to the Member States? We know that the enforcement of fundamental rights lies within the European Union’s sphere of responsibility, so the principle of subsidiarity does not apply.</p>

Many people are leaving the country and many young people, in particular, cannot find employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at it in the long term, the only way to guarantee true freedom of movement of workers would be to have common remuneration rates right across the European Union and common social benefits.

Ultimately, that is the way to guarantee the situation and ensure the freedom that we long to achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the moment, Member States retaining internal labour market restrictions should review their position. Although, according to the transitional arrangements in the Accession Treaty signed by Romania and Bulgaria, restricting the right to work is not an act of discrimination, now that so much time has elapsed since accession, it is not normal and moral for such restrictions to be retained in the area of freedom, security and justice. It is time for the Commission to take action to convince the Member States which are still retaining restrictions to lift them. How can we explain to the EU’s Romanian and Bulgarian citizens that in this House we, their elected representatives, can offer equal labour rights to all legal immigrants, but cannot do anything for them?

The question for the Commission should rather be: What do you intend to do about it?

Or has this rule now been changed? If we take a look, ladies and gentlemen, at our parliamentary passes, we still see in them – more than six years after the EU expanded to include the countries of central Europe – only the 11 languages of the ‘old’ 15.
