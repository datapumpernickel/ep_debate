<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Renate Sommer (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everyone has gone to watch the football, and I wish I were with them, since the match is being played in my electoral district in the beautiful Ruhr, but it must not be forgotten that there is something venerable about the directive that we are considering and it is to that that we must give our undivided attention, for the work of this House must not be allowed to take second place to football, even to a footballing event like this one.</p>
<p class="contents">As we now move to the second reading of the draft directive on the technical requirements for inland waterway vessels, we are handling a relic from the previous century, for it was as long ago as December 1997 that the Commission submitted a proposal in respect of the previous directive, 82/714/EEC, which was superannuated even then, but is still in force today, and this proposal’s first reading in this House was in October 1998. Then, on 1 May 1999, came the Treaty of Amsterdam, and with it codecision on transport matters, and so the first reading had to be repeated in September 1999, although Parliament reiterated its position from the ‘first’ first reading – a never ending story!</p>
<p class="contents">A few months into the new century, in July 2000, the Commission came up with a modified draft, which took account of Parliament’s wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this all about? It has to do with creating, once and for all, the same conditions everywhere for European inland waterway transport, the intention being that updated technical requirements should ensure that traffic on Europe’s internal waterways is safe and problem-free. In order to do this, the Community’s technical requirements had to be harmonised with the standards governing navigation of the Rhine, for safety considerations had previously led the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine not to recognise the technical approval of vessels on the basis of the former directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive to be revised – 82/714/EEC – also has other defects, among them the fact that it does not apply to passenger ships and floating plant such as construction vessels, and the safety requirements are, of course, as they were in the 1970s. Free shipping on all the EU’s inland waterways is, however, dependent on the harmonisation of the technical requirements and safety standards with the highest standard, and that applies not only to the free movement of goods but also to the guaranteeing of high safety, environmental and social standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, Community law has been capable of being applied only where the provisions of the Convention of Mannheim are not in force; that Convention, which was signed on 17 October 1868, determined the principles that still largely apply today to the navigation of the Rhine, although the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine had already been constituted under an annex to the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Up to now, then, the EU has been unable to adopt any legislative act applicable to the Rhine, even though 80% of all goods transported on European inland waterways travel on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Only since an additional protocol to the Mannheim Convention entered into force in December 2004 has the mutual recognition of ships’ certificates been possible, and, in fact, the most important aspect of the new directive is the introduction of a standard ship’s certificate for inland waterway vessels within the EU. That has something to do with legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">There were still a few problems with the inclusion of sports boats of between 20 and 24 metres in length, which might well fall within the scope of both this directive and the so-called sports boats directive, No 94/25/EC, although this latter directive governs trade in sports boats and is, then, an internal market directive regulating the access of sports boats to the market. The revised directive on technical requirements for inland waterway vessels goes further than what is laid down in the sports boats directive only where safety considerations on inland waterways make this necessary, and so it does not contradict its provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I might add that experience with sports boat traffic on the Rhine shows that the owners of sports boats have no problems with those rules applicable to the Rhine that are comparable to the technical regulations in the revised directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Transport and Tourism took the line that the technical regulations in the annex to the directive, including those in Chapter 15, ‘Special provisions for passenger vessels’, which, because of protracted negotiations and long translation times are still as they were during the 2004 negotiations, should be covered by the comitology procedure. The committee was in favour of an amendment to this effect, that being the only way in which it can be ensured that the harmonisation of the existing legal systems can be accomplished without delay and also that industry and trade be afforded legal certainty, and so I ask you to give your support to this one amendment at second reading too.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to use this opportunity to express to the Council and the Commission, but also, of course, to my colleagues, my warmest thanks for their good cooperation on this dossier. In thanking the House for its attention, all I can say now is ‘ship ahoy!’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to thank you, Mrs Sommer, for your personal and important contribution to building this consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community legislation harmonising the technical requirements for inland waterway vessels dates back to 1982. This legislation provides for a certificate with which an inland waterway vessel may navigate on any EU waterway, except the Rhine. However, two thirds of transport by inland waterway in Europe takes place on the Rhine.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal, which dates back to 1997, therefore has three objectives:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, to update the technical requirements with a view to bringing the safety of vessels in line with technological progress;</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, to make it possible in the future for the Community certificate to be recognised for navigation on the Rhine;</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, to establish a comitology procedure for regularly adjusting the technical requirements in the future, in the light of technological progress and of the development of the rules in force on the Rhine.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter remained at a standstill for a long time within the Council because of the issue of admitting vessels with Community certificates to navigation on the Rhine. Once this point was resolved, however, the Council was able to reach a political agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of this directive will be a real step forward in terms of harmonising the rules, which is what we call for in the NAIADE action plan. It will make it possible to implement a single system for the entire network of European Union waterways. The technical requirements will be harmonised to ensure a high level of safety, particularly for passenger ships.</p>
<p class="contents">The future validity of the Community certificate on the Rhine will promote competition and will create genuinely fair conditions for river transport within the internal market. We will maintain this level in the future, in cooperation with the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the amendment adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we support it, and I am delighted that a compromise has been reached among the three institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to assure you that the Commission is aware of the anxieties expressed by some owners of large recreational craft in certain Member States. The text that you will adopt will make it possible for the majority of these concerns to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike Directive 94/25/EC, which provides for market access for recreational craft in the Community, the new directive on technical requirements for inland waterway vessels, for its part, provides for safety of navigation on all waterways. A 20-metre long vessel warrants requirements additional to those needed simply for marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, excluding recreational craft less than 24 metres – and not 20 metres – long from the scope of the directive would render the rules applicable on the Rhine different from those applicable on other Community waterways. That could cause problems when it comes to recognising the Community certificate for navigation on the Rhine and could stand in the way of the idea of having a single certificate for vessels in the Community, namely the Community certificate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the directive permits a number of derogations for existing recreational craft. I am specifically responding to Mr Watson on this point, as he was the person who drew my attention to it: existing recreational craft may continue to operate provided that their breach of the requirements does not represent an obvious danger. I would add that Article 7 permits those Member States whose inland waterways are not connected to the waterways of other Member States to depart from all or part of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I can, in any event, assure you that the Commission will ensure that it pays special attention in the comitology procedure to the chapter on recreational craft, in order both to prevent any contradiction of, or incompatibility with, Directive 94/25/EC and to clarify and shed light on any points that may seem unclear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The document currently before us, and, in particular, that which this House could – and did – contribute to it, is something that can help promote free inland waterway shipping, and that free inland waterway shipping is what we need. If we want to make the flow of traffic through Europe more generally compatible with the environment, we need proper rules, consistent with each other, for inland waterway transport, and the Commission, in its midterm review, is quite insistent on that – Vice-President Barrot should take note of the fact that I was listening very carefully the last time.</p>
<p class="contents">What is called for, however, is not just one single regulation, but the interlinking of all rules applicable to inland shipping, and we must make improvements to the planning of routes, that is to say, the TENs, to the support frameworks – including Marco Polo II – and, not least, the technical rules and regulations, and must bring them up to present-day standards.</p>
<p class="contents">A happy outcome is worth waiting for, and our group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, thanks Mrs Sommer, the rapporteur, for the valuable work she has done. We hope there will be large majorities tomorrow, and will play our part in bringing them about.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have a few more things to do to the network. As you have just said, Mr Vice-President, Naiades is the next draft act whereby we have to ensure that the opportunities are actually used and that Europe’s waterways as a whole can make a substantial and constructive contribution towards handling the flows of traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important in this regard, particularly in relation to Naiades, is that we must not concentrate only on Western Europe: rather, especially now that the Danube is open, we must ensure that the whole European waterways network may grow together into a sound, proper and safe unity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, of course, we are taking a less spectacular decision, but one that is nevertheless long overdue, in that this House, at second reading, will be agreeing to the harmonisation of technical regulations for inland vessels, thus bringing to an end a legislative process that has been going on for nine years now.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive adapts Community standards to the more extensive ones contained in the Convention on the Navigation of the Rhine, and this, as we see it, guarantees free competition on all internal waterways with the same high safety standards applying in every instance.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, and in the Common Position, this House and the Council made various amendments. Like the rapporteur, to whom I am most grateful for her report, I, too, take the view that these amendments are generally acceptable and add to the original Commission proposal in a reasonable way.</p>
<p class="contents">We endorse the view expressed by Mr Grosch and Mrs Wortmann-Kool in their amendment on the subject, that certain types of vessel are subject to two sets of legislation, and, even though we have now been advised that the two sets of legislation are quite different, we do nevertheless think that the amendment is sound, and what we would welcome at the earliest possible opportunity is the revision of the technical annexes of the relevant directives in order to remove the duplication.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, what both my group and I want is for the legislation to be completed without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in this House can do no other than heartily welcome such a substantial contribution to sustainable, safe and competitive transport through Europe, for it cannot be taken as granted that transport will be like that; it is important that the right conditions be created for it. Mrs Sommer's report provides one of the necessary building blocks, for harmonised technical regulations for transit on internal waterways mean equal conditions for everyone and hence a fine, manageable and safe fleet. </p>
<p class="contents">What gives us cause to welcome this report with even more enthusiasm is the fact that it represents the conclusion to a process that has lasted for some ten years. I am particularly pleased to note that relations between the institutions in the inland shipping sector have been no obstacle to this agreement, and I believe that this manifestly fruitful cooperation is being extended to other areas too. This is something we will need to talk about later on.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the content, I am pleased to note the standards demanded of the vessels. Even though the sector must make the necessary effort to satisfy these demands, this does indeed indicate that the quality of the fleet has gone up beyond any doubt. In view of the potential for water-borne transport, that is both very welcome and essential. </p>
<p class="contents">I am also satisfied with the procedure for making further adjustments and improvements to the directive. It is certainly not perverse to leave such a technical enterprise to the specialists. I am given to understand that a number of proposed amendments are on the table at this very moment. I hope that the specialists will find a solution to the possible discrepancy between this directive and Directive 94/25/EC, and I strongly support the amendment to that end. </p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to thank Mrs Sommer for her efforts. I hope that this stage will make a positive contribution to improving transport on inland waterways. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am speaking as a Member from a Member State, Spain, whose rivers stopped being navigable some time ago and which is suffering from a drought that is becoming structural, thereby making it less and less possible for that navigability to be restored. I am therefore speaking as somebody with a healthy European envy of those countries that do have navigable waterways, both for passengers and for goods.</p>
<p class="contents">As the partner of a German, I well remember the admiration I felt when I saw the Rhine some years ago, because until then I had heard talk of river motorways, and I had even worked in that field, but I had never known what they were. It was the impression of seeing the Rhine with such well-regulated, organised, stately and at the same time efficient traffic that taught me what we were talking about and how Europe was getting to grips with such important transport routes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore delighted as a European that this debate is finally coming to a successful conclusion, thanks to Mrs Sommer and also to my colleague Mr Stockmann. This will make it possible to harmonise river navigability, in terms both of social safety rules and of environmental rules, including the proposed non-reduction in those countries where that danger exists.</p>
<p class="contents">It only remains for me to express my hope that my city, which in 2008 will hold the international Expo on this very issue of water and sustainable development, can implement projects to restore the navigability of the River Ebro, amongst others, as a collective means of passenger transport, and naturally to promote its use for sporting and tourism purposes. I am therefore delighted that the safety and social rules also apply.</p>
<p class="contents">My dream is that, in the not too distant future, goods crossing the Pyrenees from Spain into France via a central tunnel will then travel along the Canal de Midi and the network of French canals and finally to the Rhine, whose ideal and wise regulation we are today turning into European law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
