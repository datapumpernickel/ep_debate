If I may, Mr President, I would like to introduce my statement on Chechnya by expressing my full personal commitment and my determination to continue as of now attending the House and playing a full part in the work of the European Parliament, my intention to pay heed to the considerations expressed in this and other debates and<span class="bold"> </span>to keep Parliament fully informed, insofar as it is in my power, regarding the Council’s <span class="italic">dossiers</span> and activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the subject of Chechnya, as you all know, the situation in the Republic of Chechnya, one of the components of the Russian Federation, has been the object of the European Union’s attention for some time now as a result of the serious acts of military violence and terrorism that characterise it and of the likely consequences for Europe. The situation being played out in Chechnya will have an effect that reaches well beyond that small Republic. The effects of the situation, whether negative or positive, will affect the entire Caucasus area.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that some knowledge of past events, however summary, is important when forming an opinion on the present and on the outlook for the future. That is why I am giving you this brief history. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the subsequent birth of the Russian Federation, the Republic of Chechnya has been the scene of violent Russian-Chechen clashes and of bloody separatist acts. The 1997 Peace Treaty laid the groundwork for a broad-based <span class="italic">de facto</span> autonomy under the Presidency of Chechen leader, Aslan Maskhadov, while guerrilla groups continued to be active throughout the country. In 1999, Moscow intervened in Ingushetia and North Ossetia while, in Chechnya, Russian troops occupied the capital city of Grozny. Years of attacks and repression followed in a climate of brutality on the part of both separatist fighters and Russian forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE recognised, even then, Russia's right to defend its territorial integrity and to combat terrorism, but condemned its disproportionate use of force, inviting the Russian Government to implement a political solution to the crisis and to allow humanitarian aid organisations to enter Chechnya. After 11 September 2001, Russia stepped up its anti-terrorism efforts, even though the connection between Chechnya and Islamic fundamentalism – which does exist – appeared to be quite indirect. The roots of the war remain essentially nationalistic in nature, despite its growing and dangerous susceptibility to Islamic extremism, particularly as regards the methods and instruments used. Although, in September 2001, a channel of dialogue opened up between the Russian authorities and one of the main exponents of the Chechen resistance, it remained uncertain and unclear whether a political solution to the conflict could be found. It was against this backdrop that the serious terrorist incident at the <span class="italic">Na Dubrovke</span> theatre occurred, followed by the numerous, and equally violent, attacks of recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation on the ground is extremely difficult: the local economy is falling apart, there is contention within the pro-Russian administration, there are terrorist threats from the separatists and brutality, and violent military action from Russian militias. While, in the past, Chechnya had a flourishing economy, due, of course, first and foremost, to oil production and to a highly developed metal and mechanics sector, it is now considerably reduced; unemployment is at 42%, there are 64 000 Chechen refugees in the nearby Republic of Ingushetia, 8 000 displaced persons in reception camps and 290 000 homeless. Civil life has, for the most part, come to a standstill, reduced to a very sorry state with the destruction of archives and offices.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the major institutional reform initiative launched by President Putin with the adoption of a new Constitution, to be approved by local referendum, has been grafted onto these bases. In Mr Putin's plan, the process should be supported by the international community and, in particular, by the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE. The political plan consists of the concession of broad-based autonomy and greater powers to local organisations in the context of the Russian Federation, whose territorial integrity is thus safeguarded. Withdrawal of non-necessary military contingents and the reduction of checkpoints were begun so as to facilitate the gradual normalisation of the region and the holding of the referendum. The results of the referendum of 23 March – which saw an 89% participation rate – were, as we know, highly favourable to the draft Constitution. This outcome has demonstrated that the Chechen people, weary of war, have chosen the political solution within the Russian Federation. At the same time, it has also emerged that the separatist rebel leader, Aslan Maskhadov, and his followers, have lost the better part of the support of civil society. In accordance with the recently adopted Constitution, it is possible to foresee Chechen presidential elections by the end of October, while parliamentary elections will take place no earlier than three months after the election of the future President.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, despite this positive outcome, the referendum is only a first step in the political transition underway. A large number of unresolved issues remain, including the definition of the powers held by the Chechen Republic and the Russian Federation, the provision of compensation to those who have lost property and the adoption of measures for combating crime, including the crimes committed by the Federal Forces. As you all know, ladies and gentlemen, at present, there are 200 serious criminal cases pending against members of the police force. On 6 June 2003, the State Duma adopted an amnesty law for Chechnya to be applied to both rebels and members of the police force, on condition, of course, that they have not committed violent crimes. It offers clemency to those who give up armed, separatist resistance by 1 September of this year. Nevertheless, despite the amnesty, attacks on the ground are continuing, prompting, as a result, harsh responses from the police force.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community has been actively following the developments and the initiatives of Moscow. While, in March, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a resolution that contemplates the possibility of setting up an International Tribunal in order to bring those guilty of serious violations of human rights in Chechnya to justice, more recently, the political and institutional process begun was examined in depth in the course of the talks of the Commissioner for Human Rights in Moscow. In the context of the OSCE, the Presidency is laying the foundations, in agreement with Russia, for the resumption of the organisation’s activities in the Republic, based on specific programmes agreed<span class="bold"> </span>regarding elections, good governance, the judicial system, the media, the police and humanitarian aid. In April, the 15 Members of the Union presented a draft resolution at the Geneva Conference on Human Rights that censured, that condemned the serious violations perpetrated in Chechnya, a resolution which, as you are aware, was not adopted for lack of a majority of votes in favour. Its failure to be adopted was, as you know, described by Moscow as a ‘triumph of good sense’.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Council has noted the European Parliament's views on the situation in the Republic of Chechnya and will endeavour to ensure that the political process recently set in motion leads to the reestablishment of the rule of law and the reconstruction of the region's economic and social fabric. The Union is united in its overall positive judgment of the start of the institutional process launched by President Putin with regard to Chechnya. We now expect to see an about-face in terms of human rights and we call for the punishment of those guilty of abuses. The European Union's continuing attention was made clear through the recent visit in April to Chechnya itself of the Troika of Heads of Mission in Moscow as well as through support for the resumption of the OSCE’s activities in the region, which I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU-Russia Cooperation Council of 15 April last was the Union's first opportunity to send a high-level political message of vigilance, interest and general availability. The St Petersburg EU-Russia Summit expressed the hope that the political process recently set in motion, along with economic and social reconstruction, will lead to the reestablishment of rule of law, to the promotion of human rights and to genuine reconciliation. The St Petersburg Summit condemned any act of violence, particularly terrorist violence, that might jeopardise the current prospects for a political solution and acknowledged the substantial contribution that international organisations can make, working together<span class="bold"> </span>with the Russian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, once the region's economic reconstruction is underway, the Union will also have to make a financial commitment, although one based on strict conditions, of course. The representative of the Commission, who is due to speak shortly, will be able to describe to you the aid package being put together. The cooperation of the Russian authorities will be fundamental in ensuring that this aid actually reaches those in deep need. The possibility of launching a European Union initiative in Chechnya in the future deserves closer examination. By supporting the process begun by President Putin, this initiative could extend Community intervention from the field of humanitarian aid, on which we have all been focusing up until now, to the different – but equally important, if I may say so – area of institution-building and the promotion of socio-economic development, placing a number of practical initiatives in the framework of the existing cooperation between the European Union and the OSCE. The OSCE is currently assessing, along with its Russian counterpart, the possibility of aid interventions in specific sectors: I have already mentioned elections – an extremely important area – the judicial system, police reform and the reintegration of refugees and displaced persons. These elements of institution-building are traditionally held to be Union priorities too.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, with regard to the institutional process launched by Moscow, the Italian Presidency will be committed to facilitating a definitive political solution which, if possible, involves all the representatives and segments of the Chechen population not compromised by terrorism. We believe that the institutional reform launched should have the practical, genuine result – the automatic result, if I may say so – of improving the present levels of respect for the human rights of the Chechen people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, following the Council's position, clearly expressed by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Frattini, I must say that the Commission can only repeat that the European Union is firmly committed to the fight against terrorism and, in this regard, that it supports Russia in its legitimate fight against terrorism in Chechnya or anywhere else. There must be no doubt about this. This means that the defence of human rights is an absolute and that, if the main violation of human rights is terrorism itself, which does not respect the basic right to life, that does not mean that we must not always be aware, in any action or fight against terrorism, that human rights are a fundamental element which must be respected at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said all of this, and moving on to the areas which are more directly related to the Commission's activity – which is what I am going to focus on in order not to repeat what has already been said – I would point out that it is necessary to make progress on the possibility of providing humanitarian aid in Chechnya. As the honourable Members know, the European Union, by means of the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), is the main provider of humanitarian aid in the Northern Caucasus. Since October 1999 we have provided more than EUR 110 million in aid to the victims of the conflicts in Chechnya. The security conditions in the Northern Caucasus are still deficient, which means that there are considerable logistical problems. However, the Commission trusts that the Russian authorities will adopt a more open attitude, for example, with regard to the attempts to liberate Arjan Erkel, the European aid worker who is still being held hostage.</p>
<p class="contents">The reluctance, in certain cases, of the Russian authorities to allow non-governmental organisations to use the necessary radio communications, as well as the system for granting residency and work permits in Chechnya, remain the principal obstacles to providing humanitarian aid. In this regard, we will continue to call for improvements in the treatment offered, in order to facilitate the carrying out of humanitarian operations, in accordance with the basic rules on safety, efficiency and supervision and, of course, independent evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, although the Russian authorities have assured us that they will not repatriate the thousands of displaced persons in neighbouring areas to Chechnya by force, referred to a moment ago by the President-in-Office of the Council, the truth is that ECHO has informed us that it is observing that the possibility of replacing the deteriorating tents and building more solid shelters in neighbouring Ingushetia is being denied.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to Chechnya must not be the only option for the displaced people. In addition to continuing to closely monitor how events develop in general, we will continue to insist in particular that any repatriation of displaced Chechens must take place voluntarily and unconditionally. With a view to the future, the Commission will continue to monitor how the situation develops, including the work under way, with a view to the signature of a treaty intended to clarify the status of Chechnya within the Russian Federation, as well as the preparations for the presidential and parliamentary elections in the Russian republic, scheduled for October and December. In this regard, we will continue to analyse how the situation develops.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now stressing that all these actions, all this progress, should take place with the utmost transparency, entirely in accordance with international rules, and, above all, that they should be carried out in a way that helps to resolve this conflict once and for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, you also quite rightly mentioned the name of the Dutchman, Arjan Erkel, a moment ago. I am very indebted to you for this, because Arjan Erkel, the head of the <span class="italic">Médecins sans Frontières</span> mission in Dagestan, has been missing since August last year. He was kidnapped, and it is especially important that this abduction should receive the Commission’s, and also the Council’s, attention.

I have to say that it was quite a depressing experience: compared to Bosnia and Sarajevo – I can draw a comparison with the war situation at the time – Grozny and Chechnya are actually worse off.</p>
<p class="contents">We, and also the Americans, in particular, have a dangerous tendency to define this Russian war in the way that suits us best, hence, along the lines of 'if you do not criticise our war, then we won't criticise yours'. We in the European Union should be careful about doing this: it is not only rebels and terrorists who are fighting the Russian armed forces, there are also others that most definitely fall within the category of resistance fighters. The Chechens are not wrong by definition, and nor are the Russians. The fact is, however, that many citizens in Chechnya, on account of the action taken by the Russian troops, tend, in their desperation, to veer to the anti-Russian camp. We ourselves were able to make out from conversations on the streets that there are justified complaints from people who saw their friends being beaten up and who therefore know that others are too scared to go to work in Grozny, because the risk of random, extremely rough action from the Russian military is enormous. We can somewhat identify with this situation if you know that many of us have a colonial history in our own countries, during which time all kinds of things happened that did not come to light until much later. In the case of Russia's action in Chechnya, matters come to light quicker, which is good. This is why I should like to urge both the Commission and the Council to employ all political and diplomatic means available to us in order to curb the violence in Chechnya. Indeed, this is desperately needed, and we cannot even be all that demanding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what happened the first time. We met the Russian, Ingushetian and Chechnyan leaders and members of their governments. We met people in camps and in Grozny too, as well as the Chechen diaspora in Moscow, and obviously members of humanitarian organisations, both national and international. Besides human rights, we wanted to get to know about social, economic and educational issues and medical facilities, the situation regarding refugees and the possibilities of leading a normal life in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I wish to raise the matter of Russia’s change of strategy. It is no longer pursuing a military solution but a political one. This is a positive approach and one that the European Parliament has been calling for for a long time. Secondly, it is obvious that all parties are tired of war and want peace. I do not now mean the criminal elements that have turned the war into a means of making money. Thirdly, it would appear that a window of opportunity has presented itself that is to last about a year, until the elections in the Russian Federation and Chechnya are over. It is to be feared that after the elections the situation may go back to what it was before. For that reason, there should now be strong support for the political process that has been started.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the risk of ‘Chechenisation’ of the conflict, with violence moving more and more in the direction of civil war. On the road to peace it is vital that Russia should convict war criminals and that the army should withdraw. Human rights must be protected. The Chechens must also cease their armed struggle and terrorist attacks. Observations have been made from several sources that combat action on the part of the Russian army has already diminished in the region over the last six months. At the same time, however, violence on the part of armed groups has increased, which is very worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">We must determinedly press on with the social, cultural and economic reconstruction that has only just started. As one possible candidate for President of Chechnya said to me, money creates peace. The Russian Government has put together a kind of politico-economic package to normalise the situation. It may well need revising and adding to, but the choice of direction is important here.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with this, the European Union should likewise strengthen its measures in the region. The European Union is already the biggest external provider of assistance. The Commission recently also granted EUR 16 million in humanitarian aid, which is only right.</p>
<p class="contents">Our delegation is calling on the aid organisations to get to the region quickly, safely and unimpeded. Without outside help it will take even longer to put things right. It is also essential that the office of the OSCE in Znamenskoje can be got fully up and running without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">In a few months’ time they will be planning elections and the start of election campaigns there. It will be very important to check that the campaign is made transparent and that the requirements of democracy are being fulfilled. This will require a long-term presence. If the campaigns are not democratic the elections can hardly be either.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the idea of a peace conference has also been proposed. All parties could participate as well as the European Union, the Council of Europe and the OSCE. I have not named the guilty parties in my speech because now is the time to seek peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We thus support the Russian Government’s attempts to stabilise conditions in the region on the basis of the recently conducted referendum. At the same time we would stress that there must be respect for human rights in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">If Russia’s current policy does not lead to the hoped-for outcome soon, it will, in my opinion, be wise of Russia to consider whether there is an alternative to it. It is extremely difficult to bring peace to Chechnya when certain powerful groups are trying to bring about its secession from Russia. On the other hand, Russia is holding on tightly to its regional unity, which is something the international community has also given its clear support to.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia undoubtedly has enough resources for military control over Chechnya, but it will have to pay dearly for it in terms of loss of human life and financial losses, and politically too. Unless armed resistance starts to subside, the Russians will have to ask themselves whether it is worth paying such a high price for military control of war-ravaged Chechnya. They will have to consider whether an alternative to their current policy on Chechnya can be found.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution arrived at in Kosovo might perhaps serve as a model in principle. That way Chechnya would still indisputably belong to the Russian Federation, but international peacekeeping forces and local police forces would be responsible for security. It would certainly be hard for Russia to agree to such a solution, but it will not be easy if the present situation continues either.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution is in the hands of the Russians themselves. Outsiders cannot advise or guide them. Russia itself must decide what sort of policy it wants to put into effect in Chechnya. At least for the time being, Russia continues with its current policy, and, as I said to begin with, the ELDR Group supports the joint resolution of the political groups based on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also welcome the administration's efforts to make life more bearable, to gradually reopen schools, and to partially reinstate energy supplies, public transport and medical care in Grozny at least. But that is by no means enough. The Russians really need to make reconstruction a top priority. Against that background, I hope that the elections in December 2003 or March 2004 will lead to political stabilisation in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should be prepared to provide whatever assistance is needed to hold free and fair elections. Nevertheless, I regard it as highly problematic that international organisations have still not been given free access to Chechnya in order to provide urgently needed humanitarian and medical aid. As has already been mentioned, the refugees' plight remains precarious. Humanitarian aid must not be cut, nor should refugees be forced to return against their will, unless and until the necessary conditions have been met.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned that since 11 September the Council and the Commission have effectively stopped discussing the actions of the Russian army in Chechnya, which have chiefly resulted in enormous suffering amongst the civilian population. Whilst we condemn acts of heartless violence by Chechen terrorists, we also condemn the disproportionate use of military force and arbitrary acts by the Russian army. You cannot cherry-pick when it comes to human rights, and it is not by breaching human rights that the conflict will be de-escalated. If the European Union wants to help resolve the conflict, it must work with Russia and press it for further changes in its policy towards Chechnya. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, the fight in Chechnya is not a fight against terrorism only. The situation is far more complex. If you read up on it, you will notice that you will speak of Chechnya in a yet more balanced way.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have paid a visit to Chechnya, and I did not gain the impression that the Russians have the situation under control. People are being abducted on a daily basis. Soldiers are being killed on a daily basis – ten a day on average. Human rights are being violated, and the Russians have indeed changed strategy and switched from a military strategy to a political strategy, which involves a referendum and elections being held soon. However, Mr Frattini, Commissioner, it is a strategy that is being imposed from the top down. It is not an inclusive process; it is not a process that involves all the layers of the Chechen population. Neither is it a process that involves the rebels, the resistance fighters, or even Mr Mashadov, the most recently elected President. I think that we will need to do a great deal in order to remedy this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the humanitarian situation is concerned, I can fully support what the Commissioner has said. She has, I think, given a correct summary. Something must be done about what the humanitarian organisations are going through over there.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to conclude with the Arjan Erkel case. Arjan's father is in the public gallery, together with representatives of <span class="italic">Médecins sans Frontières</span>. I should like to tell him here officially that in our resolution on which we are voting tomorrow, a paragraph has been devoted to his son's abduction. I also give you the assurance that this text will be translated into Russian the day after tomorrow. We have a delegation meeting of the Russian delegation in Moscow next Monday and Tuesday and as the chairman of this delegation, I can assure the relatives that we will bring up their son's case for discussion during our delegation meeting in the Duma next Tuesday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What sort of political process is this? We have witnessed a referendum in which less than 15% of the population voted, in which Western journalists present in Grozny were able to vote: what more do we need to prove that it was a complete charade? I am pleased to hear that Mr Oostlander found when he went to Chechnya that the normalisation process described by his friend, Mr Putin, has had no effect whatsoever for months. What is happening in Chechnya is that a policy of terror is being implemented by a state which has succeeded – and the resolution does not mention this – in killing 200 thousand people in 10 years, which has succeeded in turning 300 thousand out of a population of a million inhabitants into refugees, which eliminates dozens and dozens of Chechen civilians every day, and I am talking about civilians, not soldiers, through the Russian armed forces present in Chechnya. So this is the normalisation process! If we want to pretend, in the interests of a potential great Russian market, that the policy of terror implemented by the Russian Federation in Chechnya does not exist, then we can continue to do so, but, in that case, we will be accomplices to genocide – and we must be aware of that – for when 20 to 25% of the population of a country is eliminated in less than 10 years, that is called genocide. This is worse than Bosnia, it is worse than Kosovo. Therefore, President-in-Office of the Council, I believe – as Mr Staes said – that the way forward is through negotiations between the two parties concerned, that is between President Putin and President Maskhadov. The rest is pure and utter garbage that we are inventing in the name of interests which we do not want to admit to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to make it very clear that I believe that what Russia is doing in Chechnya is not a war on terror, but that it is actually giving rise to terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be quite clear that Yelena Bonner, Andrei Sakharov's widow, is right when she says that what is happening in Chechnya is genocide. I shall not mince my words – I believe that this is a colonial war driven by the energy interests of Gazprom and others. That is what it is really about. So it is vital that we should not deceive ourselves. Many well-regarded international human rights organisations came to the conclusion that the so-called referendum was a total sham. Convenient partners for bogus peace talks have been created.</p>
<p class="contents">The OSCE has already observed elections in Chechnya. There has already been peace in Chechnya once. Mr Mashadov was democratically elected in the presence of OSCE observers, so why are we not negotiating with him? Why has he been forced to go underground? This has happened precisely because he represents his people and is not a puppet. This will not lead to peace, Mr President-in-Office, so the basic presumptions underlying this debate are utterly false. Choosing puppets as your partners in talks has never been effective and has never led to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to make one point very clear: what I regard as being dishonest about this debate and about many of the speeches we have heard – including speeches made by Mr Putin, who used Chechnya as the bloodiest election platform in history in order to come to power – is the word ‘normalisation’. When was the last time we heard about ‘normalisation’? It was in 1968, when the national uprising by the Czech and Slovak peoples was put down. That is not the sort of normalisation we want!</p>

Three thousand were killed at the start of the year. Forty-nine communal graves have been found, a very small proportion of which can be ascribed to terrorism and a very large proportion of which can be attributed to the abuses perpetrated daily by an army which has established itself as an occupying force. The referendum was an illusion of normality. It is difficult to decree normality in a country by waving the barrel of a <span class="italic">kalashnikov</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of all this, we believe that the political solution must genuinely be a political solution, and for that to be so, Mr Frattini, I put it to you that all the parties need to be involved. The former President, Mr Maskhadov, must take part too, and he cannot be dismissed so hastily, Mr Frattini, as a rebel separatist. Former President, Mr Maskhadov, was elected democratically by the Chechen people at the end of the first war. Today, Mr Maskhadov is an essential point of reference if we want to achieve genuine peace, true peace. There is also a danger that Chechnya will become a permanent war zone where old grievances are superseded by new.</p>
<p class="contents">One last recommendation to Mr Frattini and to the Commission. We must ensure that Russia is involved in this peace process and that it shoulders its responsibility. If we continue today to talk about the possibility of Russia acceding to the European Union, without considering this ongoing conflict as an element which is already causing difficulties in our relations with Russia, we will certainly not be facilitating the peace process. Apart from being extremely premature, talking about the accession of Russia could be extremely dangerous in terms of the fate of Chechnya. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
