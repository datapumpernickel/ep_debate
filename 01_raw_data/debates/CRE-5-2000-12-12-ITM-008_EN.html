<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oostlander (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, our relations with Russia underwent a fundamental change when the cold war ended. Fear of military violence or of a dictatorship that might advance further, is a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The attitude of the European Union and its Member States is now more one of a feeling of joint responsibility for the restoration of Russian society. It can be regarded as a kind of moral duty but also as being in the interests of the European Union, which, of course, has nothing to gain from lawlessness and poverty in a very large neighbouring country.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet for many of us, the development of the Russian Federation is still a dubious matter and that is why I can imagine that people sometimes have their doubts about it, even in this Parliament. In any case, the best thing we can do in our strategy towards the Russian Federation is to follow a twin-track strategy. On the one hand, we must indict those who violate human rights and wield a disproportionate amount of power, clearly and forcefully, and on the other, we must enter into cooperation in a variety of sectors. Both approaches are necessary if we are to help Russia become a flourishing, democratic constitutional state. This is in our mutual interest. That means condemning the gross violence in Chechnya and looking for ways of helping to end the war and assuage the suffering. So it is necessary for the European Union and the OECD to be present there. We know, I am happy to say, that people in Russia are not indifferent to our criticism of what is happening there. That comes up in quite a few conversations one has in Russia. After all, Russia too wants to be assessed by the same standards that we apply to ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also do well to be severely critical of the visa measures vis-à-vis Georgia that have recently been undertaken, and provided for in amendments. I am expecting a more extensive discussion to take place next month via the topical and urgent debate, and would suggest that we only give a limited preview of this debate in these resolutions. In particular, I hope to be able to adopt half of the amendment tabled by the Greens on this issue. It also behoves us to criticise the relations between Russia and the Baltic States, which are still to be regularised. It will not be the fault of the latter. They need Russia to regularise and establish its affairs with them effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as cooperation with Russia is concerned, the Russian response to the strategy document of the European Union offers some good starting points. The entry into force of scientific and technological cooperation with the Russian Federation is a good example. In retrospect, the interruption of this cooperation was not a success, particularly as there appears to be little coordination in actions of this kind, between the European Union on the one hand and other major players, such as Japan and the United States, on the other. We must take this lesson to heart for future reference.</p>
<p class="contents">The Northern Dimension is a clear example of cooperation that is to be put into concrete form. In point of fact, this concept is underused, politically speaking. It is an important concept, particularly in the fields of energy provision, care for the environment, the clearing up of nuclear waste, and the decommissioning of nuclear submarines. In addition, it is possible to achieve various forms of cross-border cooperation that will prevent sharp disparities in wealth from arising. Initiatives concerning cooperation with the region of Kaliningrad fit into the same framework.</p>
<p class="contents">We would argue in favour of having a separate budgetary line for developing this Northern Dimension in a coherent manner, along the lines of the one that we already have for cooperation with the three Baltic States. However, I am of the opinion that the importance of Russia is not really reflected in the budget, but we disagree with the Social Democrats on that score. If you take a close look, then roughly speaking, Russia is slightly ahead of Morocco in terms of budgetary importance, which cannot be right to my mind. I could live with it though, if recital G on this aspect were to lapse, and in so doing if it were to be possible, with the support of the Social Democrats, to achieve a broader majority for this resolution, because this would send out a clearer signal to Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">We are hoping that the cooperation will extend to external policy. The resolution refers to the Commission as the initiator of policy and to the High Representative as the coordinator of policy. There are various regions where we could start the ball rolling, such as the Balkans, the Caucasus region and Central Asia. A more relaxed discussion of mutual security interests would also have its uses, bearing in mind that, naturally, from my point of view and that of others and the majority of my group, NATO, and within this framework, our bond with North America, are absolutely paramount in matters of security.</p>
<p class="contents">We will follow the developments in Russian society and internal politics with great interest. We hope that a truly civil society will soon flourish there and form the permanent basis for a real political democracy. I hope that links will be established at all levels between organisations, individuals and associations in the EU and their counterparts in the Russian Federation. This will help to spread awareness of the values we all share. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Orden (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Russia has yet to come to terms with herself, to decide what sort of society she wants to create and define her position in the world. For over seventy years, her development was distorted and held back by the monstrous experiment of communism which grew to threaten us all. I must say I very much welcome Mr Oostlander's report for its very reasonable and balanced approach, praising constructive reforms while criticising blatant human rights abuses. But let me say a couple of words about our strategic relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">While encouraging a strong economic relationship between the European Union and Russia coupled with efforts at political cooperation, we must take care that we do not create for ourselves some sort of strategic dependency. For example, it has been suggested in the context of European defence policy – about which I have to say we continue to have reservations – that the European Union might turn to Russia to provide strategic airlift capabilities to complement the arrangements already in place between the WEU and Ukraine. Now I am in favour of encouraging Russia and the Ukraine to move in our direction and cooperate with other alliance countries in crisis-management tasks, but I would not be in favour of us moving in their direction or adjusting our policies in order to accommodate them.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a very dangerous situation if the Europeans were to become logistically reliant on Russia. If we do not have our own strategic airlift then we already have a tried and tested ally in the United States – and in this context I am sure that Mr Oostlander has no desire for Russia to supplant the United States as a strategic partner for Europe. We must work in the closest possible harmony with the United States in our dealings with Russia and certainly must not give Russia the impression that there are divisions to be exploited. This would be in no one's interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must take great care to ensure diversity of production and supply in terms of energy. Already some 40% of natural gas supply for the EU comes from Russia, and an increasing proportion of oil imports now come from the CIS countries, where known reserves are larger than those in the United States and North Sea combined. Many of the transit routes for these are through areas of great conflict. It is in our interests to do all we can to help stabilise that region by economic and political means, ensuring that we do nothing to encourage or sustain instability in the Caucasus and the southern regions of Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That alone illustrates the importance which the EU attaches to its relations with the Russian Federation. The dual strategy of cooperation and criticism which Mr Oostlander develops in his report is, in the opinion of my group, eminently suited to the situation in the Russian Federation. However, this sort of strategy is a complex subject and all the institutions and the Member States must approach it in a strictly coordinated and circumspect manner.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Oostlander report demonstrates, this is not always easy and Parliament must ensure that it works in a very orderly fashion here.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the most important points in the report: the Russian Federation is important to the Union for both security policy and economic reasons, of that there can be no doubt. The PCA provides the necessary contractual basis here and – if it is applied fully – the instruments needed in order to react to a whole spectrum of developments. The agreement contains a human rights clause and provisions governing the establishment of democratic rule of law. Our economic relations with the Russian Federation have fluctuated enormously over past years, depending on various crisis situations. But, most importantly, there is a lack of foreign investment in the Russian Federation, coupled with a huge drain on the profits of Russia companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless the Russian Federation rectifies this situation by creating, post haste, the necessary legal and security framework and hence a more friendly investment climate, there would appear to be no way out of the economic crisis, high oil prices notwithstanding. And programmes such as TACIS can only be of limited help here – more to the point, they barely scratch the surface.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's priority task should therefore be to improve the effectiveness of the funds deployed under the programme and, more importantly, to enhance its visibility. What is important, I think, is that it should continue to be the political responsibility of the administrative staff and should not turn into project management.</p>

This highlights the importance of the strategy towards the Russian Federation and, at the same time, the importance of your report, Mr Oostlander. However, as we have already said, the Russian Federation is a difficult partner. Even if President Putin guarantees the democratic development of his country, that does not automatically guarantee a stable and democratic Russian Federation. Basic democratic order is not a fact of life in the Russian Federation and this is a problem, especially when it comes to cooperation with the European Union, because, for us, any such cooperation must be based on respect for human and minority rights, and we have made that clear. This means that the twin-track strategy posited in the report is very, very important. We want outstanding cooperation with the Russian Federation, but we cannot accept the Russian Federation's continuing to wage war on its own people in Chechnya, a war which has continued uninterrupted for a year now.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also hugely critical of the Russian Federation's provocative visa policy towards Georgia and call for this decision to be revoked at once. Nor can we tolerate the manner in which the freedom of the press is trampled underfoot in the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Prodi plan may bring a new dimension to cooperation with the Russian Federation and provides an important basis. Let us not forget the basis we had in the European Union, with the coal and steel plan guaranteeing lasting peaceful cooperation between France and Germany. And look where we are now. The energy community with the Russian Federation may well take on a political dimension in exactly the same way. That means that we have a joint responsibility for peace in the Caucasus, for environmental protection in the Russian Federation and for the rights of its indigenous people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Oostlander’s report is crucially important and it sets out to achieve this cooperation. We have to use our combined powers to heal the wounds that ten years of crude capitalism have inflicted on Russia. Boycotts will not resolve the problem. Things are now going badly for Russia. There is no middle class: there are just the super-rich and the super-poor. Half the population live below the poverty line. The country is in sharp moral decline: it is almost like Sodom and Gomorra. There are fears that the number of HIV-positive cases will rise in the next few years to close on 600 000, and the disease is also beginning to hit young people hard. Eighty per cent of new infections concern people under the age of 25. The birth rate is dropping, the mortality rate is going up, and the net loss in Russia’s population amounts to a million a year. That goes to show just how bad things are for the people there.</p>
<p class="contents">The country is also burdened by the need to protect nature and human beings from old mistakes. There are still 300 tons of anthrax bacteria manufactured for purposes of biological warfare in existence there, and just a small dose is lethal. Dozens of tons of waste plutonium have to be destroyed as a result of disarmament negotiations. The EU must help Russia, because in that way it is also preventing risks that would threaten itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important area of cooperation is energy policy, which is connected with superpower politics, which governs, for example, the transportation of oil and gas from the east to the west. Today 30-40% of EU gas comes from Russia, and in ten years’ time the EU will be almost totally dependent on Russian gas. There is no northern, western or southern alternative for this. The EU countries should not be a geopolitical extension of the United States in matters of gas and oil pipelines. The EU is no threat to the Russians, but a unipolar world under the leadership of the USA is. The Russians cannot, at least not yet, oppose NATO’s sly expansion through the militarisation of EU structures. Slyness does not become us: we must build a Europe of economic cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Contrary to what previous speakers have said, I do not believe that this strategy has been successful to date. Unfortunately, the major financial scandals which continue to punctuate relations between Russia and international finance, and a number of projects involving the international community, clearly illustrate as much.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot really agree with Mr Oostlander’s approach to the issue of human rights and democracy in the context of the Russian Federation. I have put forward a number of amendments intended to place rather more emphasis on these issues. Mr Oostlander does not customarily welcome my amendments and I was not therefore very surprised to see that they had not been included.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Chechnya, in particular, I do not think it is possible to say, Mr Oostlander, that the solution cannot be purely military. I think that the solution cannot be military, as the situation clearly demonstrates, and that it can only be political. Mr Putin himself – and we would not even be going as far as him – said that the issue of the future status of Chechnya is not the main issue. Yet we do not dare say as much in our report. This, I believe, is not acceptable. Nor do I think it acceptable, moreover, to fail to state that it is absolutely intolerable, after one and a half years of war in Chechnya, that our Commissioner for humanitarian aid, Mr Nielson, has not yet truly set foot in Chechnya. Nor do I think it acceptable that the European Union should fail to respond to the murders of journalists covering the war in Chechnya. These are not isolated instances but repeated occurrences. A member of my party, a radical militant journalist, was murdered several weeks ago in Tbilisi, a city clearly under the control of<span class="underline"> </span>Russian troops. I do not feel the Commission and the Council can fail to respond to an event of such seriousness.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Orden is quite right in what he says regarding the Caucasus. We are currently witnesses to an absolutely dreadful deterioration of the situation in Georgia. The country is completely destabilised, literally strangled by the Russian Federation. It is on the point of collapse and the European Union is offering no practical response to this rejection, this ban by the Russian authorities regarding the introduction of visas. It could respond by cancelling visas for Georgians travelling to the European Union. It could and should start to consider Georgia’s accession before it is too late, before there is another Balkans situation at the very gateway to Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the domestic front, President Putin has explicitly opted for an enforced recentralisation policy, his watchword being ‘all power to the Kremlin’. When it comes to overseas affairs, Moscow does not wish to comply with international obligations. The attitude of the Russian diplomats at the OSCE Summit held in Vienna at the end of November, spoke volumes in this respect. There is to be no withdrawal of Russian troops from Moldova, nor are the Russian military bases in Georgia to be closed.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, how does the EU view the latest Russian manoeuvre against Georgia? I am referring to the introduction of a visa obligation for Georgians, with the exception of the Abkhazians and the South Ossetians. Surely that is completely out of kilter with the rapporteur’s idea of a certain degree of convergence between the foreign and security policy of the European Union and Russia in the Caucasus? After all, that would be sending out the wrong signal to Kremlin boss Putin at entirely the wrong moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The famous Russian opposition politician, Grigori Jawlinski, has made it into western newspaper columns again lately. Using cutting words he condemned the uncritical stance of the West towards the occupant of the Kremlin. He said western politicians do not understand Russia. Indeed, they fear Russia. Hence they choose the line of least resistance. They want to have a friend in the Kremlin. It makes no odds to the west what is happening with Russia, its people and society.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Oostlander’s report contradicts the latter sentiment and I would like to compliment him on that. And yet Jawlinkski’s portrayal of Europe’s struggle with the phenomenon of Russia is very apt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His was a well prepared report. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, and Common Security and Defence Policy got its most important proposals approved and in the final vote we supported the adoption of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Oostlander’s report clearly denounces the excessive use of force that Russia was guilty of in Chechnya. Failings in the implementation of human rights and democracy have also been clearly brought to light. On the other hand, the report supports a strategic partnership between the EU and Russia. Cooperation with Russia needs to be reinforced. A separate budgetary heading is being proposed for the Northern Dimension and increased aid to Russia, in general, is being recommended. The report also supports the development of energy cooperation between the Union and Russia. It is important for the Union that the availability of oil and natural gas is secured by creating alternatives. Moves to exploit the gas and oil resources in the Barents region should be speeded up, while, at the same time, production in the Komi and Caspian Sea regions and the infrastructure for transporting the products out of those regions should be improved in terms of technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the Nice Summit seems to be opening up the avenue towards swift enlargement of the Union, it is important to show determination in getting to grips with those problems which enlargement threatens to create for relations between the Member States and Russia. We need flexibility, particularly in arrangements regarding trade and the mobility of people. However, the main solution is for cooperation between the Union and Russia to be enhanced, bringing down the barriers between us. As the Union expands it will also be important to think about its internal differentiation, which might, for its part, ease border area problems. On the other hand, there is reason to hope the Russian Federation will also consider decentralising the power of decision and the issue of internal differentiation, allowing the possibility of abolishing borders. By this I mean, for example, making special economic areas of Kaliningrad, Murmansk, Karelia and other parts of Russia bordering the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Anyone looking at Russia from the outside and with the odd personal experience from visiting the country itself and speaking to Russian counterparts will soon be in danger of selectively tailoring reality in the Russian Federation to fit his personal image. Current discussions on the Russian state symbol show that there are several takes on reality in the Russian Federation. The national flag of Peter the Great flutters alongside the army's red flag and the national coat of arms showing the Tsarist double-headed eagle is displayed while Stalinist national anthems are being sung. These symbols are perhaps not as contradictory as they first appear, each reflecting as it does a facet of an authoritarian state.</p>
<p class="contents">But a whole spectrum lies between these diametrically-opposed historical perspectives and pro-active Russian society will certainly refuse to be reduced to or guided towards any of these authoritarian alternatives. I personally become more and more enthusiastic when I meet young, open, well-educated Russians and more and more depressed by Russian structures, be they state, economic or even mafia structures. The best way we can help the Russian Federation is, on the one hand, to refrain from wholesale damnation and clearly address unhealthy structures or individual policies, such as the Chechen policy and, on the one hand, to value positive developments, without talking up, writing up or thinking up the Russian Federation as a whole. We can contribute towards stability from the outside by sending the Russian Federation clear and specific signals as to how we wish to configure our cooperation. Once Poland and the Baltic States accede to the EU, we hope to use the greater geographical proximity to the Russian Federation to strengthen cross-border cooperation in the area of Saint Petersburg, Nowgorod and Kaliningrad. Transport, energy, the environment and internal security are right at the top of the list of possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations to find creative solutions as regards the future freedom of transit for the people of Kaliningrad through Lithuania and Poland should also be completed before Poland and Lithuania accede to the EU. Why not make the <span class="italic">Oblast</span> of Kaliningrad a pilot project on two counts: first in relation to the potential for economic cooperation between the Russian Federation and the EU and, secondly, to test the Russian Federation's ability to implement fundamental reforms such as rural, fiscal and administrative reforms in advance in this area with our support? That is the way to bind the Russian Federation to the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The common strategy is one of them. Despite all its contradictions, Europeans clearly see Russia as part of Europe and have a huge interest in a stable, democratically-organised Russian Federation with good economic prospects which plays a confident part in and helps to shape international policy. The West also needs the Russian Federation as an important international partner if Europe is to be reshaped after the change. It is this interest which has led the Union to develop specific fields of activity in numerous areas in the common strategy towards the Russian Federation and other documents.</p>
<p class="contents">They include consolidating the rule of law and strengthening government institutions. They also include developing a civil society as an important precondition to consolidating democracy. In the economic sector, the Union is endeavouring to integrate the Russian Federation into a common economic and social area. The Union is already the Russian Federation's most important processing, investment and trading partner, accounting for over 40%. But there is still huge potential here. Experts have calculated that trade between the European Union and the Russian Federation only accounts for one-third of what might be expected, given the Russian Federation's gross national product and its proximity to EU markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In the political sector, the common strategy towards the Russian Federation proposes entering into a standing dialogue on policy and security and creating a permanent mechanism for such dialogue. It would be interesting to expound on this, but time is too short. The EU sets great store in its Russian policy by environmental protection and nuclear safety. Unfortunately, this momentum in relations between the Russian Federation and the EU has come up against a counter force – cue Chechnya, which has seriously hampered relations. The substance and methods of the internal consolidation being pursued by the Putin regime will have a significant influence on the nature of our relations. We can only hope that the current pragmatic and realistic partnership will perhaps one day become a real strategic partnership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report contains many empty phrases and, in particular, pious hopes. It is not just because each of the major European powers is primarily concerned with safeguarding the interests of its own capitalist groups, but in the final analysis, what does capitalist Europe have to offer Russia?</p>
<p class="contents">Economic growth? Yet for the last ten years the Russian economy has done nothing but collapse. An end to the preponderance of queues? Yet what use are more or less well stocked shops if, with unemployment, and retirement pensions and wages at a low level or not even paid, one third of the population is living below the poverty line and does not have any money to buy the goods? Democracy? Yet under the guise of democracy there is domination by official and unofficial mafias. Freedom? Yet the freedom which the reintroduction of capitalism has brought Russia is freedom only for a narrow range of bureaucrats left over from the previous regime to pillage natural resources and transfer the proceeds to Western banks. And indeed, what does freedom mean for the Chechen people?</p>

As a Swedish Christian Democrat, I fully support the two-strategy model which Mr Oostlander presents, involving vigorous, consistent and sustained criticism of all crimes, especially crimes within Russia against human rights, but also involving close and intimate cooperation with Russia, our large neighbour in the East.</p>
<p class="contents">Recital KK in the report states the following: ‘given that Russia is in a political union with Belarus, it is appropriate in the interest of Russia’s democratic legitimacy for President Putin and the Russian government to point out clearly and consistently the comprehensive need for democratic progress and reforms in Belarus, not least in the light of the report submitted by the parliamentary troika from the EU, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Minsk on 16 October 2000’. I am the author of that paragraph, which has been applauded in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. I should here like to highlight the value of our really emphasising the seriousness of Russia’s in actual fact being in a political union with Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the report we presented in Minsk, we first of all emphasised that the Belarus Parliament is at present lacking in powers, cannot legislate, does not have the right of veto against Presidential decrees and cannot adopt budgets. Secondly, we pointed out that electoral law has disqualified a quarter of the candidates in this so-called parliamentary election in October. Thirdly, we discussed access to the media, which is unfairly organised in a State-controlled system. Fourthly, we discussed the administrative criminal law which makes it illegal to urge a boycott of elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Belarus is therefore in political union with Russia. It is important for us to emphasise the seriousness of this for Russia too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The war in Chechnya is a case in point, and, for example, this labour legislation now under discussion will reduce employees’ rights quite drastically. We have, however, tried a boycott policy, and that had no effect on this war. The twin-track strategy proposed by Mr Oostlander offers a way out, for which I thank him. This is the first strategy on Russia in our history. Multi-faceted cooperation will help to stabilise conditions in Russia. That will be the first step, after which attempts will be made to achieve respect for the law, which will be the second step, and then, economic development will bring more stability, all of which will bring about the features of civil society we expect. The result will finally be more human rights, which we all desire. This report thus creates the possibility for constructing a multilayer structure. For this reason I think it will be an important breakthrough. We have already laid the foundations of a period of cooperation with Russia during which the political leadership has changed. We uphold the criticisms, but we will not sever our contact as we did after the civil war, which was followed by Stalin’s persecutions and all the terrors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Northern Dimension, which is important, will receive its own budget funds under this proposal, which is a very important issue. I, myself, suggest that energy should be made the driving force behind this important project, as that is something we need, that is where the money is, and since we have the money, we can also spend it on the infrastructure, on hospitals, environmental issues and so on. Money from energy: both sides need cooperation for that, and especially in parts of northern Russia, which I would urge Russia to turn to. It is peaceful there and soldiers are not needed to guard the pipeline. Do you intend to support a project such as this, Commissioner Patten? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alavanos (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, a few days ago, the Duma decided that the Soviet anthem would be Russia's national anthem. The music and words and the decision by the Duma are not overly significant. What is significant is that the majority of Russian citizens supported this move. What I want to know is why these people did not choose the <span class="italic">Marseillaise </span>or <span class="italic">God save the Queen</span> as their anthem of hope for a brave new world, preferring instead to turn the clock back to a regime which many of my fellow members have described as inhumane, criminal and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the significance of the ten years since Russia was suddenly catapulted into the free market and into contact with western values? Do we not know what their significance is? The responsibilities are, of course, mainly Russia's, both for the past and the present. But do the European Union, the United States and the other powers bear no responsibility? This is the mafia we are talking about. Where does the mafia have its roots, if not within the Kremlin itself? Who were Yeltsin's protectors and agents all that time? Who fought tooth and nail to support Yeltsin inside Russia? This is power hijacking we are talking about. Which banks is the money from foreign loans and/or the money hoarded inside Russia paid into? Is it the Bank of Havana or the Bank of Algeria? It is paid into the large western banks! And how is it controlled? And where are the prostitution networks operating?</p>
<p class="contents">What I am getting at is that someone must take responsibility for what has happened over the past ten years, including the European Union. From what certain speakers have said, the winner-takes-all model obviously applies. The cold-war model has been replaced by the winner-takes-all model. What are we afraid of? Dependency on Russia? Can the entire European Union, with Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and everyone else present in Nice really depend on Russia? Or will we opt for mutual dependency as we do with every other large power in today's world?</p>
<p class="contents">The point at issue here is Russia's role. What was Russia's role when NATO was taking decisions on a neighbouring area, on the Balkans, without so much as a nod to the UN, to which Russia belongs, or to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe? How come this power was not terrified? What I am trying to say is that we need to change our stand: we must not feel and we must not sow the seeds of fear; we must look for a partner which needs our help and support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoframe_blue"><tr><td><img alt="MPphoto" src="/doceo/data/img/photo_generic.gif" align="right" width="50" height="63" /></td></tr></table> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – I very much welcome this report and I should like to pay tribute to Mr Oostlander for producing it. His report has been welcomed by all parts of Parliament except, perhaps by those who look back with nostalgia to the not-so-golden days memorialised by a very large number of brave Soviet dissidents. But it is an excellent report which, like the common strategy itself, underlines the importance that we attach to the relationship – the strategic partnership – between the European Union and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The report endorses what is being called our "double track strategy" towards Russia, a strategy that combines plain speaking on issues like Chechnya – to which I will return in a few moments – with a continuing effort to build an effective relationship based on shared values and cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The common strategy and Russia's medium-term strategy for relations with the EU have created a new dynamism. The common strategy identified initiatives in foreign policy, security and the fight against crime. Other areas where we seek to bolster European Union cooperative efforts towards Russia are the rule of law and democracy building, civil society, twinnings as well as regional and cross-border cooperation and, above all, the Northern Dimension Initiative, to which a number of Members referred.</p>
<p class="contents">We strongly support the Russian Government's economic reform programme which is vital to improve the investment climate. In this context, as Parliament will know, at the last summit between the European Union and Russia, Romano Prodi launched a far-reaching dialogue on energy.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all areas in which the Commission has a powerful contribution to make, as the report repeatedly makes clear. Our technical assistance programme – in particular Tacis – already responds to many of the priorities identified by this report. The core Tacis Programme, worth EUR 34 million, focuses on education, the rule of law, democracy and civil society development, including regional media freedom, protection of individual rights and support to self-government. The subsequent action programme – to a value of EUR 58 million – focuses on institution-building, on the rule of law in the economic field and on improvements to the business and investment climate.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member's report rightly stresses the need for our Moscow delegation to play a bigger part in the management of our financial assistance, and I am determined to see significant progress in this direction as part of our wider reform of European Union external aid programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The report comments on the Northern Dimension. We too see this as an important mechanism for regional cooperation for the development of the north-west Russian regions as well as Kaliningrad. I am anxious to work closely with the incoming Swedish presidency to make concrete progress on the Northern Dimension. This means concentrating our efforts on key areas like the environment – which has been referred to by a number of Members – and nuclear safety, on Kaliningrad itself and on improving coordination between different sources of funding.</p>
<p class="contents">We are acutely aware of the urgent need to tackle environmental threats from nuclear storage facilities and rusting decommissioned submarines, especially in the north-west part of Russia, for example, around the Kola Peninsula. This is a formidable task. It requires a combined international and Russian effort. The Commission has taken a leading role in the negotiation of an international agreement establishing the multilateral nuclear environment programme for Russia. Those negotiations are now at a key stage and we hope for significant progress by March 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a pressing need to raise environmental awareness in Russia. This is exactly the objective of the environmental work programme for the Russian Federation, initialled last June in the framework of our partnership and cooperation agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a word on Kaliningrad: the partnership and cooperation agreement already offers an institutional framework for our dialogue with Russia on trade, visa and border issues. At the same time the development of the region has already benefited from Tacis projects amounting to about EUR 30 million since 1991. We are now finalising a communication to the Council on Kaliningrad. We are in the process of opening an office in Kaliningrad. I very much hope to visit Kaliningrad myself in the early part of next year, and not just because Immanuel Kant spent the whole of his life there. It is a serious issue that we need to address as part of the Northern Dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">In all of the areas I have outlined we are working closely with Russia to our mutual benefit. We are working to strengthen Russian democracy, reinforce the rule of law and transform the Russian economy. That is all to the good, but there remains one serious impediment to further improvements in the ties between Russia and the European Union: I refer, of course, to Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">At the last European Union Russian Summit in October, President Putin acknowledged the urgent need for a political solution to the conflict. I have to say to honourable Members – and I will abbreviate what I might have said at much greater length – we are profoundly concerned about the humanitarian situation in Chechnya. We are concerned about the continuing reports of human rights abuses, for example from NGOs like Médecins sans Frontières and Human Rights Watch. We hope that we will be able to make a great deal more progress with the Russian authorities in addressing those issues in the months ahead. We are profoundly concerned about the likely fate of thousands of refugees in Ingushetiya and Chechnya this coming winter.</p>
<p class="contents">It is because we take our relationship with Russia so seriously that these issues matter. They cannot just be brushed under the carpet. We have to return to them again and again, but we must also continue, as the honourable gentleman's report wisely recognises, to engage with Russia. We must avoid the mistake to which an honourable gentleman referred earlier, which was made at the start of the last century, when Russia was effectively excluded from European affairs after the Leninist revolution in 1917 with disastrous consequences. We shall therefore persevere with the common strategy to build on the progress achieved to heed many of the points raised in the honourable gentleman's report, and above all to strengthen the hands of the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one further word about a point that was raised by a couple of speakers in the debate – and that is the question of Georgia and visas. We have already expressed serious concern over the way in which Russia unilaterally introduced visa requirements for Georgian citizens on 5 December. The entire international community, not excluding Russia, is committed to supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the independent states. Actions by any country in the region which could have the effect of undermining that sovereignty carry significant implications. If more favourable visa requirements are applied to the inhabitants of secessionist regions or if they are exempted altogether, this would imply support for the legitimacy of their regimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Georgia is a member of the United Nations, a member of the OSCE, a member of the Council of Europe, and it has a partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union. It deserves our support. We call upon the states of the region to use the OSCE mechanisms to resolve their disputes quickly before real damage can be caused.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the honourable gentleman once again on an extremely good report on a very important issue, to which I am sure we will return in this Parliament over the next few years again and again. The honourable gentleman has given us a very important and useful political and intellectual infrastructure for our future discussions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
