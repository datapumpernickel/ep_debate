<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Christofer Fjellner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, on Wednesday, we are to vote on the scheme of generalised tariff preferences, or the ‘GSP’ for short. As rapporteur, I would like to start by taking the opportunity to thank the Commission, the Danish Presidency and, in particular, all the shadow rapporteurs I have had the privilege of working with on this matter. We worked extremely well together, and I believe this is also evident when we look at the results.</p>
<p class="contents">The scheme of generalised tariff preferences is the EU’s most important trade policy instrument, in particular, when it comes to trade with developing countries. No other instrument encompasses so many countries. By using this scheme of generalised tariff preferences, we can help developing countries in their efforts to acquire basic human rights, to reduce poverty and to achieve sustainable development in general. We do this by reducing or completely abolishing duties on their goods.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the first time that the European Parliament has been involved in legislating on the scheme of generalised tariff preferences, despite the fact that it has been in existence for more than 40 years, and I would like to start by saying that I think the fact that we can stand here in plenary today and discuss a proposal that already comes with an agreement one year after the proposal was presented is an achievement in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Early on in this work, I met many people who thought that things would be more complicated and difficult now that Parliament was involved in the decision-making process, and it has perhaps been a little bit more complicated, but no one can say that we are not working in a determined and efficient way. We put pressure on the Council to reach a decision, and instead of us following their lead, they have been forced to adopt a position on the basis of our positions.</p>
<p class="contents">The new proposal and what we have now negotiated with the Danish Presidency means that those countries which have succeeded in making economic progress, or which have other, more favourable agreements with the EU, are no longer included in the scheme of generalised tariff preferences and may no longer make use of this particular scheme. I have to be honest and say that, when I started work on this matter and saw some of the countries that were considered to be developing countries, I personally found it difficult to understand how some of the Gulf States, for example, could be viewed as developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very clear to us, however, that we should safeguard and retain that part of the scheme of generalised tariff preferences that ensures that the poorest countries in the world do not need to pay duties to Europe on any products other than weapons. This is probably the particular part of the EU’s trade policy of which I think we have most reason to be proud.</p>
<p class="contents">Our work in the European Parliament has sought to make the scheme of generalised tariff preferences transparent, predictable and more generous to those who remain in the scheme. The most important debate and the most difficult discussion we had was, I believe, that relating to the selection criteria. We knew that we needed stable and internationally recognised criteria that were also able to stand up to the scrutiny of the World Trade Organisation, and therefore we concluded that the Commission’s original proposal of USD 4 000 was probably the most reasonable one. We have made some adjustments with regard to the transitional period, however.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make the scheme more generous to those who remain in it, we have also included more products that may be of significance for poor countries and will increase their opportunity to trade their way to prosperity. We have also tightened up the requirements for joining the EU’s flagship arrangement for human rights, GSP+, while, at the same time, making membership of the scheme more attractive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to mention GSP+, as it is the EU’s system for providing additional trade preferences in exchange for countries undertaking and committing themselves to comply with the 27 different conventions on human rights and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by thanking those of you who were involved in this work and to say that it will now be many years – another 10 years – before we need to discuss this matter again. I hope that, in 10 years’ time, even fewer countries will be included in the scheme of generalised tariff preferences – partly because many will have concluded more favourable agreements with the EU, but, above all, because we will have fewer poor developing countries as a consequence of the trade to promote development that we are concerned with here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As he just said, we will only have to discuss this again in 10 years, and by then Mr Fjellner’s hair will either have started to disappear or will be getting grey.</p>
<p class="contents">Just over a year ago, the Commission adopted a proposal to reform the EU Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). Few trade files under this mandate have been subject to more intense scrutiny, and I congratulate the rapporteur, the Committee on International Trade (INTA), and the Danish and Polish Presidencies, for bringing us to where we are today. I am happy to see that the compromise reached between INTA and the Council Presidency endorses the core areas of the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a coincidence. Our internal discussions in the Commission were as complex as yours, and our proposal was the result of very careful reflection and a detailed impact assessment. The outcome was a balanced proposal which tackles head-on the true problems we face in the GSP. It is balanced because it focuses preferences on those who need them the most while, at the same time, expanding opportunities for countries which embrace core international values or values in human rights, labour rights and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal confronts head-on the real issues behind GSP. The first one is that the poorest developing countries will never grow sufficiently if we do not give them the space they need to export. This space is currently taken up by countries which are economically much more advanced and no longer need our unilateral preferences. We must focus preferences on the countries most in need.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if we are serious about supporting sustainable development, we have to expand opportunities for those countries which are ready and willing to implement core international conventions. Thirdly, without sufficient predictability, EU importers will never make best use of the GSP and the GSP will never fulfil its potential in terms of exports and growth for the countries most in need.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal squares the circle by providing answers to these three challenges, while safeguarding the legitimate interests of EU industry and respecting WTO rules. While I would have preferred to do without some aspects of the compromise reached between INTA and the Council Presidency, I can and will support it because it strikes a realistic balance between the very many different views in this particularly complex dossier, and one that ultimately well reflects the policy priorities the Commission agreed on in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore count on your help to support a compromise that is as realistic as it is politically important – a compromise whereby the EU will help those who need it most and those who embrace international values while respecting the interests of our industry and international law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new legislative proposal aims to target the preferential agreement on imports for the developing countries who need it most, in other words, lower-middle income and very low income countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, even though this report is a very good compromise, I feel rather unsatisfied because I believe that making GDP per inhabitant the sole condition for gaining access to the GSP will penalise, or at least could penalise, some small countries faced with high poverty levels – I am thinking, in particular, of Latin American countries or African countries such as Gabon, for example. For the Committee on Development, it is not sufficient for eligibility to the GSP system to depend on this sole criterion. That is why we proposed adding the human development index. I genuinely regret that this proposal has not been taken up by the Committee on International Trade (INTA).</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, good governance and, in particular, fair and transparent fiscal administration, good practices against tax evasion, as well as the fight against illicit capital flight, should also constitute new eligibility criteria for GSP+.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has managed, on the basis of an already sound Commission proposal, to work out a good compromise position with the aid of a number of other Members of this House. What is the major change? The major change is that, in future, the generalised system of preferences (GSP) will be much more targeted than at present. At the moment, there are 176 developing countries that benefit from this preferential market access, whereas in future, it will be around 80. In other words, we are to be more targeted. We will be excluding countries that have slowly worked their way up to a higher income. At the same time, we are managing to grant the larger and more targeted advantages to those who urgently need them. Our objective must be to use the preference system to pull as many countries out of poverty as possible over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">I will turn now to what I think is a good idea, which may work. I believe it is a good idea that we are providing at least 10 years of planning certainty for the countries taking part and for businesses, as only in 10 years’ time is this new instrument to be subject to revision. That is a clear improvement on the situation in the past, when people never knew whether some element of the system would be changed in the near future, whether production could be relocated to a developing country, or whether there was a need to factor in the potential loss of one advantage or another again in the near future. Indeed, we have even improved the conditions for GSP+, in that, while we expect more, we are also ready to grant more advantages in return. In so doing, we are making GSP+ considerably more interesting, meaning that we are providing more incentives for our standards – which is to say, the things that we believe to be right – to be met in these countries. On the other side of the coin, we are also prepared to provide advantages in return. I would love to see as many countries as possible around the world able to apply these GSP+ criteria over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, I would like to point out that we have changed nothing for the world’s poorest. In other words, for the world’s poorest countries, the rule remains: everything but arms. They can export everything but arms into the countries of the European Union. I would like to see many more of the world’s poorest countries taking advantage of these opportunities. I call on European industry, I call on investors, to please take advantage of this opportunity. The ‘everything but arms’ rule, too, will be stable over the next few years. Invest, at long last, in these countries and create growth, jobs and thus better living conditions for the people in the world’s poorest countries, too. I therefore very much welcome the compromise reached. I am extremely grateful to all those involved for the quick compromise and I am grateful, above all, for the fact that, through the rapid deliberation and the speedy finding of a compromise, including between the European institutions, we now have planning certainty for all and thus development opportunities also for the poorest of the poor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They really have succeeded in negotiating a good compromise. I also call for us to pass this compromise with the largest possible majority, as there has been real success here in granting these unilateral advantages in a more targeted way.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s trade policy, after all, is oft-criticised. In this area, however, it is clear that we are granting unilateral advantages to the poorest and next-to-poorest countries in the world, so that they can bolster their development on the back of these advantages. We will now be making this more targeted, and that is exactly the right approach to take. With the GSP+ countries, we are inviting them – on the basis of common values in relation to human rights and sustainability – to intensify trade relations with us still further. This also helps to strengthen sustainable development on the global level. Here too, then, what we have is a reasonable approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also ensured, however, that there are not sudden distortions in our industrial relations. In that connection, we have incorporated appropriate safety nets in those areas in which there is a competitive environment for our industrial products, so that we can very confidently say that we are granting unilateral advantages without jeopardising any jobs within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For those countries that will be leaving the GSP scheme, it goes without saying that the door is not closed. We invite all of them to conclude intensive trade relations with us – be it via bilateral trade negotiations, through the WTO, or through economic partnership agreements (EPAs) – with the aim of bringing about sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Congratulations to the rapporteur, Christofer Fjellner, who managed to strike a balance between the various options.</p>
<p class="contents">There are now two commitments to undertake immediately. We need to coordinate the application of GSP with that of bilateral free trade agreements, first and foremost, so as not to alter the preferential nature of GSP for developing countries, which could even find themselves penalised by less favourable access conditions than those granted to the beneficiaries of bilateral agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more important is the monitoring of its entry into force, especially of effective compliance with international conventions on human rights, trade union rights, environmental protection and the rule of law. In this area, we have important news: the burden of proof is reversed, meaning it will be up to countries that are potentially non-compliant with these conventions to demonstrate that they are using the criteria of good governance and respect for human rights, by virtue of which they may enjoy this generalised system of preferences.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that information on this matter may come not only from the international organisations themselves, promoters of these conventions, but also from Parliament, the Council and especially from civil society, transforms this scheme into a much more participatory and democratic one. There are no less than 27 conventions to observe, including the United Nations one on climate change. This part of the scheme, without which this good work would, for the most part, be in vain, now needs to be fully implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a positive that there are now longer durations, and more certainties for exporters.</p>
<p class="contents">The criteria are too imprecise, however, as the Committee on Development has already said. Unfortunately, the Commission is only interested in World Bank categorisation. In that connection, Parliament has been very critical in the past, and on repeated occasions, of the use of gross domestic product as the sole criterion. The definition of upper-middle income countries can apply to countries with a per capita GDP of USD 4 000, but also to those where it is up to USD 12 000. That is thus an enormous – and far too large – range, and it in no way does justice to the realities on the ground. We certainly do not object to countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait being removed. The reform to that end was good therefore. These countries, however, are high-income countries. Russia and China, on the other hand, are upper-middle income countries, but we certainly need not be concerned by their removal from the scheme either.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet this category also includes much poorer countries, such as Namibia and Ecuador. Until now, the Commission had at least also applied the criterion of vulnerability, which covers countries that export little, or only a very small range of goods. That meant that it was possible to at least avoid the situation where countries that are dependent on fewer products and are thus very vulnerable are categorised too high.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, then, has the Commission removed this criterion? It will mean the removal from the scheme of countries such as the Dominican Republic, Fiji, Gabon and Botswana, even though their economies fit the criterion of vulnerability. Why did the Commission not retain the old criteria, which were, in any case, already inadequate? It raises the suspicion that the Commission wants to force poorer countries into free trade agreements that are unfavourable to them. The preference system, however, is an instrument to promote development and cannot be replaced by pure trade instruments, in which the path of a country or a region to development no longer plays any role. Fortunately, my fellow Members will still have the chance in plenary to vote in favour of our amendment, which incorporates vulnerability as a criterion.</p>
<p class="contents">The new arrangements will also mean, however, that trade regions will be dismembered. Neighbouring countries in customs unions will soon have to follow different rules when exporting to the EU. This absolutely does not reflect our objective of promoting regional integration. Instead of individual countries, the Commission should be giving greater consideration to development regions. Here, too, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have tabled an amendment, which I hope will meet with a great deal of support. It is also problematic for countries that one day were still benefiting from the GSP only to then find themselves outside the programme the next day. There need to be transitional periods, and we can see from our own Member States that just a few months are not enough for economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, we MEPs have to consider, for all legislative proposals, whether we focus just on speed and want to work with wonky compromises, or whether we would not rather involve the entire plenary. For me, the entire House is important for legislation, and for democracy, rather than time and speed. In fact, it takes time to enact democracy and to pass laws properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For once in my life, I am going to actually congratulate the Commission and the Council because it was one of the few trialogues that I have been on – and I have been in this Parliament a long time – where we have actually been able to work as a unit on what I consider to be an excellent proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the ECR Group thoroughly recommend and welcome the deal. We hope that the new regime will not only provide stability and predictability, but will also lead to the promotion of trade focused on development. The Asian lesson shows that trade is key to development, and we must do all we can to assist countries to trade their way out of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we as a group are a little bit disappointed that the terms of the deal were not more generous from the EU side. We cannot, on the one hand, say that we want to do all we can to help developing countries, only to back down when we think it seems to hit our bottom line. One of the ladies who have just spoken mentioned those countries which are moving out of GSP, and I believe there should be some sort of assistance or transitional period to help them move on.</p>
<p class="contents">The other thing that I am always concerned about is that, whenever we discuss trade negotiations within the European Union and redo trade agreements, we tend to become rather protectionist. I know that Christofer and I believe that protectionism is not only not good for those countries but also destroys us if we are not careful. Therefore, it is good to have the proposals that are there.</p>
<p class="contents">Daniel mentioned EBA (Everything But Arms). We have a saying in certain areas of trade policy that it is not just EBA, it is EBA and sugar, but this is a classic example of how, sometimes, we get tied up in protecting our own systems, and that I would not like to see. However, I think it is a win-win situation. It has been an excellent negotiation and I hope the Commission will pass my thanks on to Peter Thomsen who was one of the negotiators present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This could be described as colonialism by another name. Perversely, many EU states themselves have not even signed the treaties or agreements that they are insisting these lesser developed countries must sign.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreements have been attacked as being illegal under both UN and WTO law. Furthermore, some countries are so fed up with EU meddling that they are increasingly looking to autocratic China as a preferred trading partner instead. Because China does not make these political or legal demands on other trading partners, it is likely to pick this trade up for itself.

This fact is concealing itself behind the debate about the criteria into which we have already entered, including today. A completely arbitrary limit value has been set on per capita average income, which just happens to exceed USD 4 000 per annum. However, this value tells us nothing about the real distribution of income in many countries. In particular, the inconsistency of development processes in each country is not covered.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you recall the Treaty of Lisbon? The elimination of poverty is a coherent goal of the foreign policy of the European Union. Your reform will destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs in countries like Ecuador, thus tipping women, predominantly, back into poverty. I believe that the motivation is clear, and it has even been publicly acknowledged by the rapporteur. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Fjellner for his openness and the mutual respect shown during the debate on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Countries such as Ecuador are to be forced to conclude a direct free trade agreement with the European Union. We have seen the simple peddling of the argument that the reform aims to help the least developed countries. You are aware of that yourself, as trade potentials will not shift to the weak, but to the strong. Mr Lange, every major development organisation, this House’s Committee on Development, as well as the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and numerous national trade unions have leant their support to the amendments and the trend through which we are seeking to revise this regulation. We will bring these amendments up again with Members in plenary, and I strongly urge you to support these amendments and thus help ensure that the European Union does not withdraw from the global fight against poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I quite often agree with Mr Scholz on trade policy, but I fundamentally disagree with him on this matter. We are right to try and focus on the poorest countries in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">My group did try to include a vulnerability criteria so that some of the vulnerable upper-middle income countries could have been included in this scheme, but that was not carried, and we as a group will support the compromise agreed in the trialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth recalling, when we talk about GSP reform, that we still have the most generous scheme in the world for the poorest countries in the world. The Everything But Arms initiative is unparalleled, and we should be proud of that and proud that it has not been touched in this scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Rinaldi about the GSP+. He is right to point to the shift in the burden of proof. The weakness in GSP+ up until now has not been the criteria we have set. We have been right to insist on strong human rights and environmental and labour standards, but we have been unable to enforce these so far. This reversal in the burden of proof will make a significant difference, and I welcome it.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of where we go from here, I think it is right that the scheme lasts for ten years. I know the Commission would have liked an open-ended agreement, but I thought that was too long, and ten years is a reasonable period.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have made clear in the trialogue is that it is not ten years from now – not ten years from the date of the agreement – but ten years from the date of implementation of the agreement, so this gives importers inside the European Union a period of stability and it gives our exporting partners ten years in which to take advantage of the situation. Built into this scheme as well, there is the flexibility for countries to join if they become poorer countries, and to enter into the scheme at a later stage.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the Socialist Group would have nuanced the package differently, but we welcome this agreement and, as a group, we will support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, of course, in a post-Lisbon era, I hope we will be able to make the most of the opportunity and deliver the advantages of this system to those countries that will qualify, and ensure that they are able to use this to promote human rights, democracy and freedom of speech in the developing world.</p>

<p class="contents">The rules currently in force were established by a Council regulation in 2008, and, due to the dynamic pace of social and economic development, it is understandably necessary to update these rules. In connection with the application of new legislative procedure mechanisms under the Treaty of Lisbon, the regulation must also go through the proper procedure in the European Parliament. Even though the draft regulation submitted by the Commission is based on a proven structure applying three separate preference regimes – 1) the standard GSP, 2) the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance known as ‘GSP+’, and 3) the Everything But Arms (EBA) arrangement – the rules and criteria for granting preferences have been changed, which also results in a different structure of beneficiaries. The list of beneficiaries is reduced first by countries with another agreement on preferential conditions, such as a free trade agreement, secondly, by Overseas Countries and Territories of the EU, the US and Australia and thirdly, by countries which have been classified by the World Bank as a high-income or an upper-middle income country during three consecutive years, such as Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Brazil.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, however, the new classification proposed by the Commission would exclude most Caribbean islands, most Latin American countries and even Namibia, Gabon and Algeria. Meanwhile, economies as powerful as those of India, China, Indonesia and Thailand would temporarily continue to be eligible for the GSP.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the Committee on International Trade’s proposal is sensible and correct, recommending as it does the introduction of a transparent system combining a number of indicators for objectively justifying the provision of GSP benefits to selected countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, refocusing the benefit of the system on the poorest countries is a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in wanting to correct the excesses of one system, are we not, ultimately, creating some injustices as the application of the sole criterion of income per capita would result in a number of countries, which are neither least developed countries (LDCs) nor low income countries, but which are fragile, finding themselves at risk of being penalised? In particular, I am thinking of the small island developing states, whose vulnerability would have justified granting them a special status.</p>

As the Chair of the Committee on International Trade (INTA), I would have preferred the opposite approach, in other words, to negotiate with the other institutions only after the debate and the vote in plenary.

This will be detrimental to poorer economies and to the most vulnerable countries in the European Union itself.</p>

For this reason, the rules for applying it must be based on criteria that ensure that it is applied in the most fair and balanced way possible to the countries that need it most. However, the current proposal to reform the GSP, on which we will be voting on Wednesday, gives the same treatment to countries that are very well integrated into international trade, with incomes per capita of up to USD 12 000, as it does to vulnerable countries whose incomes per capita are barely more than USD 4 000. For example, the measure excludes countries such as Libya, Namibia, Botswana and a large proportion of Latin American countries which have very little weight in international trade, weakening the EU’s strategic, supportive links with the region. For these reasons, I support the amendments that enable some of those vulnerable countries to remain within the framework of the GSP or which, at least, give them some time to adapt to the new situation and, if they wish, to negotiate an agreement with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The vote on Wednesday will be the last opportunity to try to amend this agreement so that no country is forced to negotiate a trade agreement with the EU due to being excluded from the GSP. I trust that Parliament will take these proposals into consideration, as they would enable this reform to be more inclusive and balanced, and the EU’s trade policy to contribute to creating fair international trade that benefits us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One positive aspect, however, is the new geographical coverage owing to the principle of differentiation, which provides a boost for the poorest nations. Equally useful is the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, known as ‘GSP+’, linked to the implementation of the main international conventions on social, human and environmental rights. Also positive is the safeguard clause for the entire textile and clothing sector, as well as the general clause.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the loosening of the financial criteria for the beneficiaries of the GSP+ regime and the exclusion from the graduation mechanism of nations that come under this scheme actually opens the door to unfair competition in relation to already heavily affected sectors, as I said, and gives priority to countries such as Pakistan, whose violations in the field of human rights must not be approved.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, there is no doubt that this is a positive regulation, but the issues I mention cast a shadow over other aspects that we wished to consider. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In general terms, we have a good regulation on the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+), which is necessary, specifically, with regard to some measures concerning the monitoring of standards for importing textile products that could be damaging to EU production. We are concerned, however, by the exclusion from the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) from 2014 of certain countries that are classified as having upper middle incomes, for example, Latin American countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned as to what is happening with these middle income countries (MICs) that have a lack of diversification in their exports. Why not introduce a criterion of diversification of exports? This could create a two-speed system: countries such as Costa Rica, Cuba and Ecuador would benefit from it, differentiating them from potentially developed countries such as China and Brazil.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we must support a transition period, and that amendments are going to be tabled during that transition period in order to adapt to that situation and to those countries, and provide the opportunity to begin negotiations and trade agreements with them so that they can benefit from it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The number of countries benefiting from the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) has been reduced to less than half as the new criteria exclude from the system countries whose development indicators are not yet fully aligned with recent improvements in their GDP per capita. In many cases, the increase in benefits is associated with an unacceptable application of pressure and blackmail to force the acceptance of the free trade agreements, an approach that we vehemently reject. At the same time, the benefits granted to other countries are being extended in such a way that they will very likely adversely affect countries such as Portugal which are heavily involved in vulnerable sectors, such as textiles and clothing.</p>
<p class="contents">A final regrettable point is the way in which the discussion of this dossier has been handled. It is regrettable that, before a debate and vote has even taken place in the plenary, the major political groups, the Commission and the Council have agreed and finalised everything in advance.

Some of the proposed changes are self-evidently beneficial, such as the removal of preferences for high-income or upper-middle income countries. However, it appears that powerful exporters such as China, India, Indonesia and Thailand will continue to be part of the scheme, at least for the time being. The changes to the safeguard clauses allowing EU producers the legal right to seek action if they face serious disturbances to their business, or a deterioration in their financial situation, are clearly beneficial. Under the graduation process, whereby a country lost its preference if its exports of a product exceeded 15% of the GSP total, this figure will now, unfortunately, be raised to 17.5%. In my view, individual states should have the final say over the withholding of preferences, based on the impact of imports on that state, and not on the exporter’s percentage of the GSP total. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I can hardly imagine the opposite being the case: would you, for example, agree to China obtaining ‘Everything But Arms’ status as soon as it entered into an agreement with, say, Laos or Cambodia, to set up a customs union by a later date, for example, within 25 years? It would be very difficult to imagine that being the right answer to the question. You could say the same of India, Pakistan, Thailand or Malaysia, which do the same with LDCs. Needless to say, this would accelerate preference erosion, with a significant drop in LDC exports. They would be squeezed completely out of the market with such a system.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members have asked why we did not include other criteria. We have given a lot of thought to this issue, but our conclusion is that we have to ensure WTO compatibility, and the use of a single indicator which is internationally recognised is, we think, the best solution. It would be a disservice to developing countries, and to the credentials of the EU as a serious partner, if we added more criteria and, as a result, lost yet another WTO case on GSP. This would lead to a full redesign of the new scheme just after it entered into force. Therefore, we should stick to an internationally recognised, objective way to differentiate among countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question that has been raised a couple of times relates to using the Human Development Index as an indicator. Again, we looked into the possibility of using the Human Development Index in GSP, but this index is not well suited to this exercise. Human Development Index data are not complete in terms of time or countries covered; also, Human Development Index categories are relative and fixed. This means that countries may develop significantly, and the development needs which the GSP should address may change, but they will remain in the same category. For example, no matter how much China grows, it is likely to stay in the same ‘medium’ category and thus, basically, keep GSP preferences forever.</p>
<p class="contents">These problems are acknowledged by the United Nations itself. They would render the Human Development Index inadequate for the GSP and enhance the risk of a WTO challenge. The Human Development Index is a good index to establish a long-term picture of social development, but it is ill-suited to the short-term analysis of export needs which the GSP requires.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards transition periods, I would like to say that these were the subject of negotiations between Council, Parliament and the Commission up to a few weeks ago, and I am satisfied with the compromise achieved. A number of countries no longer receiving GSP benefits are in free trade negotiations with us. We look forward to their conclusion and recall the EU commitment to assist, pending WTO membership, and to support development as per EU development policy – a debate we will come to later on. Finally, I would like to thank all colleagues for their comments and I look forward to the vote on the GSP tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not surprised that there are certain Members who think that things have progressed too quickly. I do not see this as an indication that the result is bad, however. On the contrary, we have a very broad majority in favour of this compromise here in Parliament, and we have discussed this issue for several years.</p>
<p class="contents">Just because someone does not agree with everything, it does not mean that he or she should be able to defer the process and say that we should negotiate until every Member of this Parliament supports the compromise. We have a good compromise, and I think we should safeguard it. The important question that has been discussed most here today is, of course, what criterion we should apply in order to determine whether or not a country can be included in the scheme of generalised tariff preferences.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not want a situation in which everyone chooses a criterion that suits their particular favourite country. It is easy to sit in a country and say that I want this particular country to be included and therefore I choose this particular criterion. Instead, we tried to find something that is clear and fair and, above all, that will stand up to the scrutiny of the World Trade Organisation. That is what we have done.</p>
<p class="contents">The element that I think most Members here should, in fact, be extremely proud of is the question of ‘everything but arms’, which gives the poor countries of the world free access to the EU’s market. I have discussed this with representatives from the US and they say that it is a splendid idea and they also want ‘everything but arms’ … and sugar and cocoa and coffee and cotton and bananas.</p>
<p class="contents">This is something that Europe is doing and it demonstrates leadership. I think we should continue to try to get the rest of the world to support it. I am proud of the agreement. It provides an efficient, predictable and transparent trading system. We did not use these times of crisis as a reason to be less generous, but rather to be more generous towards the poorest people of the world. That is the result of this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current regulation, however, essentially covers all non-European countries other than the developed member countries of the OECD. Among the countries covered, there are several that have more competitive economies than the EU or are granting their own export companies subsidies contrary to WTO rules. In several cases, the competitive advantage is due to subsidised energy prices, which promotes increased CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions. In the meantime, the EU is imposing considerable additional costs on companies in order to reach its climate protection goals. These unjustified preferences violate not only the interests of European employees and European industry, but also of states that are truly in need, as their less competitive products are driven out of the market. The new system will terminate, after a transitional period, the preferential treatment of certain highly competitive Asian countries, such as China and Thailand. This is something that I have already demanded on several occasions. I welcome the Commission’s proposal that more competitive or wealthier countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia or Brazil, should not be granted preferential customs tariffs. The new system will cut down the number of countries given preferential treatment by more than half, namely from 176 to about 80. This will be more useful in ensuring that it is indeed developing countries in need that can enjoy preferential access to the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
