<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Menrad (PPE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Parliament originally gave me the job of preparing a report on the proposed Guidelines for Member States’ Employment Policies 2000. The wide-ranging debate and the many suggestions raised in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on employment policy in general encouraged me to divide my draft report in two, with conclusions and a legislative part concentrating on the proposals for guidelines for the year 2000, which the Council of Ministers must adopt in December 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Parliament we should try to focus on the essentials, so that the Council’s response is not “less would be more”. On the day after the vote was taken in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Council also formally asked Parliament for an opinion. A simple consultation was therefore necessary. This means that legislative amendments may only be adopted without general conclusions. So for procedural reasons it became necessary to present two reports today, one on the Guidelines for Member States’ Employment Policies 2000 and on establishing an Employment Committee, and the other on the 1999 Joint Employment Report, which contains the conclusions adopted in committee. This second report begins with a positive message. The Community created 1.8 million additional jobs in 1998 by means of its employment-policy initiatives. However, youth and long-term unemployment are still at an unacceptably high level in most Member States, and, in any case, every single unemployed person is one too many.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to look at the conclusions in detail now, but bearing in mind the debate at yesterday’s sitting on the macroeconomic dialogue, I would like to make one point: the European Parliament needs to be more closely involved in preparing and implementing the European Employment Pact. We regret that at the Cologne Summit the word “Parliament” was not mentioned in the paper on employment. That is really not on! We represent the public and are therefore the most important institution of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities are attached to this second report on today’s agenda. Both opinions significantly enhanced the work of the Employment Committee. I would like to thank the draftspersons of the opinions, Mrs Theorin and Mr Grosch, for their excellent work. Many of their suggestions have found their way into both Employment Committee reports,<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>but in order to keep things tight, we have had to make a selection. This means that the chances of their being accepted by the Council of Ministers are greater.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities worked very hard on the employment-policy guidelines, and we are now looking at the legislative section, that is at the first report on today’s agenda. It in turn consists of two parts, the first on the proposal for a Council decision establishing the Employment Committee, and the second on the Commission’s proposal for Guidelines for Member States’ Employment Policies 2000. The Employment Committee is intended to play a consultative role in assisting the Member States’ coordination of employment and labour market policy. I have already mentioned the thrust of my report on the employment-policy guidelines: to concentrate on the essentials. It would be wrong to increase the number of guidelines any further. Instead, I would like to see practical implementation and verifiability of the guidelines and of the national action plans, based on concrete criteria. Simply increasing the number of guidelines will not create one single job. Quality not quantity should be the motto of modern employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to combating long-term and youth unemployment, effective and continued participation in the labour market can be achieved by switching from passive to active measures. Specifically, the percentage of the unemployed offered initial and further training or retraining is to be increased. We are seeking a target of 25% instead of the 20% in the Commission’s proposal. We need the most modern vocational training available. In this case, the existing guidelines need to be adjusted to the changing requirements of the labour market, especially as regards equipping schools with computers and Internet access. We need to pay special attention to female pupils and students here.</p>
<p class="contents">A second requirement is access to the capital market, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, which create the bulk of new jobs through innovation. Promoting voluntary share ownership models for employees in conjunction with a clear reduction in administrative effort and a determined attack on the black economy could give a boost to job creation. Non-wage labour costs need to be lowered, because they have a direct impact on the competitiveness of medium-sized companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Existing or new models for taxes on energy consumption should, however, be checked to see whether they are appropriate for maintaining balanced social security systems in the long run. Another means of combating unemployment named in the report is greater flexibility on the part of companies, which involves ensuring that they are provided with information and consulted at the appropriate time, thus enabling them to adapt to change. One way of achieving this is through minimum standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Flexibility is also needed in working hours. We need intelligent labour models, such as the “breathing factory” concept, in which working time is adjusted in line with the level of activity. Working time is generally – but not always – reduced, instead of introducing a unilateral reduction in working hours without cuts in payment. That is no way to create new jobs, it just puts existing ones at risk. In the Commission’s draft, the four pillars of the guidelines are kept intact. The fourth pillar becomes the most important. It involves strengthening measures to promote equal opportunities for men and women. Coordination of European employment policy, especially by means of the employment-policy guidelines, should lead to a longer-term strategy of tapping the potential in society for creativity, innovation, entrepreneurialism, willingness to invest and a “can-do” attitude. Reforms aimed at promoting dynamic competition and flexibility need to be coordinated with the need to maintain but also modernise the social security system. That is how I see the European model. On that note, I ask you to vote for these two reports.</p>

And by the same token I would like to thank the administration for their support, as this is an important subject, because despite the continuing high level of unemployment, unemployment and employment policy is generally not accorded the position it deserves here in the European Parliament and at European level. That is both my own view and the view of the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we so reluctant, when it is perfectly simple to express this issue in terms of quantifiable defined employment policy objectives, in training at least. This kind of action would at least have the effect of forcing the Member States to utilise all the resources at their disposal to reduce unemployment. And as we are actually talking about consolidating the guidelines here, continuity of the employment-policy guidelines is a good approach. But efficient, performance-oriented action is only possible if these guidelines reflect an assessment of results achieved. In that way, the process of drawing up the guidelines could take account of a comparison of the best methods found in the individual Member States, so that successful strategies could be applied throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context it is also important, as Mr Menrad has already just indicated, to have access to reliable quantitative data as a basis for comparison and trend analysis. There is no miracle cure that will make unemployment disappear overnight. It is more likely that a combination of different options and factors will be successful. As I see it, alongside training one important option is a targeted reduction in charges in areas which have been shown to create jobs. SMEs can play a key role here, as they make an important contribution to job creation and generally have enormous development potential, which must be promoted by creating optimum conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst these conditions are a simplification of administrative procedures and specific improvement of access to information sources and research programmes. The services sector is above all widely recognised as the sector with the greatest potential for job creation. The employment guidelines should be an incentive for Member States to create jobs. But they should not degenerate into political <span class="italic">dirigisme</span> with companies subject to greater burdens than they can tolerate. Instead, the objective of the guidelines should be to induce Member States to adopt a proactive employment policy creating an ideal framework for businesses. With that in mind, we in any case hope that we will increase the potential to create jobs, with less subsidised public sector jobs. The opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is short and to the point, because we thought that was what was expected of us in this case. We did not see it as being our role to produce an expert report, or to recite a political creed, but rather to provide the Member States with reliable, correct and simple guidelines and make a contribution in that way.</p>

So far, the results have been meagre. A very limited number of measures concerning equality have been introduced. Few (albeit some) budget resources have been made use of, and few quantitative objectives have been established. European women earn, on average, 76 per cent of men’s hourly wages, and their employment rate is approximately 20 per cent lower than men’s.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough to make sweeping commitments concerning equality under the fourth pillar in the employment guidelines. What, instead, is required are clear references under all four pillars. The opinion I have formulated on the report will ensure that a concern with equality permeates the employment guidelines for the year 2000. Most of the proposals which I and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities have submitted have already been adopted by the Committee, but a small number of central proposals were not adopted, namely Amendment Nos 37, 38 and 39. These are now being submitted by a number of groups. These proposals require the Member States to undertake to achieve a balance between women and men in any decision making, to ensure that there are as many female as male candidates for committees and working parties within the EU, to improve labour market legislation so that it reflects women’s needs and problems, and to ensure – not least – that those who draw up the guidelines for national employment policies are trained in such a way that they might more effectively integrate a concern with equality into their work. Finally, annual quantifiable objectives are to be introduced in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">My opinion is entirely in line with the Amsterdam Treaty which attaches much more importance to equality than did the Treaty of Maastricht and the Treaty of Rome. Above all, the Amsterdam Treaty describes the achievement of equality between women and men as one of the EU’s central tasks. Discrimination against women in the labour market is not only non-productive but prevents the development of women as individuals, of women as a group and of society as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He managed to complete an extremely difficult report and a highly important task under adverse circumstances. I believe that the report as it stands now is basically sound. There is, of course, always room for minor improvements. But this, of course, also holds true for what the Commission submitted to us. I would like to make two observations in this context, not so much regarding the Menrad report but regarding the report issued by the Commission itself. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I very much approve of the Commission rating the Member States. I know that Member States sometimes have difficulty taking the feedback on board but it is very important that this is done, because this spurs them on to achieve greater things than if there were no assessment. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I do feel that there is something missing from the Commission report, namely the demographic aspect. This aspect can be split into two components. The first is demography in the actual sense of the word and the second is the impact migration and emigration have on the labour market. Although there are statistics available for this, which are, in fact, also prepared by the Commission, these guidelines fail to take adequate account of them. I would actually like to ask the Commission to reconsider this in future because this is such an important issue. </p>
<p class="contents">Then we had a long chat about the amendments in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. There were dozens and dozens of amendments, a large number of which have been resolved. I regret that these amendments have nevertheless been resubmitted, especially since those submitting the amendments largely agreed on the Menrad report. </p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I am bound to say, when I hear my predecessor, Mrs Theorin, that I happen to know that the rapporteur has made every effort to incorporate as many amendments as possible, but it is no longer the case that all amendments as proposed, even if the same idea is repeated two or three times over, should all be included in a report. We now have slightly different proportions of majority in this new Parliament. It is unacceptable that if the socialist group feels that certain amendments need to be incorporated that these should be automatically included in each and every report. We should take a vote on it in that case. Quite frankly, the way the negotiations have been conducted, especially by Mrs Theorin, has caused some resentment and unnecessary friction with regard to this report. I hope that this will no longer be the case in future so that it will be easier to reach the intrinsically sound outcome of the Menrad report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Lancker (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission’s Joint Employment Report clearly shows that the European employment strategy is slowly paying off. Good progress has been made especially in cases where the Member States have reached clear-cut and common agreements. But there is certainly no cause for resting on our laurels for the time being. There are still too many long-term unemployed with no real prospect of finding jobs. Women and the elderly often do not fare well in that same job market. Jobs are still badly distributed and investment into services is still very much lacking for example. </p>
<p class="contents">What is more, there are alarming signs that the process which has been in place since Luxembourg is now grinding to a halt due to a lack of European convergence strategy. Not all Member States have expressed the same enthusiasm to continue with this process. We were therefore disappointed, Commissioner, to see how the proposals with regard to the new employment guidelines 2000 put forward by the previous Commission were lacking in ambition. There has been no added pressure in this respect but perhaps we need it.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is not asking for new guidelines either. What we do need is to add substance by setting clear goals in the existing guidelines. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the rapporteur for his cooperation. It was hard work. We had to work fast but I should add that I regret that my group failed to reach agreement on a number of our high-priority points within the Committee and that we have therefore decided, Mr Pronk, to resubmit these amendments as we consider them to be essential. I think my group is entitled to this. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point a few things out. Firstly, under no circumstances should we restrict the European employment strategy to mere following-up of what is happening within the employment policy at national level. As far as we are concerned, the European Union should take the matter into its own hands and push for change. This is why we would like to see greater substance added to the employment guidelines by setting specific, measurable benchmarks at European level. We noticed that a great deal of progress has been made in cases where the Member States had agreed on joint benchmarks, for example with regard to the integration of the young unemployed. Consequently, my group would propose three new European objectives for the next couple of years. </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it seems important to us that we should reach an employment level of 65%. This was the gist of Jacques Delors’ White Paper and it was, in fact, also the text of the previous Commission in 1997 before the Committee on Censorship apparently took action. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we would also welcome benchmarks for the long-term unemployed and for halving the gender divide. Both long-term unemployment and the gender divide between men and women should be halved within the next five years. </p>
<p class="contents">A third important remark regarding our employment strategy is that we should be careful not to fall into the American trap where work and social security are played off against one another. We are therefore hoping to create a link within the employment guidelines between creating new chances for the unemployed and new jobs on the one hand and the quality of those jobs and social protection on the other. As is the case with European Economic and Monetary Union and, in fact, as is now the case with employment, we are of the opinion that the Member States should be guided by the three most successful Member States. So in actual fact we would like a social convergence strategy in addition to the employment strategy. In so doing, we would like to make the fight against poverty our priority. I have to say, it strikes me as almost incredible that this proposal to set up a Luxembourg process for social security has also been rejected by members of the PPE in the Committee, especially in view of the fact that it formed the very core of the Pronk report which we voted on in the previous Parliament. In my opinion, those who take the employment and social security issues seriously should perhaps finally take a stance on the matter. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament got involved in the process exceptionally late this year. This was on account of the elections and the appointment of the new Commission. But still, we have made some progress because, as the rapporteur has already pointed out, this year the Council officially asked us for advice for the very first time. I urge us not to miss this opportunity of reinforcing the European employment guidelines and at the same of setting up a process of securing quality jobs and good social protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party find therefore, that, with the employment package, a good solution has been found to the problem of how we combine the principle of subsidiarity with a desire to ensure that employment policy is properly coordinated. The Member States’ reports on how they are complying with the guidelines do not simply explain how the various countries are managing individually and in relation to the others but are also a source of mutual inspiration through which countries can learn about each other’s successes. However, precisely how employment policy is put into practice is entirely a matter for the individual Member States. A good deal of policymaking in the areas of employment and the labour market belongs at local level. </p>
<p class="contents">What is more, success in employment policy is crucial to sound development in the public finances, and it is reasonable to see the employment package and macroeconomic cooperation in an EU context. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is not, however, in favour of the employment guidelines’ containing demands that the various countries organise their employment initiatives in accordance with a specific template and in terms of heavy-handed numerical objectives. The individual countries themselves should decide upon the priorities for their employment policies and, in this context, we in the Group of the Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party feel free to take pleasure in the fact that a liberal employment policy which is particularly concerned with securing the correct incentives in taxation and social policy has been proceeded with in most Member States in recent years. </p>
<p class="contents">In the EU countries, cooperation between parties in the labour market – in other words, the social dialogue – follows very different models characterised by different traditions and cultures. This process is to be respected. And it must also be ensured that the dialogue between governments and the social partners in the labour market does not overshadow the democratic process in the national parliaments and the EU Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">I want finally to say that, in its report on employment, the Commission has made recommendations to the individual countries. That is not unproblematic, and it is very important that the Commission should openly describe the assumptions on which it is making its recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Flautre (Greens/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the European Union’s employment strategy states that the fight against unemployment is being taken into consideration in European-level policy. This is desirable in itself. It is realistic. For the broad guidelines of economic and monetary policy have a real impact on employment at European level. And it is desirable if we wish to curb the sort of competition which is based on reducing social aspects to the lowest bid and also the growth of inequality between regions and between social groups within the economic Union. European employment strategy, however, in the form in which it has been laid down, has been progressively implemented since the Luxembourg Summit and is characterised by dubious ideological foundations and a not particularly dynamic conception of institutional practices.</p>
<p class="contents">To hear some people speak, you might wonder why we even need a policy on employment. Yesterday’s debate on macroeconomic dialogue showed this: you might think that a policy of monetary stability would be sufficient. No one has yet proved the validity of the premise that it would be enough to guarantee monetary stability and overall competitiveness for employment to follow. Our last debate in Strasbourg on the subject of Michelin and the restructuring of firms was an opportunity for us to develop our doubts on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Once it has been said that European economic policy should have employment as its goal, once this is laid down in law and is proclaimed loud and clear, without ever checking the validity of the affirmation in a realistic and pragmatic way, then the subordination of the social to the economic is being written in the stone of the Treaties, finally reducing the social aspect to the task of managing each and every one of us in our competition for a place in a labour market which is getting tighter and tighter. The result of this economics-based, minimalist approach is that any debate on the means of creating jobs, running counter to this liberally inspired dogma, is ruled out, virtually prohibited. Is it conceivable that out of twenty-two guidelines on employment, there is not a single one on the effective reduction of working hours. Not one is on public investment. And even the mention of active support for local initiatives on employment is limited and any attempts to examine the quality and sustainability of jobs created are eliminated. We have to deal with the figures. It is essential to bring about a reduction in the number of registered unemployed in a Europe where the number of men and women living below the poverty line is itself not getting any less.</p>
<p class="contents">Before mentioning the proposals of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, let me express one fear. Some circles in Europe appear to be overcome by a feeling of blind optimism, with their eyes riveted on the upturn in growth and only the officially recorded and registered unemployment figures. A considerable number of political leaders seem to forget that many of the jobs created are temporary, part-time jobs, are not chosen, are generally forced on women, and do not always afford the people employed in this way wages which take them above the poverty threshold. If we do not seriously evaluate the sustainable and qualitative nature of growth, there is a risk that we will underestimate the efforts which still need to be made in order finally to give the construction of Europe a social aspect. This is why we think it imperative to evaluate the success or failure of European employment strategy against the yardstick of the indicators measuring concomitantly the numbers of registered unemployed, standards of living and the quality of jobs created. It is only when we increase job security and reduce unemployment that we can see the European Union as representing real progress for its residents in terms of civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Greens are concerned, the selection of an ambitious European employment strategy should instigate a number of actions, most of which are currently ignored by the guidelines proposed by the Commission. The commitments undertaken in favour of the young unemployed and the long-term unemployed must be implemented at a faster rate, it is true. Job creation must be promoted by combining a number of policies supporting the development of sustainable activities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fundamental that local employment initiatives are favoured, that the cooperative, mutual and non-profit sector is supported by being guaranteed a status, that the third sector is truly recognised, including by means of public financing, this form of economy emerging between the traditional public sector and the profit sector, based on the creation of socially useful activities. Broad consultations and public debate must be undertaken in order to decide upon major public works: public transport networks, energy saving programmes, renovation and construction of housing, projects which create a great number of jobs and which benefit everyone’s quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, working hours must be reduced, that taboo subject, which we are not allowed to discuss in Europe. We must find the resources to specifically evaluate the initiatives to reduce working hours which are being implemented in any case, in an equitable or inequitable manner, more or less across the whole of Europe. And to make real progress, we must really bank on the intelligence of the community. It is essential to implement a policy whereby community projects and unemployed people’s associations are acknowledged. It is necessary, at the very least, to preserve their rights to allowances and grants in full. We urge that you give your enthusiastic support to two amendments contributing towards this, numbers 30 and 31, on which I shall ask the presidency for voting by roll call.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, institutional practice must be changed so that we really bank on democratic debate and the commitment of all the parties involved. We must find legal bases at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference for the whole chapter of social and civil dialogue.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if it is macroeconomic policy which is the most important factor, an active policy concerning the labour market is also very necessary. The labour market can no more chart its own course than any other complex systems can, but must instead be regulated and given direction. It is just a question of how this is to be done. </p>
<p class="contents">In fact, labour markets in Europe all look very different from each other, and the conditions which need to be present before they can be directed and regulated vary from one market to the next. In certain countries, levels of trade union membership are high. There, the social partners in the labour market can themselves play the main role. In other countries, it is the State and the employment agencies which play the main role. Where future labour markets too are concerned, we must perhaps consider strengthening the rights of individual employees. </p>
<p class="contents">When the Commission and the Council now set about devising employment plans and guidelines, these national differences must be taken account of. You can have common objectives, but the way of achieving these has to vary depending upon national and regional circumstances. What is most important is that the actors at national, regional and local levels want to be involved in a constructive way. There should not be any commands coming from Brussels. Instead, we must listen to the actors in the market and develop a dialogue. I therefore think it is a good thing that the Commission has now seriously begun to emphasise the importance of local job creation. I was very pleased to see that one of the main topics in the so-called employment week conference which is now going on in parallel with our own discussions is precisely the importance of local initiatives. This, then, is one of the main themes at this conference. </p>
<p class="contents">Whether or not the Luxembourg process functions effectively will depend in fact upon cooperation between local, regional, national and European actors. Where this is concerned, I think that the planning and the tools need to be improved. The Menrad report is a good step in that direction, even though I think that it largely accepts the existing form of planning. In the future, we in Parliament must be bolder with our proposals and initiatives. Personally, I think that the convergence philosophy ought to be replaced by an interest in variation, diversity, experiment and the mobilisation of local resources. Workers should not be regarded as an abstract labour force but as active participants who are to be supported and strengthened by the planning process. That is, in fact, much more important than individual detailed formulations in the written guidelines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hyland (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, the enactment of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May 1999 has certainly ensured that greater attention is given to the implementation of a common employment policy. The central aspect to the implementation of new employment must be a need to guarantee a fair distribution of job opportunities throughout each Member State through the process of regionalisation and decentralisation. This is only correct and proper in the light of the fact that 11 countries out of the 15 are participating within a common, single European currency regime. This also takes into consideration the fact that within the workings of an internal market there are still many social problems which exist in both urban and rural parts of Europe and certainly in my own country, Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Unemployment is falling within the European Union and in Ireland it stands at a little over 6% of the population. However, those people without skills seeking to integrate into the workplace have little or no chance of taking up remunerative and rewarding employment unless they learn a new trade or a different work practice. National Member State governments must also take into account the provisions of the new European Social Fund regulations. These regulations in essence will ensure that Member States support programmes that take account of the changing nature of work practices, the need to promote entrepreneurship, as well as supporting local job creation programmes. This latter point is of particular importance to me and my constituents in the Province of Leinster. Local job creation initiatives must be supported by national and European Member States. Local communities, from the private, public and voluntary sectors must be allowed to pool their collective talents in an effort to create employment within the small and medium-sized enterprise sector in their respective areas. That is why I supported the LEADER initiative both now and in the past and why I support the new EU EQUAL job creation programme. This is also part of the process of decentralising the implementation of EU and national job creation initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and national Member States must implement programmes which take account of the ever-changing nature of employment, both in urban and rural areas. This also means that we must address existing difficulties which act as an entry point for men, and particularly women, to take up jobs in the workplace, most particularly so in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">One such problem relates to the need to provide greater childcare facilities for women who take up jobs in rural parts of my country and indeed, throughout Europe. From an Irish perspective I fully welcome the recent publication by the government of its White Paper on rural development. The government fully recognises that a strategic programme must be put in place if more jobs are to be created within the small and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural parts of Ireland. An intrinsic element of this relates to the need to put in place more expansive childcare facilities heretofore which simply have not been in existence. The lack of childcare facilities is a very real and fundamental barrier to women taking up employment in the workplace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And this should remain so. Indeed, the serious problem of unemployment justifies an approach which creates optimum impact. As such, the policy will need to focus on the local or regional job market. </p>
<p class="contents">This approach requires the guidelines to be broadly-based so as to give the Member States sufficient free rein in terms of policy. The Commission’s plans to monitor the policy efforts and policy results at national level more closely are well-intended but will probably have the opposite effect, especially if this is done by means of a quantitative approach: counting the number of measures, aid schemes and employment projects. Adding the numbers up in this way tells us nothing about the extent, quality and inventiveness of the policy measures. Peer pressure amongst the Member States is better addressed by consultation on matters of content, exchange of good practices and focused recommendations which are really what the Member States need. </p>
<p class="contents">Could the representative of the Council explain how the guidelines fit in with other EU policy. Just before the summer, the Council turned down a regulation to increase the tax burden with regard to energy and to decrease that with regard to employment. However, recommendation no 14 in the present guidelines recommends this very thing to the Member States. Why do we have this conflicting approach? </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the insistence on a more family-friendly policy in view of the individualistic tendencies which seem to pervade our modern society. At the same time, I fear that as long as our culture adopts the idea that you only count as a human being if you have a paid job, we will be left fighting a running battle. The emphasis on economisation within society and the introduction of market forces into virtually all social fields, in particular, have a family-unfriendly impact and put humanity under pressure. I would ask the European Commission and Member States to undertake a radical overhaul of their policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Often the establishment of committees is, in reality, a solution which is adopted in order to avoid addressing a problem, or when the ability, the power or the legal basis needed to address the problem is lacking. I think that this in reality, the first issue we must address is who must decide on employment policies. We have already said that the European Parliament was almost totally excluded in Cologne. I think that at least, given that employment policies at European level are already policies that make suggestions, recommendations and push for coordination between the Member States – so there is no actual concrete, decision-making power, which, all things considered, I believe to be positive for the subsidiarity principle, although it is a somewhat limited power – Parliament should be fully involved. However, a committee, an apolitical committee runs the risk of being a clearing house where there is the attempt to take the drama out of debates, to find alternative policies in the name of consensus, which is, of course, neutral and non-political, and which I do not think we can find when it comes to employment. </p>
<p class="contents">The system of committees, conciliation and social dialogue must not become a substitute for parliamentary prerogatives. It must not become a substitute at European level, but obviously it must not become a substitute at national level either, because when we have social dialogue – which, in reality consists of dialogue between the large workers’ unions, often in the more traditional sectors of the economy, and big business – it is often dialogue, cooperation and conciliation which result in the exclusion of those who today remain on the fringes of European economic systems, meaning the unemployed, immigrants and prisoners, and keep all those who are outside the system of guaranteed work outside the insiders’ system. And, in fact, there is something very important missing in the guidelines on employment policies, and that is immigration. In reality we, like the European Union and the Member States, should find the courage to request and promote the entry of hundreds of thousands of people from outside the European Union, as this is the only way that we can fill the jobs with the highest staff turnover rates, because training the manpower, the current workforce in the European Union, is not enough. A bold, active employment and immigration policy is what is needed to boost employment in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
