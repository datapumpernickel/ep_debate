<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bourlanges (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I do not think that anyone can dispute the fact that the European Union’s system of legislative acts is incredibly complicated, lacking in transparency, incomprehensible to the general public and sometimes even difficult for us to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">This complexity can certainly be explained and justified. It is not easy to have a legal system that has overall responsibility for the other legal systems – of 15 States at the moment, of 25 States in the future – which are fundamentally different. Undoubtedly, the European Union also has to deal both with conventional problems relating to the hierarchy of legislation which arise within each of our Member States – the Constitution, laws, implementing regulations, individual decisions – and with problems specific to the Union relating to the ever-delicate relationship between the powers of the Union and those of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, therefore, a justifiable complexity and we shall never have a wholly simple system. That said, there is also a completely unjustifiable complexity in this matter. We are experiencing legislative chaos, procedural chaos and linguistic chaos. Legislative chaos when we see that decisions which are by nature fundamentally different are adopted for example in the same framework, namely the constitutional framework. There are provisions relating to policies and others relating to the institutions. We also have a decision of a budgetary nature – on resources – taken in a virtually constitutional framework. On the other hand, since there is no clear distinction between the area of general legislative measures and that of regulatory measures, there are implementing measures which are adopted in the framework of the law and there are measures of a general nature which are adopted in the framework of implementing regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we are certainly experiencing linguistic chaos, since every effort is made to avoid giving a name to what we are doing. We adopt laws, but we take care not to describe them as laws. We use the term decision, in other words something which comes from the depths of the hierarchy, to describe both individual measures and measures of a constitutional nature.</p>
<p class="contents">No one understands anything. Added to that is the problem of pillars and the fact that, absurdly, and I struggle to understand why, we decided that it was possible, that it was even necessary, given the sensitive nature of some of the decisions to be taken, for example decisions relating to fundamental rights in criminal matters, to have recourse to procedures that are less democratic – not involving the European Parliament – less effective and which could be adopted unanimously. They would also be less legally certain without the backing of the Court of Justice for their adoption. Make of that what you can.</p>
<p class="contents">Why must something which directly concerns fundamental rights not benefit from the guarantees and procedures applied to legislative acts established elsewhere?</p>
<p class="contents">The report proposes to sort all this out and to apply a simple principle: one act, one procedure, one description, one name. We therefore propose to arrange this into three main blocs: the constitutional bloc, which will be divided into – I think that this is the opinion of the Convention as well – two parts: Part A, which includes everything that is strictly constitutional, namely the values, principles, objectives, institutions and procedures which enable the Union to operate, and then Part B, which will include the main political principles currently contained in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The question in terms of this bloc is whether to develop the ratification procedures. Your rapporteur put forward proposals, not all of which were supported by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but it is clear that we must develop them if we want to avoid 25 States rejecting the possibility of developing this legislation outright.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a legislative bloc. A legislative bloc is simple. We must call a law a law, and we are obviously proposing to make a distinction between organic laws, which would be rather formal laws that are subject to a specific procedure, framework laws, which would replace directives, and ordinary laws, which would replace legislative regulations, and then to make a distinction between laws on financial and budgetary issues, which would, obviously, deal with financial and budgetary matters. Let us call all of these laws, however, because they are laws. And above all, let us state very clearly that what characterises a law is codecision, and that codecision must become the only decision-making procedure for the whole legislative bloc. There are, of course, specific applications, particularly in financial matters, but this is the path we must take.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and last element is the implementing bloc, in other words the implementing regulations. In this respect, we must apply three simple principles. First of all, we must take on board the fact that, from now on, the legislative authority is not just the Council, but is, in fact, the Council and Parliament acting in accordance with the codecision procedure. The powers that are currently bestowed upon the Council, particularly under Article 202, must therefore be exercised by both arms of the legislative authority. Moreover, we must admit that we cannot regulate with 25 Member States in the same way as we have up to now. We need to share more work between a legislative authority which authorises and supervises and an executive authority which adopts implementing regulations and which, in our view, must be the Commission. Clearly, this will happen, subject to a call-back procedure enabling both arms of the legislative authority to ascertain the conformity of regulations with the statutory provisions on which these regulations are based.</p>
<p class="contents">These, therefore, are the main points. There are, of course, many other things to say about this report, but we believe that if we were to introduce this major distinction between a constitutional bloc, a legislative bloc governed by codecision and an implementing bloc which would put an end to comitology procedures at least as far as consultation is concerned as the Commission desires and which would replace comitology with a genuine monitoring by the two arms of the legislative authority, then we would gain in transparency, democracy and effectiveness, and perhaps some people in Europe would, at last, begin to understand what we are doing! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a difficult subject. As Mr Amato said, there is nothing quite as complex as simplification. In trying to address the issue of simplifying our hierarchy of acts in the European Union, Mr Bourlanges has taken a very complex, difficult subject and tried to bring a certain rationality to it.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we support his dual approach of, firstly, trying to rationalise the hierarchy by broadly defining three categories of acts: constitutional acts, legislative acts and implementing measures. There are obviously subcategories – we cannot simplify too much, unfortunately – but nonetheless there are these three main groupings. The other prong of his approach concerns the terminology or vocabulary, for instance regulations should in future be called 'laws' and directives in future should be called 'framework laws'. That seems sensible and would make our acts much more comprehensible to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I come to a point which is of particular importance, and which Mr Bourlanges touched on towards the end of his comments. It is this category of implementing act where we delegate the right to adopt certain types of act to the Commission. There is already a problem of terminology about what we call these acts, but nonetheless when we, as Parliament, and the Council, as a legislative authority, delegate powers to the Commission, currently exercised in the context of the comitology system, we need some fundamental change, some further steps forward on what has been agreed so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bourlanges has indicated what we agreed in the committee, indeed amending his own original draft report, but coming to a text which will have a broad majority in this Parliament. The position we agreed was that yes, we as a Parliament, are willing – with the Council – to delegate such implementing powers, provided that we have the opportunity to call them back where necessary. It is not that we want to immerse ourselves in all the technical details of implementing measures. It is not that we want to substitute ourselves for the executive, but we need the guarantee that we can call back the powers if we do not like the way they are being exercised by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We have proposed that if either the Council by a qualified majority, or Parliament by a majority of its Members – in other words, not a narrow majority on a Thursday afternoon of 29 to 36 – decides to call back an implementing measure, then the Commission must either withdraw the measure, or their original measure will be subject to the full legislative procedure under codecision to confirm, amend or repeal the act in question.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a simple system, one that would enable us to delegate far more than we do now, but it will also ensure democracy and transparency. I commend it to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a report which will be of great interest to the Convention, which is itself studying these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary achievements are: firstly, to make a clearer distinction between legislative and executive acts; secondly, to rationalise the choice of the instruments available so that force will more clearly follow form and, thirdly, to bring in a clearer class of subordinate legislation which should contribute not only to the quality of primary legislation but also to the parliamentary scrutiny of what is passed.</p>
<p class="contents">My main amendment on behalf of my group seeks to insist upon a separate amendment procedure for the second part of the Constitutional Treaty. It is essential that the policy chapters are susceptible to a softer form of revision than the existing unanimity, plus national ratification in all Member States. If we fail to bring in such a softer procedure, it may never be possible to alter the political chapters. If the Union insists on the same procedure for the first and second parts, what is the point of splitting the Treaty in the first place?</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE and PSE Groups used to support the lighter procedure and I trust that their spokesmen will be able to enlighten us as to why they now seem to have changed their minds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that this is a matter of great urgency, as, at the end of the day, the public want to understand Europe, and it is intended that Europe should become more readily understood. I am sure that, in the course of its discussions on shaping the actual content of the Constitutional Treaty, the Convention will give a great deal of attention to the issue of the typology and hierarchy of acts.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards this report, there are just three critical observations that I want to make. The report describes a hierarchy of five types of act in the European Union: constitution, organic laws, agreements in international law, laws, framework laws and their implementing regulations. Paragraph 1 sets out this five-type hierarchy in terms of three principles, something that I find rather confusing and hardly likely to simplify matters, but the public will perhaps forgive us for it.</p>
<p class="contents">They will be less inclined to forgive us if we put before them what are manifestly tax-raising powers for the European Union without actually calling them that. In paragraph 6, the own resources decision is described as being an organic law. The procedure for enacting organic laws is set out in paragraph 9, according to which it is envisaged that the own resources decision would no longer need to be ratified by the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">We could have a tremendous argument about the introduction of tax-raising powers for the European Union, but I do not believe that it is acceptable, even with the best will in the world, for it to be simply decided on, along with much else, under the heading of ‘typology and hierarchy of acts’. That proposals to fundamentally change the European Union's confederal nature should be put forward under this heading and in this report, is something I regard as highly dubious.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 5 abandons the hitherto valid principle that the Member States are masters of the Treaties, the objective behind this being that their consent should no longer be required when powers are transferred in future. Instead, a qualified majority of Member States is to be sufficient. By its very nature, though, such a thing would be an empowerment to seize power at the European level, and I have serious doubts as to whether that is what is intended. I want to make it abundantly clear that German constitutional law would prevent consent being given to such a treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would sincerely like to thank him for this, not least in that his proposals contain a number of points which my group considers to be important and positive. I cannot say the same for all his proposals, however, so I will focus on those which we feel to be most problematic.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention is faced with the issue which the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice Intergovernmental Conferences before it were unable to resolve, in other words the question of the hierarchy of acts and the distinction between the legislative and the implementing regulatory functions, which needs to be expressed more clearly. This is, as it was intended to be, the scope of the Bourlanges report, but we feel that the report has exceeded its mandate in including more problematic issues which, in our opinion, should have been discussed in more depth by Parliament and which we certainly cannot accept as the last word on the matter. I would mention, in particular, the proposals Mr Bourlanges makes regarding the constitutional revision procedure, which we as a group cannot endorse. Indeed, we advocate the subdivision – described by the rapporteur – of the European Union’s normative system into three parts: the constitutional, the legislative and the regulatory. However, we feel that we cannot support the proposals he makes regarding the constitutional revision procedure because they are contradictory. We feel that it is not acceptable to stipulate the need for unanimous agreement by the Council and the representatives of the Member States and then say: ‘Oh alright then, not everyone has to sign’. We cannot have it both ways: either we accept the principle that it is possible to revise the Treaties even without the unanimous support of all the Member States or we do not. Clearly, we or, at least, the majority of the group, are firmly in favour of the former.</p>
<p class="contents">Another position which I feel it is important to stress concerns the legislative bloc. We feel that Article 308 should be amended because, as it stands – with adoption by a unanimous decision of the Council alone – it cannot possibly meet the need for flexibility in the definition of the competences of a 25-Member State Union. Furthermore, as regards the more specifically executive elements, we are opposed to the idea of a special organ or of specialised agencies with the task of monitoring the technical implementation of Community law. Our experience in this area has almost always been negative.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as regards the specific issue of comitology, I would just like to stress one point, namely the fact that the European Parliament and the Council are given a deadline of three months within which to make a decision. We feel that this is too long and that it would extend the implementing procedure unnecessarily. In any case, it has proved difficult to apply effectively. This is a question which we need to highlight and explore further, and I hope that this will not be Parliament’s final word on the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the Bourlanges report is both outstanding and technical, two qualities which are, more often than not, virtually impossible to combine in a single document. This is the first achievement on which the rapporteur is to be congratulated. Mr Bourlanges then pulls off a second achievement – but for this, he receives less hearty congratulations – which is to mislead us by skimming over the main points of his intentions. Ultimately, this report is based entirely on an implicit presupposition, namely the vision of a pyramid structure for Europe where the nations make up the pyramid’s base. It is the same pyramid structure for Europe which is condemned so vigorously by the Napolitano report, where there is a risk that the model will be applied to the regions and to the local authorities. </p>
<p class="contents">The top of the pyramid consists of a European Constitution, the report on which, shrewdly, does not say in so many words that nations would be subordinate. Quite the opposite in fact. Paragraph 4 even specifies that this would be an act governed by international law signed by the Member States, but it does not clarify the key point: the States would thus essentially be consenting to giving up their sovereignty, since the European Constitution would dominate the national constitutions and since, for example, it would impose decisions adopted by majority for all the so-called legislative acts. </p>
<p class="contents">This development favoured by the report points to a crucial problem. What happens when a decision adopted by majority at European level contradicts a national constitution or a fundamental principle to which a nation is particularly attached? The report says nothing about this, because, if it mentioned this subject, it would be obliged to acknowledge that it is now proposing that sovereignty be relinquished without any safety net. </p>
<p class="contents">We find this model of Europe unacceptable; and furthermore, in an enlarged and ever more diverse Europe, it would simply not be able to operate. In this sort of Europe, extending majority decisions could only work if, in return, the national parliaments’ right of veto were clearly recognised, as I explain in the minority opinion that I have annexed to the Bourlanges report. </p>
<p class="contents">More broadly speaking, the report uses simplification as a pretext for making proposals in favour of supranational unification. This is also the tried and tested method used within the Convention, which constantly tells us that unifying the treaties is more simple, the single legal personality is more simple, merging the pillars is more simple, extending the use of the codecision procedure is more simple, abolishing unanimity, including for the revision of the treaties, is more simple. It could all be summed up in a single slogan, which is itself unique: the super-State is more simple. </p>
<p class="contents">This solution does indeed seem more simple, but its major drawback must not be disguised either: it weakens democracy considerably. Admittedly, paragraph 1 of the Bourlanges report affirms that its proposals are based on a principle of ‘democratisation’. On reading the description provided however, one realises that this is what, in his speeches and in his draft constitution, President Prodi calls supranational democracy. To sum up, this means taking away powers from the national parliaments and giving them to the European Parliament, which forms the heart of the codecision procedure with majority decisions in the Council. Unfortunately, however, Mr President, this supranational democracy seems highly artificial, as the nations currently grant principle legitimacy to their national democracy. It is therefore nothing more than a trick which makes it possible to take the power away from the nations in order to harness more of it. </p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, our response to the Bourlanges report and to the Convention is that it is unacceptable to put forward technical considerations for simplification in order to dodge the debate on essential political questions. The current essential political question is that the nations are basically calling for a closer Europe, but we will not bring Europe closer by somewhat simplifying procedures that are by nature far removed from the nations and which deprive them of their powers. We will bring Europe closer quite simply by giving national parliaments the right to intervene directly in the European decision-making process. The rest is mere detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Bourlanges's report is, in my view, an extremely virtuoso piece of work and, I must say, as an individual, I admire it very much. However, it reflects a very different tradition of political thinking from that in my own country. After all, what he has done is to create a theoretical template into which the workings of the European institutions and, in particular, certain aspects of the relationship between the European Parliament and the other institutions should be inserted.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this is the wrong way around. Rather, the best solution to the matters and problems he raises is to decide on the particular procedures, processes and mechanisms needed to handle most effectively the particular issues concerned and then to define and describe the workings of the European Union in that way.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite regardless of the subject matter, some of which we Conservatives like and some of which we do not, we shall be voting against the report because we believe it looks at its subject matter the wrong way around – in a way that we believe is wrong for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, I joined this Parliament three and a half years ago with the firm intention of making Europe’s legislature more intelligible, more efficient and more democratic for our citizens, of helping to tear down the bureaucratic cathedrals and simplify administration. I have to say that, over three and a half years, we have, in this Parliament, discussed a whole raft of proposals. I would refer to the Kinnock reforms and the Lamassoure report on the clear distribution of roles between the four administrative layers of our European home, namely the European, national, regional and local levels. We are currently debating the Napolitano report, and are trying to get it endorsed here with a view to better anchoring down the foundation of our European home in the European constitution at both local and regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are discussing the Bourlanges report that officially addresses the hierarchy of acts. Originally, this report was rather complex and quite theoretical, too theoretical, in fact. However, we managed to sit down and have a proper talk, and we can be pleased with the outcome, because we managed to considerably reduce more than 30 types of decisions at European level, which easily outrival Gaudi's Sagrada Familia in terms of complexity, down to a clearer proposal. We are left with three blocs of legislation: a constitutional bloc with principles, a legislative bloc and an implementing bloc for implementing measures. I should like to say one thing. Although we are giving our unqualified support to Mr Bourlanges, we do not see eye to eye with him on one particular point. We do not want a few states to be deprived of their veto right, as it were, when we come to revise the Treaty. We cannot say to certain countries – the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France or whichever other country – that they are not allowed to participate in the revision of the Treaty. In this respect, I endorse the views of Mrs Kaufmann and Mrs Frassoni. We will therefore be voting against this particular point. We remain adamant that the Treaty should be unanimous and should be changed unanimously. This does, however, pertain to the constitutional bloc; as far as the other blocs are concerned, we naturally endorse the view that these should be simplified. This, however, does not apply to the constitutional part, as we would then end up with things being done on a very unequal basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And, as lawmaking has become not only a more involved process but also ever more complex, Members of this House are assumed to be incapable of mastering difficult technical problems. So the executive, wanting to be helpful, puts its rules in appendices or other forms of act, despite the fact that in some cases there are some really intricate political issues of decisive importance lurking in their depths.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this makes it right and proper to propose that a hierarchy of acts be used to create reliable forms of cooperation. Alongside primary legislation, we need secondary legislation; it is only when it comes to secondary legislation that we need, even more than the national parliaments – which already have it these days – the so-called callback procedure, as this House has no right of initiative with which to reverse the Commission's initiatives. I think it is to the committee's enormous credit that it has now also concurred with the view that both institutions, which are held in an institutional balance, must each have their own chance to withdraw a proposal. I think that really is of the utmost interest for democratic and transparent lawmaking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Well done, for I believe that, through your work, you have highlighted what will become one of the important subjects of the Convention. Well done too for succeeding in incorporating the question of terminology in your report. I believe that when Europeans try to explain to Europeans what the European Parliament does, it is best to use simple words. You urge us to do this. I imagine that the Convention will support this plan and this will be a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">You tell us you are aiming to simplify. Where Europe is concerned, I am wary of simplification, because I have learnt that complexity is not necessarily synonymous with complication and that we sometimes make things more complex when we seek to simplify them.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a point on which your report is absolutely essential in relation to the powers of the European Union, however; that is the question of the consequences of codecision on comitology. You call for Article 202 to be reformed. Both dimensions of Article 202 are absolutely essential: defining mandates and scrutinising their execution. With regard to powers, it is important for the powers of the Council and those of the European Parliament to be parallel. If the Council gives up some of its powers, we could give some up as well, and vice versa. That said, we must also take account of what is really happening, and I fear that the work that we have done in relation to your report does not bring us totally into line with what is really happening in terms of the changes to European legislation. You quite rightly referred to the mechanisms which are being established in connection to the Lamfalussy procedure, which we doubt the Council and the Commission would wish to extend to other areas, hence the importance of obtaining a genuine call-back procedure for Parliament. In addition, you also mentioned the question of coordination policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to touch upon one last aspect, which is self-regulation by market operators, and draw the attention of Members to a major risk that we are facing, namely of focusing our work and our deliberations on the legislative procedure, whereas in reality, legislation in Europe will, in the future, be drawn up using self-regulation, coordination and comitology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am in favour because he takes account of the long theoretical work that this Parliament has been developing since Maastricht, because this is a parliamentary <span class="italic">acquis</span> that must be included in the text of the Convention and lastly, because this work has resulted in clear instruments and effective decision-making procedures, which are crucial to the smooth functioning of the future Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Mr Bourlanges, in the text’s philosophical and theoretical subconscious – for example, in paragraph 5, second indent – we can discern a terrible distrust of the small and medium-sized States which makes me unwilling at the present time to adopt the report, for various and quite straightforward reasons. It is the differences between the large States on the major issues that have impeded the Union’s progress. It is not through any lack of will on the part of the small States that the United Kingdom has not signed up to the euro or to the Schengen area! And nor can the small States be held responsible for the absence of a Social Europe, the small size of the budget, the lack of reform of the CAP, the crisis in structural policy or the limitations of the judicial instruments of the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, then, where the size of States is concerned, recall the perennial response of the unforgettable chief of police in <span class="italic">Casablanca</span>, which was to ‘round up the usual suspects’! It is not square kilometres, longitudes, latitudes and <span class="italic">per capita</span> GDP that determine how important countries are to the common interest, the European interest! For this very reason, these criteria cannot be used to impose finalised constitutional solutions, leaving anyone who does not agree standing in the hallway, in other words, one step away from the door leading out.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps Mr Bourlanges, with his intelligence, knowledge and unswervingly pro-European attitude, should have explored this point further and fought harder to find a reasonable and consensual solution. I hope he will do this, at least by tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would nonetheless draw attention to two points about which I disagree. The first point concerns the procedure for revising the treaties. I completely agree that, against the background of the work in the Convention, it is clear that, in the future, we must use the Convention method for treaty amendments. That is something we have in any case learned from this process. I must nonetheless declare myself to be in complete disagreement with the rapporteur’s proposal with regard to changing the ratification procedure itself. I do not believe that it would be in keeping with the prevailing spirit of our Community if we were to take control of the EU’s development away from the Member States. I am in actual fact afraid that such a procedure would in itself stand in the way of development in this Europe of ours because people back home would be very sceptical about giving Europe more competences if, for example, they were not to feel that they were in control of what was going on. I think, therefore, that we have to recognise that Europe is founded upon its citizens and nations but that the sustaining, constituent units of our Union are the Member States and that this must naturally be reflected in our ratification procedure. We ought quite simply to stick to the procedure we have at present. The second point concerns the place of the social dialogue in the Community. The rapporteur is trying to have a procedure of approval by the Council and the European Parliament introduced whenever the two sides of industry have arrived at a proposal. I believe that such a procedure would give rise to an irrelevant third party in the social dialogue. The idea of the social dialogue is, of course, precisely that the two sides of industry should enter into binding agreements with each other and that there should be no irrelevant parties – in this case, legislators – involved in such agreements. If we are serious about beginning a social dialogue and perhaps, in time, creating proper European agreements, we must recognise that it is the two sides of industry themselves which must negotiate and that the legislators must stay outside the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If this enlargement is not accompanied by a profound constitutional change, what we are probably celebrating is the death of the European Union. In other words, the current decision-making process, based on constitutional modifications being made unanimously, is a procedure which does not lend itself to the development of an institution such as our Community, which so far at least has been effective. The danger is that we will transform our European Union into a kind of Council of Europe, an ineffective parliamentary forum – the only thing that works is the European Court of Human Rights – a kind of big UN, with the difference that in the UN only five States have a veto, while in the European Union 27 or 28 States would have the right to veto.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, firstly, with regard to the proposals from Mr Bourlanges, I believe it is essential that we replace the current unanimity with a system of majorities, but, of course, the greater the possibility of adopting decisions by majority, the closer we will be to the genuine political community we aspire to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I agree with Mrs Frassoni that the escape route represented by the rule on majority by means of variable geometry could lead us – as Mr Marinho pointed out – to certain States, such as the United Kingdom, escaping through the back door of variable geometry. In other words, giving them options which allow them – as in the case of Schengen or the euro – not to contribute to the European project. This is perhaps the main weakness of Mr Bourlanges’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">But, in conclusion, I would like to say that I agree with the proposals in general and I believe that, in any event, although I do not agree with any proposal by Mr Bourlanges, the adoption of the report would represent great progress in terms of the strengthening of the European institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Back home, our acts are on three levels: the constitution, the laws and the implementing provisions subordinate to the laws. In the EU, we have thirty different instruments. The EU's box of instruments is therefore far too big and hence also far too confusing, as nobody can find their way around it and the terminology, too, is all over the place. We are dealing, then, with a system that is utterly lacking in transparency and is also to some degree undemocratic.</p>
<p class="contents">What makes the Bourlanges Report so creditable is that it represents a quantum leap in this area. This really is a great leap forward in terms of clarity and democratisation. By dint of a great deal of effort, we have attempted to locate the three levels within the EU as well: the constitutional level, the legislative level and the subordinate<span class="italic"> </span>acts. As regards the constitutional level, it is my view that there will have to be a less cumbersome review procedure for the second part of the constitution. If we are to require unanimity from 25 or more states in order to amend any of the provisions in the second part, we know perfectly well that we will have a blockade on our hands. This is, of course, a highly sensitive issue, though, as majority decisions obviously mean that someone can end up losing. But this leap must be made, and this inner will must be present, or else we will be vetoing each other, and the public does not want that.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of lawmaking, the first step is for us to call laws ‘laws’ and not – as we currently do – ‘regulations’, an expression that in German denotes an administrative act that is not a law. I would be very much in favour of the terms ‘Union law’ and ‘Union framework law’ being used and of codecision being the rule, which it must be in every kind of lawmaking. For legislation on the budget – and decisions on the budget are another very important prerogative of Parliament – there will surely be a need for a special procedure, but the principle of codecision should remain the same.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue, that of separating normal lawmaking by Parliament and the Council from the implementing provisions enacted by the Commission, is of great significance. We need to be clear in our own minds here about what is legislative and what is executive. We could make things easier for ourselves if we in Parliament were not to enact technical regulations, but only the acts underlying them. Mr President, I believe that what we have here is a great success; many thanks to Mr Bourlanges, who has made such an effort and presented a truly great report! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, I would like to say to Mrs Frassoni and Mrs Kaufmann that they must not misunderstand this report: Article 308, as referred to in this report, would result in decisions being made by codecision and qualified majority; we would therefore leave behind Council unanimity in favour of codecision, just as we have for own resources. It is untrue to say that we are proposing to exceed the powers of the European Parliament; we are – since Mrs Kaufmann referred to it – fully in line with the interpretation of the German Constitutional Court, which, following Mr Herzog’s report at the time of the Maastricht Treaty, pointed out that European parliamentary power was needed wherever competence was transferred from one area to another. Let us therefore have no unfounded accusations on this point: we are in favour of codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I fully understand that there might be some hostility towards the proposal that ratification of the Constitution should not be by unanimous vote, even though that is not the main point of the report, and I would not, therefore, want us to focus on that. I fully understand that there might be hostility on principle, and I understand what Mr van den Berg said on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not, however, want any unfounded accusations to be made. It is untrue to say (and I think Mr Marinho should review this point) that the proposal is in any way insulting or disdainful towards small States. The proposal would allow States that represent 2.4% of the Community population to veto the adoption or ratification of a Treaty that might thus be supported by States representing 97.6% of the Community population. So let us not have any unfounded accusations! If one is in favour of Member State sovereignty, I can understand that one would not want a treaty to be ratified by just some of the States. My proposal, however, does not discriminate in any way against small or medium-sized States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a word about Mr Duff, who tabled Amendment No 14. I agree with the content of this amendment, since it states that we need to revise parts A and B of the future Constitution differently. I made a proposal to this effect but I did not receive the support of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and I therefore cannot endorse this amendment personally. However, I believe the argument put forward by Mr Duff is entirely accurate and, personally, I fully support his move, even if, as rapporteur, my hands are tied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report is indeed remarkable in many aspects. First of all, because it covers in depth one of the fundamental points of the issues raised at Laeken. Secondly, because of its rigour, effectiveness and the concise proposals that Parliament formulates in the report, which do indeed lead to genuine simplification of our legislative system, which the rapporteur himself, Mr Bourlanges, described as rather chaotic. Lastly, I must say, because of the extremely rich, clever, skilful pen of your rapporteur, whose talent contradicts each day what a great French diplomat used to say. This diplomat, Mr Talleyrand, who Mr Bourlanges knows well, used to claim, quite wrongly, that spirit may be very useful but does not lead anywhere. On the contrary, Mr Bourlanges, your spirited report leads to a very well-argued resolution. I would like to express the Commission’s full approval of most of the conclusions of this resolution, in accordance, furthermore, with our own communication, which I prepared with President Prodi and my colleague Mr Vitorino here on 5 December last with regard to the institutional framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to emphasise three points. The first concerns the actual principle of the organisation of the legal structure of the Union in three blocs – constitutional, legislative and implementing – which would provide the operation of the Union with the clarity that is sorely lacking today. This reorganisation is indispensable if we are to clarify the legislative role of each institution: the responsibility of the European Parliament and the Council for laying down legislative acts and the primary responsibility of the Commission for ensuring that legislative acts are applied and adopting implementing acts. Naturally, adoption and revision procedures for future constitutional treaties are also important. The Commission, like Parliament, would like to call on the Convention as a model for these procedures more frequently from now on.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above procedural issues, Parliament and the Commission share the same point of view on the need to include sectoral policies within the constitutional treaty. Yet again, I must reiterate that we cannot have strong institutions with weak policies.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point, ladies and gentlemen, which is fundamental to this report, concerns the creation of a genuine legislative bloc. The time has come to call a spade, a spade, as you say yourself, and therefore to talk about European laws. These laws will be adopted by a legislative authority divided into two equal arms; they will be adopted by means of a single procedure, the egalitarian codecision procedure that Mr Leinen rightly focused on earlier on. Here, at last, is an option that would provide all the citizens with a clear, transparent plan, although it is clear that certain aspects of the codecision procedure would need to be streamlined.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, specific adjustments certainly need to be made in the area of organic laws or budgetary acts, and your report, Mr Bourlanges, paves the way for this to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the role you would like the European Commission to play in implementing legislation. I am not talking here about actual governmental functions, although I would note in passing that we should also clarify the exercising of these functions, which must be shared between the Commission, which proposes, and the Council, which decides, with appropriate information provided to the European Parliament. This applies to the fields of police and justice and to the field of common foreign and security policy. With regard to Community competence to implement European legislation, however, we, like you, would like this to be clearly awarded to the Commission and monitored equally by Parliament and the Council, in other words by the two arms of the legislative and budgetary authority. Mrs Randzio-Plath has emphasised this point, moreover. We need to carry out fundamental rationalisation to know who does what in the European Union and introduce greater transparency and accountability into the exercising of these implementing competences.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this regard, ladies and gentlemen, that I must inform you of two concerns the Commission has on two points in your report. The first was raised by Mrs Frassoni earlier. It relates to the possibility of awarding at least part of these implementing competences to an authority other than the Commission. Ladies and gentlemen, we must avoid encouraging or facilitating what could be perceived as dismantling regulatory power in the European Union. The second point that concerns us, and Mr Corbett and Mrs Bérès, amongst others, have raised it, is that of granting Parliament and the Council a generalised right of veto with regard to implementing measures. I am indeed talking about implementing measures. This point is currently the subject – although some of the details may be different - of a reasoned discussion within the context of the preparation of the draft interinstitutional agreement on improving legislation, and my colleague, Mrs de Palacio, will discuss it here tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not repeat the Commission’s position, as it is already well-known. Allow me simply to say that, as regards implementing measures each institution must be able to exercise its prerogatives autonomously, in harmony with the other institutions, and must avoid burdening the citizens and economic entities with the risk of legal insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in conclusion, I would like to congratulate the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and your rapporteur most sincerely on the inspired work they have achieved with this report. We shall have to fight to impose the ambitious conclusions arising from the report. Mr Bourlanges, ladies and gentlemen, there is some distance between the Bourlanges report, as you are able to adopt it, and the conclusions of the Convention working group headed by Mr Amato. In order to bridge this gap when the future constitutional treaty is drafted, it is essential for the Commission and Parliament to continue to take the same line within the Convention. You can count on Mr Vitorino and myself for that. This is an element that Mrs Kaufmann and Mr Duff raised earlier, which makes Mr Bourlanges’ report all the more useful and relevant.</p>
