It is worth noting that the Council alone has spent eight years considering the draft, which further testifies to the controversy that surrounds this method. Naturally enough, we might ask why foodstuffs should be irradiated at all, since it has been proved that vitamins in fruit and vegetables are killed off and also that the irradiation of products with fat content releases free radicals, which, as we know, are carcinogenic. But I should also like to remind the House that, for as long as we have not had a standard framework, we have naturally had no compulsory labelling either. Since irradiation is practised in several countries, such as France, Belgium and the Netherlands, and since we have a single market in which irradiated products are traded, there is no real point now in maintaining the old position that Parliament once adopted. We must prohibit it. Just wait, Mr Bangemann; it is too soon to be rejoicing.</p>
<p class="contents">This will not now happen. Eighteen months after the entry into force of the directive, labelling will become compulsory. This naturally also applies to spices and other ingredients, even – and this is very important – if such ingredients constitute less than 25 % of the product. In addition, we have managed to ensure that, after 1 January 2003, irradiation will only be permissible if standardised and validated verification methods are in place. You certainly did some resolute stonewalling on this point, Mr Bangemann, and the only reason why we were able to overcome the resistance of the Commission is that the Council was on our side for once. That was naturally very gratifying. Another important point is that changes to the list of foods and ingredients – which, for its part, has to be on the table by 31 December 2000 – are always governed by the provisions of Article 100a of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been established that the treatment of foodstuffs with ionising radiation must not be a substitute for hygiene, nor must it be used in production processes or in agriculture. It used to be the case that when food started to go off, ionising radiation was applied, and the eye was deceived, so to speak. This will no longer be possible in future. But the crucial point will naturally remain the extent to which we educate consumers on what it means when foodstuffs are treated with ionising radiation. This, of course, is not something that the average housewife would know. I can only hope, and we shall be pressing this point, that it will not appear in such small print that it is overlooked, because I still take the view that there is no real need to irradiate foodstuffs. We should do better to ensure that we eat whatever is in season. It is not absolutely essential to prevent onions, potatoes and so on from germinating. For all that, we are naturally in favour of the agreement we have now reached. Goodness knows how hard it was to achieve this agreement, and we shall do everything in our power to ensure that those who buy these products actually know what they are buying. If that can be achieved, then I believe we shall have established a good Community system. I am pleased that progress has been made at long last, and at the end of the day it is almost satisfying, if not entirely so, that we have all received our dues.</p>

I believe that today we not only need to congratulate the rapporteur on her report but that we can also congratulate ourselves as a Parliament for our dogged, lengthy and ultimately successful efforts to achieve a number of improvements to the original Council proposal and hence to the common position too.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though I myself do not believe it is necessary to treat many foodstuffs with radiation, because I share the rapporteur's view that the healthiest food is local produce consumed when it is ripe, I believe that labelling is of great importance to consumers as a means of indicating to them what they are buying and what they can expect from their purchases. I also consider it important to emphasise that ionising radiation cannot replace good agricultural practice, which means that food should only ever be irradiated when it is fresh. I also believe it is very important to validate and standardise inspection procedures, so that the Member States can exercise an unambiguous right of control and so that consumers are ultimately able to assert their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">At this particular time, when the issue of food safety is under widespread scrutiny, it is essential to have such a directive. I also believe that the large size of many farms in the applicant countries makes it necessary for us to ensure that the directive is adopted before any enlargement of the Union, so that there is a body of EU food‐safety legislation which can be applied to these farms from the outset.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schnellhardt </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the treatment of foodstuffs with radiation conjures up diabolic visions in the minds of many people, while sending many a practitioner and expert into transports of delight. European policymakers were faced with the task of reconciling these two extremes and making the practical application of radiation treatment possible. The treatment of foodstuffs with ionising radiation must be possible, we believe, where it is prudent and necessary, but not as a substitute for health measures and hygiene. I do not believe what Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz said about radiation being used on food that is going off to make it fit for consumption again. Not even radiation can do that. That will be explicitly stated in future directives too. It is a very important principle.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it goes without saying that the food in question poses no health hazard whatsoever. But that has to be re‐emphasised, because we have heard the opposite message again today. Food treated with ionising radiation is not radioactive food, and we, the population of the EU, can consume it without becoming seriously ill. Harmonisation at European level is therefore an urgent necessity. The legal position in the various Member States has hitherto been unduly disparate. Whereas food has been treated with radiation for years in France, Belgium and the Netherlands, for instance, irradiated foodstuffs are prohibited in other countries, so there is no trace of the single market here.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of the conciliation proceedings with the Council is good and has our approval. The market in food treated with ionised radiation will gradually become a single market too. Compulsory labelling will also enable consumers to make a choice. I believe this represents a major success, and I cannot help emphasising the specific role played by my group in the inclusion of standardised and validated verification methods in the directive. Without validated verification methods, there can be no credible labelling system. And without a credible labelling system, there can be no consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of confidence, I must repeat – and I agree with Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz here – that spending ten long years on a directive is not something we can afford to do very often. Let me say to the Commissioners that we certainly cannot afford a repeat with regard to the chocolate directive or the labelling of alcoholic beverages. Directives like the present one should not become the norm. It is high time we started to build up consumer confidence by acting quickly.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hyland </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I welcome this directive because it creates a legal framework for the single market in foodstuffs treated with ionising radiation. It sets high standards and limits to production which may be treated. Improving food variety and quality through added value is now central to a modern food sector. The quality of the product, information on its source and full details of the added value process must at all times be fully available to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Food products resulting from new research must only enter the food chain after the most stringent tests have been undertaken. Consumers must at all times be protected from the uncertainty of inadequate testing of new products. In a nutshell, public health and consumer protection must be paramount to all other considerations for Europe's agrifood sector. This Parliament has played a key role in ensuring that the concerns of consumers are taken into account and that the eventual risks related to the control mechanisms are minimized. The highest standards of food quality must be the primary goal of national governments and the EU. And measures which enhance and improve food quality must be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that in Ireland there is a growing appreciation of the professional role of farmers in providing quality raw material to a food sector committed to the highest standards of consumer satisfaction.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Whitehead </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, in her absence, I should like to congratulate Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz for seeing this very difficult conciliation through. It might have come more quickly. Anything which includes the word radiation is bound to be fraught with difficulties, misunderstandings and misgivings. What is the proper use of ionised radiation? Essentially it has to be where consumer safety benefits. It is for the consumer and for the consumer's health. It is not where producer profits benefit because of the cosmetic effect on fruit and other foodstuffs of limited durability.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not benefit from eating strawberries which have passed their natural span simply because they can be artificially preserved. We do, however, benefit from maintaining the natural span of spices and preservatives which are used in our stores and which are kept for long periods of time. We have a strict range of products which can be sold now throughout the single market. We can understand that in each Member State the same conditions apply and the same safeguards apply. With enlargement soon to come, we should also understand that this is an important benchmark for the applicant states where all kinds of temptations lie in wait for the agricultural sectors in those countries, as Mr Schnellhardt has already said.</p>
<p class="contents">This is perhaps the first time we have been able to come to some sort of consensus on an aspect of radiation and radiation treatment. It will not be the last.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, it is always a very silly situation when people feel they have been proved right, because it is very easy, of course, to feel vindicated by events and to say ‘there you are, for ten years I have been fighting the good fight, and the others have finally recognised that I was right'. But it really has to be said, as I have told Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz – and I believe this may not be primarily the fault of Parliament – that for ten years the Council has purely and simply turned a deaf ear to the argument which was presented here by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz and which I have advanced at every Council meeting for the past ten years, namely that the situation we had was worse for the consumer than what we have been proposing. Why? Because we have placed very tight restrictions on the scope for using ionised radiation.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that we have always pressed for labelling, so that every consumer can choose whether or not to buy one of this limited range of treated food products. Consumers can leave them on the shelves. No consumer will be deceived into buying these products unwittingly, because they will be labelled. As for the honourable Member who has now left, Mr President, I shall get up and leave in the middle of one of the next sittings to bring home to the honourable Members of Parliament how idiotic it is, not to mention discourteous to the Commission, for anyone here to comment on the chocolate issue and then simply to go away before the Commissioner can deal with the point that has been raised.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Protest) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Oh I see, you have put your jacket on. I thought you had left, because you were in shirt‐sleeves when you spoke! Well, as far as chocolate is concerned, the problem is exactly the same. We proposed labelling so that all consumers can make an entirely free choice as to whether the chocolate they buy is made entirely of cocoa bean ingredients or whether they will accept the use of other vegetable fats. Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz rightly said that we should have a certain amount of trust in the consumer. That is the view of the Commission too. So why not let consumers choose what they want? Some of them can then insist on buying chocolate with only cocoa fats, while others might not mind taking other types of chocolate.</p>
<p class="contents">That has been precisely the problem with the radiation too. As long as we did not have a common set of rules, some Member States treated all sorts of food with ionising radiation, and it was not labelled. I am now in my eleventh year as a Commissioner. If Parliament is gracious to me, I shall see out my term. If not, I would not be unduly upset either. But for ten years I have been putting the case for this directive to the Council; for ten years I have been advancing these arguments – and this applies to many parliamentary debates too, by the way – and it has been like talking to a brick wall. Sometimes one really does wonder whether it is at all possible to come up with a reasonable set of rules which everyone can accept while appreciating that they might not represent any one person's ideal solution. There is no such thing as an ideal solution in a democracy anyway, because wherever a hundred people are gathered together, at least three or four different opinions will emerge. But labelling will give consumers the freedom to choose for themselves. Given the range of opinions on such subjects, the only answer is to give the individual a set of reasonable options. That is why I am glad that we have finally reached this point.</p>
<p class="contents">But if I were a Member of Parliament, I should think thrice before celebrating this as a parliamentary triumph.</p>

I did not say that Parliament alone was to blame; Germany, my own Member State, has blocked the solution of this problem for ten years. I have spent ten years repeating the arguments that Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz has presented this evening. I am damned if I will apologise, because this is a proper democratic discussion. You have been wrong for the past ten years, and now you do not want to admit it! That is unacceptable. Duplicity kills democracy!</p>

Commissioner, I have absolutely no idea why you should be pillorying Parliament. With regard to the chocolate directive, I was merely trying to express precisely what you went on to say. The Council thinks it is entitled to drag this whole thing out, and the other business too. But if you can quote anything in our Rules of Procedure or in the Maastricht Treaty to show how Parliament could have been any quicker in dealing with this matter, I shall naturally be more than willing to act on your advice when the other two subjects come up. But I agree with you entirely that both of us – the Commission and Parliament – should pillory the Council. That was all I said.</p>
