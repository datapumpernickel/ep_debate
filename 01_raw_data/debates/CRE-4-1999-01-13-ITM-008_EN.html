<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Areitio Toledo </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, this evening in the privacy of this Hemicycle we are going to debate an issue with the Commissioner which, in spite of the fact that there are very few people present, is very important. The issue of State Aid and the need to control it has been a longstanding objective for the Commission and for the whole European Union. Such aid distorts competition and free trade, hinders industrial restructuring and impedes the achievements of the stability pact.</p>
<p class="contents">The total volume of State Aid awarded is by no means insignificant, and I should like to remind you of the amount involved. We are talking about figures approaching 1.5 % of Community GDP. We are talking about 2.6 % of public spending in national budgets which, compared with the Community"s own budget, is even higher. And I believe that this cannot be tolerated within the framework of monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, due to the Treaty, the Commission only has the necessary authority to control such aid on an individual basis, analysing the compatibility of each case with the Treaty. It is obvious that the resources available to the Commission to carry out such controls on each situation where aid is granted or on each aid scheme are clearly inadequate. As I was able to point out on other occasions, I believe that in the long term there will be a need to put a global limit on the total volume of aid awarded by each Member State. Indeed, Parliament has already approved this approach in various resolutions. If this does not happen, then tensions will develop within monetary union. It is true that if there are weeds growing in a garden they can be pulled up one by one, but if there are too many weeds, then it is best to use weedkiller.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the Commission was aware of this problem and it began to reorientate the State Aid control policy at the end of 1996. The aim was to reduce the number of cases to be investigated and to improve the efficiency, transparency and coherency of the control procedure. To this end, the Council adopted a financial regulation in November 1997 which allowed the Commission to exempt the Member States from declaring certain categories of aid, such as for small and medium‐sized enterprises, for research and development, regional aid, aid for employment, aid for training, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s proposal for a regulation that we are considering today is the second stage of this reorientation which the Commission"s new direction is based upon. The aim of this regulation is to establish a clear procedure, which has never existed before now, to be applied to the Commission"s control procedures for State Aid. In short, it is a matter of increasing the transparency of this procedure and the legal certainty of those involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that the Commission should be congratulated on this initiative that will undoubtedly make the control procedure easier, both for those who enforce it as well as for its victims. With this very objective in mind, the rapporteur has suggested three amendments to the text which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has adopted and which simply seek to strengthen the guarantees of transparency and legal certainty and to eliminate some aspects of the proposal which we believe to be of a discretional nature.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the need to give the Commission prior notice and the principle of suspensory effect, laid down in Article 93(3), remain central to the control policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to go into detail on the amendments. I believe that the Commission is already aware of them and, in addition, they were also debated in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that the contribution we have made with this report will help towards improving the State Aid control policy and I trust that State Aid will be more strictly controlled. But I cannot fail to highlight, as I have said before, that when weeds grow too wildly in a garden, pulling them up one by one is ineffective. I must also point out that, sooner or later, this issue will also have to be dealt at macroeconomic level within the stability pact.</p>

But time is precious at this late hour and I shall not be needing to use up my ample allowance of minutes on too many questions of substance. Let me explain why.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly – as we have seen on many similar occasions – there is no fundamental disagreement among the big political groups in Parliament on the substantive issues of competition policy. Unanimity reigns. As to this particular matter, we may have argued in committee over a few minor points, but in the end we reached a uniform, consensual view. We all share a desire to see procedures clarified and decisions taken in a transparent way.The Commission needs to see its position as a competition authority consolidated and its supervisory role in the field of aid strengthened. I can go along with the rapporteur on all these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would make one point, however. Not surprisingly – looking at the clock – no one from the Council is to be seen. Our much‐esteemed Competition Commissioner is with us, however, and perhaps he can enlighten me. I am keen to establish what precisely we are doing here tonight. It is not the content of the debate that worries me, but the form. We have come together to deliberate over a text; tomorrow we shall be voting on our amendments. As far as I can see, however, we have been overtaken by events. The actual decision was taken two months ago in the Council. So I am wondering where we as a parliament come in. Perhaps it is true that our views have been taken into account, but what about the points which were not heeded?</p>
<p class="contents">Article 14 – in the Council"s version of the text – contains a paragraph which refers to the suspension of recovery proceedings. This paragraph was unanimously rejected in committee. I happen to know, because the relevant amendment came from me and, as shadow rapporteur for my group, I managed to get all my points through. The committee expressly voted against this paragraph, but it figures in the Council text. What happens now, Commissioner? Could it be that we are simply engaged in intellectual gymnastics? This is what concerns me. Maybe we need to rethink our own procedures. The horse would appear to have bolted; it seems rather futile for us to be discussing the angle of the stable door.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Metten </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the time when my group thought state aid was the ideal solution is long past, and we now support the Commission"s current view that state aid should be allowed only in special cases, such as for regional aid or research. But even here we must be careful. Regional aid must not be allowed to lure jobs from one area of the Union to another, and research support must not become state aid for businesses by another name.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it has to be said that state aid is still being granted on a considerable scale, even to firms that do not represent the public interest. Some of it is traditional aid that the Commission has tolerated or even approved up to now, and some is illegal support. I have to say that it is very hypocritical of the Member States to support the generally rather restrictive policy on state aid, but then to make difficulties about claiming back aid that has been granted illegally. As I see it, punishing abuses is all about showing credibility and effectiveness. This also applies in my view to state aid in the form of tax concessions. Demanding repayment means of course that the state has to get money back from individual firms, and it is rather ironic that the governments should be worried about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the fiscal aid that the Commission has tolerated up to now, I would heavily criticise the Commission decision published in the Official Journal of 18 December last year, which classifies Ireland"s extremely low corporation tax that applies only to foreign undertakings as aid for exploitation and distortion of competition, but at the same time allows it to be extended until 2003 or even 2010. The Commission is clearly being far too lax and inconsistent. It is time to put an end to these sorts of practices.</p>

As previously mentioned, the matter has already been discussed in the Council, but I would like to mention something that was also touched on by Mr Metten, namely that there can be extenuating circumstances in connection with state aids. What we are talking about is employment. I would like to emphasise that aid should be given during periods of restructuring, and that it should always be temporary. I would also like to emphasise that it has been found that when people decide to remove the aid and to develop businesses instead, then jobs are in fact created. So some of our competition money could well be used for development rather than aid. I hope that when the Commission comes to simplify the administration of Article 93, it does not turn a blind eye to problems. I realise that Mr Van Miert does not have so many people at his disposal, but I hope that it will be a good and effective simplification. I am particularly pleased that on‐site checks are being proposed. I think that is a good thing, which could make this more effective and transparent and improve legal certainty. I also think it is good for countering national bureaucracy and bad faith.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very difficult for a country to admit that it has made a mistake. I know that from Denmark and from Germany. We have had a lot of cases in shipbuilding, but as politicians we must all commit ourselves to looking forward. I believe that what is on the table, even if it has now been dealt with in the Council, is a good way forward. I also believe that, year by year, we should look at how it can be improved. What the Council has arrived at this time could perhaps be improved next year, because we are always becoming better or more skilful at administering these rules. I would therefore like to wish the Commissioner and the Commission good luck in future, and point out that Parliament supports the Commission in this area.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Van Miert, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, as the rapporteur said just now, we are discussing this dossier here, which is nevertheless an important one, in what is almost an intimate atmosphere.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, my sincere thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Areitio Toledo, and those who have spoken in the debate. In a way, we are discussing this subject amongst ourselves, amongst people who are familiar with it and want to improve things, a desire which is not new. We have been trying for years to work together to achieve better discipline in the monitoring of state aids, to improve the procedures, to be more transparent and better balanced. On this or that point – and I shall reply to Mr Metten presently – we do of course have differing views. Opinions will not necessarily be the same on how this or that affair should be managed. But I think I can say, generally speaking, that despite the sensitive nature of the subject of state aids, there is – if not a consensus – at least the feeling that by and large things are moving in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">This is our second initiative on the basis of Article 94, and you will remember that we made one attempt before without success. This time we have managed to agree two proposals and, between ourselves – since we have been debating privately among friends, as the rapporteur said – we have done it far faster than I had expected. And, Mr Rapkay, that rather explains our problem. A proposal which was put forward several months ago was in the end dealt with very quickly by the Council of Ministers. I was very surprised by this, because initially there had been disagreement on it. I had myself been present at the Council meeting when the Council considered this matter for the first time, and I threatened to withdraw our proposal because there was no support for it. And now, a few months later, to my astonishment, the Council of Ministers adopts our proposal on the substance in five minutes flat. There are lessons to be learned from all this – for Parliament first of all, in that it might perhaps work rather faster in cases of this kind, and for the Council of Ministers too, which might sometimes be encouraged to work more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I think in essence that what was agreed in principle by the Council is very broadly consistent – and I stress very broadly, Mr Rapkay – with what Parliament has always said. For the first time, in fact, we shall have a truly transparent procedure. So this was a kind of inaugural act, an act which was necessary. It will enable us to work against a background of greater clarity and transparency and will enable others to understand the procedures better: I think that is in everybody"s interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to reply to one or two specific comments. One problem in particular, Mr Rapkay, is of great concern to us. Once the Commission has decided against, which as you know it is doing more and more often, the Member State or authority which granted the state aid has to recover that aid. Most Member States do just that, but in some of them it is extremely complicated. In Germany, for example, the matter may be referred to the national courts and can drag on for years. This leads to a certain discrimination between Member States. We have tried to correct this, because there has to be consistency in implementing Commission decisions throughout the territory of the European Union. This is why we have battled over this.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point concerns on‐the‐spot checks of compliance with the conditions which are sometimes attached to the decision to grant state aids. Such checks are carried out, for example on shipyards. But in other sectors too, it is sometimes necessary to be able to check whether the undertakings given are indeed being respected. These are a few examples which prove that things are improving.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I know that the question arose in Germany as to whether the Commission can do something which is not in accordance with national law. That needs to be discussed, because once again, if the Commission"s decisions are implemented in most Member States but not in one or two others, there is a problem. Those who do carry out the decisions will say ‘yes, but look at what these other countries are doing, payments wrongly made are not being recovered". I come up against this problem more and more. I have to say that in all honesty. More and more I am asked ‘if the others are doing that, why shouldn"t we?" I feel I have to point that problem out.</p>
<p class="contents">My time is limited, Mr President, so I must finish, and in concluding I would address myself particularly to Mr Rapkay. I think most of the amendments were agreed in the end so that we have reason to be satisfied, even if it is somewhat after the event. On one or two points, I cannot allay your concerns, because we do not agree, as is sometimes the case. But overall, I think I can say that this arrangement satisfies the wishes of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the last question put by Mr Metten it is true that we were in a special situation because in the past, rightly or wrongly, the Commission accepted this system. It goes back to the time of Ireland"s accession. So the situation was, I repeat, one which the Commission accepted at a given time. It could not be ignored. And there are established rights. What we tried to do was to end that system after a transitional period. And that is what was agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question is what the rate will be for companies. This is a more general debate which is part of the issue of fiscal harmonisation, because once you are talking about a general measure you are no longer talking about state aids. Thus we told the Irish authorities that the system as applied in the past was no longer acceptable, just as we shall have to tackle a whole series of other fiscal aid dossiers, some of which were also accepted in the past. So there too, solutions will have to be found for other dossiers which have never been notified, which have never been accepted by the Commission. We shall have to be tougher, stricter, that much is obvious. But I am sure that we shall discuss this again on future occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point, and the rapporteur raised it, is that this lovely lady sitting next to me is part of the team of officials who handle dossiers of this kind. But as you know, we are seriously short of staff to do all the work. There are 30 or so ‘fiscal aid" dossiers pending, and I do not have the human resources I need. We have to find taxation specialists to administer these dossiers. So once again I make the plea, but I know that you share my concerns here: when you have a new field to cultivate, but not the means to do it, you cannot work miracles. We are faced with a mountain of dossiers, and the human resources available to us are laughably inadequate. I have to say: do not be angry if we cannot process all these dossiers in a period of a few months. But I know that I am preaching to the converted here. All I can do is restate the problem in the hope that you may perhaps, in other places, give us a helping hand to get the minimum of personnel we need to manage our dossiers.</p>
