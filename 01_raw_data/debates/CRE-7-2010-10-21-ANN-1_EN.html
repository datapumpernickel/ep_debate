<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the October 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) SMEs in the European Union are especially dependent on financing through the banks, which has been affected by the economic crisis. Indeed in Europe, the percentage of financing of SMEs and other entities through the banks as opposed to through the capital markets is much higher than in the United States. Some estimates place this percentage as high as 80% of all financing of the economy.</p>
<p>Various bodies, including the ECB and the Commission, are continuing to monitor the finance being given to the economy overall and to SMEs in particular, and regularly inform the Council on the matter. The European Central Bank has recommended among other things that the financial system should transfer funding obtained from the Member States to help it ride out the crisis to the real economy and to SMEs in particular. This recommendation was made against the backdrop of the banks also needing to clean up and strengthen their balance sheets in order to meet the increased capital requirements of the new Basel Accord announced on 12 September 2010.</p>
<p>The mission of the Basel Committee, which is made up of representatives of the central banks and financial regulatory authorities of 27 countries in the world, is to increase the stability and reliability of the financial system. The Committee should be submitting a series of measures to the G20 Heads of State or Government in Seoul on 11 and 12 November and has announced an impact assessment for the end of the year. Under these circumstances, it is still too early to reach a valid judgment about the long-term impact that the increased capital requirements will have on the development of the financial markets and their repercussions on financing for production activities and for SMEs in particular.</p>
<p>Politically speaking, the Basel Accord is crucial, but it is not legally binding. Each member of the Basel Committee therefore needs to implement it whilst taking into consideration its own limitations and situation. In the European Union, the new standards will apply to all credit establishments, not just to the major international banks as in the United States; hence the need for a detailed study before the precise figures are set. The European Commission has announced that its legislative proposal for implementation of the new Basel Accord, ‘CRD 4’ (Capital Requirements Directive 4), will in turn be accompanied by impact assessments, which will address two aspects. The first will be an assessment of the impact on the banking sector as an industry and the second an assessment to determine the anticipated overall impact on the economy.</p>
<p>The Council will be examining the Commission’s CRD 4 proposal, which is expected by the end of the first quarter of 2011, as soon as it is presented, and hopes there will be fruitful collaboration with the European Parliament with a view to prompt adoption. This will provide the best possible conditions for the EU’s credit institutions to prepare themselves for when the new rules come into force.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the October 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) Work began on the European Union’s accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) on 17 March 2010 with the presentation of the Commission’s recommendation for opening the negotiations on accession. Parliament stated its position in a resolution of 19 May 2010, which among other things called on the Belgian and Hungarian Presidencies to do their utmost to finalise the accession at the earliest suitable opportunity and insisted that Parliament should be closely involved in the preliminary discussions and also in the conduct of negotiations on that text, in accordance with the provisions of Article 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The negotiating mandate and the negotiating directives were adopted by a Council decision of 4 June 2010.</p>
<p>By the same decision, the Council nominated the Commission as negotiator. Under the terms of the decision, the Commission shall conduct the negotiations in consultation with the Working Party on Fundamental Rights, Citizens’ Rights and Free Movement of Persons (FREMP), as the special committee appointed in accordance with Article 218(4) TFEU. Through the negotiator’s reports, the Council follows the progress of the negotiations, which are held in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The first working meeting of the informal working group of the Council of Europe’s Steering Committee for Human Rights (CDDH) on the accession of the European Union to the ECHR was held in Strasbourg on 6 and 7 July 2010. A second meeting was held in Strasbourg from 20 to 22 September 2010. Following that meeting, the working group drew up a draft list of issues to be discussed regarding the EU’s accession. The special committee (FREMP) was kept informed of both meetings.</p>
<p>As regards the matter of accession by the European Union to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Council has not received any recommendations on this matter from the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0494"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the October 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) The Council considers that enhancing the patent system in Europe is a necessary prerequisite for boosting growth through innovation and for helping European businesses, in particular SMEs, face the economic crisis and international competition.</p>
<p>Such an enhanced patent system is a vital element of the internal market and should be based on two pillars: the creation of a European Union patent (hereafter ‘EU patent’) and the setting up of an integrated specialised and unified jurisdiction for patent-related disputes, thus improving the enforcement of patents and enhancing legal certainty.</p>
<p>In December 2009, the Council reached an agreement on its general position on the future EU patent regulation. As regards the language arrangements for the EU patent, the Council is awaiting the European Parliament’s opinion on the Commission’s proposal, and in the meantime is working hard to reach an agreement as quickly as possible. The subject was recently debated at the Council session of 11 October, and we will be returning to it soon.</p>
<p>As regards the second pillar, the Council has submitted a draft treaty establishing a European and EU Patents Court to the European Court of Justice for its opinion on the compatibility of the text with the Treaties. The Court’s opinion is expected within the next few months.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0496"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the October 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) Since the European Union was given no express remit in the field of tourism, its jurisdiction has been very limited in this area, which explains the fairly restricted scope of past action by the Commission and the Council to promote Europe as a destination of choice for international tourists.</p>
<p>With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the new Article 195 TFEU stipulates that the European Union may complement the action of the Member States in the tourism sector, by promoting the competitiveness of undertakings in that sector and in particular by encouraging the creation of a favourable environment for their development and by promoting cooperation between Member States, particularly by the exchange of good practice. Nonetheless, this provision excludes any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States. Furthermore, any measures taken in this area must comply with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality as set out in the Treaty.</p>
<p>On the basis of the above-mentioned provision, on 6 July 2010 the Commission published a communication entitled ‘Europe, the world’s No 1 tourist destination, a new political framework for tourism in Europe’.</p>
<p>In response to this Commission paper, the Council decided that action to support tourism could be grouped under the four priority areas set out in the Commission communication, which are respectively:</p>
<p>a) to stimulate competitiveness in the European tourism sector;</p>
<p>b) to promote the development of sustainable, responsible and high-quality tourism;</p>
<p>c) to consolidate the image and profile of Europe as a collection of sustainable, high-quality destinations;</p>
<p>d) to maximise the potential of existing EU financial policies and instruments for developing tourism.</p>
<p>The Council also asked the Commission to gather further evidence, consult widely, and analyse the European and plurinational added value of the actions and initiatives addressing the key issues mentioned above.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0498"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the October 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) Youth employment is one of the main overarching themes for European cooperation on youth for the 18 months of the Trio Presidency.</p>
<p>The Belgian Presidency aims to take inspiration from the Spanish Presidency’s initiative, which led to the adoption by the Council of a resolution on the active inclusion of young people, establishing common principles in this area and stating that social and economic exclusion and all forms of discrimination are obstacles to the well-being of young people and may hinder their active participation in society and in the labour market. This resolution also integrated the ‘youth’ perspective into other policy fields such as education and employment, and the Belgian Presidency aims to continue along these lines by proposing a resolution on socio-educational activities and by calling upon the Council to adopt this resolution at its November session.</p>
<p>The proposed resolution will acknowledge in particular the role that socio-educational activities can play by providing opportunities for young people to develop a wide range of different personal and vocational skills that will help their employment prospects.</p>
<p>On 21 October 2010, the employment guidelines will also be presented to the Council for adoption. These guidelines, which will form one of the principal instruments for implementing the Europe 2020 strategy, emphasise the importance of targeting young people in the Member States’ employment and educational policies. Guideline 8 in particular states that to support young people and in particular those not in employment, education or training (NEET), Member States, in cooperation with the social partners, should enact schemes to help those people find initial employment, job experience, or further education and training opportunities, including apprenticeships, and should intervene rapidly when young people become unemployed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Presidency wishes to draw attention to the fact that continuing on from the Communication on Youth on the Move, published recently by the Commission, which proposes various measures aimed at achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy (including the goal of improving employment for young people), the Council will be called upon during its November session to adopt an integrated approach (on education, youth and employment) which addresses the various socioeconomic challenges currently facing young people.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0503"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the October 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) Last December, in the context of its conclusions on human rights and democratisation in third countries, the Council emphasised the important role of business in achieving full respect for human rights. In this context, the Council expressed its support for the work of Professor Ruggie, the UN Special Representative on Human Rights and Transnational Corporations and other Business Enterprises.</p>
<p>The European Union recently reaffirmed its support for the Special Representative’s work when presenting its latest report to the Human Rights Council in Geneva in June 2010. The EU also welcomed the Special Representative’s plans to produce a set of guidelines in 2011 for the implementation of his conceptual framework ‘Protect, Respect and Remedy’ and to examine the possibility of creating an instrument within the United Nations to promote this framework. This conceptual framework is based on three fundamental principles: the state duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, including business; the corporate responsibility to respect human rights; and the need for greater access to effective remedy, both judicial and non-judicial. These three principles constitute a set of complementary aspects which work together to produce lasting progress.</p>
<p>As members of the OECD, some of the EU Member States are taking part in that organisation’s work on modernising its guidelines and making them more effective, and they generally welcomed Professor Ruggie’s proposals, including his proposal to add a specific section on human rights and the principle of due diligence. According to this principle, to avoid infringing the rights of others, companies must exercise due diligence in the area of human rights, which combines established corporate risk management practices and consideration for human rights aspects, in keeping with the fundamental criteria laid down by the United Nations.</p>
<p>As regards the EU Member States, the position to be adopted in the context of the OECD’s work is not coordinated between the Council’s working groups. However, the delegations within the Council are informed of the progress of this work, especially with regard to commercial aspects and aspects relating to investment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0506"></a>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the October 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>(FR) With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union (EU) replaced and succeeded the European Community (EC). The EU therefore inherited the status of observer at the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>The status of observer at the United Nations General Assembly inherited by the EU carries relatively restricted rights, such as a limited degree of access to the list of speakers and certain procedural rights. These restricted rights have entailed a significant reduction in the EU’s action and profile compared with the situation prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, in which it was the Member State holding the Council Presidency which represented the EU. We must recognise that the EU is not able at present to fully exercise the role within the United Nations General Assembly that the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union confers on it, nor can it promote the EU’s interests as effectively as it was able to do before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force.</p>
<p>Since the debate on the draft resolution on the EU’s participation in the work of the UN was postponed at the September meeting of the UN General Assembly, on 4 October the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy decided to form a working party on the resolution with a view to consolidating, coordinating and supporting the work of the EU delegation to the United Nations, the work of other EU representatives in third countries and that of the services of the Commission and the Council Secretariat in Brussels, so as to establish the conditions that are required to obtain the additional rights needed for the EU to participate effectively in the work of the UN General Assembly. This working party is made up of officials from the Commission and the Council Secretariat.</p>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Council will be discussing a strategy on the matter on 25 October.</p>

<p>(EN) With Functional Airspace Blocks (FABs), each Member State looks beyond national borders and provides air navigation services together with other Member States. FABs are key mechanisms of the Single European Sky (SES) to deliver the operational benefits of enhanced cooperation among air navigation service providers and, where appropriate, through an integrated provider. However, it only remains an intermediate step towards a true single European sky.</p>
<p>Under the SES II legislation Member States are obliged to establish FABs before 4 December 2012. Two FABs – in Sweden and Denmark and the United Kingdom and Ireland – have already been notified. Within the coming months the Commission expects the signature for the agreement on FABEC, which covers Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. To facilitate the negotiations between Member States cooperating in the same FAB, Mr Jarzembowski was appointed coordinator in August 2010.</p>
<p>However, more work is necessary to accelerate the Single European Sky and to meet the deadline.</p>
<p>To assist Member States, the Commission has established a tight work program and presented a number of regulatory measures. For example, the Commission Regulation laying down the performance scheme was adopted on 29 July 2010. This will be the vehicle to drive Member States to seek closer integration in the field of air navigation service provision while improving performance.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission is now finalising its proposal for an implementing regulation on information requirements for the FAB establishment. Supporting material will also be finalised by 4 December 2010.</p>
<p>To conclude, the December 2012 deadline gives the Commission and the FAB coordinator strong leverage in the discussions with Member States. The Commission will then have to address possible issues if the December 2012 deadline is not met. However, at this stage the Commission is optimistic that the deadline will be met as the preparations are advancing well.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Priority Project 17 "Paris-Strasbourg-Stuttgart-Vienna-Bratislava" (PP17) is an east-west oriented railway axis crossing very densely populated areas in the centre of Europe. It stretches over 1,382 kilometres and crosses four Member States: France, Germany, Austria and Slovakia.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that with the nomination of EU-Coordinator Péter Balázs and after the signature of a declaration of intent by the Ministers for Transport of the four Member States on 9 June 2006 followed by several bilateral treaties on the cross-border sections, implementation has made good progress on most segments. The last French high-speed section should be operational in 2016; the new Vienna station will be opened in 2013; all passenger sections in Austria, designed for 200 kilometres per hour (km/h), should be operational until 2015 at the latest.</p>
<p>The Commission welcomes the finalisation of the works on the cross-border section between France and Germany. The Kehl Bridge will be opened on 10 December 2010 - and the ongoing works on the section Augsburg-Munich are scheduled for completion in December 2011.</p>
<p>But the Commission also has some concerns:</p>
<p>- works on the section Stuttgart-Ulm started in 2010. This section should be fully operational in December 2019, designed for a maximum speed of 250 km/h, although, as the Honourable Member is aware, the section in Stuttgart is also at the centre of a political debate;</p>
<p>- the connection to Munich Airport is still not financed although the Bavarian Government and the parliament (Landtag) recently agreed on a development concept for Munich ("Bahnkonzept München") to connect the railway line with the airport;</p>
<p>- although in July 2007 the German and the Austrian ministries of Transport agreed on jointly developing the cross-border section Freilassing-Salzburg to improve the capacity of this section, a final date for starting the works on the German side has yet to be confirmed by the German authorities;</p>
<p>- regarding the section Munich-Freilassing, a comprehensive approach for the whole section is expected to be a priority in the revised planning framework that the German Transport Minister is expected to present later during autumn 2010.</p>
<p>The Commission understands that infrastructure investments have to take account of available national resources, but equally investment in Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) projects is a collective commitment by all the Member States concerned: if one does not deliver its part of a link, the investments of the others are likely to be devalued. Thus the Commission will remind the German Government of its political commitments.</p>
<p>The Commission is happy to inform the Honourable Member that in June 2010 the Commission appointed Gilles Savary, a former prominent member of the European Parliament, as new European coordinator for Priority Project 22 (Athens–Nuremberg/Dresden). He will present his first report of his work on 27 October 2010 to the TRAN committee.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0495"></a>

<p>(EN) Regulation 1008/2008<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> allows the imposition of public service obligations (PSOs), for reasons of economic development or of territorial connection. PSOs are tools to ensure the access to isolated regions or to support regional development policy goals when the Member State finds that its objectives will not be adequately met by free play of the market forces.</p>
<p>These obligations are of a general nature (obligations in terms of frequencies, of capacities, of maximum prices etc…). If no operator undertakes the provision of the services, Member States can make recourse to an exclusive concession for only one operator chosen after a European call for tender. This exclusive concession can be with or without compensation, and its main objective is to effectively ensure that the regional development objectives are attained. When there is compensation, the beneficiary is the airline to whom the tender is awarded, not the airports involved.</p>
<p>Currently, PSOs are imposed on 200 routes within the EU. By ensuring that a minimum number of frequencies are operated on these routes, PSOs stimulate air traffic to and from regional airports. The Commission has not made a quantitative analysis of the economic impact of PSOs on regional airports, but PSOs by their nature incentivize air traffic at regional airports that would otherwise be served by less scheduled air services.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Aeronautics directly employs half a million people and its yearly turnover approaches EUR 100 billion. Europe has a market share of over 38%. Therefore, this high tech industry is key for the EU.</p>
<p>The White Paper on the future of transport is not yet finalised and it would therefore be premature to say what it contains. In general, the aviation sector, the transport equipment industries and aeronautics will benefit from it.</p>
<p>First of all, the deployment of the technologies developed by SESAR (Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research), in which many aeronautics manufacturers participate, will entail production and continuous efficiency improvements and therefore benefit the aeronautics industry. The completion of the Single European Sky will contribute to increasing air capacity with expected positive opportunities for air carriers and also for European aeronautics manufacturers.</p>
<p>A better integration of the transport modes, connecting air, rail and public transport, will contribute to reducing emissions linked to short haul feeding flights and to last mile connections with the cities.</p>
<p>Framework Programme 7 with 2.1 billion Euro,which includes the Clean Sky initiative (EUR 800 million), is already supporting the technological needs of the European industry in developing a new generation of greener, more effeicient, less costly, safer and more reliable aircraft, aero-engines and equipment as well as air transport. Also, the clean fuels strategy under development will help European manufacturers in an early and smooth transition towards a more sustainable air transport..</p>
<p>Last but not least, fair pricing of transport is an important policy field in the White Paper. The inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions trading system (ETS) from 2012 will provide further incentives for innovation, accelerated fleet renewal and use of alternative fuels – not only for European, but also for major extra-EU airlines – with clear benefits for the aeronautics industry.</p>
<p>Overall, the Commission is committed to further increase the opportunities of this strategic sector, which creates jobs for highly skilled employees and produces technology spill-overs to other sectors.</p>
<p>In this context and following the good example of Vision 2020 for aeronautics research, the Commission will establish a high-level group with industry leaders from the aeronautics industry to develop a new vision for aeronautics and air transport research in Europe beyond 2020.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0504"></a>

<p>The Commission is currently working on this impact assessment according to the established Commission rules and methodology.

<p>Each option is carefully analysed in terms of economic, social, health, safety and environmental impact on the basis of the available information: studies, consulted parties, trial results, etc.</p>
<p>In particular, within each of these scenarios, fundamental rights, health and detection performance will be further assessed. The option of granting passengers the possibility to opt-out will also be considered as well as options on image retention.</p>

<p>(FR) The report on the impact of the POSEI reform of 2006, submitted by the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on 24 September 2010<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, emphasises that the POSEI measures have been very effective for several farming sectors in the outermost regions, including the banana export sector.</p>
<p>The POSEI measures, which for the banana sector have meant a significant level of aid, have indeed produced positive results in terms of maintaining production and income levels.</p>
<p>In particular, the sector has seen significant progress in terms of increased profitability, effects on productivity, quality and environmental production conditions.</p>
<p>These conclusions are based in part on a recent study conducted by independent consultants on the Commission’s behalf, which evaluated the measures implemented under the POSEI system since 2001.</p>
<p>The Commission can therefore say that the POSEI system has made a substantial contribution to maintaining European banana production and to improving production conditions.</p>
<p>The current financial envelope for EU banana producers was set at EUR 279 million for the four producing regions of the Canary Islands, Martinique, Guadeloupe and Madeira when the grants were transferred to the POSEI system in 2007. This considerable sum was calculated partly to reflect a certain variability of the banana market in a scenario of further liberalisation.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore considers that the budget currently allocated to grants for the banana sector is still sufficient to protect EU producers in the current more open market climate.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Commission is closely monitoring the impact of multilateral trade agreements aimed at reducing import tariffs for bananas and will take appropriate action to mitigate should it be necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is very concerned about the current situation, whereby both Iceland and the Faroe Islands have established unilateral quotas and, as a consequence, the stock is being over fished.</p>
<p>The actions by Iceland and the Faroe Islands in setting unilateral quotas for themselves is nothing short of unacceptable. It is unacceptable, because we the European Union and Norway have spent years to build up this lucrative stock in the North East Atlantic to a good and sustainable level. The amount of mackerel which Icelandic and Faroese vessels have taken out of the sea this year goes way beyond what they have ever fished before. These actions also defy all the hard efforts of our own industry in trying to protect this stock.</p>
<p>Ensuring the sustainability of the stock and thereby allowing fishers to benefit fully from the best possible availability of mackerel both for 2011 and for the longer term, is a priority for the Commission. With this aim, the Commission has taking the lead to re-establish collaborative management with all Coastal States in whose waters mackerel migrates. For this purpose, the Commission asked to discuss this issue during the meeting of the Council of Fisheries Ministers of 27 September 2010, where Member States supported the Commission in this objective.</p>
<p>The Union is at a critical point in relation to mackerel management in the North-East Atlantic in view of absence of a quota-sharing arrangement between the Coastal States. Current fishing levels are far above what scientists advised for 2010. The Commission is committed to finding a solution to the problems that have arisen so that the stock can be brought back into good management for 2011 and basis it's position in these negotiations on the Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) for 2011 which allows an increase in the total allowable catch (TAC).</p>
<p>In the absence of collaboration, there is a serious risk that the stock will decrease. To avoid this, the Commission is determined to defend the Union's interests in reaching a long-term agreement. This autumn's negotiations will be crucial, and flexibility and goodwill will be needed by all concerned in order to reach a solution.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0501"></a>

Such claims can indicate that high cholesterol is a risk factor in the development of coronary heart disease. National competent authorities are then responsible for enforcing the legislation concerning them.</p>
<p>Concerning claims on omega-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular health, some await an EFSA assessment; but for others that have already been evaluated, the Commission is in discussion with the Member States for a decision on their authorisation. Claims submitted for authorisation are allowed to remain on the market until a decision on them is taken.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Honourable Member can be reassured that, once the Regulation is fully implemented, only health claims backed by science will be allowed to be used in the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As stressed in the report<a href="#defann_20_2" name="refann_20_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> from the Commission on the application of Directive 2004/38/EC<a href="#defann_20_3" name="refann_20_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the Court of Justice of the European Union in its ruling in the Metock case<a href="#defann_20_4" name="refann_20_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> recalled that the Directive does not prevent Member States from fighting against abuse of EU rights, including marriages of convenience, as stipulated in Article 35 of the Directive.</p>
<p>To identify difficulties and clarify issues of interpretation of the Directive and to assist Member States to apply it correctly, the Commission established a group of experts from Member States in September 2008. The fight against abuse, exchange of best practice, statistics and intelligence on emerging patterns of abuse are on the agenda of the group which meets on a regular basis. An IT network is used to allow Member States to share statistical data and further intelligence on abuse and fraud. In the group, the Commission supports activities at technical level with Member States to improve their ability to fight abuse.</p>
<p>Further assistance was provided in the Commission’s guidelines<a href="#defann_20_5" name="refann_20_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> on better application of the Directive of July 2009. Regarding abuse and fraud, the guidelines highlighted that the Directive allows Member States to take effective and necessary measures to fight against abuse and fraud in areas falling within the material scope of EU law on free movement of persons by refusing, terminating or withdrawing any right conferred by the Directive in the case of abuse of rights or fraud, such as marriages of convenience. Any such measure must be proportionate and subject to the procedural safeguards provided for in the Directive.</p>
<p>Recent news from the United Kingdom concerning criminal convictions of clergy involved in concluding sham marriages and successful police raids against organised criminal rings involved in sham marriages made after police investigation confirm the Commission’s opinion that there is no need to modify the existing EU legislative framework to allow Member States to take effective steps against abuse.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This summer, the Commission published a Green Paper entitled ‘Towards adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems’ in which it raises a number of issues relating to the solvency regime for pension funds, raising the retirement age and the mobility of pensions. It does not, however, mention the principle of gender equality and totally ignores the issue of the level of women's pensions. Throughout their lives, women are subject to discrimination on the labour market because substantial differences still exist between the pay for men and women doing equivalent work. Women's pensions are also lower because they work in low-pay sectors or because they have to stop working to look after their families, thus further increasing the poverty of women pensioners.</p>
<p>Does the Commission agree that the level of women's pensions should be dealt with as a separate issue, since discrimination on the labour market has an impact on retirement benefits for women?

<p>(EN) The Commission Green Paper “Towards adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems”<a href="#defann_22_1" name="refann_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> covers the gender dimension and makes similar points about the issues facing women to those of the Honourable Member<a href="#defann_22_2" name="refann_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Green Paper brings together the different elements of the EU level pensions framework and this holistic approach has been widely welcomed by stakeholders. The key issue of pension adequacy will therefore be tackled within this framework, where the gender dimension (pension adequacy for women) will continue to feature strongly. The latter involves major emphasis on labour market measures, where the holistic approach pays dividends, for instance through links with the Europe 2020 Strategy. Any specific measures the Commission intends to adopt on the basis of the Green Paper will depend on the outcome of the ongoing consultation. Once stakeholders have given their views the Commission will consider what steps are appropriate next.</p>
<p>The Commission has already taken several initiatives to promote equality between men and women on the labour market, where the pension gender gap originates. In particular these concern the promotion of gender mainstreaming in the European Employment Strategy and a specific campaign the Commission launched in 2009 to tackle the pay gap. Employment inequalities between men and women and their consequences for retirement are given important consideration in the Commission declaration of March 2010 on a Women's Charter<a href="#defann_22_3" name="refann_22_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and in the recent communication on a “Strategy for equality between women and men 2010-2015”<a href="#defann_22_4" name="refann_22_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as part of its work to promote equality between women and men within the Open Method of Coordination in the area of social protection and social inclusion, an overarching objective of which is gender equality, the Commission has monitored the gender dimension in Member States' National Strategy Reports and it published its latest assessment in this regard in the 2009 Joint Report on Social Inclusion and Social Protection<a href="#defann_22_5" name="refann_22_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.

<p>(EN) The Commission is particularly concerned about the critical shortage of qualified workers, in many African countries, in the health sector. It is estimated that a minimum of 2.3 health workers per 1000 population are needed in order to provide basic health care. Africa, on average, has 0.8 health workers per 1000 population and Mali even less, compared to 10.3 per 1000 population in Europe. Aware of this challenge and of the benefit which the EU derives as a destination for many of these migrant health workers, the EU has adopted a Strategy for Action on the Crisis in Human Resources for Health in Developing Countries, followed by a European Programme for Action. In 51 countries, including Mali, the EU supports health programmes dealing with human resources for health (HRH). At the global level, the EU is beginning to explore opportunities for stimulating circular migration and for introduction of other mechanisms that would make migration of health workers beneficial for development.</p>
<p>One sub-theme of the thematic programme Investing in People is dedicated to improving health systems and addressing the human resource crisis. Under this component, an EU project is being funded in partnership with World Health Organisation (WHO), so as to strengthen the health workforce development and tackle the critical shortage of health workforce in 57 countries, including 36 African countries, of which Mali.</p>
<p>Existing EU legislation and the legislation in preparation already contain a number of safeguards aiming at preventing "brain drain". For example, Directive 2009/50<a href="#defann_23_1" name="refann_23_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the EU "Blue Card" provides that Member States can refuse applications for Blue Cards in order to ensure ethical recruitment. In addition the Directive does not affect agreements with third countries which list professions suffering from lack of personnel and which are therefore subject to ethical recruitment. Third country nationals who have long-term resident status in the European Union can leave the EU territory for up to a year without losing that status, and this period is extended to two years for highly qualified migrants with a Blue Card. These provisions encourage "circular" migration between the Member States and the migrant's home country, with the accompanying transfer of skills and money.</p>
<p>The European Council also underlines the need to take further steps to maximise the positive and minimise the negative effects of migration on development in line with the Global Approach on Migration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The latest round of negotiations for the trade pillar of the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement took place on 11-15 October 2010 in Brussels.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to regularly inform the European Parliament of the progress of this negotiation. It is notably foreseen that a written report will be sent both to the Trade Policy Committee of the Council and to the INTA Committee of the European Parliament shortly after each round.</p>
<p>It should be noted that a full Trade Sustainable Impact Assessment (SIA) looking into potential economic, social and environmental impacts of an EU-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement has already been conducted and its final reports are publicly available since March 2009 (see http://ec.europa.eu/trade/analysis/sustainability-impact-assessments/assessments</p>
<p>).</p>
<p>The Commissions' response to the findings and recommendations of the study are set out in the SIA position paper published in July 2010.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission has decided to complete this work by more focused economic studies which are expected to be completed in early 2011. These studies will provide an up-to date analysis and information on the overall economic impact of removing tariffs and non-tariff barriers on trade in goods, services and investment, as well as a more detailed assessment of the agricultural impacts.</p>
<p>On this basis, the Commission will take account of the sensitivity of the EU agriculture as a whole, and in particular of relevant agricultural sectors that may be most affected by future concessions. For these specific areas, the Commission will elaborate an agricultural offer which will be both limited to concessions that take into account the sensibilities of the EU relevant markets and production sectors and, of course, compatible with the overall Common Agricultural Policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0511"></a>

<p>Many municipal day centres in Greece are being forced to close for lack of funds and manpower, leaving thousands of children from working-class families without a place. In Athens alone for example, of the 8 816 children seeking places, it has only been possible to accommodate 5 465. In addition, 60 - 70% of day centre staff are facing the prospect of their employment contracts being discontinued. To make matters worse, recruitment of state school teachers is down by 50% this year, while increasing numbers are retiring, leaving an estimated shortfall in excess of 20 000! This problem, compounded by mass unemployment, coupled with drastic cuts in pay and benefits largely attributable to the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the PASOK Government with the EU, ECB and IMF, is making life even harder for working-class families.</p>
<p>Does the Commission acknowledge that the measures adopted under the Memorandum of Understanding are having a devastating effect on working-class families, especially women, as a result of the dramatically worsening situation regarding provision for their children at local day centres and state schools, thereby undermining their right to an education?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed by Greece and the Commission (one behalf of the euro-area Member States) in agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB). The fiscal, financial and structural measures contained in the MoU and the EUR 110 billion financing provided by the euro-area Member States and the IMF are indispensable to pull Greece out of crisis. Without this financing and the MoU measures, the disruption in the Greek economy would be much more drastic and abrupt with an immense economic and social cost for the Greek people. The measures contained in the MoU were drafted in close cooperation between the Greek government and the Commission taking into account the macroeconomic situation but without losing sight social concerns. The Commission acknowledges that the Greek crisis has had a major social cost on several strata of the Greek population. Those costs are, however, mainly the result of the fiscal imbalances, competitiveness issues and financial difficulties that the MoU attempts to fix.</p>
<p>As regards the impact on women of staffing and funding difficulties at childcare facilities and State schools, the Commission draws the Honourable Member’s attention to the fact that the European Social Fund cofinances support to allow women to place their children in childcare facilities through the Human Resources Development operational programme and improvements in the quality of education in general and action to support women such as 'all-day schools' through the Education and Lifelong Learning operational programme. However, up to now implementation of both operational programmes has been slow, a fact that may partly explain the impact on women to which the Honourable Member refers. According to the Greek authorities, progress in implementation is expected to improve in the next few months.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
