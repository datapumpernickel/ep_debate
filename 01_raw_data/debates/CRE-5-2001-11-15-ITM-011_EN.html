<p class="contents">In paragraph four of the Resolution there is a phrase missing, literally ‘which should be compatible with European Union doctrine on cooperation, respect for human rights and democracy’. This was the text agreed by all of the groups according to a document given to the Presidency by the spokesperson for international relations from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">And now, Mr President, I would like to begin my allotted intervention by pointing out that this resolution aims to tackle the problem of the devastation caused by hurricane Michelle, which has particularly affected three countries: Honduras, Nicaragua and Cuba. The effects of this disaster are exacerbated by the fact that the three countries in question have levels of poverty that I personally would call extreme.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that a simple reference was made in the resolution to our recent visit to Nicaragua, in order to provide illustrative evidence of the situation in this country, I would like to point out that Nicaragua is currently the poorest country in Continental America. Fifty per cent of Nicaraguans live in conditions of poverty and 17% in conditions of extreme poverty – to be poor in Nicaragua means living on USD 1 per month.</p>
<p class="contents">In macroeconomic terms, Nicaragua has foreign debt of USD 6 500 million, exports less than a third of what it imports and the country balances its payments and survives, ultimately, thanks to international aid and emigrants' remittances, particularly from the United States and Costa Rica.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the situation in Cuba, on another delegation visit, I think we all will agree that the situation of that country is extremely gloomy. Cuba is currently surviving mostly thanks to emigrants' remittances and, secondly, tourism, which represent more than all other Cuban exports put together.</p>
<p class="contents">This being the case, what the resolution is aiming to achieve is, first and foremost, to show solidarity with the communities affected and with the human victims of the consequences of this hurricane.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and I would like the Commissioner to take special note of this, I would like to express Parliament’s satisfaction with the actions of the Humanitarian Aid Office.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would ask that, in the case of Honduras and Nicaragua, estimated damages be considered within the framework of the Regional Programme for the Reconstruction of Central America.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that we are talking about Nicaragua, there is an amendment tabled by the Socialist Group, and I would like to address the rapporteur here, which says that, as there have been misappropriations of funds – and we are referring to European funds here – certain action has to be taken. I personally took the trouble to call the Commission delegation in Nicaragua. I have a fax here in which they tell me that in no case has there been any proof, nor has there been any investigation into these funds, therefore it cannot be confirmed that there have been misappropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">During the recent visit we discovered that these accusations had occurred at the same time as an election campaign, but there was no judicial decision in this respect. For this reason, it seems extremely reckless to me to make statements on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, with regard to Cuba, the phrase we have added can be interpreted by the various political parties as they see fit. But when we say that we want a cooperation agreement to be reached in line with European doctrine, we mean to agree with what was stated in the Newens report and in the common position; that we will only reach a cooperation agreement when the Cuban regime makes significant progress in the improvement of respect for human rights and progresses towards a pluralist democracy. This is the doctrine of the European Union, which is implicitly expressed in this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not forget that, since then, it has suffered an earthquake, drought and famine. However, despite these disasters, democracy is slowly being established in these countries once again, and the European delegation, of which I am a member, which has just been to Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, is unanimously agreed on this point. The proper running of the elections which have just taken place in Nicaragua is also evidence of this. Therefore, I feel that we can be proud of the decisive role played by the European Union action in the development of democracy in these countries. That is why I call for two measures: firstly, to increase the funds appropriated to the Programme for the Reconstruction of Central America, which currently amounts to EUR 250 million for the 1999-2002 period, since the latest disasters were not taken into consideration; and secondly, to review the European Union’s outdated position on Cuba. Also totally devastated by the latest hurricane, the worst it has suffered for 50 years, Cuba is currently the only country in Central America which has not signed a cooperation agreement with the European Union, and its only hope in these times of trouble is humanitarian, emergency aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I could smile and tell you, with regard to Cuba, not to be more Catholic than the Pope, in the knowledge that he had no difficulty in identifying the right choice, but the appalling situation of this countries prevents me from smiling. Rather, I will warn you not to focus on the wrong enemy. The enemy is no longer communism: it is terrorism and terrorism thrives on destitution; democracy cannot be built on famine. Cuba is an important, or rather essential part of the process of bringing integration and peace to Central America which is currently in progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I urge the Council to instruct the Commission to reopen democratic cooperation negotiations with Cuba, insisting on total respect for European democratic values, which will not accept two different sets of values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both the delegation which, as Mr García Margallo said, visited Cuba and El Salvador, and the previous delegation that went to Honduras and Nicaragua, were able to see first hand the situation in which these countries find themselves, which, it must be said, is gloomy. Nobody would say, however, that the situation in Cuba is gloomy; of course there are many problems that Cuba has to resolve, but these are nothing to be gloomy about, as anyone who has travelled to Cuba will tell you.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, Mr President, I think we have to congratulate the European Commission for their speedy reaction to this catastrophe. We also have to acknowledge the fact that in Cuba there have not been so many victims thanks to the very quick reaction and very good organisation of the public authorities serving both the general public and tourists. Several Spanish tourists said on TV that they had been looked after very well during this situation of emergency.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very happy that the last phrase from paragraph 4 had been removed, which is a last minute amendment. For the fact that there should be a common position that prevents there being a normal relationship with Cuba, as there is with other countries, is regretted by non-governmental organisations, the church, representatives of the European Union, and even dissidents.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite a sad matter for the European Union that Cuba is the only country in Latin America with which there is no cooperation agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that when a resolution such as this one is approved in this House, it has to be done by a majority. If it is true that there was agreement on that phrase being included, then it should be; but, naturally, it is regrettable that there is no cooperation agreement with Cuba, because what is required from this country should be the same as for all the others.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday we debated this issue and we saw that neither Turkey nor Morocco nor a large number of countries in Latin America have been asked to implement measures before an agreement can be reached. We have only asked this of Cuba. This is the difference, and it was made clear in this House, Mr President. For this reason, if the phrase has to be included, then include it, but it is regrettable that it is only Cuba which is required to fulfil these conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Along with Iris, on 8 October, and Mitch, which we have not forgotten, this hurricane is one of a long list of natural disasters which regularly affect areas which are already suffering, adding tragedy to poverty. These disasters, termed natural disasters, are a further reminder that climate change and non-sustainable development exacerbate the already substantial devastation and will continue to do so in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the European Union is to be congratulated on the aid it is sending to Honduras and Nicaragua, it must be noted that Cuba is totally excluded from this demonstration of solidarity. Cuba, which has suffered its worst disaster in 50 years, is unable to receive our help, for it is the only country in Latin and Central America which does not have a cooperation agreement with the European Union. This situation is no longer appropriate: it is our duty to restate the need for a cooperation agreement focusing on environmentally sustainable development to be signed with Cuba without delay, and to review the European Union’s position.</p>
<p class="contents">We advocate equal treatment for all countries, and Cuba is certainly not benefiting from the same treatment as other countries. Moreover, the American embargo on relations with the island is preventing it from buying the food and medical supplies so desperately needed by the people of Cuba. The pharmacies are empty and there is a shortage of everything in the hospitals. We cannot tolerate a situation which deprives an entire people of the aid received by neighbouring countries which have suffered the same disasters. In order to change this, we must also support the call for the embargo against Cuba to be lifted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The principal role was initially taken by our own European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) and it appears that the Commission acted with the necessary speed by means of this office. But the action of the European Union should not stop at this point and we should make a significant contribution to the reconstruction of everything which has been destroyed or damaged by Hurricane Michelle.</p>
<p class="contents">A large proportion of our efforts will be included within the Reconstruction Plan for Central America and within the framework of the Union’s agreements with Honduras and with Nicaragua. This is where we fall down, due to the pitiful lack of a similar agreement with the Republic of Cuba. This is something that we are continually denouncing here in this House. It makes no sense that Cuba, for whom, amongst other things, the Member States of the European Union include their main economic, commercial and tourism partners, should be the only country in Latin America with which the European Union has not signed a cooperation agreement. For this reason, at the present time, the European Union is restricted to acting almost exclusively within the field of humanitarian and emergency aid.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House would ask the Commission to show a high degree of flexibility when considering the suitability of projects which, in addition to this type of aid, also contribute to surmounting the damage and helping with the reconstruction of those sectors that have been most affected on the island by the effects of the hurricane.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that we revise the European Union’s common position on Cuba, which today is obsolete and even counterproductive, with a view to achieving the objectives that should have been pursued in 1996 when it was established, that is to say, the progress and prosperity of the Cuban people. I would also have preferred that the paragraph added by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats had requested the same from Cuba as is requested from other countries with which the European Union cooperates. In any case, I do not think that the situation in Cuba is as gloomy as those who are determined to criticise that country would have us believe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we hope that the dialogue, without preconditions and without the exclusion of any particular subject from the agenda, that appears to have been re-initiated with the meeting this Monday in New York between the President of the Council and the Cuban Chancellor, will soon bear fruit and led to the signing of a cooperation treaty that will benefit Cuba and that will allow the European Union to act under normal conditions, with a greater degree of efficiency and with more influence in their relations with this country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its reputation and image abroad has been damaged by the violence, massacres and abuses of human rights there, but that is nothing compared with the pain and suffering of its people at home. One million people died in the fight for independence and another 100 000 have died in the current power struggles between Islamic militants and the military and among the minority Berber community seeking political and cultural recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">Now in this country, four fifths of which – ironically – is Saharan desert, we have the catastrophe of flooding in Algiers with the death toll in flash floods rising towards 1 000 as the grim task of sifting through the mud and the rubble goes on. It is not the first such calamity. In 1994, 30 000 people were made homeless in the Tindouf area, but the difference is that on that occasion seven lives were lost, while this time 693 people have already died and over 300 people are missing, with some 20 000 people thought to be homeless.</p>
<p class="contents">The urgency now is for the European Union to play its part in providing humanitarian aid. There is a clear need for shelter, for food, for medical supplies and I certainly welcome the EUR 750 000 which has been given for this purpose under the ECHO fund, and indeed the promised EUR 225 million from the European Investment Bank for drinking water supply lines.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a need for adequate heavy equipment to deal with situations like this and even picks and shovels seem to be in short supply. Certainly no sniffer dogs appear to be available. Given Algeria's position in an earthquake area it would certainly be prudent to have such things available for the future. I would like to hear from the Commission what proposals it has to deal with this. There is also the need to look at the policy of sealing the floodwater drains against terrorist activities, which in this case has clearly exacerbated the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though Algeria is further south than our homelands, we know that it can be cold and very wet in winter. That is why aid is absolutely essential and everything that can be done to reduce the suffering must be done, and it must be done unconditionally. This does not mean that we will not hope that something good will nevertheless come out of this terrible catastrophe and out of our provision of aid, namely that Algeria will find a way to really step up the necessary dialogue with those who want peace and freedom in that country. The sacrifices which have been made in Algeria, not only during the war against their colonial masters but also in recent years and months, are horrendous. The acts are horrendous, and it is high time that the government and the president of this country found a way out of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Expectations were high when Bouteflika was elected President, but there have also been many disappointments in recent months: disappointment that more is said than done; disappointment that the people are addressed <span class="italic">ex cathedra</span> and not consulted. The tragic events in Kabylia – a commission in Algeria itself investigated them and uncovered their causes, amongst other things – should be reason enough to change the dynamics of communication and political relations in Algeria. In the case of the unrest in Kabylia – which, of course, then spread to the whole country or to wide areas of it – it was simply not true that it was started by a handful of anarchists and others who were following foreign orders: the Algerian commission itself established that it was above all the inappropriate behaviour of the security forces which was responsible. That is why the tragic events of the last few days should also be seen as an opportunity in Algeria to try to pursue a different policy, a policy which consists of offering the people more opportunities and more chances, including economic and social ones.</p>

<p class="contents">Also, in this case, the resolution congratulates the European Commission on its speedy reaction, but special emergency aid will probably be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the European Parliament colegislates the budget with the Council, and, therefore, the result is what we achieve together, I know, but I am filled with sorrow – especially on these afternoons when we have to talk about so many catastrophes – that there is no sufficient budget heading that can be used in such cases, because we always find ourselves having to beg for, or to transfer some money from elsewhere to deal with these tragedies.</p>

In fact a debate is currently raging about this idea of concern. Recently, at a large meeting in Nuremberg, a leading German Orientalist complained that in parts of the Islamic world people were not concerned enough about the atrocious events in New York. At the time I replied that we too have shown very little concern about Chechnya, where over 100 000 people have been murdered, or Iraq, where over 100 000 people, mainly children, have starved to death. In fact there is a kind of partial culture of concern which is divided along cultural and geographical lines.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need to ensure that we also have compassion for our Muslim and Arab partners when they are hit by catastrophes of this kind, so that terrorists cannot – and after all this was the aim of 11 September – play off one civilisation against another and actually orchestrate the 'clash of civilisations'. The dead in Algeria are also our dead. The homeless in Algeria are also our homeless. If we speak of a global village in economic terms then we must also speak of a global village of compassion and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, where our partners in the Mediterranean, in the Arab world, are concerned, who are on our doorstep and with whom we need to work more closely than ever, it is the European Union's duty to provide substantial humanitarian aid, and also to ensure that Algeria is put in a position where it is more capable than it has been in the past of helping itself. Helping people to help themselves must be our overriding aim, but of course our aim now must also be to provide the victims of this disaster with direct practical help, not only by giving them money, not only by writing them a big cheque, but also by making it clear to them that what happens to them is something which we Europeans are deeply concerned about, something which matters to us as much as what happens to ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, as far as Hurricane Michelle is concerned, the Commission has been closely monitoring its effects in Central America in the Caribbean area since the beginning of the crisis, in cooperation with our experts and partners in this field. Michelle started on 29 October as a tropical storm off the northern coast of Nicaragua and Honduras, where it caused severe floods. The communication systems proved their efficiency as they were the only working systems that allowed for a quick evaluation in areas of difficult access such as Moskita. On 1 November, ECHO started discussions with the NGOs present in the field to establish emergency systems, particularly in the Moskita region in Honduras and Nicaragua – the areas worst hit.</p>
<p class="contents">On 4 November, Michelle became a hurricane that crossed Cuba and touched Jamaica. Fortunately, the local authorities had undertaken timely evacuation measures. ECHO services decided on funding once an initial evaluation of the hurricane damage had been carried out in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">This decision to allocate EUR 1 050 000, should be approved by the end of this week and will cover the Moskita region in Honduras and Nicaragua, Cuba and Jamaica. The decision will mainly involve the evacuation of people in danger, food aid for Honduras, the provision of temporary shelter in Jamaica and the distribution of water, sanitation and health packages in all countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of this House have raised two main issues. One concerns Nicaragua. I should like to assure you that all the distributed funds are regularly monitored and no irregularities have been detected so far. That was the assessment of the Parliament delegation that visited Nicaragua.</p>
<p class="contents">The second comment concerned Cuba. Some people wanted a revision of the EU Common Position on Cuba, announced on 25 June 2001. But it kept being said Cuba had not been given any humanitarian aid until now. In fact Cuba has benefited from around EUR 125 million in aid since 1993, largely in the humanitarian field, as well as the food security programme and some budget line assistance. But for the time being, the line followed by the Commission is as proposed in the latest European Union Common Position which I have already referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Algeria is concerned, the situation in the country is very complex. There are many different kinds of problems, but I will only refer to the problem of the flooding last weekend.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has followed the situation with great attention and concern. President Prodi sent a message to President Bouteflika to express the solidarity of the European Union with the Algerian flood victims. Therefore the Commission, through its humanitarian aid office, has moved quickly in response to the floods.</p>
<p class="contents">A decision to allocate EUR 758 800 of humanitarian aid has been taken under the primary emergency procedure to help meet the urgent needs of the victims. The funds are already being used for a range of support measures including temporary shelter, beds, clothing and blankets, water, sanitation and medical assistance. Humanitarian operations funded under this decision will be implemented by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and by two NGOs – Médicins du Monde and Médicins sans Frontières.</p>
<p class="contents">With those decisions on Hurricane Michelle and the Algerian floods, the Commission underlines its determination to address the needs of victims of humanitarian disasters whenever they occur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
