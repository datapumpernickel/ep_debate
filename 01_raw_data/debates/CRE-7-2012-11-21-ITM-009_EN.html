<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin Schulz, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President</span><span class="bold">. − </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, last Tuesday at midnight, the 21-day deadline for budget conciliation pursuant to Article 314 of the Treaty expired. The delegations of the Council and Parliament were unable to reach agreement on a draft text. This means that the budgetary procedure for the 2013 budget, based on the Commission draft, has temporarily broken down. As provided for in the Treaty for such contingencies, the Commission must now present a new draft. It has already announced that it will submit a new proposal on Friday this week, i.e. on 23 November, in the hope that the Council and Parliament, as equal parts of the budgetary authority, will be able to reach a compromise which would enable a regular budget for 2013 to come into effect on 1 January 2013. </p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it clear that the European Parliament is of course mindful of its responsibility in the budgetary procedure and, like the European Commission, is seeking to reach an agreement. We are aware that if no agreement is reached, a system of provisional twelfths will be put in place until an agreement can be reached. This is a viable way forward for the next budget year, but it is certainly not an ideal solution. Nonetheless, Parliament cannot give its approval to an agreement that is achieved at any price.</p>
<p class="contents">With our budget, we are at a crossroads. Over the past two years, we trusted the assurances given by the Member States and accepted these assurances on the Council’s positions on payments, which were in all cases far below the Commission draft for the budget year in question. We did so in recognition of the difficult budgetary situation in some of our Member States. It was clear to all the institutions that the Union could not manage, and cannot manage, this assumed level of payments. </p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Council and Parliament, at the end of the budget negotiations in each of the past two years, have formally declared that all the payments that could not be made from the adopted budget would be dealt with under an amending budget, and that this would happen quickly and in a straightforward manner. In a joint statement, both parts of the budgetary authority – Parliament and Council – announced that they wished to proceed in this manner. I would like to read part of the statement to you. I quote the English version of the text: </p>
<p class="contents">Taking into account the ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts in Member States, the Council and the European Parliament agree on a reduction of the level of payment appropriations for 2012 as compared to the Commission’s draft budget. They ask the Commission to request additional payment appropriations in an amending budget if the appropriations entered in the 2012 budget are insufficient. The Council and the European Parliament will take position on any draft amending budget as quickly as possible in order to avoid any shortfall in payment appropriations. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a statement by Members of Parliament who have lost touch with reality. This is a statement by the Member States of the European Union. This is our position now. The Commission has accumulated various unpaid accounts for the 2012 budget year. They relate to cohesion, the Social Fund, research, and Erasmus. They are accounts that need to be paid, amounting to EUR 9 billion. Let me say again that the funding requirement to cover these additional payments for 2012 – and, I might add, these only go up to 31 October – is not based on estimates or assumptions but on legally binding commitments which the Commission must fulfil. Before we can hold serious negotiations about the budget for 2013, the 2012 budget year must be signed off as correct.</p>
<p class="contents">As it is not yet certain how many unpaid accounts will still be on the table on 31 December 2012, it is impossible to make a serious decision about the budgetary requirement for 2013. The Member States failed to produce credible assurances by the end of the conciliation period that they are willing to abide by the statement they made in November 2011 on the 2012 budget and cover the EUR 9 billion shortfall.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike traditional budget negotiations, however, there is no scope for concessions here. If I have accounts to pay, amounting in this instance to EUR 9 billion, I cannot make a maximum offer of EUR 2, 3 or 4 billion instead. However, that is the approach that was taken by the Member States until Tuesday evening. It was not possible to reach an agreement with Parliament on that basis, for what the Member States were demanding was nothing less than a budget deficit. </p>
<p class="contents">However, this House is not prepared to adopt this approach at the European level, even if some Member States customarily apply it to their national budgets. It is not a viable way forward. If we do not solve the problems for 2012 and carry too many unpaid accounts forward to 2013 – and, I might add, these would then also attract interest for late payment – we will face intractable problems in 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the sound financial management that we are obliged to uphold under the budget regulations. It is quite clear that the 2013 budget must be sufficient to meet all the payment obligations for next year. Any remaining liabilities from 2012, for example relating to October and November of the current year, must be met from additional budget resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament will continue to fight for its priorities, namely growth, competitiveness and employment. Here, the Commission’s draft, including commitment appropriations in category 1a, for example, undoubtedly need to be improved. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are prepared to work constructively and earnestly with the Council to achieve a quick solution to unresolved issues. We want a 2013 budget. We are willing and open to negotiations and we are confident that after the presentation of the Commission’s new draft budget, as soon as the procedure has restarted, the Council will also recognise that we have to pay the bills.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end on a positive note. At Parliament’s insistence – and I myself worked intensively on this issue and would like to thank everyone involved, particularly Mr Lamassoure, but also Mr La Via and Ms Balzani; we all worked hard here – we were at least able to convince the Member States that the fifth amending budget for 2012 should be adopted swiftly, with assistance amounting to EUR 670 million being mobilised from the Solidarity Fund for the victims of the earthquake in Italy. </p>
<p class="contents">With the vote on the amending budget at noon today, we signalled our active solidarity with one of our Member States and its citizens. Minister Mavroyiannis and I signed this amending budget a few moments ago, so that these funds can now be made available to the people who are most affected in the communities worst affected in Emilia-Romagna. This is genuine solidarity. Let us hope that the other budget issues can be brought to a positive conclusion so that during the December part-session, we can vote on an adequate sixth amending budget for 2012 as well as a solid budget for 2013. </p>
<p class="contents">One final comment, ladies and gentlemen: this budgetary procedure was new territory for me, at least in my capacity as President of the House. It has been a steep learning curve. The main lesson I have learned is this: there is a stark contrast between the term ‘the Council’ and the reality of its members. ‘The Council’ is not Mr Mavroyiannis, nor is it all the Member States. However, in the Council, there are some Member States that are not willing to honour their pledges and Member States that are willing to lead us into budget deficit. In other words, they are demanding that we adopt the same reckless approach that they have applied for far too long and far too often to their national budgets. I am pleased to say that our budget experts in this House – and, I believe, the vast majority of Members as well – are not willing to go along with that.</p>

From Parliament’s point of view, it has been clear from the outset – as we have always underlined in our formal and informal discussions – that it would not be possible to deal with the matter of the 2013 budget without first closing the 2012 accounts. This required careful examination of Draft amending budget No 5 – on which we voted this morning and on which, as Mr Schulz has stated, there was some hesitation – and above all of draft amending budget No 6 for 2012 and of the 2013 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in fact impossible to consider the appropriations for 2013 since the Commission proposed the budget without taking account of some rollovers of payments from the previous year. The risk of remaining without a budget and applying twelfths arrangements are quite evident and Parliament will make every effort to avoid this situation, but clearly we must defend our priorities. As for payments, we are calling for agreement on a suitable level that would allow the normal performance of all EU policies. With regard to commitments, we strongly believe in the need to invest in growth, development and employment. These are the priorities of the Council, and Parliament also chose them as priorities in its reading of the 2013 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We are certainly aware of the difficulties of the Member States and take them into account during negotiations, but this cannot be taken to mean that the European Parliament is willing to sacrifice growth in the EU on the altar of austerity, without exception, as is being demanded by some national governments. I am however confident, in view of the atmosphere of mutual trust that has been established between the institutions, that agreement will be reached on the budget. But I would underline the fact that Parliament has the intention of exerting its prerogatives in the ordinary legislative procedure, as recognised in the Treaty of Lisbon, to ensure correct implementation of EU policy in favour of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been no agreement because we have not even begun to discuss the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still waiting for the Council to pay the outstanding invoices for 2012. President Schulz talked about this, as did the rapporteur for the 2013 budget, Mr La Via. In Parliament we have a very clear and logical position: we cannot start to talk of the next budget until this year’s problems are resolved. Indeed, this year’s problems are invoices, amounting to EUR 9 billion, which have yet to be paid and which directly affect many citizens in all countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mavroyiannis, 500 workers in my country cannot receive assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, but the same applies to 512 workers in Italy, 1 052 in Austria, 1 000 in Finland, 1 900 in Romania and 303 in Denmark. However, they are not the only people affected. European students do not know if they are going to receive Erasmus grants. Researchers in businesses and universities do not know if they are going to be paid for the work they have done. Why? Because the members of the Council cannot agree to pay, and that is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we have been unable to make any progress on the negotiations and that is why we are now waiting for the European Commission to present a new proposal. The Commission is aware of Parliament’s position and we hope that its proposal will be consistent with it.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that there is sufficient room in the budget to give more resources to a number of European programmes. We believe that we need to strengthen the programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, research and innovation under the Seventh Framework Programme, and training and mobility programmes for our young people.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, there is not a big difference between Parliament and the Council when it comes to our priorities and I think that we can reach a rapid and satisfactory agreement, but the bigger problem with the agreement is, once again, the level of payments. If we do not want our programmes to be at a standstill again, with students worried about grants, or regions and local councils waiting for the money they were promised, the Commission cannot reduce its proposal. In fact, it should increase it, because we now know that neither the November nor the December invoices are going to be paid in 2012 and that we will need more money for 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">After two years of promises and unfulfilled commitments, Parliament cannot accept another joint statement in which the Council promises to put in more money if it is needed. We will not make the same mistake again. If our budget is at an impasse today, it is because the Council is not fulfilling its commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mavroyiannis, I hope that you can reach an agreement. It is in the Council’s hands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem with the Council very often is that they make concessions to us in the negotiations and then, when the ink on those concessions is dry, they forget and say that Parliament’s demands are outrageous ‘because the circumstances have changed so much since we signed, that everyone must understand that it is no longer possible’.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is completely clear: if you sign a contact, if you enter into an obligation, you should not be surprised when the bills come in and have to be paid. That is the way it is everywhere, including in Parliament. There is no point in saying that the budget cannot increase by more than inflation, and so on. It is simply a matter of fact that once you have entered into obligations, the time arrives when you have to pay.</p>
<p class="contents">The question here is: are the Commission’s estimates right or not? There is always a great deal of misunderstanding about those estimates. This is because, if we were to believe the Member State’s own estimates that they submit to the Commission, then the budget would not have to increase by 6 or 7 % but double that. What we need first is a specific body at the level of the Member States to investigate carefully whether the estimates that the Member States submit to the Commission are correct or not. – I do have two minutes, by the way Mr President.– We need therefore to investigate whether these estimates are correct and if they are, then all that bickering about the budget for payments should not be so problematic every year. If you want the payments to be lower, there is only one solution and that is to reduce the obligations.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It gave the impression that it was the Parliament refusing to cooperate unless they received more money. In fact, the President of Parliament, before he left the Chamber, set out the case very clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a technical dispute. It is a retrospective issue regarding EUR 9 billion, which is the sum which is reflected in draft amending budget 6. Long term, as Mr Mulder has just pointed out, the lessons to be learned are that we need far greater security and control of estimates and costs from the Member States. But for the immediate what we want to see is a freeze in the size of the 2013 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">So we fully accept that we cannot reasonably be expected to carry forward such a large liability, a liability which would be in excess of EUR 20 billion, from 2012 to 2013. It is clear that this is an issue for Council to resolve. I therefore think that we in this Parliament should seek a positive engagement with Council with a view to an early conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was due to the fact that the Commission came up with a request for EUR 9 billion more to cover this year’s payments. I have been deeply sceptical about the need for this extra cash. Most Member States cannot afford cofinancing in these times of crisis. We need to remember that in February this year, two months after the close of the 2011 accounts, the Budget Commissioner told us that there was a shortfall of EUR 11 billion. Then in April, two months later, he told us there was a EUR 1.5 billion surplus. Then, at the conciliation last week, Mr Lewandowski came up with a reduction on payment needs for 2012 of EUR 1.5 billion. So which number should we believe now?</p>
<p class="contents">This behaviour has seriously affected the credibility of the negotiators, notably the Commission. No more money should be granted to the Commission as long as it fails to produce reliable and precise information. I have been saying this for many years now.</p>

<p class="contents">The Cyprus Presidency did its utmost to achieve a positive outcome within the given timeframe. We worked hard to try to reconcile positions right up to the last few hours. But in the end we had to accept that the views of our two institutions remained far apart, and that it was therefore unfortunately not possible to reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council believes that it showed considerable openness throughout the negotiations, and in particular during the last few days of the conciliation period. It was able to make some progress, and specifically was able to approve one of the key elements of the negotiation package – the draft amending budget No 5 for 2012 related to the mobilisation of EUR 670 million from the EU Solidarity Fund in support of Italy – without any modifications to the Commission’s proposal. Despite this, we were not able to find the necessary flexibility in each of our institutions needed to make further progress on the 2013 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The mandate given to the Conciliation Committee was to find an agreement on the 2013 budget. However, it proved impossible to find a way forward on this issue without having addressed first the issue of the draft amending budget No 6 for 2012, which seeks EUR 9 billion in additional payment appropriations for this year. Ms Gardiazábal Rubial is right that Erasmus and globalisation are part of draft amending budget No 6 and we understand and appreciate the sense of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council was and is ready to discuss all elements of the budgetary package and is committed to honouring our payment obligations, but we continue to take the view that they cannot be dealt with in isolation from each other if we are to find a balanced outcome which will meet the concerns of all parties. This was in fact the hiatus between our respective positions. For us, there is an inescapable link between draft amending budget No 6 for 2012 and the 2013 budget, since both of them aim at ensuring the continuity of the same European Union programmes and actions, and both of them have to be financed from the same contributions from the Member States. Of course, having said that, it has to be very clear that we fully honour and respect the rights and prerogatives of Parliament and the essence and the nature of the budgetary procedure (i.e., colegislation, codecision); there is even an edge in your favour under some specific circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have only a few weeks left until the end of this year. We now of course await, as was said, a new draft budget from the Commission which will need to take due account of the progress we have made to date in reconciling the different positions of our two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, I would have preferred to have been in a different situation to that which we find ourselves in today. But I remain hopeful that we can still reach a positive outcome in the short time that is left to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cyprus Presidency will do its utmost to make rapid progress on the basis of the new draft budget. We count on Parliament’s willingness to engage in a constructive dialogue so that we can have an EU budget in place from the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that our collective credibility would be at stake if we failed to deliver this time round. It would simply not be understood if we were unable to reach agreement given what is at stake. But I am convinced that we can overcome the difficulties and reach a compromise. The Cyprus Presidency – and I personally – am committed to delivering a successful outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You will understand why it is quite a busy time for him so that is why I would like on his behalf and that of the Commission to echo what the President said in his introductory remark and welcome the approval of amending budget No 5 which will allow the payment of much awaited support to the people and authorities of Emilia-Romagna. I think that is just one example of what an EU money can actually do and why it matters.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Commission regrets it was not possible to reach agreement on the 2013 budget within the conciliation period foreseen in the Treaty, we are convinced that we can still find a solution by the end of this year and in the next days the Commission will present a new draft budget, as foreseen in Article 314 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there are differences in the positions of Parliament and the Council, the Conciliation Committee already made some progress in identifying possible elements of compromise on the 2013 budget. The Commission is taking these into account in preparing its new draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, the Commission hopes to maximise the chances for Council and Parliament to reach agreement on the 2013 budget before the end of the year and thus avoid recourse to provisional twelfths.</p>
<p class="contents">The level of payments is a key outstanding issue. During the conciliation, one real sticking point related to the shortage of payment appropriations in the budget and the additional payment appropriations requested by the Commission for the year 2012. We are all aware of the economic difficulties facing Europe and of the austerity measures prevailing across Member States. However, it is the Union’s duty to meet its legal obligations resulting from commitments made in the current and previous budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Draft amending budget No 6 is still on the table and there is general recognition that bills have to be paid, and I say to Mrs Andreasen: real bills, real commitments, not estimates; it is also about the credibility of what we are doing here. </p>
<p class="contents">A reasonable solution on meeting the payment needs in 2012 must be found now if the EU is to keep its credibility vis-à-vis national and regional authorities who have advanced the funds in the areas of cohesion and rural development, and also towards SMEs, researchers and, as has been mentioned already, students who are awaiting payments under programmes such as Erasmus and the Research Framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that an adequate and realistic level of payments is necessary to keep supporting investments on growth and job-enhancing measures, which are priorities shared by all institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just return to the 2013 budget and what comes next. The Commission will do its utmost to present a new draft budget that can be a sound basis for an agreement by Parliament and Council, and will continue to act as an honest broker to facilitate a swift adoption of the 2013 budget. We have already faced a similar situation back in 2010, with the first budget under the new Lisbon Treaty rules. At that time, after the failure of the Conciliation Committee, all institutions worked together in a very constructive and intense manner, which allowed for the adoption of the 2011 budget in due time.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just finish, Mr President, by mentioning some of the consequences of not achieving this, because we believe that the consequences should not be underestimated. Just a few examples: implementation of key EU programmes and actions will be delayed with immediate effects on beneficiaries. That would include, among others, delayed reimbursements for expenditure on direct aid for agriculture because between 75 % and 80 % of the appropriations for direct aids are required for reimbursements in January and February 2013 next year.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be impossible to mobilise any of the special instruments like the EU Solidarity Fund, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, or the Emergency Aid Reserve. And just a final example: some of the EU regulatory agencies which are in start-up phase and are to take on new tasks would face considerable difficulties in fulfilling their role – this would be the case for example with the large-scale IT systems agency in the area of home affairs, which will become operational in the next few days.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that both Parliament and the Cyprus Presidency are aware of these risks and that both are willing to cooperate intensively in the next two weeks to pave the way for a sound agreement before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">I express my sincere hope for a solution, and trust that, based on common efforts, we will be able to meet in this House in December to endorse an agreed budget for 2013 which reflects shared priorities, can contribute to creating the conditions for economic growth, and shows the Union’s ability to act, which is the best signal we can send to EU citizens in these difficult times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For two consecutive years, a qualified majority of this Parliament agreed to the level of payments adopted by the Council of Ministers without adding a single euro. In its votes, Parliament ensured that precedence was given to its political priorities. They are same as the priorities of the European Council: the Europe 2020 agenda and, more recently, the content of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">That same sense of responsibility guides us today when we say – as President Schulz did – that the 2013 budget cannot be discussed while we have yet to guarantee the financing of the 2012 payments in arrears. None of the 27 Ministers disputes the amount of these arrears, which total EUR 9 billion. However, some of them do not want to pay, in 2012, all of the outstanding payments for the programmes that were carried out in full in 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">That attitude is contrary to the financial regulation. It is contrary to the 2012 budget that we adopted. It includes the commitment, as President Schulz just said, to adopt, if necessary, an amending budget in the course of the year. Above all, that attitude is contrary to the Treaty itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The European budget has to be balanced, which means that it has to be adopted in a balanced manner, but also that it has to be implemented in a balanced manner. We cannot get to the end of the year with a debt of EUR 9 billion. I would add that on the eve of the European Council, the refusal to pay yesterday’s invoices would means that commitments to future budgets would have no credibility whatsoever. In the meantime, this rejection of the 2013 budget reminds those who might have forgotten, in certain capitals, that when it comes to the budget, whether we are negotiating for one year or for seven years, nothing is possible with the European Parliament’s agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust the Commission – and I welcome its new Budget Commissioner – to prepare a new text that takes into account the state of play of our discussions and to act as facilitator, and we trust the Cypriot Presidency, which has been particularly active, to take the necessary initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am delighted that draft amending budget No 5 has finally been agreed. For us in Parliament this was a moral issue and not a financial or a budget issue, so we are pleased with that. I am disappointed, however, that no agreement was possible on draft amending budget No 6. I am concerned that legal commitments will not be met and I am even more concerned about the future of some programmes and some projects. I would hope that the Council could come to some agreement amongst themselves on this matter because this is really a fight within the Council and they need to sort that out.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning briefly to the issue of Parliament’s and the other sections budgets, I just want to remind colleagues in this House how well we did. We have kept our increase next year down to 1.9 %, we have frozen Members’ allowances and cut various other budget lines. Of course, the 1.9 % figure includes the extra costs of Croatia and a 1.7 % salary increase so the real operating increase for this Parliament next year is only around 0.6 %, a cut in real terms. I think the Parliament can be proud of that.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the other sections’ budgets, there are really only two outstanding issues now. One is the overall level of increases which are to be given to the other institutions. The Council still wants a blanket freeze for all institutions in the budget next year. We are saying that is wrong. All the institutions are different and have different needs. Therefore we need to look at giving some of them an increase, but of course we are encouraging them to keep their increase down below 1.9 % as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The other outstanding matter is the 1.7 % salary increase, which is currently with the Court of Justice. This Parliament believes that it is prudent and wise to put that 1.7 % salary increase into reserve. Indeed, the matter could be worse because if the Court does uphold that salary increase, we could be looking at finding funds going back to July 2007. So I would urge the Council, even at this stage, to make the concession and to say we should be putting that 1.7 % salary increase into reserve. This Parliament thinks it is wise and prudent to do so.</p>

The hesitation regarding provision of financial assistance to the earthquake victims of Emilia-Romagna constitutes one of the most shameful episodes since the founding of the EU. There are many signs, however, that the Union is in danger of disappearing altogether. Various Member States are no longer willing to listen to requests from the Commission, evidence that the European Union is no longer able to generate interest or demonstrate its usefulness. One thing must be made clear: commitments made must be fulfilled and therefore any programmes that have been defined and established, such as Erasmus, must be provided with the resources necessary to continue. In the future we must act in a more pragmatic and less ideological fashion, setting ourselves objectives that are real priorities. I think that the first thing we should change is this European Union as it exists today. Nobody believes in it, least of all the Member States who founded it but who longer wish to fund it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This budget is asking Finns for 35 cents a day. However, the budget must also be financially responsible, and the Union must take care to ensure that unintentional and intentional abuses are eradicated, root and branch.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must therefore take care to ensure that we are not ashamed to send the following message to our citizens. This is because the message is not easy, it is not to be taken lightly, it is not a Saturday requests programme, and the message is this: the fine line being trodden by the Member States in the budgetary framework negotiations is irresponsible. Citizens are formulating an image whereby our money, the citizens’ money, is being taken good care of and that the EU’s budget will be cut. If we go down that route and continue on it, the whole basis for the existence of the Union will crumble. Ultimately, what is at stake is whether we will build this continent together or whether we will not build any continent at all, because that is the question that is being asked about the European Union now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have approved them, we have scrutinised them, and we now have to pay for them. The accounts will certainly be paid; the question is when. If we do not reach agreement in the talks on the 2012 budget, they will be carried forward to 2013. If we fail to reach an agreement then, the ceilings will be used as the basis and the system of provisional twelfths will enable us to make these payments, albeit on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, a two-thirds majority in the Council and the approval of Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely important to show the people of Europe that the European programmes genuinely add value. In times of crisis and budget deficits, we need positive economic activity and for that reason, above all, it is important to reach agreement here, especially for those programmes which create jobs and stimulate economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should do so promptly in order to avoid additional interest which would make them even more expensive. It will not enhance our credibility with the public if we cannot disburse funds that they have applied for and have been granted and to which they are legally entitled. </p>
<p class="contents">That is why the amending budget must be formulated as a matter of urgency. The problem that we face for 2013, however, is that if the budget is too low, the amending budget will ultimately be even higher, for the previous year’s commitment appropriations will come back to haunt us, with all their financial implications. I have every understanding for the difficulties posed by crises, but if we genuinely want to make changes, we will have to talk about the commitment appropriations in connection with the multiannual financial framework, and that includes discussing how they should be dealt with. However, the past cannot be dealt with by questioning the law.</p>

Whilst we would all have preferred it if the negotiations had reached a successful outcome by the end of the conciliation period, I think we all share a desire to return to the discussions and are committed to working for a positive outcome by the end of the year.

This year’s annual budgetary procedure takes place under very difficult circumstances. For that reason, particular efforts are required from all sides if we are to reach agreement and establish a realistic and balanced budget for 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cyprus Presidency of the Council, and I personally, will do our utmost to achieve a positive outcome by the end of this year. I would add that we look to the Commission to play its traditional role as honest broker, and I particularly count on Commissioner Lewandowski in relation to both the new draft budget, which he is currently preparing, and the facilitation of our subsequent discussions. I thank you once more for your attention and your understanding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
