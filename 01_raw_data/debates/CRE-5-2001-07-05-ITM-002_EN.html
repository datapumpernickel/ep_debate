<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Callanan (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – It is interesting how, in this House we move seamlessly from global economic policy and world summits to the technical regulations of exhaust and sound level emissions from recreational craft in Europe: such is the broad sweep of politics dealt with in this place. I believe strongly that we must always be extremely wary in Europe of over-regulation, of using 'a sledge-hammer to crack a nut', of introducing unnecessary, cumbersome and bureaucratic regulations. To put this directive into perspective, recreational craft in the EU are responsible for less than half of 1% of all exhaust emissions in the Union and <span class="italic">if</span> it is the case that this regulation turns out to have severe impacts on small boat owners, driving them unnecessarily off the waterways, then sadly this will merely increase disenchantment with Europe among many of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country we have a very thriving small canal boat industry to which Commissioner Patten has just referred. As a former Member of Parliament in the West Country, he will know that industry extremely well. It is composed of many historic craft, the potential for tourism is extremely great and we must be careful to ensure that they are not regulated out of existence. It consists of many small enterprises and enthusiasts. The object of this proposal is to complete the internal market and to protect the health of users and third parties in Europe: those are indeed laudable aims.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as I intimated, I do have a number of concerns about the way these regulations have been framed. First of all, on the issue of retrospectivity. In my view, retrospective laws are often extremely bad laws – they are grossly unfair to existing users and industries which have grown up under an existing regulatory framework. Secondly, they very often act as a perverse incentive. For instance, under the regulations being framed in this directive, if you have an old boat with an old polluting engine, it is perfectly legal provided you do not replace it with a slightly newer possibly even cleaner engine of a greater power rating. If you do that, obviously improving the environment in the process, then you are subject to the full force of these regulations and would possibly be faced with extremely expensive compliance costs for your craft. I cannot see that regulations framed in this way benefit anybody. Furthermore, it is of course extremely difficult to see how they could possibly be policed in practice without having inspectors in every boatyard, every harbour, every port, every river and every canal in Europe, which we are clearly not going to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I also move on and say a couple of words about some of the amendments which have been proposed. I will not mention all of them (the House will be pleased to know). The Socialists have tabled a proposal by Mr Lange which was passed by the Environment Committee (No 30) seeking to impose an additional second table of stricter limits for boats on drinking water lakes. I understand the raison d'être behind that proposal, but I believe that it would prove extremely problematical. Very difficult to implement in practice, it would be a barrier to trade and it would completely contradict the Commission's intention to harmonise the internal market which will be further fragmented. I hope the House will think very closely before supporting that amendment. The proposed limits in Mr Lange's amendments are extremely strict, particularly for two and four-stroke engines. They are technically very difficult to implement and the prospective benefits that are produced are not very great. I am sure that the problems presented in one or two lakes in Germany and Austria could be solved, but imposing these limits throughout the whole of Europe where they are often unnecessary will not do that. It will result in manufacturers producing engines only for their own local markets in their own country and I would urge Parliament to reject those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I also say a word about Mr Lange's other proposed Amendment No 48 on sound level measurements. Without going into the technicalities of it, the new method that he proposes would cause many problems particularly if you had an instantaneous difficulty, particularly say wave-slap, resulting in a one-off sound level measurement which would be very difficult to repeat day after day and therefore very difficult to implement in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal could produce modest environmental benefits, but we must make sure that those modest environmental benefits do not come about at the expense at the loss of hundreds of jobs in many small enterprises across Europe and the pricing of many European citizens off the waterways which they have enjoyed for many hundreds of years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This leisure activity has become extremely popular over recent years. There are now over 3.5 million motor boats in the European Union and the number is rising. If you include sailing boats and rowing boats, there is one boat for every 70 citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of recreational craft – and here I must disagree somewhat with our rapporteur – is not totally without its problems. Certainly, exhaust emissions compared with overall exhaust emissions from other engines in the European Union are tiny. We have brought about a great many improvements with cars and lorries over recent years and we should seek to achieve fundamental improvements in the recreational craft sector.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, people living on the banks of highly frequented inland waters live with the impression that the noise from motor boats is a constant source of disturbance, even at quiet times. The point here, I think, is that we need to reduce the level of noise generated by these recreational craft. People trying to relax at the weekend and local residents in particular sometimes have to put up with a great deal of disturbance, precisely because of the increase in the number of recreational craft.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor must we underestimate the noise generated when the water is displaced by boats travelling at high speed. Implementing the directive will reduce noise and exhaust emission levels. I too think that the derogations proposed in committee are right. More importantly, I think the derogations for historic craft and self-build craft are justified. Building these craft often takes a long time and is a leisure activity in itself. We need to retain this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as I have already mentioned, recreational craft are used in areas in which there are large numbers of people trying to relax, which is why it is especially important to keep on reducing noise pollution and why I think it would be wrong to allow any further derogations. However, I think it is right that, even with the need for harmonisation, Member States should still be able to issue stricter requirements for inland waters used for drinking water supplies. This has nothing to do with making inland waters off limits; it is a move towards reducing costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think Mr Schnellhardt has highlighted the main point. The equipment at issue here – recreational craft and, more importantly, jet skis – is used solely for leisure activities. In other words, it is something our society can do without. If we are to pollute the environment not because society needs to but merely in the pursuit of leisure, then this equipment should be as clean and quiet as possible. It is therefore right and proper that we should want to improve on one or two points in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">With all due respect to our rapporteur, this is not about canal boats in Great Britain, it is not about self-build craft which are not marketed. That is not where the problem lies and we have allowed derogations for these craft. The main problem is with sports craft and – I repeat – jet skis in particular, which are produced in large numbers and used on sensitive inland waters, including waters used for relaxation and drinking water supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we need very strict provisions for these areas in order to transfer the technology which we have already adapted and introduced for other mobile engines – in cars and lorries – to engines for recreational craft. This cannot be done from one day to the next. That much is obvious. We need a certain transitional period here, we are all pragmatists here, and we shall give manufacturers a transitional period. We need to apply the technology, however, so that leisure activities cause the minimum possible exhaust emissions and the minimum possible noise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that we take into account current developments, for example with four-stroke engines, which the Commission’s proposal does. I believe that the Commission’s proposal, along with the improvements which we are adding here, will reduce emissions considerably. It is said that exhaust gases will be cut by half. In this way, we will be able to contribute to improvements in sensitive water environments.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Finn, and not necessarily as a representative of the ELDR Group, I must say, however, that I am worried about the two-tier system which the rapporteur proposes. Otherwise, I believe that on many points he has drawn up a realistic proposal which corrects certain errors in the Commission’s proposal and which takes into account the costs and classic boats. I, myself, have a boat over 30 years old in my boat house which would not meet these standards; I believe it is a classic boat. In this respect it is a good proposal, but a division whereby different rules apply for inland waterways and seas is not good. For example, in the country which the Commissioner responsible for and I know best, it is possible to use the same boat on inland waterways and on the sea in the same day. When a boat is manufactured, it is not known which conditions it will be used for. I therefore think that Amendment No 15 is unworkable, and that is also the point made by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much to be done if we are to be able to engage with the recreational craft sector. In this context, I would also like to have seen us dealing with septic tank requirements, as I believe that this, at least with regard to the situation in the Baltic Sea, is one of the most problematic environmental issues associated with the boat industry. I would thank the rapporteur for a good proposal. We have been greatly interested in the fact that the Commission has now tabled this. It is important in order to ensure that the water environment will be improved. However, I believe that the issues which Mr Lange addressed with regard to groundwater should be solved at their respective locations, and that is something for which we have other legal instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my city, Amsterdam, the dozens of boats create far more stench than the tens of thousands of cars.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the fact that the European Commission, at the instigation of the Scandinavian and German boat industry, want to improve that situation. The modest Commission proposals, however, have been watered down by a majority of the Christian-Democrats and the Liberals in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. The Group of the Greens has tabled one correction amendment. We are counting on the Christian-Democrats and the Liberals, who care about the environment, to wake up and no longer to tag along behind the Conservative rapporteur, Mr Callanan. If they were to continue to back him, that would be a blot on the European Parliament’s green escutcheon. What is worse, we in Amsterdam, as elsewhere in Europe, would continue to be faced with the noise and stench of the pleasure boats on and around the water. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Callanan and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for this comprehensive report. It is very well timed for European citizens, who are now preparing for their holidays and may experience the problem daily.</p>
<p class="contents">Engine noise, air and water pollution are becoming an increasingly common irritant in recreational activities. I recently read in the press that, in the past, no attention was paid to research and technology on noise pollution and that is the reason for the delays in development.</p>
<p class="contents">While exhaust emissions from recreational craft are relatively small in comparison to the total amount of pollution in the environment, the effect of pollution is amplified by the way recreational craft are used. Noise pollution has been targeted, because motor boats are often used in areas where people go to relax. Recreational areas free of unpleasant noise are an important but scarce national resource that should be protected. This has led to the introduction of different emission requirements in the different Member States. The proposed legislation therefore seeks to avoid fragmentation of the internal market and at the same time to ensure a high level of health, safety, and environmental consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal is a good example of synergy between environment and industrial policies contributing to sustainable development. Comparable legislation exists in the United States on exhaust emissions from recreational out-board engines. The environmental protection agency is currently preparing legislation to cover recreational in-board and stern drive engines. These cases are under discussion under the auspices of the transatlantic business dialogue, in which I am also participating. Mr Callanan and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are to be congratulated for the amendments which aim to simplify the noise-testing procedures, produce the conformity assessment costs for SMEs and clarify requirements in the case of replacement engines.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept the amendments which aim to clarify and improve the wording of the initial text in relation to partly completed craft and weather conditions, as well as those concerning the simplification of the noise-testing procedures. The amendments concerning the distinction of stern drive engines, the formulas to be used for the noise-testing procedures and clarification of the coverage of replacement engines can be accepted in principle. While we have no problem with the general direction of the proposals, we need to analyse further the values and definitions proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the institutional aspects, the proposal envisages, in conformity with the rules governing comitology, a regulatory committee to deal with a number of standard issues relating to the adaptation of technical provisions to technical progress, including measures concerning the evolution of exhaust and noise emission limits. A regulatory committee is thus essential for the efficient implementation and the regular update of a specific range of technical elements of the proposed directive. It would be contrary to the simplifying aims of the comitology decision to initiate a formal modification procedure in the case of non-essential provisions subject to regular review. Consequently, the amendments requiring the rescission of this provision relating to comitology cannot be accepted by the Commission, as they are contrary to its executive powers under Article 202 of Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in order to meet concerns expressed by some Members of Parliament, like Mr Lange, as regards further steps in the case of emission limit values, it may be possible to arrive at an acceptable formula in the light of subsequent negotiations. The Commission will consider the most appropriate ways to take into account the evolution of exhaust and noise emission limits. For example, the question of possible further reductions in emission limit values could be dealt with in the report to be presented to the European Parliament and to the Council under Article 2 of the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that further work in close cooperation with the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, will lead to a balanced solution offering a clear benefit for the environment and the internal market, while minimising additional burdens to SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 6, 14, 18, 19, 22, 27 to 29, 37, 39, 41 and 44. Furthermore, the Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 3, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 21, 23, 35 and 36. In addition, the Commission can accept in part Amendments Nos 10, 43 and 45. On the contrary, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2, 4, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 20, 24 to 26, 30 to 34, 38, 40, 42 and 46 to 50. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
