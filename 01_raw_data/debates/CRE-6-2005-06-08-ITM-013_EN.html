The Parliament voted, with a massive majority, to pat Mr Barroso on the back and tell him what a splendid job he is doing. It tells him and the other Commissioners that they can accept any amount of hospitality, from anyone, without there being any question of being held to account.</p>
<p class="contents">The Motion was called only because of Barroso's refusal to come clean over hospitality, and the intransigence and blind obedience of the major political groups. Well, despite the strong arm tactics and bullying we managed to have a debate, which is a small victory for transparency. The silence of Mr. Barroso, on the very central and direct question on the Latsis Group and the EU relations, no doubt proves there are no longer business links between them.</p>
<p class="contents">However due to a re-interpretation of the rules we are forced into today's vote which was never our intention. So be it. The European Parliament may have confidence in Mr Barroso, but other recent votes out there in the real world suggest that the peoples of Europe have lost confidence in his project.</p>

They have to avoid conflicts of interest such as personally rewarding links with companies. In Mr Barroso's case, being the President of the European Commission, doubts about such corporate links have arisen. Therefore we signed a motion of censure with the explicit and exclusive goal to initiate a debate in the plenary session. Although this debate has already taken place on the 25th of May, we have no reasons to be satisfied with Mr Barroso's replies yet. We strongly believe that a majority of MEPs indeed has made it too easy for Mr Barroso to take the criticism seriously. In the meantime we have received fresh information about Mr Barroso's corporate involvement. Although this information has been insufficient yet for bringing this motion of censure to the vote, it might as well become sufficient later. If we would have had the freedom to withdraw or postpone the motion of censure, we would have done so. As it seems, though, that it is no longer possible to withdraw this motion, we have decided to abstain from voting today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As an equal to the Council, Parliament clearly formulated its political priorities in relation to the Financial Perspective. Thanks to the rapporteur, a framework has been created with the utmost professionalism which provides real added value, and which sets out feasible and acceptable financial thresholds that will eventually be transformed into specific tools and programmes. The fact that cohesion funding will be maintained at 4% of GDP is of great importance for the new Member States, as they stand to receive a substantial amount of funding for cohesion and structural measures. At the same time, emphasis is laid on a fairer distribution of contributions by net payers, in keeping with the spirit of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Böge report represents an acceptable compromise between the generous proposal by the Commission and the inadequate proposal by the Council. The challenge that the Council faces is to enable negotiations on the Financial Perspective to be concluded while Luxembourg still holds the presidency, and at any rate no later than by the end of this year, by means of its unanimous approval at the June summit.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I voted against this report for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">1. The process of ratification of the Constitutional Treaty showed that some of the nations of Europe had doubts about the effectiveness of European socio-economic policies. I am convinced that the European Union has to have an ambitious budget that gives to the Community’s authorities the means of carrying out their task. The Böge report, which fixes the payment appropriations at 1.7% of the Gross National Income, does not measure up to this challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">2. The emphasis on budgetary restraint undermines the European commitment towards farmers. It also threatens the viability of the common market organisation (CMO) for sugar, the reform of which it will not be possible to finance. I do not accept that farmers should become the victims of national self-interest, implicit in the Böge report.</p>
<p class="contents">3. The introduction of joint financing, which opens the way to renationalisation of the common agricultural policy (CAP), is, in my opinion, unacceptable. It signals a departure from the only public policy that is genuinely European, at a moment in our history when Europe needs to become stronger by sharing its strengths. Giving in to national misgivings would further widen the gap between Europe and its nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We support the Swedish Government’s and the other five countries’ demand that the EU’s budget should not exceed 1.00% of gross national income, be it in payments or commitments. The EU must fulfil its commitments towards the ten new Member States, but room is made for this expenditure within the present expenditure framework. The difference between our demand for 1.00% and the European Parliament’s (and the Commission’s) proposal lies in the fact that the EU-15 (with the exceptions of Greece and Portugal) have, in particular, to forgo aid from the Cohesion Fund. The June List welcomes the initiative in terms of cofinancing and hopes that this will open the way to future renationalisation of, for example, agricultural policy. We also support the idea of a correction mechanism to compensate those countries that, under the present system, account for a disproportionately large proportion of the EU’s income. The correction mechanism will hopefully also be an alternative to the British rebate.</p>
<p class="contents">By rejecting the Constitution, both France and the Netherlands have shown that they prefer less, rather than more, supranationalism. A Swedish veto in the Council against a bad compromise is a better alternative than a new long-term budget.

In the course of numerous debates, however, each Member of the European Parliament acknowledged that Natura 2000 was an integral part of European Union policy, that the first experiments in managing sites had produced very positive results and, better still, they had made it possible to lay the foundations for sustainable development in areas of important biological value. The environment, having previously been kept in check, was turning out to be the trump card for new development based on a realisation of the importance of the natural heritage of our countries. The report mentions the EUR 21 billion needed to continue to run Natura 2000 for 2007-2013 but there was not a single line of the budget that referred to this figure in the forecasts of expenditure. An amendment adopted in plenary even managed to remove Natura 2000 from the funding for fishing.</p>

Economic and rural development benefit from it, and a healthy natural and cultural landscape is guaranteed. Farmers must continue to be guaranteed financial support through the common agricultural policy, and the EU’s long-term financial planning must reflect this. The accession of Bulgaria and Romania, which is scheduled for 2007, will make the financial situation more acute. No provision is as yet being made for more funding to be allocated to the CAP in order to take account of this enlargement; on the contrary, the draft envisages a reduction in, or capping of, resources. The accession would further reduce the funds set aside for farmers in the existing Member States, and so, should the CAP’s financial resources prove insufficient to meet the need, contributions would have to be sought from the individual Member States, which would be obliged to find the shortfall for their own farmers. Far from adding up to the renationalisation of agricultural policy, this would mean that its funding would be secure in the long term. If the benefits of the common agricultural policy are to be retained, it may in future be necessary to ask the Member States to bear their share of the costs, for it is not acceptable that farmers should foot the bill for the European Union’s enlargement, and that funds for other policies should be quarried from the agricultural budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">- I am in favour of a stronger, more political Europe. It is difficult for the European Parliament to put forward a figure for the general budget that is below that proposed by the Commission. It is difficult to want more Europe without an adequate budget. I feel it necessary, therefore, to give some pointers to the Heads of State or Government who will make the final decision on the level of the financial perspective. They must give to Europe the means of achieving its goals</p>
<p class="contents">- Joint financing of the first pillar of the common agricultural policy (CAP) must be rejected. It introduces ideas that could prove destructive to one of the founding policies of the European Union and moves it towards renationalisation. It does nothing at all for the European credit deficit. Instead it transfers responsibility for part of the cost onto the Member States and/or their territorial communities without ensuring that they actually have the means to pay. It is a false solution for those who refuse to take decisions in favour of a better distribution of public support for agriculture and for a more in-depth review of the CAP that would lead to more sustainable agriculture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Money spent collectively on democracy, the environment, the provision of public services, social security and international solidarity is money well spent. A society that omits to set aside resources for this purpose is permanently in crisis. Although we have no sympathy whatsoever with those who want to reduce taxes by rolling back the state, we are critical of the EU on account of the way it spends money, which is sluiced around unnecessarily to regions in the richest Member States, with much of the agricultural funds ending up with the big farmers and in export subsidies, and the disaster fund suddenly being extended to include a terrorism fund. The European Parliament costs a great deal of money unnecessarily, with vast amounts being reimbursed in expenses and on account of its permanent commuting between two cities. Many of the cross-border issues for which the EU could be useful are not tackled, and many of the funds disappear into shadowy spending and fraud. As long as this situation persists, we have little reason to actively oppose those who want to reduce spending to 1%, even if we condemn their often selfish views and arguments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The peoples of France and the Netherlands condemned on the basis of their experience of life the European and government policy which brings austerity, unemployment, inflation and uncertainty through capitalist restructurings as promoted in the financial perspectives for 2007-2013. This is the direction they are taking, in order to safeguard the profits of and reinforce European capital and the plutocracy in each country, strike at grass-roots rights and reinforce the militarisation of the ΕU and, of course, there are numerous appropriations for propaganda and for diverting the workers from their real interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Infighting between the imperialists is worsening and the margins for manoeuvre are narrowing and the rejection of the 'European Constitution' is a good and optimistic message.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive outcome of these referenda for the peoples of the ΕU, which – and this is your pseudo-democracy – you disdain in your stand, cannot be reversed by a decision on the financial perspectives which the parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece will vote against. However, it does show the workers the path of insubordination and disobedience to the policy of the ΕU and opens up prospects for the fight for a Europe of peace, grass-roots rights and socialism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not agree, however, that the best course of action is to develop initiatives outside the Community framework, such as Schengen+ (between seven Member States), which undermine the development of mutual trust among the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">- legitimacy: The low levels of democratic legitimacy are appalling. Parliament must be genuinely involved in drawing up legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">- effectiveness: Objectives, priorities and responsibilities must be clearly set out, whilst ensuring that efforts are not duplicated and not spread too thinly.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, maintaining current legislation in the expectation that the Constitutional Treaty would be ratified has served to exacerbate the existing democratic shortfall.

It does, of course, become a problem when these terms occur in repressive legislation, which is what is being recommended here. That is how Belgium’s largest political party came to be condemned partly on the basis of a text on female circumcision. According to the judge, that text was not published to improve the situation of women in Islam, but to stigmatise Islam. In that way, freedom of opinion is crippled and problems become unmentionable, which is not, of course, the way to get them solved.</p>
<p class="contents">The report speaks, and I quote, in terms of ‘profoundly racist, anti-Semitic, islamophobic and homophobic statements and actions by prominent politicians and members of government’. The reality is, however, that nearly all anti-Semitic incidents can be traced back to Islamic immigrants. The reality is that so-called discrimination is often the result of a lack of willingness to integrate on the part of immigrants. The reality is that the indigenous population has never been consulted democratically about the question whether they want to live in a multi-cultural country, and that is something that must change as a matter of urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for this is that the overly broad concepts used in the report could result in too wide an interpretation of these rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The wording of paragraph 24, which calls on the Commission to eliminate obstacles to free movement in the EU for married or legally recognised gay couples, could serve as a basis for the recognition of certain legal rights held by gay couples. Only a small number of EU Member States give legal recognition to the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">This would amount to unjustified interference in the family law systems of certain EU Member States. Given that this area of law is out of bounds for integration measures, such interference is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The rights of faith schools could be curtailed on the basis of paragraph 22 if they were obliged to employ homosexual persons and include homosexuality in their sex education curricula. This could run counter to the ethos, beliefs and missions of such schools. A good example of a directive that makes no mention of such issues is the Equal Treatment in Employment and Occupation Directive (2000/78/EC).</p>
<p class="contents">Despite being urged to do so, Parliament failed to insert a clause underlining ‘the right of parents to raise their children in accordance with their own religious beliefs’. Worded in such a way, this right of parents is a universally recognised in international law.</p>

<p class="contents">This would amount to unjustified interference in the family law systems of certain EU Member States. Given that this area of law is out of bounds for integration measures, such interference is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The rights of faith schools could be curtailed on the basis of paragraph 22 if they were obliged to employ homosexual persons and include homosexuality in their sex education curricula. This could run counter to the ethos, beliefs and missions of such schools. A good example of a directive that makes no mention of such issues is the Equal Treatment in Employment and Occupation Directive (2000/87/EC).</p>
<p class="contents">Despite being urged to do so, Parliament failed to insert a clause underlining ‘the right of parents to raise their children in accordance with their own religious beliefs’. Worded in such a way, this right of parents is universally recognised in international law.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these decisions by Parliament, I have decided to vote against the report and the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does not cut across the social divide; it mainly affects the poorer, grass-roots sections of society. It refers to numerous forms of actual discrimination in the workplace against women and young people, but passes in silence over the high rates of unemployment and the inhumane, flexible forms of employment applied mainly to young people and women, as a result of Lisbon-type strategies. The report passes in silence over the scandalous discrimination against the Russian minority in the Baltic States, despite the fact that the Communist Party of Greece has repeatedly raised the problem in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The people subject to discrimination should not delude themselves; only their fight, in cooperation with consistent, working-class movements, with the fighting grass-roots movements, can put the brakes on their marginalisation and exclusion from the social and political rights of which capitalism and its political exponents have deprived them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is precisely what has happened in the report before us. The group to which I belong tabled a number of amendments that would have turned the report into a series of acceptable and positive proposals. Those amendments were unfortunately not adopted, and I therefore voted against the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that on issues such as these, I repeat, both shortfall and surplus are detrimental. The right to be different should not be confused with imposing equality. They are not the same thing and do not produce the same results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
