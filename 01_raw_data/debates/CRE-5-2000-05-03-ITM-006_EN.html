<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sterckx (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the question you are really asking in your communication is: what does the future hold for the European aviation industry? That is the key question approximately ten years on from the start of liberalisation within that sector. Liberalisation, as you point out in your communication, set a growth process in motion; new companies have sprung up, new routes have opened, new air fares have in fact been put in place, and so this has attracted a new kind of public to the aviation industry. The existing large and small national airline companies have become more profitable and have started to operate more efficiently without government funding. All these aspects demonstrate that liberalisation has stirred the market. We could say that passengers have generally benefited from liberalisation, but not all of them. For example, it is evident that the benefits in business class are only minor compared to those in other passenger categories. </p>
<p class="contents">We now wonder how solid the basis for the European aviation industry is. In your communication, you stated that fragmentation is still far more pronounced here than it is in the United States. We have more or less the same number of airline companies, but their share of the global market is 38%, whereas ours is 27%, which is a huge difference. You also stated in your communication that the profitability of our companies is considerably less than that of our American counterparts. We also question the viability of the new companies which are appearing on the market, because how long will they last and how solid are they? One cannot help but wonder how many of these will still be operating within the European market in ten years’ time. Also, how tenable and sustainable is the growth we have witnessed within this sector over the past decade? We are faced with an overcrowded airspace, or should I say a badly managed airspace? </p>
<p class="contents">We have congested airports to contend with and this is why, Commissioner, it is of great importance that you at long last make a proposal on the management of slot allocations for airports. I think this is a matter of life and death, especially for small companies starting out in the aviation industry. We have also asked ourselves about social development and the rights of passengers. This is why I wanted to ask you what the outcome was of the agreement recently reached on Gibraltar on this matter. Is that in any way related to aviation? These are questions which we are still left with. </p>
<p class="contents">Important steps still need to be taken after liberalisation. Firstly, air traffic control should, of course, be Europeanised. This topic is also covered in Mr Atkins’ report and I will be tabling an oral amendment on this matter tomorrow, to replace ‘privatisation’ by ‘liberalisation’. This was agreed upon in conjunction with the large political groups. It is clear that another aspect, namely safety, should also be Europeanised. A European Aviation Safety Authority should therefore be set up as a matter of urgency. It is obvious that the Member States need to take a step back as far as these two aspects are concerned. I will now move on to the key point in your communication, namely the fact that there is no external policy for European aviation, in other words that the rights with regard to third countries have been negotiated bilaterally. This, of course, determines the entire structure of the aviation industry in Europe. Normally speaking, after a liberalisation process, companies tend to operate in tune with the market which has been liberalised. This is actually quite rare in the world of aviation. No mergers have taken place. An attempt to that effect was made by KLM and Alitalia, but this has now been abandoned, due in actual fact to a number of problems related to nationality, if I can put it that way. A merger between Swissair and SABENA is still on the cards, but we rely there on an agreement with Switzerland which we will be discussing this week and on a forthcoming referendum in Switzerland. What is happening is that, although European companies join forces with their American counterparts, they play second fiddle to the Americans. This is why I, as rapporteur, have a few questions with regard to your proposal to establish this common transatlantic air space. I am in favour of this in principle, but I do wonder whether we are not rushing into things or whether this is not too big a step, considering there is no solid base in place for the European aviation industry. A number of very complex problems need to be solved first before we can take the second step. As rapporteur, I am personally quite suspicious of America’s nationalism when it comes to transport, including aviation. Negotiations must clearly be held with a great deal of openness and reciprocity, as it is put, and the European companies must have exactly the same rights as the Americans, otherwise negotiations are bound to break down. Only then, as things currently stand in European aviation, will we be capable of competing with the Americans within an open market. </p>
<p class="contents">An important question is: what do we do if we cannot pull it off with the Americans? What do we do then on our own? How viable is the European industry if it is confined to the European boundaries and to those bilateral agreements? What is more – and I have skated over this aspect in my report, but Mrs Lucas has drafted a report on the environment which deals with this at length – we need to acknowledge that there are limits. The environment too has its limits and this is an important, in fact, vital question which we may need to ask ourselves, not so much following on from my report but following on from Mrs Lucas’ report. Secondly, intermodality is highlighted in my report too. I think that the Commission too should be clear about this and should issue proposals to promote intermodality. Trains and planes could work together very well in a number of areas. </p>
<p class="contents">At all events, Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that liberalisation has been hugely important. I am well aware of this, although we are not even halfway there. In order to improve the current situation, we need to receive from the Commission proposals, concrete action plans and legal texts which we can debate within the very short term. It is also clear that the Member States have a very important responsibility and that a great deal depends on them and on how much they are prepared to put into creating real European aviation and a real European aviation industry. I think, therefore, that Parliament too, in tandem with the Commission and the Council, cannot work fast enough on this score because the world will not wait for us. As such, we need to get a move on, otherwise we will be buried under an avalanche. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Aviation is without doubt one of the most exciting and stimulating industries. The opportunities for business and job creation during the last decade have played a major part in the economies of countries in Europe and worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, aviation in the UK contributes GBP 10.2 billion a year to the UK GDP and generates and supports 380 000 indirect and induced UK jobs. It transports GBP 35 billion’s worth of UK exports, maintaining unrivalled access to the global market, and this is multiplied ten-fold across the European Community. When I began my career in the aviation industry 30 years ago, very few people could afford to fly. But today, with the liberalisation of the market, flying for most people has become a way of life.</p>
<p class="contents">The report covers a number of areas and outlines fairly accurately the way the aviation industry has developed over the last ten years. But in a number of areas there is little recognition by the Commission of the benefits the aviation industry, including aerospace, have brought and I am disappointed by the negative attitude towards the industry in this paper.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key factors in the success of the last 20 years has been the privatisation of the national state-owned industries which began in the 1980s. I also welcome the Commission statement that subsidies have now ceased.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at the choice of routings and so on for the consumer, air fares have come down considerably over the last few years. Fares from the UK are amongst some of the lowest, showing what effect having three major carriers operating out of one country can have on competition and pricing. This has produced the real benefits and other countries need to take a look at this. The report outlines at some length the expansion in capacity which has taken place in the European aviation industry, particularly across the north Atlantic, but that is obviously quite a complicated issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully accept that there are challenges which need to be addressed such as problems with congestion, in particular air traffic control. However, I believe that the Commission has a responsibility to put forward more balanced views which do not undermine the value and success of an industry which has made an enormous contribution, not only to the countries of the European Union but worldwide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmitt (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supported Mr Sterckx’s report in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism as it will support it in plenary. The key message, as Mr Sterckx has reiterated, is that basically liberalisation has succeeded in principle. As a result we now have substantially more competition. This stronger competition has also created some movement in price levels, not in all market areas, certainly, but in many of them. Furthermore, what many people feared has not come to pass, namely job losses and deteriorating working conditions, and instead we continue to see rising employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the space of about eight years, employment figures have risen by nearly 50 000 and there really has been no evidence of a lasting decline in working conditions unless we look at this in the context of what has happened nationally, which is that national airlines are in a sense being transformed into modern service industries, which is, of course, accompanied by changes in working conditions and their modernisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless I am glad that the report does address the fact that we, of course, expect common rules – even if for a different reason, namely because of safety aspects –with regard, for instance, to working hours and flight times, because, at the end of the day, it is training and actual working conditions that will partly determine how safe we can make European aviation over the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sterckx also made it clear, however, that liberalisation concerns only a very small area of European air transport, which can largely be regarded as successful, but there are many other areas that currently continue to give us problems, whether these are old, unresolved problems or new ones. We are a long way from having a uniform, common European air transport market, in principle. I think in future we will have to deal with four important points. Mr Sterckx has already addressed some of them, and I would like to raise them again. In my view, the Member States’ airlines must, of course, be in a position to have equal access to the international market, like other airlines in the world. At the same time, we must ensure that the airline companies really do achieve economic stability, which means we have to try to ensure, through appropriate competition on the ground, that the immense costs of, for instance, landing and ground handling charges are reduced to the kind of level that is usual in other countries of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, let me emphasise that we do want to see more air transport. It enhances individual mobility. But, on the other hand, we must not disregard environmental conditions. My position is fairly clear on this point. Bans are not the right method; instead we need incentives, we need to give support for the airlines to move towards reducing emissions by using modern fleets that use less kerosene and also produce less pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in my view we need to improve consumer protection because obviously the growing number of passengers brings increasing problems with it and, in this regard, the passenger deserves more protection than the airline. My fourth and final point, and the one I consider most important, is that we must ensure that we also have a single European airspace and we must establish a uniform system of air traffic control in order to reduce delays and congestion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wiersma (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Sterckx on his report. It is the first in a series of reports on aviation which we will be dealing with in the course of this year. We support the development of a European aviation space encompassing all aspects of aviation, ranging from delays to environmental harm. In addition, we think that, at world level, the Union must be able to show a united front on this matter. We also have our doubts regarding the restrictions and automatic responses generated by national sentiment which, to this day, play such a significant role in European aviation. I would like to illustrate this with air traffic control, for example. These national responses and preferences also hamper cooperation, as we recently witnessed in the unfortunate breakdown in cooperation between KLM and Alitalia. We will not protest in cases where liberalisation can help achieve a more effective policy, but it is a pragmatic approach and not a dogmatic one. Indeed, where the interests of public services or the environment so require, we will not hesitate to advocate an active stance on the part of the authorities. </p>
<p class="contents">We would also draw attention to the human side of developments within aviation. This is dominated by three issues: firstly safety. We back the setting up of a European Aviation Safety Authority which unites as many countries as possible. Our amendment on widening the scope in this way has been adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. Common standards and inspection agreements boost safety levels. This should not be restricted to the EU. We can and must help improve safety agreements throughout Europe. One is led to believe that lower costs as a result of liberalisation only have benefits. This may be the case for some passengers, but upon examination of recent annual reports of major aviation companies, this conclusion does not immediately follow. Personnel too experience the adverse, social effects of cost reductions. We do not want to let this situation get out of hand, especially when safety issues can be in the balance if, for example, pilots have to fly long hours.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, air fares may seem low, but often the overall interests of the passengers are hardly taken into consideration. It is no fun having to wait for hours because of a delay, on top of which you are likely to miss your connecting flight. It is even less fun if you become the victim of overbooking. Mr Sterckx rather feebly states in his present report that information on these situations must be made available to passengers. A fat lot of good that will do them. Passengers have rights and, more than anything, they have the right to be informed at the time when a problem arises. As I understand it, airports will be installing notice boards this summer on which they will display passenger rights in the event of delays, for example. This is a step in the right direction. It would be better still if the amendment on passengers’ right to information tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists were to be adopted in addition. We are always harping on about consumer interests, well, here is one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I only have a few minutes so I want to focus on just one particular point in the Commission communication. Let us recall that the title of this communication is ‘From single market to worldwide challenges’. Yet one of the remarkable things about this communication is that it does not appear to recognise that one of those worldwide challenges must be how the airline industry will respond to increasing environmental concerns and likely environmental legislation. Of all the many words in this communication, just one short paragraph is devoted to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for a very good Commission communication on aviation and environment I know that the issue of environment and competitiveness is a very live one with strong feelings on both sides of the debate. For example, that communication starts by saying that the growth of the air transport industry is, and I quote, “unsustainable and must be reversed because of its impact on climate and on the quality of life and health of European citizens” and it goes on to say very clearly that ‘business as usual’ is not an option. It is quite obvious that aviation’s response to environmental concerns will have effects on competitiveness, some positive and some negative.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not underestimate either the impact of aviation on the environment. A report launched in the UK just yesterday by a number of environmental NGOs including Friends of the Earth forcefully made the case that one flight to and from the US could cause more pollution than the average UK motorist causes in a year. It makes the case that the world’s 16 000 commercial jet aircraft produce more than 600 million tonnes of CO2 every year – nearly as much as all the countries of Africa put together. It makes the case that the number of people flying will almost double in the next fifteen years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask therefore that we see a bit more environmental mainstreaming. Rather than confining the environmental aspects of aviation to a report solely devoted to that subject, we should be seeing environment threaded through all approaches to this policy area, particularly one which purports to be addressing issues of competitiveness. Mr Sterckx has included environment in this own report. I very much welcome that but I would also like to see environment automatically mainstreamed through all Commission reports and communications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Meijer (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, in the first half of the previous century, many opinion formers claimed that the air offered enough space for unlimited growth in international transport. There was ground congestion and new infrastructure was very expensive, but anything was still possible in the air. Meanwhile, the countries at the heart of the European Union have been faced with unexpected problems. Thanks to free competition, record low prices and cheap, tax-free fuel, the airspace has become overcrowded there. Gigantic airports emerged near Paris, London, Frankfurt and Amsterdam with a great deal of transit movement for travellers from outside Europe. These airports continue to grow and they place a huge burden on their surroundings. Not only do those living near the airports complain, passengers too are dissatisfied. They are increasingly faced with delays. The air has more or less reached capacity levels in that respect. Thanks to new navigation techniques and low-noise aircraft, it may be possible to increase the number of flights for a little while longer, but this will inevitably have an adverse effect on the environment, safety and the reliability of the service. </p>
<p class="contents">We have reached the limits of growth. Further growth of freight and passenger transport will need to be accommodated by alternative means: by rail or on water. Meanwhile, however, competition between air traffic – which is favoured by government policy – and trains and ships has become fierce. This is why the proportion of international train traffic and freight transport by river and canal has dropped so dramatically. There are considerably fewer international through train connections within the European Union compared to 20 years ago. In the remote areas of the European Union, however, it seems as if time has stood still there. People still complain there that remote regions and islands are not sufficiently serviced. New, small airports are expected to perform miracles as they could attract rich business people and masses of tourists. What is more, the areas surrounding the Mediterranean tourist beaches are also increasingly afflicted by accidents, noise and air pollution, and nature reserves are being sacrificed. </p>
<p class="contents">During the discussion on Mr Sterckx’s report, it has already transpired in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, as well as from amendments tabled on this topic, that opinion is strongly divided on this matter within Parliament. Certain Members favour an increase in the number of aircraft, the lifting of all legal restrictions in this connection and continued reductions in air fares. I hear this opinion mainly from those Members who endlessly complain within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism that their flight was once again delayed and who are very much guided by these personal experiences in their vision of transport policy. According to other Members, air traffic has grown far too much over the past decades. In their view, the conservation and protection of the natural environment are far more important than fast or cheap transport, and air traffic has already supplanted far too much rail traffic. It is high time that the safety and health of passengers, personnel and population on the ground were made the top priority. </p>
<p class="contents">My Group is very much in favour of the second opinion, relating to the environment, safety and the interests of personnel. Air traffic cannot continue to grow endlessly and we cannot afford to subordinate all kinds of other matters to this. We consider that Mr Sterckx’s report falls short of being able to solve the actual problems but it is a first step in the right direction. I am pleased that the rapporteur seemed prepared to adopt a number of amendments concerning safety and the environment at an early stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It may not be obvious, but air transport is not an end in itself: air transport moves capital, it moves industries – be it the tourist industry or some other industry – and it brings people into contact, not merely in the pursuit of leisure, but in order to clinch business deals. The contribution made by air transport to the European and global economies is truly great, and it should therefore be both promoted and regulated. Regulated in that, all too often, there is insufficient planning, airports are located in inconvenient places and airlines are prevented from expanding by the presence of military corridors or restrictions. </p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, we must not forget that the air industry is among the most global industries, for, nowadays, an aircraft can easily fly all over the world, especially if it is a high endurance aircraft. Therefore, while nowadays, it is an easy matter to relocate an industrial plant, it is even easier to relocate an airline, in that the means of production itself is, by definition, mobile. </p>
<p class="contents">Then there is a problem of competition, particularly competition from the United States in the form of those huge carriers which are governed by standardised legislation which, I regret, is lacking in the European Union, both in the sphere of air traffic control – with the result that operational standardisation is lacking as well as legislative standardisation – and as regards the recognition of professional qualifications. For example, even today, an Italian pilot with professional qualifications obtained in Italy cannot do the same job in Belgium. </p>
<p class="contents">Another issue to be resolved is the age limit. Some countries of the European Union allow pilots to continue flying up until the age of 65, but in other countries they have to stop working at 60. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call upon the Commission to adopt common legislation governing the whole of the Union as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report drafted by Mr Sterckx elaborates on the effects of strong growth within the sector. The enormous competition within the industry has led to a price war in certain sectors. The number of passengers and, alongside this, the number of flights, is growing at an alarming rate. The rapporteur is looking for the solution to congestion in a common airspace and European air traffic control. I support him in this. </p>
<p class="contents">Competition also leads to lower costs. The pressure on personnel in the sector is increasing both socially and financially. It is vital to guarantee their rights. I endorse the rapporteur’s observations that proposals are required which deal with the social dimension. </p>
<p class="contents">Passengers also suffer as a result of the commercial war. Although air fares have come down in certain areas, there are situations in which their rights – including those in the event of overbooking – are under real threat. This too needs to be regulated. </p>
<p class="contents">The impact of all these developments on the environment is of vital importance. Achievements as regards innovations in terms of emission values, noise and harmful substances cannot offset the environmental damage caused by the dramatic growth in aviation. And this is not likely to change in the foreseeable future</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary to consider the position which we want to, and must, accord aviation. In some cases, only air transport is possible but in the case of holidays, for example, the increasing demand for transport can only be met through other means. </p>
<p class="contents">This report should also accommodate the downside of a worldwide aviation market. Solutions which spring to mind in this respect include a common traffic control system, stimulation of technological innovation for engines and promotion of alternative methods of transport for passengers and goods, i.e. trains for passengers and coastal navigation for goods. </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, imposing VAT on flight services and excise on kerosene, which are, in fact, levied on other means of transportation – at intra-European level if necessary – will contribute to a more balanced view of the costs generated by the different means of transportation. </p>
<p class="contents">In short, the aviation industry is heading for stormy weather. It is up to us to guide it through this in the interests of society. In our opinion, the rapporteur is steering things in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that paragraph 8 of the Sterckx report adopts the right approach, for we must look to the medium and short term. I shall begin with the medium term. In the medium term we must transfer regulative competencies for air traffic control to the European Union, something that is entirely feasible. There is no point in people coming along and saying, well, Eurocontrol has far more members and is far better. Eurocontrol does not work and that has been proven. One reason is that it operates according to the unanimity principle and the principle of the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the European Economic Area sets a good example. If the Community of 15 has the authority to set regulations, and if 12 countries want to join the EU in the next few years, then we will have reached the figure of 27. If we follow the example of the European Economic Area with Norway and Iceland, then there will no problem with including Switzerland in the same system. We therefore need EU competencies in this area, so that we can decide by a majority on the basis of Community law, rather than having to abide by unanimity and international treaties. We also need private service companies to carry out the actual operations. I admit that Mr Sterckx would like to see the term “privatisation” replaced with “liberalisation”. I think we will be happy to endorse that.</p>
<p class="contents">But we need competition, and, of course, he agrees with us on that. We must move away from a situation of monopolies and here I would like you to consider – although this is by no means a revolutionary idea – that if we have a single market on the ground, we could also have a single market in the skies, and that we should certainly allow different cooperating or competing service companies to control certain European aviation routes beyond the national borders, that we should move beyond the small-state mentality and offer services to airlines. We must go further in this regard. In any case, we will be discussing this again in connection with the Atkins report. </p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the short-term aspects. We are all grateful to the Vice-President for setting up a high-level working party with a view to achieving results in the short term too. I can only call on the 15 governments to instruct their civilian and military advisers to actually deliver solutions to the Vice-President by the end of the month, so that we will have something concrete to consider in June, and so that the Vice-President can respond to practical requests and take practical action, such as occasionally using military areas for civil aviation. We must therefore proceed with practical solutions, for we cannot have the same situation this summer as last summer: congested airspace, stacked aircraft, the pointless, constant combustion of kerosene in the air, i.e. environmental pollution of the first order! Let us hope that if the Member States really provide the Vice-President with what she wants, she can then present us with a good proposal that also includes short-term measures which can enter into force this summer.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Simpson (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Sterckx for his report which addresses an important aspect of the civil aviation industry. There is no doubt that civil aviation has grown considerably over the last ten years and it is predicted to continue growing in the foreseeable future. There are those who would argue that this is due solely to the liberalisation process within that sector. Whilst I and my Group recognise that this has had a considerable effect on aviation’s growth, other factors have also contributed. In the initial stages of liberalisation, a lot of people lost their jobs, those who remained had to work longer hours and others suffered a deterioration in their working conditions. Also, on some routes, fares increased while others were so cheap that airlines went bust or built up huge losses.</p>
<p class="contents">Another result of liberalisation has been the practice of co-sharing, of airline alliances, and in some instances even takeovers. We are beginning to see now an increase in aircraft registered outside the EU similar to the maritime sector’s flag of convenience. At my own airport in Manchester there are Icelandic-registered aircraft and I have been to Iceland more times than they have.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why I mention these points is just to lend some balance to the argument. It is very easy to say that liberalisation in aviation has been a glowing success, without ever recognising that there is also a negative side. My Group accepts that gradual liberalisation is a way forward but only if safety, working conditions and passenger rights are safe-guarded and strengthened. We accept that an increasing number of EU citizens are demanding better services. My Group welcomes the latest decision by the Commission to launch a campaign to inform passengers of their rights – something which the airlines in particular have failed to do over many years.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe we need something more to ensure that passengers are better protected from delays and cancellations. We have all heard the excuses offered by the airlines, ranging from “aircraft going technical”, which is aviation-speak for ‘I’m afraid there are not enough people booked on so we are going to consolidate’. “Air traffic delays” is the next one, but of course that is an easy excuse because there is never anyone from air traffic control there to say that is not the issue. Then of course there is the ‘get them on board’ scenario, irrespective of whether the plane is going to leave or not. Without doubt aviation has made considerable progress, but I also believe that aviation has a responsibility to its passengers, to its workforce, and also to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my Group looks forward to receiving from the Commission its new proposals regarding slot-allocation, even though they have been a long time in coming. I hope this document will embody the view of the fair market access for all, in particular in clarifying the present legislative position regarding the trading of slots. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have supported this liberalisation process so that bilateral barriers may be lifted, ownership restrictions changed, technical standards harmonised, and suitable safety standards established and so that the conditions of liberalisation may promote greater transparency with regard to how air transport development policy is framed and allow, above all, the inclusion of environmental considerations in production within the aeronautical industry, in tariff policy and in the management of air traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">A key point raised by the rapporteur is the current situation in which, while the aviation industry is liberalised and operates in an open European market, the authorities which control the air space, the airports and the regulating bodies, as well as the companies providing services to the air transport sector, still operate from an excessively local point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur also mentions, as an unresolved issue, the continued state presence, in certain cases, in the ownership of national airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning in particular to air traffic control, the development of a common system of air safety is a fine challenge for the future. We must not forget that European airspace is a mosaic made up of 15 sovereign Member States, which, for a variety of reasons, mainly military, find it difficult to relinquish part of their sovereignty in this area. To this end, we must concern ourselves with resolving the issue of the policy of privatising the operational bodies responsible for air traffic control.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to charges, we share the Commission’s opinion that the costs over which the airlines have no control – ground assistance charges, airport taxes and atmospheric costs – must be transparent and non-discriminatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Sterckx report, our contribution has concentrated on the environmental aspects related to it. Our main criticism centres on the fact that the Commission, in its overall analysis, is trying to treat environmental, safety and health aspects in the aeronautical sector as a separate debate, by means of a separate communication, when, in reality, the impact of these factors on the future of the industry is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to mention some basic points. Airlines’ pricing policy must include the external environmental costs of air transport. The regulation of slot allocation must be reviewed according to specific environmental criteria, taking account of noise and emissions into the atmosphere, and specific actions should be taken in order to strengthen intermodality with other trans-European networks, especially with railways, in light of the conclusions of the report on aviation and the global environment, which considers that more than 10% of European short-haul air traffic could change from air to rail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this way, or so the Commission and our rapporteur tell us, we will see reduced expenditure on the part of airlines, better passengers services and more innovation. It is therefore proposed that airports, with all the strategic importance which they have for a country’s safety, should be surrendered to the multinationals, despite the negative implications this would have, and that the aspirations of private-sector airport owners to reap maximum profits should be promoted. It is also proposed that the sovereign right of each country to control air traffic in its air space should be surrendered to the European Union, on the pretext of establishing a uniform system of air safety. At the same time, the proposal calls for the privatisation of the operational bodies responsible for air traffic control which, it says, will be responsible for all the EU’s air space and will compete with each other. </p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, aside from abrogating the sovereign right of each country over its own air space, will give rise to confusion and will have particularly negative and dangerous repercussions on air safety as, objectively speaking, the competition which is being vaunted here as the trump card will be competition for maximum profit and not for maximum air safety. The proposal argues that all this will reduce flight delays and hence the expenditure of the airlines. And maybe it will. Nonetheless, as experience with similar cases shows, it is doubtful whether a rise in profits will mean cheaper tickets or improved services. On the contrary, the situation will deteriorate. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also proposed to end state aid to airlines. This, however, will prove disastrous for air connections to and from disadvantaged areas. Greece is a typical example. This ignores the indisputable fact, as the experience of official organisations and trade unions for workers in the civil aviation industry around the world has shown, that constant reductions in the running costs of aircraft and ground services, together with wall-to-wall privatisation and the private sector’s goal of maximum profit, are the reason for the continuous rise in the number of air accidents. These are the reasons why we shall be voting against the report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We agree with these objectives, but we cannot support the project to create a regulatory authority for air transport safety. We would like to have further information, particularly regarding the formation of this authority and we would like to know who would be responsible for monitoring it and by what means they would do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, paragraph 8 calls for, and I quote, “the operational bodies responsible for ATC to be privatised”. We do not think that this is a wise suggestion. We are totally opposed to any kind of further privatisation, which could exacerbate the already deteriorating working conditions, in this area which is so closely linked to passenger safety. This privatisation will result in major job losses and will certainly have a damaging impact on safety. European skies are comparatively safe, and we want to see that safety preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, in order to guarantee the primacy of safety regulations over all other considerations, air traffic control must remain a public and national service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has come, I believe, at a time when the aviation industry is very much in the limelight, what with the takeover agreement between Swiss Air and Sabena, the breakdown of the marriage between KLM and Alitalia, as well as the vicissitudes surrounding Malpensa. One could therefore say that there is a lot of commotion in the industry and this makes the report all the more topical. </p>
<p class="contents">Despite the many advantages described by Mr Sterckx, the liberalisation of aviation has not given us heaven on earth – or not yet anyway. Just as Europe and EMU will need to be restored ecologically and socially, we will have to assimilate liberalisation with measures designed to better organise the airspace, increase safety and improve consumer and environmental protection. </p>
<p class="contents">It became apparent during the Strasbourg debate on night flights only two weeks ago that European legislation on aviation leaves a great deal to be desired. Liberalisation without a common aviation policy and without a unified airspace will inevitably lead to problems. It is estimated that air traffic will double in the next fifteen years. At present, one in three flights is delayed and 450 000 flight hours are lost annually, and unless far-reaching measures are taken, the situation will only get worse. </p>
<p class="contents">What is actually preventing us from taking a number of additional measures, except for a powerful lobby of airline companies and a misconceived concept of sovereignty in some countries which refuse to let go of the management of their own national airspace? We have a unified market, free movement of people and a single currency. Why can we not move towards a single European airspace more rapidly? Moreover, I fully endorse the idea of a common transatlantic air space, provided that this is not subject to unilateral European concessions. This is most certainly a lesson we need to learn from the vicissitudes of the hushkits affair.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the allocation of slots is concerned, I believe that more consideration should be given to environmental criteria, such as noise and exhaust fumes. In addition, the government should invest more in measures which improve the quality of life of those living near airports. This is often the case and is most needed at smaller, regional airports. </p>
<p class="contents">In summary, and by way of conclusion, I would like to advocate a <span class="italic">pax avianautica</span>. The ingredients of the <span class="italic">pax avianautica</span> which we need to pursue are a unified airspace, a common aviation policy, viable airports in a comfortable environment, increased safety and strong, European airline companies. My home town of Ostend, with its noisy and unsafe, regional airport, will not fully understand the meaning of the European Union until we have achieved this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Personally, I fully agree with the committee’s report, in that there is a need to open up the European skies, and with the need to unify them, since, although roads have been unified, the railways, the sea and the skies are not yet in that position. It is extremely important that we move in this direction, but this should not be limited to the creation of a new market.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, for several reasons, I feel that the tone of the report is excessively smug with regard to the liberalisation that has already taken place. Firstly, the competition with which we are familiar has created two air spaces: that of the major routes on which we see congestion, delays, queues and broadly inadequate consumer protection laws, although prices have, of course, fallen. And then there is the air space of the smaller routes, which is expensive and which has largely been overlooked by the market. I live in Bordeaux, but it is more expensive for me to fly from there to Lisbon than to fly to New York via Paris, and if I wish to fly to any other French city, I have to change aeroplanes at an airport in Paris. I feel that these effects of liberalisation should not be ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think that it is important to point out, as certain honourable Members have during this debate, that safety is not something that should be haggled over, and that European harmonisation of air traffic control must include this aspect of safety and it must not be handed over wholesale to businessmen. This is extremely important. I am one of those people who think that a European system of specifications should be introduced, some kind of agency, of course, but which would not necessarily involve privatisation and competition between the various air traffic control centres that exist at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, my third reason is that the Union’s regional policy, which accounts for the Union’s second largest budget, is meaningless without an effective planning policy. Airports are highly decisive factors in influencing the location of businesses, senior officials, management, and therefore jobs to an area. I fail to see why subsidies should be banned both for routes and for infrastructures, when certain remote regions do not have access to airports. I feel that this aspect of regional planning should be taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It proposed, in effect, that competences in air traffic control matters should be transferred to the European level, that the operational services of air traffic control should be privatised, and even that competition should be encouraged between these services. Air traffic has doubled since 1986, and will double again by 2015.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The resolution gives the green light to the deregulation of air transport and sees the privatisation of the main body of airlines and the development of unbridled competition as something positive. Anyone can see, however, that this development is being carried out in a way that is completely divorced from the transport requirements of the European public. European airlines are competing on the same routes, each of them separately establishing worldwide alliances, their only concern being for instant profit. They duplicate the flights of small carriers and compete for the same time slots.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of establishing a joint transport development plan, the European Union, using an intermodal approach between air and rail, has, quite to the contrary, moved towards privatisation and deregulation. The result of this is traffic saturation and pollution and, at the same time, a deterioration in working conditions and in the status of those employed in air transport, as companies subcontract as many of their activities as possible in order to minimise social costs. This resolution is giving way to the dictates of the major companies, who now want to privatise air traffic control services as well. The delays and the congestion are not the fault of the air traffic control system.</p>
<p class="contents">The ATM 2000 report summarises the financial aims of this approach and it is pretty bad. The methods facilitating safety objectives must be looked at from the economic point of view. They must avoid the excessive use of flow restrictions or traffic limitation and not unduly increase the cost of creating new systems. The professional rigour of air traffic control employees, whose primary concern is the safety of the aeroplanes and passengers, is directly at stake. This is why we are opposed to this resolution, which in fact seeks to place air traffic control in the clutches of the financial interests of large companies, to the detriment of passenger safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To a large extent, the report confirms the analysis which was expressed in the Commission’s communication on the European air transport sector in the light of the global challenges, since, thanks to the liberalisation of this sector, we have been able to establish a much more competitive market than the one that existed previously. The importance of this is clearly illustrated by the increase in the number of airlines or the increase, much less spectacular perhaps, but significant nevertheless, in the number of routes where there are more than two competitors. This gives an idea of how competition has increased over these years. The opening up of the markets means that the sector has evolved in very diverse ways. Airlines have developed innovative strategies in order to adapt to the growth of the market and the challenges of competition, but despite their restructuring efforts they still suffer a large degree of fragmentation and financial fragility in comparison with their principal international competitors, and I am referring specifically to the US airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, some of you have spoken of a common transatlantic air space, and I would like to tell you that this is a very important issue. The current situation is the result of the bilateral signing by various Member States of the European Union and the USA of the so-called “open skies agreements” which, in fact, are resulting in an internal fragmentation of the European market and making it impossible for European companies to restructure in such a way as to give them sufficient capacity to compete at an international level.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission is totally against these bilateral open skies agreements. It has appealed against them at the Court of Justice and I hope that the judgement of the Court will allow us to put an end to this situation and do what we have to do: enter into a bilateral agreement with the United States as the European Union as a whole, as a single internal market, and not divided up into different countries. The opposite situation may undoubtedly suit the United States, but in no way does it suit European airlines and European interests. One of the objectives of the negotiation of a common transatlantic air space is precisely to resolve, by common agreement with the United States, the current situation caused by the unilateral actions of the different countries which have signed up to these agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out, ladies and gentlemen, that the reality of the internal civil aviation market in Europe has been affected in a very negative way by this. Just now some of you were talking about the KLM-Alitalia affair, which obviously involves other issues, but where, if the two companies had already merged, we would not have the problems that we are facing at present.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that one trait of European liberalisation, when compared to US liberalisation, is that the granting of state aid has been authorised to support the restructuring of certain airlines. It is true that the Commission authorised the injection of public capital – only once, as a one-off and subject to strict conditions – with the aim of helping companies to effectively carry out the transition from a regulated market to an open market. We can now congratulate ourselves on the fact that the majority of European companies have completed the transition process and that transition can be considered to have been finalised.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say to those people who said that employment in the sector would be reduced, that this has not been the case and that neither has the quality of work deteriorated in any way whatsoever. On the contrary, more jobs and wealth are being created. Companies have been able to confront the situation and liberalisation has significantly benefited consumers, although it is true that it has not benefited all consumers in the same way; for example, it has provided less benefit in relation to short-haul business trips<span class="bold"> </span>where undoubtedly the lowest fares are not usually adequate and cannot be used.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by referring to some of the questions that have been raised. The issue of Gibraltar and the agreements reached recently by the two countries involved do not affect transport. In this regard, therefore, the situation remains as it was before that bilateral agreement between these two countries of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that intermodality, which is already being considered, is a key element in the balanced development of mobility and air transport. On the other hand, the question of slot allocation must be the subject of a Commission proposal since we cannot accept the current situation, in which many slots are lost, not all of them are properly used and, furthermore, let us be honest, there is a black market in them. We will make a proposal to the effect that slot allocation should be an administrative right granted under licence. We will try to ensure that there is greater flexibility in this allocation without causing any companies to go bankrupt.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Iceland, I would like to point out that it is an integral part of the European Economic Area and is therefore fully affected by the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have left two issues until the end, not because they are less important, but because I wanted to focus on them for a moment. The environment is a key issue in the development of aviation and, of course, efficiency in the consumption of fuel per passenger is improving every day, although it is true that the growth in air transport is exceeding the improvements achieved in efficiency. We must therefore try to ensure that aircraft are modernised. The question of noise is also a serious problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to make it clear that our primary concern, despite the fact that I have left it to the end, is safety. That is the main and primary objective and all initiatives relating to air transport, the single airspace, the management of air traffic, the regulation of air transport, must take it fully into account. All our actions must take account, first and foremost, of the basic objective of safety. The Commission does not hold any position in principle with regard to whether or not operational air traffic services should be privatised. We believe that, before we reach that point, some associated services could be privatised, such as, for example, meteorological areas, which would allow for greater flexibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
