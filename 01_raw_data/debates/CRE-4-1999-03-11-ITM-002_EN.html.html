<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Truscott </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Madam President, I should first like to thank honourable Members for their cooperation, suggestions and amendments which have been gratefully received. Since the five Central Asian Republics – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan became independent in 1991 with the breakup of the Soviet Union, the European Union has been engaged in the process of building bilateral relations with each of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The five states differ widely in terms of population, land area, resources and democratic developments. The Commission communication on relations between the EU and the newly independent states of Central Asia published in October 1995 stated that the primary objective of the Union was to maintain the stability of the region which could best be done through the development of broadly‐based democratic institutions, the reduction of sources of conflict and economic reform. Given the length of time since this communication was produced perhaps now would be a good time for the Commission to update it.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament was asked by the Council for its assent to the partnership and cooperation agreement with Kazakhstan in July 1995. In the case of Kyrgyzstan it gave its assent in November 1995. However, given the concern over the internal situation in Kazakhstan Parliament delayed its assent until 13 March 1997. In the case of Uzbekistan the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and the rapporteur Mrs André‐Léonard decided that the situation was such that it was very clear that the country did not meet the general principles laid down in Article 2 of the PCA, i.e. respect for democracy, principles of international law and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirty months on and human rights and democratic institutions have been further undermined in Central Asia. The recent presidential election in Kazakhstan was widely regarded as rigged and flawed. In Uzbekistan, after a series of explosions in Tashkent on 16 February, the government has used this as an excuse to clamp down on opposition groups. There has been particular concern for the safety and treatment of Mamadali Mukhmurdov and Munira Nasriddinova. Since the main non‐violent opposition parties, Erk (Freedom) and Birlik (Unity) have been closed down, the Committee for National Security (KNB) is also busy arresting and harassing dissidents.</p>
<p class="contents">In Turkmenistan and Tajikistan, despite the peace agreement signed in the latter country last year, there has been little or no improvement in the human rights situation, and even in Kyrgyzstan, where human rights are respected in many areas, there are still problems with citizens' limited ability to change the government, freedom of speech and the press, due process for the accused, religious freedom and ethnic discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">On a positive note it is to be welcomed that both Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan have introduced moratoria on capital punishment. I hope this will be extended to all Central Asian countries. The Commission has given an undertaking that human rights issues will be regularly raised as a serious issue with the authorities of Central Asia and that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy will be kept fully informed of developments in this sphere. I trust that Commissioner van den Broek will keep this promise on his forthcoming visits to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and report back to committee on his impressions. It is regrettable that Commissioner van den Broek could not be here today but I hope that he will keep the committee and Parliament fully informed.</p>
<p class="contents">Central Asia is an area of outstanding geo‐strategic and economic importance to the European Union. Its importance has been recognised since the days of the ‘silk road" and during the era of the ‘Great Game". The natural resources of Central Asia, especially gas and oil, are considerable. US State Department estimates suggest that the Caspian contains up to 200 billion barrels of oil, enough to supply the world for eight years, and 7 000 billion cubic metres of natural gas, enough to supply Europe for 16 years. Clearly the EU must be engaged with the countries of Central Asia and encourage them to shed their old Soviet era mentality.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of TACIS, in particular the democracy programme, TRACECA, INOGATE and WARMAP are to be welcomed. But cross‐border and democracy programmes, assisted by NGOs, should be given more support. The legacy of environmental degradation, especially round the Aral Sea and the nuclear test ground of Semipalatinsk should also be tackled with an adequate response from the EU. The region has suffered from both the Asian and rouble crises. The Commission, Council and international financial institutions must consider measures to help protect the population of the region against severe economic hardship.</p>
<p class="contents">While the EU should encourage foreign investment in Central Asia, part of the solution lies in the region itself in terms of introducing assured legal rights for investors. Currently the EU is the region's most important market outside the CIS. If Central Asia is to develop its economic independence it will require foreign assistance in developing alternative gas and oil pipeline routes and new markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the EU should play its part in helping to build a democratic, prosperous and secure Central Asia in a region of fragile stability. Central Asia may be far away but its future will affect us all.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">André‐Léonard </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> When the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy appointed me rapporteur on the partnership agreement with Uzbekistan, I wanted to see the situation there for myself, so I went to Tashkent to meet political leaders and representatives of civil society and human rights organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">This country, which was part of the former Soviet Union and gained independence in 1991, has still not fully broken away from the practices of the former Communist regime, though of course efforts have been made to do so. In December 1992, a new constitution was adopted, which makes Uzbekistan a pluralist democracy. A constitutional court is currently in operation, the parliament is working quite well and an ombudsman has been appointed to ensure that human rights are respected. The problem is that the ombudsman is directly dependent on parliament and is therefore under its charge.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1991, Islam Karimov was elected to power with more than 80 % of the votes cast, against just one other candidate. The President"s party, the People"s Democratic Party, won a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections in December 1994, after several opposition parties had been banned. And in March 1995, President Karimov was re‐elected for a period of five years.</p>
<p class="contents">What I saw there did little to reassure me. In fact, freedom of expression is non‐existent, censorship is in force, the press is not independent and there are only four newspapers available, all of which are subject to government control. The freedom of assembly, the freedom of association and the right to demonstrate are all forbidden, and opposition parties are banned. Arbitrary arrests and detentions are a daily occurrence. Torture is frequently carried out and the death penalty is still in force, although we have, of course, asked the Uzbek authorities to commute the death penalty to prison sentences.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion was that democracy only takes root slowly – even here – and that 70 years of communism and totalitarianism cannot simply be forgotten overnight. That is why I asked the Committee on Foreign Affairs to postpone our agreement and give Uzbekistan two years in which to make progress in terms of respect for human rights. Time has unfortunately not changed the situation and today we are receiving some alarming reports from human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent riots on 16 February demonstrated the violence those in power are capable of. Three people are still in prison and have suffered serious violations to their integrity; no proof of their guilt has ever been furnished. One of the prisoners, Mrs Akedova, is 60 years old and is the head of a human rights organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think that we should give Uzbekistan a chance, because this country, this region, needs our help, be it democratic, economic or environmental. The country has substantial mineral and gas resources that are underexploited. It is the world"s fourth largest cotton producer, and yet, according to its leaders, 15 % of the population live in abject poverty and wages are almost as low as they are in the third world. A great many TACIS projects have been set up, ranging from projects promoting democracy, transport, energy, telecommunications, education and the environment, to projects aimed at combating drug trafficking. It must be noted that the volume of drugs from Afghanistan is huge, and that 40 % of the drugs that reach Europe come from this region.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have enough time to elaborate on environmental issues here but I can tell you that I spent two hours flying over the Aral sea, or rather what is left of it. I witnessed the sheer scale of the ecological disaster there, which Europe has failed to gauge the importance of. Pesticides that have been used for years in this area have destroyed everything and dried up the sea. Infant mortality is 10 % higher in this region than in the rest of the country, as is maternal mortality. Many of the people are disabled, miscarriages are so frequent that they are no longer accounted for, and diseases such as cancer are rife.</p>
<p class="contents">We rapidly need to take action in this part of Uzbekistan if we do not wish to bear a heavy responsibility for these stricken peoples. These observations were what finally influenced my decision and what led to Commissioner van den Broek"s commitment to suspend the partnership agreement should human rights violations continue, as provided for in Article 2 of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Mr van den Broek is to visit Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan himself at the end of the month. I hope that he will be able to act as Europe"s spokesman and subsequently give an account of his trip to the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Other elements have contributed to the proposal to conclude this partnership agreement, especially the very worrying regional context in Central Asia. Mr Truscott already discussed this situation and I shall not go into it here. The geostrategic situation of Uzbekistan, which shares a border with Afghanistan, and the fear that the Islamic fundamentalism of the Taliban will spread, finally convinced me to adopt this position.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must indeed be vigilant, but it is vital that, at the dawn of the third millennium, we continue in our historic duty to ensure respect for human rights all over the world. We must also share our knowledge and experience to enable regions to prosper, regions that have been deprived of fundamental freedoms for far too long and that have lapsed into an economic and democratic backwardness that needs to be overcome. We must therefore have confidence in Uzbekistan, and hope that we will not be betrayed. In any case, the Committee on Foreign Affairs will submit an annual report to the European Parliament on how the situation is developing in terms of democracy.</p>

The only thing I would say to the assistants is that it may be worthwhile exposing certain Members who are not paying their assistants the proper wages which they should be entitled to receive. We should expose people when they are bringing this Parliament into disrepute.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also wish to expose an institution that is bringing Parliament into disrepute. The institution is Parliament itself. I understand that people who work for us, such as the freelance interpreters, have not been paid since October. I find that disgraceful! And I hope every Member in this House finds that disgraceful. If I were the shop steward, as I was in Rosyth dockyard, there would not be an interpreter in any of those booths today, until such time as that matter had been corrected.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the Bureau to issue us with a clear, categorical statement as to why people who work for us are not being paid properly. I would ask the Bureau to issue that statement prior to the part‐session in April.</p>
