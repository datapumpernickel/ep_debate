<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolai Wammen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– Mr President, the Spring European Council is, as you know, the European Council’s annual rendezvous to discuss economic and social issues, and the next meetings of Heads of State or Government will be no exception. The European Council will seek to address the current economic crisis, notably, by providing guidance on Member States’ economic and employment policies, putting particular emphasis on accelerating structural reforms to increase competitiveness and create more jobs and on fully exploiting the potential of green growth.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let me stress that this is not to say that we are in a business-as-usual mode. Indeed, we cannot afford complacency. Because of the crisis, we need more than ever to make full use of our new tools – the European Semester and the ‘six-pack’. This is an important priority for the Danish Presidency and we will work in all relevant Council formations to ensure strict implementation of the new rules in order to ensure their credibility, but also to provide opportunity for anchoring this process at the level of Heads of State and Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council will conclude the first phase of the European Semester on the basis of the Commission’s Annual Growth Survey and the discussions held in the different formations of the Council. It is the Presidency’s intention to summarise all these contributions in a synthesis report. Furthermore, the EPSCO and Ecofin Councils will adopt conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the European Council will identify the main challenges facing the EU and give strategic advice and guidance to Member States on the different policies. Let me recall that a number of orientations have already been set out at the informal European Council on 30 January regarding stimulating employment, especially for young people, completing the single market and boosting the financing of the economy, in particular, of the SMEs. Those measures requiring actions at the national level are to be duly reflected in Member States’ national reform programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards measures to be taken at EU level, the Council will report back on the implementation in June. We expect the March European Council to assess the economic situation and express the EU’s determination to continue to take all necessary measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding guidance to Member States on their national reform programmes and stability and convergence programmes, the European Council will discuss the implementation of the 2011 European Semester country-specific recommendations and commitments under the Euro Plus Pact. It will call on Member States to give priority to the areas identified in the Commission’s AGS and in the Council discussion on the European Semester and to reflect this in the NRPs and SCPs. The European Council will also call on the Member States taking part in the Euro Plus Pact to update their commitments and to make them more precise, time-limited, operational and measurable.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding innovation and following up on the orientations set by the European Council, the Danish Presidency will prepare reports setting out progress achieved in this field. On that basis, we expect the European Council to stress the areas where more progress is required to unlock innovation potential, for instance, a single innovation indicator.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second issue on the agenda – international summits – the forthcoming G8, G20 and Rio+20 meetings will address issues important to the EU. The difficulty is, of course, that they will take place in June and the March European Council should therefore take stock of preparation and signal those issues of particular importance.</p>
<p class="contents">On the G20 and the G8, the Mexican Presidency has identified the following priorities for the summit: economic stabilisation and structural reforms as foundations for growth and employment; strengthening the financial system and fostering financial inclusion to promote economic growth; improving the international financial architecture in an interconnected world; enhancing food security and addressing commodity price volatility; promoting sustainable development, green growth and the fight against climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mexican Presidency will organise preparatory ministerial meetings on foreign affairs, tourism, agriculture and labour. The EU position at the meeting will be thoroughly prepared in the coming months in the relevant Council formations in order to ensure a strong and coordinated EU position.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN Rio+20 conference: at this conference, it is an important priority for the Danish Presidency that we should promote a strengthened global institutional framework for sustainable development and advance work on global and coherent post-2015 goals for sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council is expected to underline its strong commitment to an ambitious outcome of the UN conference to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June of this year and stress the need for strong participation from the private sector and civil society. The Council will further develop the EU position on Rio+20 in order to ensure a strong European voice in Rio.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the conclusions of the European Council in December 2011, the European Council will also take up the issue of status as candidate country for Serbia. As you are aware, the European Council, on 9 December 2011, noted that considerable progress has been made by Serbia towards fulfilling the political criteria. With a view to granting Serbia the status of candidate country, the European Council tasked the General Affairs Council to examine and confirm that Serbia has continued to show credible commitment and has achieved further progress in moving forward with the implementation, in good faith, of agreement reached in the dialogue, including on IBM, has reached an agreement on inclusive regional cooperation, and has actively cooperated to enable EULEX and KFOR to execute their mandates.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of its examination, the General Affairs Council will take the decision on candidate status on 28 February, to be confirmed by the March European Council. I hope that a decision can be taken to give Serbia status as a candidate country but that will, of course, also require that Serbia has done what is necessary to live up to the criteria formulated in December.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally the European Council is expected to address foreign policy, probably with the focus on the Southern Neighbourhood and the Arab Spring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maroš Šefčovič, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, Europe is in an unprecedented economic situation. After the years of crisis, our forecasts show that growth is at a virtual standstill and will remain slow for the foreseeable future. Unemployment, especially youth unemployment, is unacceptably high and may remain so for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the background against which we need action and against which the actions of European institutions and national governments alike will be judged. We need to deliver on the greatest concerns of our citizens – jobs and growth – and we need to mark a turning point in the way we have addressed this crisis until now.</p>
<p class="contents">As we already said in our road map last October, we need decisive action to address Greece’s problems and restore public finances to health. We need to strengthen the European banking system and to build credible firewalls for the euro area, and we need stability and discipline to prevent a repeat of recent events, but unless we can also get our economy growing and creating jobs, we will only have a partial solution and we will not win the support of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the informal European Council was such an important stepping stone for the Spring European Council. It represented agreement among Europe’s leaders to concentrate on a few immediate priorities with substantial potential for growth and employment – first and foremost for our young people and for our SMEs, to help them to grow and to create jobs again. This message was already at the core of our 2012 Annual Growth Survey (AGS), adopted by the Commission last November, and with this AGS, we are launching the new European Semester. As you know, our survey is a contribution to the Spring European Council and we will call upon the European Council to give very strong backing to the priorities we have identified. I hope that we can also count on the support of this House to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The Annual Growth Survey points to the number of priorities we have to achieve in the future and the priorities which should guide the Member States in drawing up their own new national programmes, which are due to be presented in April. On the basis of this, the Commission will put forward country-specific proposals for the discussion in May and adoption at the June European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">What is very important is that very little of what is in the Annual Growth Survey is completely new. There is, and has been for some time, a broad consensus on the need to cover jobs and growth as well as getting public finances in order. We need a balanced approach, covering growth and jobs and the improvement of fiscal consolidations and public finances, but what we need even more is implementation and respect for the commitments which we have already undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as new ideas are concerned, we have to remind ourselves that we already have a policy for jobs and growth. It is called Europe 2020. We also have a European Semester which represents a quantum leap in economic policy coordination in Europe. For the first time this year, the semester will take place within our strengthened system of economic governance based on the ‘six-pack’ legislation that the European Parliament played such an important role in developing. What is needed now is a firm commitment at national and European levels to picking up the pace of the reforms and to carrying that commitment through to 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already put forward a proposal regarding the problem which is probably the most burdensome and most difficult for our citizens – namely, youth unemployment. We cannot accept the fact that we have 7.5 million young people across Europe classified as NEETs, which means that they are not in employment, education or training. They definitely do not deserve this.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to tackle these high levels of youth unemployment and we need to do so in a sustainable manner. Getting young people on to the labour market is an essential element of our efforts to ensure future growth. We have already set up action teams that will visit the eight Member States with the highest youth unemployment rates and they will examine, together with national authorities and social partners, what we can do better, how we can make better use of EU and national funds, and how we can focus our efforts on social policies, SMEs and job creation for young people. I am very happy to report that our initial contacts with the Member States have been very encouraging and I hope that we will already be able to bring a positive report to the Spring European Council on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">But these actions must be part of the wider reform of labour market policies aimed at getting more Europeans on to the labour market and increasing their employment opportunities. I am sure that these issues will be discussed again at greater length in a moment when you debate the Cornelissen, Gauzès and Berès reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I started my presentation in a slightly downbeat fashion, but I would like to conclude on a more optimistic note. While no one is brave enough yet to suggest that we have turned the corner, that the worst might be over, and that we might finally be back on the road to growth, I think it is fair to say that we now at least have far greater control over our future. The new measures that have been proposed by the Commission and agreed by this House – now I am talking about the ‘six-pack’ and other measures – are giving much more visibility to the European Semester and are allowing us to take action far earlier than before and to avoid the kind of fire-fighting that has dominated our discussions until now.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, the Commission adopted its first alert mechanism report according to which the 12 countries should be subject to a more in-depth review. Our recommendations will now be discussed in the Council and Eurogroup and, of course, the feedback from this House into this discussion would be very welcome. This might not seem particularly optimistic, especially for the 12 Member States concerned, but it underlines the rapid and effective improvements that have already been made to the way in which public finances are managed in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to have the right tools in place to monitor progress, address risk and propose remedies well before a crisis hits. We must make sure that the crisis that we are now going through will never again be repeated. Thanks to widespread agreement between the Commission, Parliament and the Council, we now have the tools and, although it is early days, I would say that we have very strong indications that they are working. I fully expect the positive spirit of the informal Council to continue through to the Spring Council, that the Heads of State and Government will endorse the guidelines for growth and, more importantly, that they will meet their commitments on the ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the financial crisis has undermined this trust, the trust that our fellow citizens have not only for each other but also for policy makers, and this distrust continues to grow. In the face of this danger, we must be unambiguous. We need measures to restore confidence in the good management of our finances and the Treaty to be signed next month will be one of the cornerstones of this.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need measures to restore confidence in the governance of the euro and this cannot be achieved by issuing contradictory statements. In this regard, I am very surprised by the statements made by Commissioner Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the Commission, who is of the opinion that it would not be a tragedy if Greece left the euro area. I ask the Commission: is this your official position? I would ask the Commission to address this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, after years of imprudent management of public finances in many of our countries, now is the time for change. This applies even more to Greece of course, but we will not avoid spending cuts —and Greece cannot take any more. Our Latvian friends showed the way some years ago, by reforming their public management without any outside help and accepting painful sacrifices that led to a return to growth.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, for my part, I also trust in the Greek people’s enormous sense of responsibility and I am not among those who would have them believe they will immediately overcome the crisis without reforming.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, as I stated just after the last European Council, it will take more to build the economy than growth and employment reforms. However, the package proposed to us at this stage is not, in any way, up to the challenge. I firmly believe this is no longer the time for business as usual. It is time to make commitments on a par with those of the post-war Marshall Plan or even the 1992 single market project.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for Europe to be ambitious. The time has come to establish a project which mobilises all our resources to restore growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">My group expects the European Commission to propose a legislative package of this kind, in close cooperation with Parliament, as we did with the ‘six-pack’. This package could include measures as ambitious as completing the internal market. We need to know which countries are still blocking this market. The Single Market Act, the Services Directive and the European Patent are all being blocked by an absurd dispute over location. This package must also reduce the burdens imposed on our businesses which stifle their competitiveness. In return, leave it to them to commit to providing more employment, above all, for young people. Ultimately, there is no magic formula for overcoming this crisis unless we demonstrate political will, have the courage to tell our fellow citizens the truth and see through our commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">As a former manager, I can tell you, I have lived through many crises and I would ask the Commission and the Heads of State or Government who are always thinking of the next election — I understand this and therefore, it is up to us, in Parliament and in the Commission, to show them the way, to put forward proposals, bold proposals for major projects, for example — to establish the internal market and condemn those who do not.</p>
<p class="contents">These are measures, small measures, which together will perhaps allow us to quickly return to 1% growth.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hannes Swoboda, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Šefčovič, the Council is finally intending to come to grips with the important problems relating to growth and employment. For a long period, for many years and months, nothing has been done in these areas. The Council is also planning to resolve the imbalances in economic policy. This subject is also mentioned in the report which the Commission has published. However, perhaps too little has been said about the fact that both sides, the countries with deficits and those with surpluses, must do something to correct the imbalances, as Germany promised in the G20 meetings and resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the rules are concerned, Mr Fox, you should take a look at reality, at the empirical facts. Many countries are following the rules, in particular, countries like Germany and Austria, which have the lowest levels of youth unemployment. We need to focus on reality and not on the ideology.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I support what the Council and the Commission are now doing. However, I doubt whether there has really been a change of direction, particularly when I look at what is going on in Greece. A lot of decisions have been made and a great deal of what has already been said today brings to mind the G20 summit in Cannes, for example. I will come back to that subject this afternoon. The case of Greece shows that we have not yet learned to change our way of thinking. The economic situation in Greece is being put at risk by radicals who are setting fire to Athens. It is being endangered by those people, and Mr Daul is right in this respect, who are not prepared to take over political responsibility in Greece. It is also being put at risk by a Troika which is calling for changes that will only make the situation in Greece worse and I do not know on whose behalf they are doing this, definitely not on behalf of social democracy or of many of the people of Greece. What will the extreme cuts in pensions, salaries and minimum wages achieve? A deeper recession and greater poverty. This will reduce people’s purchasing power, lower tax revenues and increase the deficit. This is the policy which the European Commission is unfortunately also supporting, together with the European monetary fund, for Greece in particular. We want to see a change of direction.</p>
<p class="contents">If wages and pensions are cut, but there is no increase in competition, because there are so many restrictions on competition, for example, then prices will rise and there will be more poverty. What the Troika is demanding, with the support of some members of the Commission, in other words, cuts in social security and dismantling the system of social dialogue, is in stark contrast to what has been said at G20 summits and in many other meetings. For us, social dialogue and the role of the social partnership is absolutely essential, in particular, as regards the reforms in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">People are saying that the trade unions must take responsibility, but they must also be given responsibility. If we take responsibility away from them, we cannot expect them to assume responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an alternative route to the one suggested by the orthodox Troika. For this reason, I have proposed that three prominent Members of my group, three former ministers, should travel to Greece and investigate, together with the Greeks and the people who want to introduce the reforms, which measures will really effectively reduce the deficit, because they will lead to more growth and create more jobs. That is also the difference in our approach. To a certain extent, Greece is being blackmailed by the Troika and it has no say in the matter. This is putting democracy at risk. We want to work together with Greece on these issues. Greece does not need a headmaster from Germany or from elsewhere with a cane in his hand. Greece needs help and support. It needs to be advised, not dictated to. We want to give Greece advice. We want to work together with Greece to help it to emerge from this serious crisis, just as the Americans did with the Marshall Plan for Europe. We must not threaten the Greeks. We must help them, because help for Greece is also help for the euro area and for Europe.</p>

However, we have all heard that the finance ministers yesterday cancelled their meeting in Brussels at which they intended to approve the second aid package for Greece. What does that mean? What does it mean for Greece and for Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that our common goal is to keep Greece in the euro area and I would like to respond to Mr Daul on this subject. I do not agree with what Ms Kroes has said about Greece remaining in the euro area, but the reason why she has said it and why so many people are so impatient, is the behaviour of her sister party, Nea Dimokratia, in particular. If they could just call Mr Samaras to order, it would be very helpful. I believe it would be better for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">We want Greece to stay in the euro area, but it is important to make one thing clear. In the past, the Greek Government has made a lot of promises, but has delivered very little. The introduction of another austerity package does not by any means indicate that what is being promised will actually be put into practice, and that is exactly what this is all about. It is about structural reform, which will lead to further aid being made available. If it takes the right course, Greece can count on our support. However, we no longer need preliminary work; instead, we are looking for action.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said here that the situation in Greece is genuinely dramatic. In addition to the savings which are needed, Mr Swoboda, from 1991 to 2007, in other words, before the crisis, Greece had an average annual national deficit of 6.6%. Greece is now having to pay the bill for its poor policies in the past. Of course, we do not envy the Greeks. That is absolutely clear. We want to get the country and the economy going again and the trade unions will be an important part of this. Trade unions have played a constructive role in increasing competitiveness in Germany over many years.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic performance has fallen by 7% over the last three months. This is why we now need genuine structural reforms, in other words, a tax reform which is worthy of the name. Progress must be made with privatisation in important sectors such as energy generation, ports and lotteries, every area where the state is too heavily involved. The proposed cuts in the bloated civil service are also needed. Parts of the Greek political system have been based on this. People simply found positions for their supporters in a ministry, a public authority or a public company. In other words, the state sector is completely bloated.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind everyone in this context that it was the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which called for a sort of Marshall Plan some time ago. We call it the Hercules Plan and we will be happy to work on it. However, after the last Council meeting, our group also made three very specific proposals for measures to promote growth and create jobs. These proposals are addressed to the Council: the implementation of the European patent, the deployment of unused funding from the European Union budget and a plan to reduce the risk of infection within Europe. We want a debt redemption pact for the whole of Europe. We expect the Council finally to tackle this problem.</p>

However, apparently, we are able to function on different planets.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Šefčovič from the Commission, you mentioned 2020 and it made us think that once upon a time, there was 2020. A lovely fairytale. Once upon a time, there was also the Lisbon strategy. These were goals which were formulated, but were ultimately never put into practice. I am really very pleased that the Council has finally realised that we have high rates of youth unemployment. This has been the case for about the last eight years and they have just discovered the fact. Welcome to the real world! Perhaps you will discover other things which are happening in the world over the course of the next eight years. When you talk about youth unemployment, you could make the link with Greece. How do you plan to resolve the problem of youth unemployment in Greece? Now we come to one of the Commission’s central problems. If the neoliberal Taliban are in power in the Commission, then the Member States will have a hard time. I can tell you what is going on in Greece at the moment, and Mr Swoboda is right. It is not only irresponsible of the Troika, but I would almost say that it is criminal.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give you an example. I do not know which officials had their fingers in the pie. The Council and the Commission are saying that the Greeks need to save EUR 326 million. The response of the Greek Government and Mr Samaras, after they had attempted rather belatedly to put the situation in order, was that they would make the savings from the defence budget, to which some of the Commission officials replied that they must make the cuts in pensions. How did they come up with this idea and why? It is right that the money should be found from the defence budget. This is what I call the neoliberal Taliban.</p>
<p class="contents">You are all calling on Greece to make savings. Mr Lambsdorff, it is not true that nothing is happening. First of all, without taking into account interest, Greek debt fell last year from 10% to between 3 and 4%. They have reduced their debt by 6% of GDP. We cannot say to these people that they have done nothing. The situation is slowly starting to become outrageous. Sometimes I think I am going mad. We want to give the Greeks EUR 130 billion. Now there is a problem with EUR 380 million and we are putting a stop to everything because of the EUR 380 million. Not to beat about the bush, this is coercion. It is coercion of the Greek people and it is not a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would finally like to say that if everyone here believes that this is the way to save Greece, then they are wrong. You cannot introduce reforms without the support of the people. If you constantly provoke the people, then they will make the wrong decisions. It may be that the people of Greece currently have the wrong ideas about certain subjects, but you will not solve this problem by making them walk on their knees. They must be able to walk upright.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say one thing to the Germans in this House. When Germany occupied Greece, it transferred 486 million from the Greek central bank to Berlin. This money has never been repaid. Taking inflation into account, this amounts to EUR 81 billion that Germany owes Greece. Why do you not tell the Germans this? This would pay off one-sixth of Greece’s debts. This is how European history can be explained. It is known as the European narrative in European history.</p>

EU summits are becoming a political ritual, somehow divorced from the real world.</p>
<p class="contents">Every summit – and we have seen lots of them in recent months – comes and goes with the same old mantras and demonstrations of hope triumphing over experience. A little bit more austerity and immediately confidence in the euro will somehow magically come flooding back. Another Treaty package to tinker with the rules and the markets will suddenly realise that they have been wrong all along and the euro is, in fact, completely sound. And then at the end of them all, we see the same ritual – the stern-faced leaders emerge, they gaze at the cameras and they repeat the same old mantras: ‘we will do all we can to save the euro’. But they never actually quite specify exactly what they are going to do to save the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">If politics has traditionally been seen as the art of the possible, the EU is turning it into an art of delusion. Surely, eventually, this nonsense needs to stop. The risks are becoming too great for yet another of the many summits that come and go, and which fail to face reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with Greece. I was amazed that neither the Commission nor the Council mentioned anything about Greece in their opening statements, as if it has suddenly disappeared off the map. Nobody believes that the latest package will save Greece. None of the MPs in Greece who voted for it on Sunday night seem to believe this, none of the international commentators or economists believe it; even the German Finance Minister who insisted on it does not seem to believe that it will save Greece. Because even if all of the measures that were voted for on Sunday night are implemented – and, given Greece’s record, that is probably unlikely – then by 2020, after eight more years of grinding austerity, Greece would still be in a worse position than Italy is today.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece is suffering from a 30% loss of competitiveness against Germany. How do you eliminate such a deficit? Economic reform in the long term will clearly be essential, but in the short term, there really is now only one solution: a default, coupled with a devaluation, is the only way now to salvage something from the wreckage of the Greek economy, and to save a generation or more of young Greeks from a miserable economic inheritance.</p>
<p class="contents">All of the energy currently being devoted to drafting and ratifying a new Treaty that is completely irrelevant to the ongoing crisis would be better employed drafting and implementing a plan for the orderly withdrawal of Greece from the euro, including carefully prepared support for the banks that will be most affected. That is the sustainable solution and everything else is just a very expensive way of further kicking the can down the road. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This year, however, the debate is likely to be overshadowed by the dramatic situation in Greece. Greece is the ideal example on which to base a discussion about the failure of the economic and financial policies of the European Union. The predominant global policy of deregulation and privatisation has plunged the European Union into the most serious crisis it has ever experienced. As a result of this policy of deregulation, the global financial markets and also the commodity markets have got completely out of control or, more accurately, have fallen victim to speculators. The Greek crisis is also a result of EU policy, because the existing macro-economic imbalances between the Member States will be significantly exacerbated by the Europe 2020 strategy. These imbalances are what the financial speculators are now gambling on.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only Greece which is fighting for survival. A policy which has had such disastrous consequences in Greece and in other countries, such as Portugal, Spain and Italy, needs fundamental changes. In fact, it must be reversed. Austerity measures are making the economic recession worse, as the fall in the gross domestic product figures of these countries has shown so dramatically. My group was strongly opposed to the Europe 2020 strategy and the imposition of one-sided austerity and debt reduction policies right from the outset. Instead, we need programmes to stimulate sustainable growth and to create jobs, together with programmes for investment, for the environment and for education.</p>
<p class="contents">A policy which involves axing social services, abolishing social legislation and restricting fundamental democratic and parliamentary rights, while at the same time supporting the banks to the tune of hundreds of billions of euro, can only lead to outrage and social unrest. The Greek Government is losing its political base, the parties which belong to it are losing their members and the structure of society is collapsing. This is the result of Greek and European policy and it requires a fundamental change in the EU’s approach in favour of one which serves the interests of the people rather than those of the banks.</p>
<p class="contents">One scenario could begin with the financial markets. Let us imagine that the European Central Bank (ECB) could lend money directly to the Member States via a public bank. This would enable the Member States to circumvent the international financial markets and to obtain the loans they need at favourable interest rates. No one could gamble on Greek, Portuguese or other bonds. All of the hype surrounding the markets would disappear. Does that sound appealing? All we need is the determination to take this step, and this is what my group is calling for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He said: ‘violence and destruction have no place in a democratic country’. What democratic country? He is not even a democratically elected Prime Minister. He has been appointed by you guys.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece is not run through democracy now, it is run through a Troika: three foreign officials who fly into Athens airport and tell the Greeks what they can and cannot do. The violence and destruction that you saw on Sunday is being caused directly because people are having their democratic rights taken from them; what else can they do? If I were a Greek citizen, I would have been out there joining those protests on Sunday; I would be out there trying to bring down this monstrosity that has been put upon those people. In the puppet’s efforts to get the MPs to vote for the bail-out package, he warned them that if they did not do so, there would be a dramatic decline in living standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Has he looked outside the front door? Has he seen the fact that 50% of the young people are unemployed already? Has he seen the fact that the economy, far from stalling, has contracted for five years in a row, and is now accelerating on a downward debt spiral, a contraction of 7% per annum?</p>
<p class="contents">Greece is being driven into the ground, and when it comes to chaos, you ain’t seen nothing yet. These policies are driving Greece towards a revolution. They need to be set free. If they do not get the drachma back, you will be responsible for something truly, truly horrible.</p>

I can remember papers on the topic of youth unemployment at the end of the 1990s which identified that some Member States had lower levels of youth unemployment and others had higher levels, and which explained that it would be a good idea to look at what those countries with low rates were doing. Fourteen years have now passed and nothing has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">When people say that we need to show solidarity, I would like to remind them that in the last 31 years, Greece has received more than EUR 100 billion from the Structural Funds. That is an expression of European solidarity. It has repeatedly been said that the money can be used, for example, to fund education and training, in particular for young people. I can remember initiatives in the region which I come from that involved attempts to introduce the dual educational system in different areas of Greece. However, this did not work. The energy revolution is still in progress in Greece and this and many other things could be financed using money from the Structural Funds. This demonstrates Europe’s solidarity. However, we also need to increase the pressure to ensure that the funds made available by the European Union are used for the purposes which will be discussed during the spring summit. Otherwise, this will once again be a summit with lots of interesting papers but no concrete results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It passed them because it had no other choice; because the majority of Greek people have agreed to suffer numerous sacrifices in order to remain in the euro area, so that the country does not go bankrupt and have to leave the euro; because the majority of parliamentarians put the nation’s duty before their conscience, before their conviction that we are reversing decades of achievements in labour rights. How has Europe responded? That ‘nothing is certain’, that ‘we shall see’ and that ‘there are second thoughts’.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be clear; Greece has made great progress and now it needs a clear, positive message, a hope that will give Greeks the strength to shoulder the burden of the obligations it has undertaken. However, on the contrary, every day we receive contradictory messages which do not assuage the anxieties of the Greek people. The key point of the Spring Council is employment and growth, but what are the specific proposals and the framework for the countries hit by the crisis? So far, we have only heard wish lists, with ever harsher measures being imposed in practice, with wage and pension cuts leading to spiralling unemployment and exacerbating the recession. Today, we expect the Council, albeit belatedly, to present specific, targeted measures for growth and unemployment. Unfortunately, the margins, not only in my country, Greece, but in the euro area as a whole, are very narrow.</p>

Evidently, the Commission therefore has an exit strategy at the ready, from which it follows that it would actually be better for the Greeks to leave the currency union. I can totally understand why. It is our duty, as democrats, to inform citizens of all possible options. Greece is going to the dogs because of the cuts which are being forced on it by non-elected bureaucrats. The Troika is something akin to a dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, the Commission has blown the whistle on Commissioner Kroes after her statement about Greece, but I would ask the Commission to ensure transparency. Bring that exit strategy out in the open. Meanwhile, billions of taxpayers’ money is again being poured into the bottomless Greek pit when everyone knows, even the IMF, that this round of financial support is not going to help Greece any more than the previous rounds did. Greece will have to leave the currency union if it is to stand any chance at all of economic recovery. Even if we completely wrote off the Greek debt, the Greek economy would not be able to survive in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">We and the Greeks have a right to such an exit strategy. There can be no talk of democracy if all kinds of secret reports are knocking about inside the Commission.

On the one hand, I note that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has condemned a pension reform that it has just applauded in a similar manner in Italy. It is not clear how a measure that is commendable for one country can be negative for another.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, governments asking Greece to show proof of its virtue and of its cuts in public expenditure are also effectively forcing it to buy military hardware, thus exponentially increasing that same public expenditure. I find this an enormous contradiction. Who is the true victim of such a contradiction? Many say it is the Greek people. However, there is another victim, and that is Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I think you will all have seen the pictures of the Greek Parliament besieged in the midst of burning buildings, among which European flags with a Nazi swastika in the middle could be seen. Be careful, therefore, because the true victim of this crisis of democracy is precisely a democratic process such as our own, which – despite the fact that it acts in the interests of European citizens and guarantees peace and growth – is perceived today as being totally evil.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take action.

How do we explain this to the Greek citizens who are being doubly punished with pressure and injustice?</p>
<p class="contents">There are alternative approaches. Let me propose one: the fight against tax avoidance. The tax haven provided by Switzerland costs Greece an estimated EUR 16.4 billion in loss of earnings. Tackling this resolutely would enable Greece to get back on track with the stability pact without sacrificing the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece has been pushed by circumstances into considering a bilateral agreement with Switzerland, similar to the Rubik agreements signed by the United Kingdom and Germany. Executing this partial levy on fraudulent investments, instead of prosecuting fraudsters, is institutional recognition of tax fraud and a bad deal financially. The Union should follow the example of the United States, which has successfully forced Switzerland to provide the bank details of suspected fraudsters.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the Commission’s plans now that its services have concluded the illegality of these agreements in a note that I believe should be made public? What does it suggest for the future now that its proposed Savings Tax Directive has been buried by the Council and, in particular, by Germany?</p>
<p class="contents">In short, what does it intend to propose so as to stop constantly penalising the poor? I would like it if the Commissioner could respond because this question is important, but I can see that he has not been listening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new borrowing agreement and its flanking measures will make modern-day slaves of the workers, forcing them to work for a loaf of bread. The attack is sweeping. Crushing cuts to wages, pensions, health, welfare and education, mass unemployment, poverty and the impoverishment of the people. Everything is being demolished.

Three days after the new Memorandum was passed, the EU has already started a new round of terrorism and pressure on the Greek people to accept even worse measures. This spells the end of self-delusion about a unified EU, convergence, solidarity and peace. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators on the streets of Greece, Portugal, Belgium, Spain, France and elsewhere are shouting as much from the rooftops.

It is not, therefore, an official EU Treaty. Whilst Member States can, under Article 273 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, bring an alleged breach of a private agreement to the Court of Justice, there is no provision in the Treaties for the Court to enforce agreements on excessive budget deficits, despite claims to the contrary, and it might not even be able to adjudicate on them.</p>
<p class="contents">If the parties to this agreement wish it to be enforceable, it will have to become a Treaty agreed by all Member States. Mr Cameron saying that he does not object to the European Court or the European Commission being used is simply not enough for it to become a Treaty.</p>

I hope that at future European Council meetings, Mr Cameron will veto any attempt to turn this agreement into a Treaty, with the purpose of preventing the creation of an economic straitjacket that might one day be imposed on Britain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Greater budgetary responsibility at national level is necessary but insufficient, and without concrete steps towards growth and solidarity, it could lead to an unsustainable downward spiral towards recession.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no evidence of Parliament’s approach, which is well thought-out and balanced, in the preparatory documents of the European Council. For the Council and the Commission, the word ‘growth’ seems to mean fiscal consolidation and salary reductions. It is true that there are positive developments taking place on the internal market, but they are not enough. Growth requires a robust internal driver, which involves a two-pronged objective: to reinforce internal demand in countries with a surplus and to promote an extraordinary investment plan financed by project bonds.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission only interprets the macro-economic imbalances in one direction – ignoring the logic of the Ferreira rule – and there is no trace of project bonds and shared investments in the European Council documents, except for a vacuous game in which the card picked is to use the existing resources of the Structural Funds, a bit like the way Mussolini used to move his tanks around in the Second World War to make it seem as if he had a bigger army than he actually had.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore clear that this ruling class has had its day, and only a major political sea change can save Europe from disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet I do not consider it such. By now, it has become clear that austerity measures alone are insufficient to guarantee recovery from the crisis. I find it incomprehensible how certain Commissioners can disregard economic analyses based on precise indicators and perhaps base their evaluations on political sentiments, thereby causing disturbances to the markets and, even more importantly, to the Member State concerned. They then envisage a penalty, a withholding of funds, followed by further budgetary austerity, that is, they are letting the Member State concerned bleed out. There is a further problem. How is it that when the IMF or the EU adopt short-term measures to restore the budget, it is acceptable, whereas if a Member State does so on its own, it is not? What is the reason for this?

Cuts will take us into recession, and the economic slump will make it even harder to repay debts and their burden will keep growing. The need to kick start employment growth is still underestimated. Whereas austerity measures are slowly becoming law, there are still only general calls for a growth and employment initiative. From a European perspective, such steps are extremely unfortunate. The growth initiative is weak. The fiscal compact is being adopted outside the European Treaties and has exemptions, and the role of Parliament – that is, us – in the negotiations on these matters is reduced to the absolute minimum.

We constantly talk about Greece here, and rightly so, but we must not forget that, behind Greece, stand Portugal, Spain and France. We all watched as they were downgraded by the credit rating agencies. So we must know that the bankruptcy of Greece spells the bankruptcy of European ideals and the bankruptcy of the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">Hannes Swoboda, Chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, has made a very wise proposal: that we socialists should set up our own Troika, a Troika comprising three former Ministers for Finance, Mr Goebbels, Mr Ferreira and Mr Kalfin. I therefore propose, because I have heard a lot of people speak with solidarity and social cohesion in Europe in mind, that an organisation – a Troika – should be set up from the whole of Parliament and then all of us in all the political groups who believe in Europe, all of us who want the European Union alive, should draft a motion for a resolution that shows that the European Parliament, which represents the citizens of Europe, exists, is taking action and wants the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maroš Šefčovič, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, this was a very lively debate and a lot of direct questions were addressed to the Commission. Some of the comments on the issue were not very positive, but please bear with me and I will try to respect the time limit.</p>
<p class="contents">First, there was a question asking what the official position of the Commission was on Greece. I want to make it absolutely clear that in the Commission, we want Greece to remain a member of the euro area. We have stated this many times and I am very glad that I can restate it today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would go even further. I would say that Greece does not have a closer and better ally than the Commission these days. From day one – in Athens, in Brussels, in all the capitals where the issue of Greece was discussed – we have been present and we have been trying to do our utmost to help and assist Greece. The Commission and all the officials are working flat out to iron out the programme for Greece and to help Greece to prepare a realistic and good programme. We have worked day and night, with no summer breaks, no winter breaks and no weekends, all day long.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that we have always been looking for ways in which to get the best solution for Greece and how to get it supported by the citizens in Greece. Do not forget, these solutions must be also supported in other Member States, because – and I know that we probably disagree on this with some of you – we are already talking about unprecedented support which has been offered to help Greece. Therefore, I cannot comment on, and I resent, Mr Cohn-Bendit’s comments concerning Marco Buti or other officials of the Commission. They really do not deserve this.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have ultra-liberal Taliban, but hard-working, dedicated officials who are keeping Greece from falling into the abyss of disorderly default. What is the difference between the situation and the plan the Troika offered and disorderly default? I think the best you can do is listen to the very graphic description of this possibility made by the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Papademos, or the Greek Finance Minister, Mr Venizelos.</p>
<p class="contents">There was criticism here of the measures on the salaries and pensions, but do we know of an alternative? What would be an alternative to disorderly default? What would be the consequences? I think that the Greek Parliament has realised how dreadful this alternative is and, therefore, supported the proposals made by the Troika by a big majority of two-thirds. They supported the package.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the concrete question from Mr Goebbels who suggested the minimum wage cut by 22%; this was a request from the Eurogroup. And why? Because this measure is essential to fight unemployment and restore competitiveness to the Greek economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to consider the context. Labour costs in Greece rose by 54% in the years following 2000, compared with 28% in Portugal and 18% in Germany. It is true that they have fallen by an average of 40% over the two years 2010 and 2011, but more clearly needs to be done. The minimum monthly wage in Greece is at present EUR 110 higher than in Spain, and EUR 266 higher than in Portugal. These are the facts.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Cries of dissent)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What else has the Commission done for Greece? I would just like to list some of the measures. EU cofinancing rates have been boosted by 10% to as high as 95%. EUR 500 million of EU funding is being reprogrammed so it can be used to guarantee financing provided to SMEs. Around 180 major projects are being kick-started, which will result in 100 000 jobs, including in the construction phase. All this whilst the EU is providing continued financial solidarity to Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">The two programmes put together amount to EUR 240 billion, and this is equivalent to over 100% of the Greek GDP. I know that some political forces question the adequacy of the amount of financial assistance provided to Greece, but it should also be recalled that the level of support in this unprecedented show of solidarity reflects the mandate given by the Member States under which the Troika and Greece have conducted the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">You also know very well that the Commission was helping the Greek authorities to negotiate with PSI – private sector investors – on private sector involvement. This may result in an overall figure – including both programmes and the private sector involvement as a result of the negotiations – of well over EUR 300 billion. So I think it is evident that the effort being made is huge.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the Eurogroup meeting of today, yesterday it became clear that the second programme and arrangements for its funding from both sides – Greece and the Eurogroup – both need to be finalised. Today, there will be a conference call and the Commission will do its utmost to put all the finishing touches to the agreement, because we want this to be a success and we want to do our utmost to help Greece. I hope that we will have a positive result next Monday when the Eurogroup and the Ecofin ministers meet.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will allow me, I will also comment on two other questions. Mr Daul asked what the European Spring summit will be about. It will be about economic governance and about growth and jobs. I agree with him 100% that what we need to do is to progress much faster with the Single Market Act, and I would like to thank this Parliament for its support.</p>
<p class="contents">I had a very constructive meeting yesterday with the Conference of Committee Chairs, where I think we made quite good progress. I really felt the strong will to go faster with the legislative proposals, so we can remove the remaining barriers to the single market which are preventing the European Union from using it better to create new jobs and economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The Services Directive is a pain – I agree with you, Mr President – and therefore we took three Member States to the Court because delaying putting this very important growth-enhancing measure into operation is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is to Mr Lamberts. Yesterday, we adopted for the first time the alert mechanism report and we are going to screen and analyse the situation of the 12 Member States. France is among them. In the event that Germany is not within the established indicators, I can assure you that the German situation will be analysed as well. We will do our utmost to be absolutely fair and to use the new economic governance tool we have at our disposal with the utmost efficiency and utmost fairness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolai Wammen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, on behalf of the Council, I would like to thank Parliament for a lively and very committed debate. I would also like to make it absolutely clear that we have listened and that, as far as possible, we will follow the good advice that has been given here today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important for the Danish Presidency to make it clear that the approach that has been set out concerning a responsible economic policy – where we tighten our belts and where we need to implement the ‘six-pack’ and the other financial initiatives fully and with precision in order for us to ensure that Europe gets back on track – will be a top priority for the Danish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would also like to state very clearly that this cannot stand alone. There is also a need for us to set a clear course when it comes to growth and the creation of jobs. From the point of view of the Danish Presidency, these two things should go hand in hand: financial restraint, on the one hand, and growth and jobs, on the other. We must not be satisfied with just the one, but need to have both of these if we are really to get Europe and the EU back on course.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore very positive that it was made absolutely clear at the informal meeting of the Heads of State or Government on 30 January that precisely these aspects of growth and jobs are now to be placed very high on the European agenda, and that we said that what is needed in particular is to create jobs and opportunities for those young people who, throughout Europe, are looking to the European Parliament, the Commission and the Member States to answer one question; namely, how they can be assured of, and have a real chance of getting, a job in this Europe of ours.</p>
<p class="contents">There are millions of young people waiting for the answer, and it is an answer that we must provide jointly. It is therefore absolutely necessary for us to make a start on creating the opportunities for the nearly seven million young people who lack jobs and training. We also clearly need to take a perspective that encompasses all of the 23 million Europeans in the EU who are without a job right now. This is a top priority for the Danish Presidency, and I would like to thank all of the Members of Parliament here today who have raised the important question of how we can ensure that this remains on the agenda. I would like to thank both Mr Daul and Mr Swoboda and all of the other speakers who have made this point very clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Greece, our position is clear. In Europe, we have a joint responsibility to help Greece out of the crisis. However, Greece obviously has a responsibility to help itself out of the crisis, too. We therefore also believe that it was a very good thing that the Greek Parliament took a firm, difficult, but also necessary, decision a few days ago. This does not mean that all of the problems are solved, but it does mean that we can now make a start on hopefully getting Greece genuinely back on track. We also have to say to our friends in Greece that it was, without doubt, important to take the decisions in Parliament, but it is even more important to actually put these decisions into practice. All of us have a responsibility to help Greece to do that, and all of the political players in Greece also have a responsibility to help this become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, this meeting that we have ahead of us is a very important one. Even though we have talked a great deal about the economy today, even though we have talked a great deal about Greece, it is also important to remember that the vision and direction of a Presidency encompasses other areas, too, and that is why it is also important to set the international environment/climate change agenda at the G8 and G20 and, of course, at the EU+20 meetings as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise what Mr Guerrero said regarding the fact that Parliament as well as the Commission and the Member States need to remember to speak out strongly for European values and to come down hard on any attempts at protectionism or attempts by Member States to separate themselves off or to attack the right to be different in Europe. That is an important point of which I hope everyone took note.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment is that, at a time when Europe is experiencing such a deep crisis as it is right now, it is, in the Danish Presidency’s view, absolutely crucial that there is close cooperation between this Parliament, the Commission and the Member States. This is not the time to fight one another; it is the time to stand together shoulder to shoulder for the sake of the seven million young people who deserve a new opportunity and for the 23 million people who need a job, and because we need to get Europe back on track. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus, the upcoming Council meeting of 1-2 March will be taking place at a rather crucial time, in particular, against the background of a possible Greek default. The European Council and the European Commission have already announced the current crisis cannot be tackled with austerity measures alone and that attention should also be given to stimulating growth and job creation. But the proposals put forward to promote such growth are not sufficient to deliver results. These proposals lack the funds and reforms that Europe desperately needs. I agree with colleagues calling for a new proposal following the same guidelines and the same type of budget as for the Marshall Plan for Europe’s recovery in 1948. We need now significant investment for supporting SMEs, entrepreneurship and self-employment initiatives, which, in return, will encourage economic expansion and job creation and improve the EU’s long-term competitiveness. Bold decisions and strong political will to promote fiscal stability are needed to restore investment and growth to Europe.

It is these three areas that lay the foundations of a successful future for Europe and its recovery from a protracted economic crisis. Growth can be achieved through research and development and the application of new technologies, fiscal adjustment through the restructuring of state expenditure and major supply systems, and job creation through incentives to employers and the expansion of the competences of young workers. I therefore stand by my position that a pan-European economic policy cannot be based solely on austerity.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I believe that the treaties on economic stability, consolidation and governance, and those establishing the European Stability Mechanism, do not offer a definite cure for Europe’s ailments, as a Hungarian politician, I do think that it is an elementary interest for my country to join them. I welcome the fact that the Hungarian Government led by <span class="italic">Fidesz</span> changed its initial negative, aloof attitude and committed itself to signing the agreement. It must be noted, however, that although these measures may secure Europe’s future temporarily, they will definitely fail to do so in the long term. New resources must be found to increase consumption, stimulate micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, and thereby generate new jobs. One solution could be the introduction of Eurobonds and a transaction tax, which has been the subject of debates in Brussels for a long time.</p>

It is unacceptable in terms of the procedure adopted, which is anti-democratic and rides roughshod over half a century of the Community method. It is also unacceptable in terms of content, in that it is aimed at tightening the already suffocating straitjacket of the Stability Pact and imposing unprecedented austerity policies throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">These policies can do nothing but plunge us into a lasting recession, destroy our social model and make the poorest citizens pay the price for a crisis of which they are the first victims. They will not resolve the debt problem as austerity will kill consumption and investment and, with them, any hope of growth or the recovery of public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact the ECB has just granted the banks a loan of EUR 489 billion for three years at 1% interest, while Greece has a knife put to its throat, is proof that Europe has currently got things completely the wrong way round. Curiously, these banks are not suspected of ‘moral hazard’, in contrast to the Member States, which the ECB is not allowed to finance directly. They will therefore be able to buy back sovereign bonds at 6 or even 10% and continue their speculative activities with this free money.

A new tranche of financial assistance was postponed yesterday giving rise to fears of an upcoming Greek default. What is more worrisome, however, is the apparent willingness of some eurozone Member States to let this scenario unfold, despite real efforts from the Greek Government in complying with their demands and imposing new austerity measures. Solidarity with Greece must not falter. A Greek default could have immeasurable consequences on Greek society and on the economies of the eurozone countries, although it seems a more palatable scenario for some Member States than a few years ago. Nonetheless, it is a path that must be firmly rejected. Instead, the EU Member States should continue assuming responsibility and should aim for further promoting debt restructuring negotiations and federalising credit guarantees. Moreover, measures for bank recapitalisation, as well as measures intended to stimulate investment, employment and economic growth need to be soon and boldly implemented. For all this to be achieved, political will towards speeding up the common economic governance and fiscal solidarity is essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the beginning of the crisis, it has been clear that, in focusing on economic consolidation, the Commission and the Member States have forgotten that only balanced and socially just reforms will bring about sustainable growth. Unilateral austerity measures and cuts in social security funding will not result in a stable economy and good, secure jobs in the long term. Sensible tax policies must be introduced to increase revenue. The focus of our efforts this year must be on creating more jobs and combating youth unemployment and poverty. It is completely incomprehensible to me that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has prevented Member States with a current account surplus from being required to help put an end to the recession and create jobs. This would have been a step towards a single European economic policy. The conservatives should finally understand that national egoism will only intensify the crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In doing so, due attention should be given to the increasing differences between the economic situations of Member States and the social consequences of the crisis. The European Council meeting in March should propose measures to stimulate employment, especially among young people, to complete the single market, and to stimulate the financing of the economy, especially of SMEs, including through better targeting of EU funds available for growth and employment, within the agreed limits. We urge the Member States to invest with priority in the transport, energy and communications infrastructure, in research and innovation, education and health, agricultural development and, in particular, in the development of European industry.

A total of 23 million Europeans currently have to manage without a regular income from employment and 7 million of these are young people between the ages of 15 and 24. This has resulted not only in these people losing their trust in the EU, but also in a fall in purchasing power and, consequently, a recession. Therefore, alongside austerity policies, we also need to focus on measures to promote growth. Our goal must be to implement targeted structural reforms which will create jobs, improve competitiveness and encourage green growth. When they implement their austerity packages, the Member States must be required not to put at risk areas such as education, innovation and sustainable energy projects which are important for the future. The key to combating youth unemployment is to provide targeted support for small and medium-sized businesses and to establish dual vocational education systems based on the Austrian model. Therefore, I believe that sharing best practice in this area represents a sensible approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
