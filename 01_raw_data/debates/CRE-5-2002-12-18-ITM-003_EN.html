<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fogh Rasmussen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the</span> <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the last time I spoke in this House was in the course of the debate on enlargement on 19 November. That was a great and positive experience. I left it with a strong and clear mandate to conclude the enlargement negotiations. I am delighted to be here today with an equally clear result. Following a long and difficult process, the Presidency concluded the negotiations with ten new Member States at the Copenhagen Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our common dream that is coming true; it is our common aim that is being achieved. The European Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency have fought together for enlargement. I was especially pleased, therefore, that the President of the European Parliament took part in the final solemn occasion when, on Friday evening, we welcomed the new members into our Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement negotiations of the last sixth months have been like a long-distance race with a series of difficult hurdles that have had to be cleared along the way. Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency have stayed the course together, and in Copenhagen we passed the finishing line. Side by side, hand in hand. I should like to express my thanks for all the efforts made and for the unfailing support and the help along the way.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisions taken in Copenhagen closed one of the darkest and bloodiest chapters in the history of Europe. We put an end to a century characterised by wars and conflicts. We finally said goodbye to the Europe of the Yalta Conference and the Cold War. At the same time, we opened the door to a new era in the history of Europe: an era characterised by freedom, peace, growth and prosperity. The Copenhagen Summit marked a high point in the history of European cooperation: a triumph for freedom and democracy and a gateway to a better future for all our peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement of the EU was the Danish Presidency’s main priority - but we have a large number of other considerable achievements under our belt. We have been a presidency that has set priorities, but not at the expense of other issues. This can be seen from our achievements.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I move on to the Copenhagen Summit, I should like to outline a number of the other tasks that the EU has carried out in the last six months. We have successfully continued the fight against international terrorism and redoubled efforts against illegal immigration. In the field of asylum, we have reached agreement on what is known as the Dublin II regulation, which lays down common rules for which country should take responsibility for handling an asylum application.</p>
<p class="contents">We succeeded in reaching agreement on fully opening up the EU's electricity and gas markets. We achieved a breakthrough in EU transport policy. The rules on the Single European Sky have secured the basis for fewer cancellations and shorter flight times, benefiting passengers, the environment and airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">Together we have reacted swiftly and effectively to unexpected disasters. First there was the flooding in Central Europe. The EU showed solidarity by approving the establishment of a EUR 1 000 million Solidarity Fund for use in connection with natural disasters. Most recently, we reacted to the tragic loss of the oil tanker <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. At short notice, the EU showed its ability to act, adopting rules on matters such as the rapid phasing-out of single-hull oil tankers and stricter monitoring in the harbours used by the ships.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreement has been reached on the emissions trading scheme in CO2. Progress has been made with regard to food safety, including on common rules for the labelling of food containing GMOs. We succeeded in finding a solution to the question of transit to and from Kaliningrad that is acceptable to all parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to emphasise the positive and effective cooperation we have had with Parliament: the work on the codecision and budgetary procedures, amongst other things. For the first time in many years, we actually succeeded in reaching agreement on large parts of the budget as early as first reading. I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks for the good and positive spirit that has characterised the cooperation between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency. Together, we have shown in the last six months that the EU can deliver the goods; that – despite national, institutional and political variations – we can together produce results, create a better, safer daily life for our citizens, create better conditions of competition for our industries and increase Europe’s influence in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now return to the Copenhagen Summit. We concluded enlargement negotiations with ten new Member States: Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. These were intensive, difficult negotiations to the last. That is the nature of the beast: it ensured that we ended up achieving the right balance between the wishes of the candidate countries and the possibilities of the present Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The tough negotiations on very specific issues such as milk quotas and credit transfers are, of course, ultimately an indication that the EU is not just a talking shop, adopting meaningless declarations, but an effective forum for discussion, in which we do business and make policy to the benefit of all parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The ten new countries can become members from 1 May 2004. By then, both the new and the existing Member States will have completed their national ratification procedures. The first stage in this process – which in many of the countries will entail referendums – is the completion of the accession treaty. This will then be presented to the Commission first of all, then Parliament and finally the Council for approval, with a view to the treaty being signed in Athens on 16 April 2003. I shall call on all three institutions to do their utmost to keep to this timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions from the Copenhagen Summit also deal with the question of the participation of the new Member States in the institutions of the EU. We have laid down that the ten acceding states will be able to participate in the 2004 elections to the European Parliament as members. The accession treaty will lay down that the Commissioners from the new Member States will join the present Commission from the time of the countries’ accession on 1 May 2004. Once the European Council has appointed a new President of the Commission, the newly elected European Parliament can approve a new Commission, which will have to take office on 1 November 2004. This provides a sensible framework for this fundamental issue. Here, too, I shall call for cooperation between the institutions to find flexible solutions that ensure the best terms for our new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Bulgaria and Romania, the conclusions are clear: the enlargement process is continuing; and we can confirm that the aim is to be able to welcome the two countries as members in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of Turkey came to be one of the main topics in Copenhagen. We arrived at a balanced and realistic answer. We acknowledge the important steps that Turkey has taken towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria. We call upon Turkey to continue its reform process with vigour, and we pledge increased support from the EU to Turkey in these endeavours. If the European Council decides in December 2004, on the basis of a report and a recommendation by the Commission, that Turkey has met the Copenhagen political criteria, the European Union will open accession negotiations with Turkey as quickly as possible. This sent a strong and positive signal to Turkey, but I would emphasise that it is still an essential requirement that Turkey meet the political criteria before accession negotiations can be opened. This is the way it has to be. Turkey must be treated in the same way as all the other candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is Cyprus<span class="italic">.</span> Cyprus will join as a divided island; but, at the same time, there is a realistic possibility that the parties will be able to find a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue by 28 February 2003 on the basis of the UN Secretary-General’s proposal. I would urge the parties to the conflict in the strongest terms to seize this unique opportunity to resolve this unfortunate conflict. We all stand to gain by finding a solution now, and none so much as the population of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">In Copenhagen, we sent out a clear message to the new neighbours of the enlarged EU: to the countries of the western Balkans, to Russia, the Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus, and to the countries of the southern Mediterranean. Enlargement will not result in the EU shutting itself in; on the contrary, the EU will strengthen links to its new neighbours. This will take place both within the framework of, and by means of the development of, the existing cooperation instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, at the Copenhagen Summit, there was agreement on the frameworks for the future agreement between NATO and the EU on European Security and Defence Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention by way of conclusion that the European Council also met with the Chairman of the European Convention, Mr Giscard d’Estaing. He reported on the work in the Convention, and there was consensus in the European Council that the Convention should present the results of its work before the summit in June 2003. It was stated that the new Member States will participate fully in the Intergovernmental Conference. Bulgaria and Romania will take part as observers.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that enlargement is home and dry, the work in the Convention has become the crucial task in European politics. We have enlarged the EU; we now have to ensure that the EU of the future, with more than 25 Member States, can also function effectively. We must simplify the decision-making procedures and stress the EU’s values. We must describe the division of labour between the EU and the Member States more clearly, we must extend the use of qualified majority voting and the codecision procedure, and we must ensure that we have cooperation that is open and subject to democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">The Danish Presidency is now drawing to a close. We are passing the baton of the Presidency on to Greece, wishing them good luck and thanking them for the good troika cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to turn, once again, directly to the Members of this Parliament, and especially to the President, Mr Cox. The meeting of the President of Parliament with the European Council in Copenhagen was yet another constructive affirmation of the close relations between Parliament and the Council. The Danish Presidency has attached great importance to meeting the European Parliament with an outstretched hand and the will to enter into constructive cooperation. It is with satisfaction that I have been able to note that Parliament has met us in the same positive spirit. We have had our differences, but the cooperation between us has been characterised by progress, results and a willingness to compromise. I have experienced this in this House, at our interinstitutional summits and at my meetings with the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament. This picture is echoed by Danish government ministers. I should like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for this constructive cooperation. Above all, however, I wish to express my thanks for the unqualified support of Parliament for the implementation of the Danish Presidency’s greatest task: concluding the negotiations with ten new Member States. The decision, in Copenhagen, on the enlargement of the EU marked the reunification of the peoples and states of Europe, the end of the unfortunate division of our continent and the beginning of a new era in the history of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Copenhagen Summit also marked the beginning of a new era for the European Union. In Copenhagen, the EU carried out the greatest task in the history of the Community. Following the Copenhagen Summit, the European Union stands as the overall framework around the Europe of the future: cooperation based on the shared values of freedom and the market economy, community spirit and social responsibility, democracy and human rights; effective cooperation that respects the national characteristics of our peoples and states.</p>
<p class="contents">The seed sown by the founding fathers of the European Union in Europe’s war-torn ground nearly 50 years ago has taken root. The enlargement of the EU has made their dream and their vision a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">A new Europe is born.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Mr President.</p>

A year that started with the successful launch of the euro and concludes with another giant step forward. We have used a lot of superlatives – too many – in the last 12 months to describe the different stages of this year, which has been the year of Europe. I am not overstating the case, however, when I say that the Copenhagen European Summit is a landmark in European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">When I took office, I pledged that enlargement would be my Commission’s top priority. We have delivered. Some people might – and do – have the impression that the conclusion of the accession negotiations at Copenhagen was a formality. Nothing could be further from the truth. Courage and political will were required on all sides to achieve this result. I should like to single out the tremendous work done by the Danish Presidency. As the multiple negotiations went down to the wire, the Presidency maintained a steady hand at the helm and a cool head in a difficult situation. Prime Minister, this was a great personal achievement on your part.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, this result is the fruit of our hard work too. Over the past three years, the Commission has put together 12 remarkable teams of negotiators who have achieved a deal on 31 chapters with each candidate country using a completely new methodology. Indeed, for over three years, 350 Commission officials and over 700 people in the Commission delegations have been patiently weaving the fabric of this silent tapestry. I want to voice here my gratitude to Günter Verheugen, who has proved to be an astute, passionate negotiator. I would also like to thank Mr Eneko Landaburu and all of the Directorate-General for Enlargement for their dedication and first-rate work. It is a unique privilege to be President of the Commission on such occasions, and today I am particularly proud to be the head of an institution that has contributed so much to the accomplishment of our dream of ‘One Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">Although ten countries have completed the last lap, others still have some way to go. Romania and Bulgaria have been given detailed road maps to reach their target accession date of 2007. In December 2004 we have a date with Turkey to see if it meets the conditions for opening negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I was heartened by the fact that the first joint act of the 25 current and acceding Member States was to issue a statement in support of the ‘continuous, inclusive and irreversible enlargement process’. These words echo the vision and generosity that marked the founding of our Union. The statement endorsed the Commission’s proposal to give Romania and Bulgaria more help in preparing for membership by raising their pre-accession aid by 20%. I urge these countries to seize this chance to further speed up their preparations.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey will also be receiving an enhanced package to help it prepare its candidacy, a candidacy which, I stress, will be judged on its own merits and according to the same criteria as all the other candidate countries. This date will give Turkey time to push ahead with the reforms it needs to make to satisfy the Copenhagen criteria and implement them both in law and in practice. The Commission’s reports and recommendations will continue to be completely objective and impartial.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week’s European Council achieved practically all its objectives. I say ‘almost all’ because we came very close to achieving agreement on the Cyprus question. Despite the fervent efforts of the negotiators and the United Nations Secretary-General, we did not achieve a solution which we can consider to be definitive at Copenhagen. Nevertheless, both sides expressed willingness to continue with the negotiations and set themselves the goal of achieving an agreement by 28 February.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Europe grows its responsibilities grow. We are inviting the new Members to join our area of peace, prosperity and stability, but our work in promoting these values does not stop at the borders of the European Union. We must not use the aim of ‘One Europe’ as an excuse to erect fresh barriers but to embrace the entire continent in our work to establish lasting peace. Each enlargement brings us new neighbours which are drawn to the European Union as to a magnet and some hope to become candidates themselves too. In my opinion, the countries of the western Balkans belong by definition in the European Union and this view was confirmed by the Copenhagen Council. The Stabilisation and Association Process is a powerful instrument and we must use it vigorously. The Commission is therefore looking forward to working closely with the Greek Presidency in the run-up to the Thessaloniki Summit, at which, I am convinced, we can offer a detailed, practical response to the letter that the five Presidents of the Western Balkans sent us on the eve of the Copenhagen Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall now have to think long and hard about where the borders of the EU are and will ultimately lie – this is the major task before us and I shall say so <span class="italic">ad nauseam</span> – but this is something we as Europeans shall decide ourselves, after listening to everyone but without any outside interference.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The debate on where Europe's borders lie is a debate about our identity. It must be conducted in this House and in the national parliaments and must involve all the European citizens closely. This search for the roots of our identity does not mean creating divisions. Indeed, European integration must provide benefits and new prospects for our neighbours as well, even if they are to remain just neighbours. We need to build a strong network of relations based on shared political and economic values with neighbouring countries, from Russia to the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the new strategic objective of my Commission. This proximity policy must bring our neighbours many of the benefits of membership without them having to join the Union formally in the foreseeable future. The European Economic Area is a useful model for such relations, but it needs to be enhanced by a series of measures to develop political cooperation. Our relations must be based on ‘sharing everything but institutions’. Our proximity policy must be attractive, unlocking new prospects and bringing mutual benefits. It must motivate our partners to cooperate more closely with the Union and it must be dynamic and based on a structured, step-by-step approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have successfully concluded the accession negotiations and we now have to make European unification a tangible, everyday reality. At last, final drafting of the Accession Treaty, which – as Prime Minister Rasmussen said – must be ratified and signed in Athens next April, can now proceed. However, our biggest job in the coming months will be to inform and reassure our citizens in both the present Member States and the accession countries. The Commission will be mounting an extensive information campaign in which the Members of this House will play a crucial role. Indeed, just a few years ago, many of the candidate countries were governed by dictatorships. Many of their citizens fear they might be giving up their new-found freedom and independence by joining another large bloc. There is concern in the current Member States, on the other hand, about the costs and implications of the entry of countries much poorer than themselves. Most of these fears are groundless. As Günter Verheugen has said, this is the best prepared enlargement in the history of the Union. We are all quite aware that the cost of enlargement is nothing compared with the cost of non-enlargement. We must therefore disseminate these simple truths throughout Europe and we must work together to make the citizens aware of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement process has progressed thanks to tremendous determination, political courage and vision. We have to convince the Europeans that by coming together we will all gain, and not just materially, through shared prosperity and sustainable development in the largest market in the world, but politically too, as citizens of a democratic, accountable Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The credibility of the new, enlarged Europe will, as I have said before, hang, above all, on the credibility of its institutions and its credibility as an active leader on the world stage. I therefore warmly welcome the EU-NATO agreement concluded at the Summit, which will enable us to conduct military peace-keeping operations in the Balkans from as early as next year. This is a further responsibility which we will have to, which we will be able to shoulder.</p>
<p class="contents">The moment of truth, however, in the coming year will be institutional reform. We will not be able to make good our promises to our citizens unless we completely overhaul the Union’s structure. Only by strengthening the Union’s decision-making process can we build the more cohesive, united Union that will earn their respect and admiration. We must therefore all work together with Mr Giscard d’Estaing to make the Convention a success.</p>
<p class="contents">This greater unity and determination must be reflected in our action on the world stage. Our growing responsibilities will leave no room for the vacillation and inaction we have displayed in the past. The task of the Convention and of all those contributing to its work is therefore just as important as the accession negotiations, for if the Convention does not succeed we will have created a Europe which is large but unable to act.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, there are therefore grounds for optimism. The success of Copenhagen and the generosity displayed there – we had expected egoism and breaking away but what we found there was a sense of unity in countries for which enlargement has a different meaning, is something different, is being experienced in a different way, but which have all understood the magnitude of what has happened – have shown that, if we can overcome the obstacles still facing us, we will genuinely be able to put to good use the blend of vision and pragmatism that have made the European Union a unique model of political integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, President Cox, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you and extend to you my very best wishes for the forthcoming festivities. I hope that you all enjoy a very well-deserved, happy, peaceful break with your loved ones.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that you will understand me when I say that it is with a great deal of relief that I stand before you today. This is not only because a period of time lies ahead of me in which I will have rather less work to do, but, above all, because I am happy to be able to say that the joint efforts of the European institutions and 25 states in Europe have brought about the success we had hoped for. Such success was not self-evident. Even though I remember that it was as long ago as 1999 that we first indicated that it might be possible to conclude negotiations by the end of 2002, I still have to say that it is a minor miracle that we have managed to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are all aware, though, miracles do not happen by themselves. They require strong political will, great determination and also great skill. So let me now reiterate very clearly that I have felt myself fortunate and privileged to have been able, during this concluding stage, to work together with the Danish Presidency, and with a head of government like Mr Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who set about his task with truly admirable determination and singleness of purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, also like to say that enlargement has not been the work of just a handful of people. On the contrary, what is most important to me is the way that it shows that the Community method is able to conclude, exactly, precisely, and within a timetable, even as complex and difficult a project as negotiations on the accession of ten countries to the European Union. It is simply not the case that the Community method does not work when great and weighty international issues are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I believe that everyone here in this House is aware of the important part played by the European Parliament in driving this process forward, for which I am profoundly grateful. I would also like to say that the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, placed himself at the head of a movement that made a deep impression on the candidate countries. I believe that the way in which Mr Cox represented the European Parliament in Central and Eastern Europe made a major contribution towards creating and building up trust in the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have now reached a point that I would like to describe with the words of one of the greatest Europeans of our time, one who is, by the way, also important for the success of this enlargement process. It was Pope John Paul II who once said: ‘What matters is that Europe should at last be able to breathe with both lungs’. That is the very point at which we have arrived.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It was in Copenhagen that we were able to reap what millions of people in Central and Eastern Europe had sown when they struggled to gain democracy and freedom for themselves. We never want to forget that the peoples of the Baltic countries never, ever, chose to join the Soviet Union. Neither did the peoples of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia ever choose communist regimes for themselves. On the contrary, they established a democracy and a human rights movement under the most adverse of circumstances. We must not fear that we are being joined by Europeans with no understanding of democracy or of human rights. On the contrary, we will see that the European spirit, founded as it is on democracy, justice and human rights, will gain strength from those who have fought for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The many changes this enlargement will bring will not be merely internal. There will also be many outward changes, and we will gain additional responsibilities in our international role. I share the concern of those who say that we may not yet be adequately prepared to take on this important and great international role. Russia, the Ukraine, the states in the Caucasus, the Middle East – all of these are closing in on us. Our neighbourhood is becoming even more densely populated and is closer to our doorstep. President Prodi has talked about how we must shape policy in relation to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, our work is not yet complete, neither at home nor in the candidate countries. The coming year will see the preparations for their accessions continued with energy and vigour. The Commission will look very carefully to see that all obligations are discharged, and, as promised, will draw up a final balance sheet on the state of preparations six months before the planned date of accession.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have succeeded in coming to reliable arrangements, alleviating hardship and limiting risks. Over the coming year, the Commission, together with the presidency, will present the draft accession treaty to Parliament. We will then need Parliament to vote in favour of each individual state and of the treaty as a whole. It is Parliament that will be the first to decide whether we can travel to the very end of the road that was taken in Copenhagen. Parliament alone has the privilege of coming to a decision on every single accession treaty. No national parliament can do that. One might say that it is you who will be setting the benchmark for what twenty-five national parliaments will have to do in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004, the EU will have 25 countries as members. Two countries, that is to say Bulgaria and Romania, can be confident that they will receive even more intensive support in their endeavours to attain membership of the EU in 2007, that now being our common objective. Turkey has a definite chance of starting negotiations, the same chance that all the other candidate countries had, and of which they made determined use. I would like to emphatically underline Mr Fogh Rasmussen's words to the effect that there is a definite sequence, which cannot be changed under any circumstances. The political conditions must first be complied with fully and unequivocally, and only then can a decision be made about whether to begin negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will not shirk its responsibilities as regards the report and the recommendation. Let me make it abundantly clear that, as far as these reports are concerned, we have developed standards, procedures, and methods in the course of recent years, and it is with those same standards, procedures, and methods that we will work. What is most important is that the recommendation that then has to be given should be based on the report's conclusions. It will not happen the other way around. We will not have a political objective and already know what recommendation we will make, with the report then having to be framed accordingly. Instead, the report will be fair, objective and neutral. That is an opportunity for Turkey, and I also believe that Turkey is capable of meeting these requirements. It must now put all its energy into the work of completing reforms and putting them into actual practice. It is not enough for us to see a ban on torture on paper in the form of a law; what we want is the certainty that nobody will be tortured to death in any Turkish jail or in any Turkish police station.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the need for broad public debate has often been a topic of discussion in this House. It is now all the more necessary if the success of the ratification process is to be assured. Let us go into this debate with a cool head and objective arguments, but also with an enthusiasm for the Europe that is now coming into being.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my unreserved approval, appreciation and profound gratitude to the Danes for their presidency, which has been a truly excellent one. I would also like to name some names and thank first the President of the European Council, Mr Fogh Rasmussen, and also his Minister for Europe, Bertel Haarder, who was formerly a Member of this House, the deputy prime minister, Ben Bendtsen, who has achieved much for the energy market, and, of course, also the Foreign Minister, Per Stig Møller.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention something that is not immediately apparent, namely that my counterpart in the <span class="italic">Folketing, </span>Mr Knud<span class="italic"> </span>Kirkegaard, working in close consultation with Mr Christian Rovsing and myself, masterminded a conference in Brussels of the group presidents and the national party leaders, at which we too did preparatory work on these Copenhagen issues. It is important that we should build up a network of contacts in the national parliaments, and for this I would particularly like to extend warm thanks to our counterparts in the Danish parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Danish people, as represented by their government, can take pride in what they have done for Europe over the past six months. I hope that the Danish people will demonstrate the same determination when it comes to joining the common European currency, in which respect I wish you, Mr Fogh Rasmussen, much success.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am no longer speaking for myself alone when I say that your presidency also demonstrates that countries that are not that large – this presidency's great achievements make me disinclined to describe Denmark as a small country – can also do great things. In the current discussions in the Convention, however, where the issue is what we might replace the six-month presidency with, we must be very careful in bearing in mind that the arguments in favour of any change would have to be very good ones, as your presidency is proof – as others have been – that, when a country has the presidency, what it has to contribute is not only ambition, but also commitment to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Again, if we want any future Secretary-General of the Council to no longer be, at the same time, High Representative – and this is no criticism of Mr Solana, my appreciation for whom I would like to put on the record – but a visible Secretary-General, then I recommend to our colleagues in the Convention that they should give very earnest consideration to these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the European Council, you spoke about a dream coming true, and we cannot but agree with you entirely. A dream has come true, but this great and historic decision in Copenhagen has also made it clear that the countries that are to join the European Union have already almost achieved normal EU standards. Taking that into consideration – and when it was financial issues that were at stake, we urged you to be flexible – the Poles and the others have almost reached the state of debate with which we are familiar in the European Union of today. One major European newspaper has talked in terms of a terribly nice European family, and that is what Europe is like. We look forward to the day when the treaties are signed, when we will have observers here in Parliament, and when, above all else – in accordance with our group's proposal, which has thankfully been accepted – the 2004 European elections will be the guidance framework for the enlargement process as a whole, and that is how things will now work out.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi and Mr Verheugen, I would also, however, like to say a word of heartfelt thanks to the Commission. Rather than everything the Commission does being spectacular, every day is an effort. Copenhagen's success, and its great commitment, was possible only because the Commission, and we in this House, had been supporting the process for many years, and hence we are passionate advocates of the necessity of the Community method being at the heart of the Convention's work, so that the new Europe follows the right method, not only as regards its geographical expansion, but also in core areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a comment on Turkey. We would greatly welcome it if Turkey were enabled to meet the political criteria by the autumn of 2004. That would be a gigantic success for both Turkey and Europe, but we are both unequivocal and determined in saying that there must be no political opportunism when deciding whether Turkey fulfils the political criteria, but that decision must be guided by the law. If, following the European elections, we have that responsibility, we will insist that the Commission, represented by its President and by Commissioner Verheugen, shall be strict in ensuring that evaluation is not founded on what is politically desirable, but in fact on the law and the criteria – and I have no doubt that they will do so, this being indeed the greatest challenge to face the present Commission. We will be with them as they go down this road.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are not lacking in solidarity, and I will be quite frank in saying to our American friends that we will always stand alongside the United States of America, but will of course not do it unthinkingly or in ways that are not justifiable. For that reason, though, we will also declare our refusal to be amenable to any pressure from the United States or anywhere else as far as the law is concerned, since the law is the foundation of our European community of values.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the European Council, let me make a final comment. Whilst this is not to diminish your work, we would have liked there also to have been a comment on Chechnya in the Copenhagen conclusions. You referred to human rights, and I think it a real duty and obligation upon us not merely to concern ourselves with our own affairs but also to defend human rights in the European Union's geographical environment and around the world. With this in mind, it is my plea that we should respect human rights rather than grovel to anybody. This is a task for us all in the future. Congratulations on what you have done at Copenhagen! You can be proud of what you have achieved, and we have been happy to be your companions on the road.</p>

<p class="contents">You made a comparison, saying that the race you have run is a long-distance race. I believe that under the Danish Presidency this has been more like a race against time, or even a one-legged race, and you have won it. I believe you deserve special congratulations for that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now up to us, as Members of the European Parliament, and all the members of Member State Parliaments and those in countries that are already part of an enlarged Europe, to take the next steps, and we must not underestimate the importance of dialogue with public opinion, as well as fulfilling our duties. I would reiterate President Prodi’s words, when he said that there is going to be an information campaign in which we must all participate. We are prepared to discuss the budget for this campaign immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate the Commission – as the negotiating body – its President, Commissioner Verheugen, and please allow me to mention also the Director-General for Enlargement, Mr Landáburu, with whom I have had the opportunity to fight against Franco’s dictatorship and for European integration. I believe he has acted seriously, using his experience, in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one question, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in relation to the democratic process of integrating these countries – and I see you have incorporated the proposal made by Mr Hänsch, which was adopted by the European Parliament, that these countries might be able to take part in the 2004 elections. The question is transition. You said, having taken decisions, that you are going to consult Parliament before the end of January. Are these consultations on consumer issues or is it an interinstitutional agreement? Many issues are currently under discussion. For example, I do not know if you have decided whether, in accordance with the Treaty of Nice, there will be one or two commissioners, depending on the country, until 2005. Will this change or not? That is a question that I believe must be discussed, as well as the changes in the Commission: will there be a second Polish Commissioner for three months or not? What will happen about Members of Parliament? We will need to discuss this, but the issue is whether there will be an agreement on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just one comment to make with regard to Turkey: I believe our Turkish friends should be told that they missed a great opportunity, during the week of the Sakharov Prize, to let Mrs Leila Zana come here.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us who are in favour of Turkey entering the European Union continue to maintain that what is needed in Turkey is a democracy in which civil power takes precedence over military power. That is the key issue and that is the question that must be put clearly to our Turkish friends.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Cyprus, perhaps Turkey will now have an objective interest in the ever present Mr Denktash changing his mind and finding a solution for February in order to achieve full integration of the whole island.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, with regard to the Middle East you made a bold statement and I believe we must support it as we cannot agree to put the Quartet’s proposals on hold, as the United States would like, and we should also welcome the fact that the Commission has freed up funding for the Palestinian elections. I believe Europe has serious responsibilities at the present time with regard to the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I would also like to express my group’s deep dissatisfaction with the way in which the Council and the Commission are approaching the problem of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster. There has not been equal treatment in terms of what the President mentioned concerning the German and Austrian situation and that of Central Europe, because no fund has been created; existing funds have simply been re-allocated. I can tell you that there is disappointment and resentment in my country and a problem that extends to other parts of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Mr President, by saying that now that Denmark has taken this historic step, please, move closer to us, and remove the barriers that still exist in terms of citizenship and the common currency on Denmark’s part. I am sure you will do this.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office on the successful conclusion in Copenhagen of an outstanding Danish presidency. It is rare in my experience for a presidency to receive such wide praise from all sides of this House. The improvement in relations between the Council and Parliament has been notable, and we owe much in this regard to the role of our former, much-esteemed colleague, Mr Haarder. The outcome of the summit is a tribute to the negotiating skills of Mr Fogh Rasmussen and the persistence both he and his team displayed. Their decision to focus single-mindedly on enlargement paid off handsomely: Europe can now reunite.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not be complacent. The full application of the Copenhagen criteria, both in the new countries and in the existing Member States, must remain a matter of concern. Moreover, there are referenda to be won in all the new countries – referenda in which each and every one of us can play an important part, if we so choose.</p>
<p class="contents">Copenhagen offers Bulgaria and Romania the prospect of greater pre-accession aid and the objective of membership in 2007. While these two countries will clearly be in the next wave of enlargement, we should continue to be guided by the principle that each candidate will be judged on its own merits.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberal Democrats would have preferred an earlier review of Turkey's readiness for accession. However, Turkey is clearly now on the path to membership and, if the Copenhagen criteria are met by the end of 2004, my group will hold the governments to their commitment to open membership negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">An agreement on the United Nations plan to reunite Cyprus would have been the icing on the cake of the Copenhagen Council. Nonetheless, we remain optimistic that agreement can be reached so that a united Cyprus can sign the Accession Treaty in April 2004. We hope that Turkey will seize the opportunity to confirm its European vocation by putting pressure on Mr Denktash to reach a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">However, celebrations over the historic decision to reunite Europe – and I welcome the very prominent role played by Liberals in the Council, Commission and Parliament, whether those on the benches in front of us apply that label to themselves or not – should not be allowed to overshadow another significant breakthrough at Copenhagen. That was the agreement with Turkey to allow the EU's Rapid Reaction Force to go ahead and have access to Nato's resources. Europe's security and defence ambitions can now be put to the test as the EU takes over Operation Amber Fox in Macedonia. This may pave the way for more ambitious missions in the future, including peace-enforcement operations in accordance with the UN Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">A wider Europe must be prepared to shoulder its responsibilities in the world, whether in the Middle East – I congratulate the Council on its firm declaration on that conflict – or elsewhere. We must be a bulwark for freedom and democracy and a force for justice. In building that strength, we owe much to Denmark.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wurtz (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, there is no doubt whatsoever that the Copenhagen Summit marks an historic stage in European integration. I would like to thank the Danish Presidency for its active contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">We must welcome the fact that, ultimately, nothing has compromised the conclusion of your work at this late stage. Enlargement can and must represent an opportunity for Europe in terms of stability, peace, unification of the continent, bringing nations closer together, interaction and co-development opportunities, as well as in terms of increasing Europe’s influence on the world stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Can we now say, therefore, as you said last Saturday, President-in-Office of the Council, that – and I quote – ‘we now have a common vision of an integrated Europe’? I, for my part, would be slightly more cautious. With regard to the peoples of the candidate countries, I do not think that we are all square. At the end of the long and tortuous negotiation process, some wounds still have not been healed. My belief is that we may sooner or later have to pay the price for launching negotiations with these countries, negotiations whose content I believe is much too liberal in substance and whose form is sometimes perceived to be arrogant.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, has anyone assessed the shocking effect on all the people of the countries concerned of the discriminatory measure taken in the area of direct agricultural subsidies for between now and 2013? This choice has, in my view, considerably strengthened the underlying feeling that the Fifteen view the countries of Central Europe as second-class members. Furthermore, the drastic safeguard clauses imposed on our partners have also added to the impression of unequal relations between a David and a Goliath. Let us also point out how strictly the Community acquis has been applied to them, in spite of their fragile economy and the exorbitant social cost of an abrupt transition to a market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, by limiting themselves to a minimum financing level, which is still below 0.1% of their annual GDP, the Fifteen have given the impression of opting, if you look beyond the words, for a cut-price enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout this process, the Union has been caught out, on more than one occasion, posing arrogantly as the rich and powerful benefactor of the poor relation, who has no other choice than to bow down or withdraw. It is no coincidence that the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister spoke, just prior to Copenhagen, of a diktat, or that his colleague responsible for agriculture spoke of capitulation. Beware of the boomerang effects of internalised humiliation! Let us not forget that the ratification referendums are due to take place early in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we should make a gesture towards our partners: send a sign of respect and openness, demonstrate, in particular, that we do not view the acquis as set in stone, when reality reveals its limitations or contradictions in one area or another. The Fifteen did indeed view the Stability and Growth Pact to be part of the acquis until Mr Prodi to some extent played down its relevance. The citizens of the candidate countries are not the only ones to be struck by doubt or uncertainty either. The citizens of the current Member States are too. As soon as citizens start to feel that they are not genuinely involved in a project, as soon as they feel their lives are dependent on inaccessible decision-making bodies, which rapidly churn out standards, laws and various injunctions that often have serious consequences, they immediately perceive, rightly or wrongly, the risks rather than the opportunities of any new undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, the enlargement process has been conducted without the citizens thus far. Surveys tell us that four out of ten EU citizens can only give the name of one candidate country, and, out of those who can name one, almost a third say Turkey. In this respect, too, we need initiatives. We must encourage every possible meeting between people of Eastern and Western Europe to discuss the challenges that they face and which stir them into action. Today’s news is dominated by the challenges facing society which, from safety at sea to migration, jeopardise the enlarged Europe. The same applies to the need to provide secure employment and training and to safeguard services of general interest, to the necessary pre-eminence of political choices over market requirements, to the role of the Union on the world stage and to the part played by social players in the decision-making process. As we move towards the adoption of a new Treaty, which, in addition, is constitutional, the project of an enlarged Europe and its purpose must be debated in our societies. Otherwise, we will have no defence against a major incident which could undermine the civilising project that we all wish to succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, this major enlargement has been described – outside this Chamber – as a revenge for Yalta. I think it is wrong to embark upon this line of thinking. We cannot build anything sound or sustainable on revenge. This Cold-War approach is, I believe, completely outmoded. The unification of Europe must enable us to overcome all the tragedies of the twentieth century. This is possible, as long as we do not look back nostalgically at the past, to a blessed era of ‘Middle Europe’, the heritage of the Hapsburgs. We must now look confidently towards the future so that we can work together to enable a united Europe to enter the twenty-first century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You did fantastically well!’</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is upon us – doubtless a great achievement on the part of the Commission, the Council, the Danish Presidency and the presidencies that have gone before it. It is a certainty that the coming presidency will have to shoulder the additional burden of making enlargement a reality, and that will be difficult. Not only because of all the votes that Mr Wurtz mentioned, that will then have to be held in the various countries, but because we will meet again and can only hope that enlargement does not give us the same hangover<span class="italic"> </span>that the reunification of the Federal Republic of Germany did, because the finances do not work out quite right, and because people suddenly realise that what they had dreamt of has not become reality overnight. We will then get back to talking about the financial framework. Let me tell you, Mr Wurtz, that the problem is not our promise that there will be no direct payments before 2013, but our own inability to question why we have direct payments, our failure to make the necessary reform to our agriculture here and now in order to establish justice and take enlargement as the means of developing a new policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no point in enlarging something that is wrong. The only thing that makes sense is using enlargement to change what is wrong and, together, doing the right thing. Very often, we have not managed to do that. That is why what I have to say to Turkey is very simple: ‘of course we will pay attention to the criteria’. But we have to say what they are. What we demand of the Commission is that, within the next few months, they tell us what the criteria are to be. What, in fact, will we have to discuss with Turkey over the next two years? Will we be discussing the issue of women wearing the headscarf? Is that one of the Copenhagen criteria? Of course it is not; instead, we will be discussing fundamental issues of democracy and of how to make it a reality again. This is where we need a road map.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say something about Iraq. I approve of what the Council has said. The UN Resolution can be interpreted in this way and that. Unfortunately, the German Federal Government, for example, with which I have a great deal of sympathy, interprets it in such a way that it can also be read in the way the Americans do, to mean that there do not have to be further debates in the Security Council. I see this as the wrong approach, and hope that Europeans, as Europeans, will insist on further discussion and a vote in the Council if the resolution is considered as not having been complied with. It is not acceptable that compliance or non-compliance with the Resolution should be a matter for the Americans to decide on their own!</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day – as Mr Poettering rightly said – yes, if we have to stand up to the Americans, then we have to try it out on the Russians. We have to tell the Russians that, however friendly we are – and we are very close – certain things will not do! I am grateful to the Danes for not deporting Mr Zakayev – that was the right thing to do, and I hope that the English will not be able to deport him either. If, though, Mr Zakayev can be granted political asylum in Europe, there must be something wrong in Chechnya. I do not think there should be any meeting with Russia without us telling them that what is going on in Chechnya is not only bad, it amounts to a colonial war. That is something that we in Europe never want to see again!</p>

There is no need for me to do so, however, since they have congratulated themselves enough, given themselves a celebratory pat on the back, which, in my view, did seem a little excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">So, this morning, then, I find myself partly agreeing with Mr Barón Crespo – which is also astonishing – who essentially said that you have done your work. If I am completely honest, I must also say that this was a job well done.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to the President-in-Office of the Council that he has certainly succeeded and that he has avoided the worst possible situation, particularly in the latest exchanges, in other words endless haggling, when we are in fact facing an historic occasion. For this, you must be complimented.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an historic moment, and this point has been clearly made by previous speakers. I fully understand that Mr Wurtz does not wish us to make reference to a certain period of our recent history. The fact remains, however, that this scar, this wound, on Europe’s body has now healed. This is not an ‘enlargement’ process – I think this word is inappropriate and unsuitable – this is a return, a reunion of a continent which should never have been divided.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the message that we must send to the peoples who are joining us is a message of solidarity, a message of understanding of everything that they experienced during these periods of oppression.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that the shift of emphasis towards the East must not make us forget the South – I know that this point was made in the Copenhagen declaration – and must not make us forget our responsibilities either – I am taking advantage of the fact that the three Presidents are here to remind them of this – towards the outermost regions, because the borders of the European Union are, at present, the borders of these regions, of Spain, France and Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would like to express my concern regarding the comments made by some of the members of the Commission or the Convention, who stated that, when clarifying the texts, we could certainly delete Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which provides the legal basis for the measures taken to assist the outermost regions. I would also draw Parliament’s attention to the risks that this would pose in the long run.</p>

Mr Fogh Rasmussen has managed much better than the euro. The Danish Prime Minister and the Danish ambassador to the EU deserve praise for concluding the negotiations on time, but the result forebodes disaster. Never before have so many rich countries been so miserly towards so few. Most Polish farmers will be net contributors to the EU. They will pay more in contributions to the EU than they receive. On the other hand, the better-off farmers will see a considerable increase in their capital, which future farmers will have to pay interest on. One hectare of agricultural land costs 30 times as much in the Netherlands as in Poland. If Polish and Dutch farmers are given the same right to buy land from each other, one can hardly call this equality. There should now be a radical revision of agricultural systems so that we avoid a situation arising in which financial gain is made from rising agricultural prices, leading to a new need for subsidies and a million Polish farmers being condemned to a life of unemployment in the city.</p>
<p class="contents">The budgetary funds and the Structural Funds are also in need of revision. Subsidies to the rich countries must be eliminated. Give the new countries free membership instead of theoretical Structural Fund subsidies, which they cannot receive on account of our bureaucratic procedures and the co-financing requirement. Let us cut EU law down drastically from its 85 000 pages. Let us only require compliance with our standards in the applicant countries when they are exporting to us. Let us give them longer transitional periods, more leeway, greater freedom. Let us allow far greater flexibility than the negotiations have settled on.</p>
<p class="contents">I am <span class="italic">not</span> criticising Mr Fogh Rasmussen for the result. He could not have done very much better with the mandate he was given, but he should now say, in his capacity as Danish Prime Minister, that enlargement will not end well unless there are radical reforms. In an EU that has 25 countries and more on the way, it is not possible to legislate as if it were a state. The EU should now focus on the cross-border aspects and let the parliaments of the Member States adopt the bulk of the legislation. An enlarged EU can only function as a Europe of democracies and diversities. We had this in mind when we named our group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That said, I hope that the Danish Presidency, that Mr Rasmussen and Mr Haarder will forgive me for pointing out two grey areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is, as Mr Pasqua said, the ‘reunion’. Unfortunately, the reunion is not complete and I thank Mr Prodi for having announced, for the Thessaloniki Summit, an initiative targeting the five Balkan countries. There are also the three countries of the Caucasus: Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. There is Moldavia too and Israel. I hope that the European Union will take particular initiatives in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The second grey area was touched upon by Mr Poettering and Mr Cohn-Bendit, namely Chechnya. I would like to thank the Danish Presidency and, through it, the competent Danish authorities for the position which was adopted during the Zakayev affair. The Zakayev affair has not been resolved, however. There is, for the Chechen representatives and for the representatives of other oppressed people in the world, a problem regarding residence, a problem regarding freedom of movement in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to urge the Danish Presidency to take an initiative in this area. Commissioner Vitorino pointed out that Article 14(3), which enabled the European Union to draw up black lists with regard to Yugoslavia in 1999, regarding Kosovo, and which has recently made it possible to draw up a black list regarding the Belorussian authorities, also provides the possibility of creating white lists, namely lists of individuals who can be offered freedom of movement and residence on European Union territory. This would make it possible to prevent unjustified and unjustifiable pressure, such as that exerted on Denmark in the last few months by the Russian Federation. I therefore urge you, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder, to investigate along with Mr Vitorino, ways, in the context of the Chechen issue, of implementing what is provided under Article 14(3) of the Treaty on European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are well deserved. I myself hardly believed that it would be possible to accomplish enlargement in the unbelievably short time available, in the face of all the colossal problems associated with it. It is an impressive administrative and technical piece of work, which deserves the greatest credit. I know that the Commission staff, under the leadership of Mr Verheugen; the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Danish Prime Minister’s Office; the European Parliament: everyone has pulled together, and it was thanks to the Danish Presidency’s aim that the project must succeed now, that it did succeed. It was an impressive achievement, which was also due to the fact that the aims and priorities were clearly explained. We were told, ‘Help us now, we are listening, we are working together’, and the cooperation succeeded. It was an outstanding achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the great experiences for me was the meeting, here in Parliament, with the representatives of all the new countries. It was moving to listen to them setting out their priorities: freedom, justice, the rule of law, parliamentary democracy. Of course, we all wish for these, and this is why we are carrying out enlargement. We desire peace, freedom, stability and respect for human rights, among other things. That is what they said, loud and clear. It was our friends that were meeting with us, perhaps with a higher level of ambition in those areas than we normally voice, but then they have a background that justifies this.</p>
<p class="contents">There was one thing which the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention, but which in any case I shall take the liberty of mentioning: for the first time, there were TV broadcasts from the beginning and end of the Council meetings in Copenhagen. This is a giant step forward as regards openness, and indeed it should be pointed out, because if there is one thing we in the European Parliament have wished for, it is just this increase in openness.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that it was impressive that the Kaliningrad problem was solved in the difficult circumstances that prevailed at the very time this took place. This, however, was another demonstration of our will, unity and cooperation playing the role that was needed to put this, too, in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Congratulations. We shall be delighted to welcome the new Members to the European Parliament. Thank you to the Presidency of the Council and to the Commission for making this possible.</p>

Today we can safely say that the iron curtain has not only been lifted but has been dismantled, packed up in its box and consigned to the attic of history where it will serve to remind us of the horrors of the past. We have a lot to celebrate today. Copenhagen reunited Europe 13 years after the Berlin Wall came down and 21 years to the day after martial law was imposed in Poland and already these things feel as if they belong to a different age.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the Danish presidency and the Commission on bringing to a successful conclusion ten sets of parallel and very diverse negotiations, bearing in mind that only a couple of weeks ago, it seemed as if we would not do it. I think it is impossible to under-estimate the importance of what has been achieved in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">However, at the risk of being accused of putting a dampener on our celebrations, I must point out that we are not there yet. There is still a lot to be done. The candidate countries still have to meet our standards and they must not be allowed to slacken their efforts. The Commission still has to draw up its final report on the candidate countries, and we must ensure that the process does not degenerate into a messy argument about the imposition of safeguards. We still have to get the process ratified by parliaments, including, in particular, by the European Parliament. We will scrutinise the treaties with care and attention to detail and no one should take Parliament's vote for granted.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have to sell enlargement to the people, both in the EU and in the candidate countries. We cannot take the people's assent for granted. Notwithstanding Mr Rovsing's remarks just now, we must still make the Kaliningrad solution work, and work in a way which does not undermine the sovereignty of Lithuania. We must still ensure that the financial arrangements actually work and we must also ensure that Parliament's role in those financial arrangements is fully respected.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have to reform our common agricultural policy before it bankrupts us financially and politically. We still have to decide how an EU of 25 or more can work, because failure to reform our decision-making process will guarantee that this enlargement is the breaking and not the making of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot has been done, but there is still a lot to do. We must not lessen our efforts towards Bulgaria and Romania, nor must they assume that 2007 is a guaranteed date of accession. I welcome the decision taken concerning Turkey – although I would have preferred the date of 1 May 2004 – but this must become a defining moment in our relations with Turkey. We guarantee that negotiations will begin if they meet the Copenhagen criteria by December 2004, but equally, we must be clear that, if the criteria are not met, then Turkey's accession will be off the agenda for the foreseeable future.

<p class="contents">I welcome the determination to resolve the Cyprus issue and would point out that, because we have always said that we would not allow third parties to veto our future, this is forcing us finally to reach a settlement in this long-running debate. Prime Minister, I am told by my government that in Copenhagen, you were always well briefed, determined, clever and gave real leadership. If we are to overcome the obstacles ahead – institutional change and the need for political and economic reform – we need such leadership more often and then we can really celebrate.</p>

It is beginning to feel rather trite, but there is no better word, for the fact that ten countries that are former Communist dictatorships are now being welcomed in from the cold and into the Community is certainly an historic decision. At last, the continent and its citizens are being united.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the door was so clearly opened to Bulgaria and Romania was also historic, as was the signal given to Turkey. The EU is no Christian club. It is a union of values that defends democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, all summits are teamwork, but there are appalling examples of teamwork’s having capsized and of people almost having come to blows. When this has happened, it has been felt far beyond the closed negotiating chambers. There was undoubtedly a certain amount of drama in Copenhagen, but matters should never of course be too pre-arranged from the start. In spite of this, and above all in spite of the concessions within agricultural policy, the Liberals hope that the reforms are here to stay. The will was there. Everyone was prepared to compromise, but it is the Danes who must be credited with the outcome. Your objective, from Copenhagen to Copenhagen, has been crystal-clear all down the line. Despite the hesitancy on the part of certain people, you yourselves did not hesitate, Mr Rasmussen and Mr Haarder, but always sounded a clear note. While others demurred, like Hamlet whingeingly soliloquising ‘to be or not to be’ at Elsinore, you had the path clearly marked out. Your efforts will go down in history. As a liberal, I am very proud that it is a liberal government that has brought about these events.</p>
<p class="contents">Political victories can only be enjoyed for short periods, however. After Christmas, the work now begins again. The EU is to be reformed. Powerful leadership is needed, as well as the political courage to dare to implement a number of the institutional reforms required. The EU must become more effective, and that requires more majority decision-taking, especially within agricultural policy. The EU must become more democratic. A common constitution, common visions and common leadership are needed. Referendums must be held. We must all show that the new countries are welcome. They will be no B team but, rather, be as welcome as we ourselves are. There is therefore a heavy responsibility upon us all, including the Greek Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must also tackle the issue of how large the EU really can become. We eagerly await the Commission’s report on the strategy in relation to the countries that in future will border upon the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems to me that there is good reason to rejoice today, and I can indeed see happy faces around me. Mr Fogh Rasmussen is happy, Mr Haarder is happy, and Mr Prodi, we hope, is also happy. Mr Verheugen has every reason to be pleased with the great job he has done. The candidate countries should also be pleased with the tremendous job they have done. I think that this can perhaps get forgotten. While standing here welcoming the fact that a little country can achieve so much, it is possible to be struck by the notion that this could be a tip as to how to structure the leadership of the EU. It would perhaps be better to entrust the Presidency to the small countries and let the large ones attend to the battles they are fighting elsewhere. This, however, is of course a little, humble wish for the future on the part of my country.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As regards all of the good ideas as to what my country should do with regard to the euro, for example, I would say that, if you can get the Stability and Growth Pact to work, Denmark may well consider them. At the moment, I do not think that there is any reason to. In my opinion it is not working, and I think that it is true that Mr Fogh Rasmussen has managed better than the euro. It is of course galling for me that it is a liberal government that is receiving the praise, but the truth has to be told: you have managed well, Mr Fogh Rasmussen.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now heard enough historical speeches, and it is perhaps time to get going: not with history, but with the future. Enlargement has been a success, but we all know, of course, that things will not get any easier. Enlargement will not make it any easier to work in the European Union. There are many things that will become considerably more difficult, but it would have been worse if we had not prepared enlargement. This is the other side of the coin. For example, it will not become any easier to carry out agricultural reform, but it is even more necessary than before. I would of course urge both Denmark and the upcoming Presidency to take note of this. There is something quite wrong in the fact that life is better for a cow in the EU than for a farmer in a developing world country. That cannot be right. We must make a start on this task, therefore.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also make a start on looking at the EU's global role. For what purposes do we mean to use our cooperation? Are we to let the USA determine everything in this world? Is it to be the USA that dictates the list of terrorist organisations, the policy on terrorism, anti-missile shield strategy, Iraq, etc.? Or will the EU find a counterweight to the dominance of the USA? What does the EU want when it comes to human rights? We have been aware of this in connection with enlargement: we have watched over the applicant countries, given them advice and guidance, made demands of them; but what then, and what about ourselves? What will happen about the rights of the Roma when enlargement has fallen into place? It will not get any easier, but it is something we must follow up. It is a matter of keeping a constant eye on our own situation. What, too, will the EU do at global level as regards oppressed peoples? What will we do as regards Chechnya? Will we allow Russia to call the tune there? What will we do as regards the Iranians and their fight against the mullah regime? Will we let our policy there be determined by feta cheese and oil, or will we really back our grand words up with action? There is much to tackle in the future; it will not get any easier, but we will get through it.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to congratulate you on the result – although I do not have so much time that I can stand and eulogise. Enlargement by ten new countries can now become a reality, as Mr Rasmussen has said, after fifty years of growth, prosperity and, in particular, peace. An excellent result, but will we now be able to deliver the goods for some 500 million people? Is this in fact possible? Will we be able to develop institutions that are democratic, transparent and efficient? We have not been particularly successful in doing so thus far, and we do not have much time in which to accomplish it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi said that integration must now become a reality, and I found that a particularly significant statement. Have you not, however, really underestimated the costs involved? Are the European institutions sufficiently credible? Not in our citizens’ eyes, according to the opinion polls. Should we not make more efforts in this regard? Or are we going to leave that all up to the Convention? Enlargement will increase your credibility, but at the same time there will be a greater expectation that things will remain as good as they always have been for all citizens, including those in the present European Union, when it comes to peace, prosperity and, in particular, solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of Turkey’s accession is first and foremost a matter for Turkey itself. Turkey must develop her democracy in such a way that the different peoples, including the Kurds, can feel at home there. Finally, we cannot view this question separately from the issue of how we view our borders. Do we really see the European Union – and I do mean the European Union – as sharing borders with Iran, Iraq and Syria? Is this what we are called to? You will have to convince the public. You will also have to convince me because I do not believe that we are in a position to develop the institutions we would need for this…</p>

<p class="contents">No one is fooled by the recantations surrounding Turkey’s candidacy. Turkey’s accession is now inevitable, despite the unanimous opinion of the people of Europe who are, whether they be from the East or from the West, Copenhagen’s big losers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that future generations, Mr Prodi and Mr Rasmussen, will wonder who were those strange European leaders who decided in Copenhagen that St Petersburg is not part of Europe, but that Ankara is. They will without doubt realise at that point that the sole aim of the matter involving Turkey is to ensure that the European Union’s perimeter matches that of NATO, which is what the US is clamouring for.</p>
<p class="contents">So, you are talking of a new Europe, Mr Rasmussen, but let us consult the people of Europe directly and by a referendum to find out if they would rather Europe stayed as it is at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Prodi, since you have become an expert on this subject, may I suggest that you create the European Prize for Stupidity and award it to your colleague, Mr Verheugen, for this staggering declaration: ‘Enlargement will cost EUR 25 per inhabitant, the Second World War cost much more’.

Such assaults on summits may appeal to extreme mountaineers such as our colleague Mr Messner, but I believe that the average member of the public still finds the proceedings laborious and difficult to understand. Admittedly, it has to be said of Copenhagen that it was well organised, that excellent work was done, and that there was a marked improvement in transparency. Not all of the problems were resolved, however, although they were properly worked through. One can rejoice in enlargement as an historic event, but one can also be amazed at the way in which Austria was treated as if it were a candidate for accession and at the derisory consideration given to its vital interests. It has again been demonstrated that the European Union cannot go on in the same way that it has to date, above all when there are 25 or more sitting down at the negotiating table and even more so when the main concern of every Council Presidency is to extricate itself from the whole business with as little inconvenience to itself as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason alone that I believe a debate on greater continuity is needed as a matter of urgency. What will remain after the success of Copenhagen will actually, despite all the presidency's efforts, be a residual insecurity and, in the end, the hope that the heavily pregnant Convention will in the foreseeable future give birth to something that can serve as a basis for further improvements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The disadvantage is that when we really have some genuine praise to give, it does not come with the force that is deserved. For my part, Mr Rasmussen has been an outstanding President of the Council. I would like, on behalf of my party, to congratulate him, coming from – and here I adopt what our President said – not one of the largest European countries. I had said smallest but I obey the President's edict on this. I am bound to say too that my own prime minister may have some personal aspirations for the presidency of the Council if it works on a five-yearly cycle, but I very much hope that Mr Rasmussen has now entered the field in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite right that reference was made to the visionary words of Pope John Paul many years ago. I want to make some reference to Margaret Thatcher's own words at Bruges. These words have sadly become synonymous with euroscepticism, but the real message that Margaret Thatcher gave at Bruges was about a wider Europe. In those circumstances her message about Europe not becoming so inward-looking is one that has been carried forward by Mr Rasmussen and is one that we all celebrate today.</p>
<p class="contents">I also endorse the remarks of Mr Verheugen. I distance myself from what Mr Abitbol had to say about him because he was quite right in talking about the moral obligation that we have to candidate countries, about the fact that democracy and human rights are the battle that these countries have taken forward. Sometimes we adopt too much of a patronising attitude towards these candidate countries. We have to recognise that both Parliament and peoples will need to ratify entry.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we learn the lesson of Nice. That is a message for all of us here. The élites within Europe do not recognise that we have to treat these countries with the respect that they deserve, not only because we want them to vote positively on entry, but because the institutions that we have must become more accountable and more responsive. That is what the Convention is supposed to be all about. We have a structured design for six countries which is now difficult to operate on the basis of 15 countries and which shortly will be a mechanism that will have to serve the interests of 25 countries. The Convention should not become tied down in a debate covering only institutional matters, but must shift its focus to demonstrate how Europe can become a much more accountable and responsive institution for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the Presidency and the Commission have done an outstanding job on enlargement. The result has garnered many positive adjectives along the way, and I should like to join in with those who say that almost all the words have now been used up; but I concur with what has been said, and I would just say that, in my opinion, Denmark can perhaps be pleased about two things in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in 1993, during the Danish Presidency, that the conditions for enlargement were laid down, and now, ten years later, we have the opportunity to close the cycle during a Danish Presidency, too. I think that this is a very good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing that I should like to emphasise is the additional opportunity we have which is peculiar to our region of Europe. We now have a region surrounding the Baltic Sea which almost exclusively consists of Member States of the European Union. I believe that this presents some good opportunities, and we may have high expectations for the situation. Even if the end of the summit was perhaps somewhat mercenary – it often is – this cannot overshadow the big picture. Quite simply, we cannot pass a more secure, more democratic basis on to future generations than the strong community that has been created here.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also realise that, once the New Year celebrations are over, our feet must be back on the ground, and, in any case, too many major tasks await us – as they do the new countries. One of these is to push the EU legislation through effectively in the new countries: implement it in practice in both administrative and legal terms, so that the EU’s standards are indeed respected. The other is to do with agriculture. The way in which the compromise on the budget was reached has perhaps not made it any easier to envisage the necessary, proper agricultural reform. We all know that the common agricultural policy, as it stands, is grotesque and is very detrimental to the developing countries. In my opinion, this really is a field in which there will be a need for political courage and responsibility in the future, too.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to close with a few words about Turkey. As you know, two things were made clear as far as Turkey is concerned, which in my opinion are very important. One of them is that it is a candidate country that can join on the same conditions as other candidate countries. The other is that if the Commission, in December 2004, can establish that the criteria – the political criteria – have been met, the Council will also take a decision on starting accession negotiations. This is a great opportunity for Turkey. It is now up to Turkey itself to take this opportunity: the ball is in the court of the Turkish Government. We can establish that today, at any rate, none of the political criteria – democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and the protection of minorities – have been met in Turkey; so there remains a real need for further reforms, and there is above all a need to implement the reforms. It was, however, a prudent decision that was taken on Turkey last week in the European Council.</p>

After all, the summit was not only historic, but also primarily financial in character. These negotiations are always the most difficult, and the accession countries obviously have an excellent understanding of what the European Union is about. I do wonder, however, to what extent the financial arrangements are scuppering the political debate, specifically the arrangements with Poland and especially those relating to agricultural reforms. I also note that although no date has yet been set for negotiations with Turkey, the political criteria are to be evaluated in December 2004, so it is possible that negotiations may start without a national parliament, let alone the citizens of a Member State, becoming involved in such a decision at all. I object to this. I wonder whether this would not be an appropriate time to stop and consider where we are actually going with Europe and how far we want to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome Mr Verheugen’s promise to my party leader, Gerrit Zalm, that the November 2003 monitor report will state which exemption clauses could come into effect in countries that have not solved the relevant problems before May 2004, and which countries these are. I found this to be a positive, confidence-inspiring commitment; one which has unfortunately been paid far too little attention in the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have a deep respect for the Danish Prime Minister’s leadership. He, the Danish Government and especially the civil servants have pursued the goal, and have achieved it. Everyone concerned is to be praised highly for this. The façade of the new EU house has been built and decorated; now it is a case of putting the furniture in place. The greatest task is without doubt reform of the common agriculture policy. I still believe that the EU should have reformed the system of subsidies to European farmers before the decision to enlarge the EU was taken. Reform would certainly have delayed enlargement, but then we would have reduced the risk of having a two-tier EU; and not until sweeping reforms are in place will we be able to look the world’s poorest countries in the eye again, as they are still losing out. I also wish to say to you, Prime Minister, that the fact that Mr Bonde is opposed to it is the best sign that this is a really good result. Once again, therefore – congratulations!</p>

This is a positive response to a legitimate demand of the new members, our equal partners, but it is also the clear sign that it is our common responsibility to make a success of the Convention, so that the enlarged Europe can be more democratic and easier to govern. We need results which are in line with our ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall tackle two specific points. First of all, I am pleased to have heard the Danish Prime Minister defend the formula of qualified majority and codecision for Community legislation, and I hope that it is all our legislation that he has in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to the conditions governing the entry into force of the future European Constitution. The Constitution must be able to come into force on the basis of a strengthened double majority of the Member States and the people and, on this point, despite the fact that he is not here at this precise moment, I would like to congratulate Mr Prodi on having been directly responsible for conducting an investigation into a summary document. This will be a major contribution to the Convention’s work, as he includes, in particular, the idea of the constitution entering into force under a double majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that we have taken the decision in favour of the EU's predominantly eastward enlargement. This important decision once again underlines the fact that Europe’s post-war divisions are a thing of the past. It is now up to the Member States and accession countries to work together to create a realistic Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I regret the European Council’s reckless step in respect of Turkey. At the end of 2004, the European Union will be under great pressure to declare that Ankara has met the democratic and constitutional accession requirements. Yet how does the Council envisage fitting the influential Turkish military apparatus into its own democratic framework in this very short space of time? It will require a true political and public sea change in Turkey, both from an institutional and a psychological point of view, and this is something that could take generations. Or will the precondition of ‘institutional stability’ be the deciding factor in 2004? If this is the case, my fear is that European constitutional requirements will become unenforceable. I will also be very concerned about the future of the Christian minority in the former Asia Minor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Contrary to what some people are claiming, the fact is that the Turks have been given a date for final negotiations and in effect for accession in about 2007. The Copenhagen criteria are not prohibitive, and are actually not much harder for Turkey to comply with than, say, Romania or Bulgaria. Yet Turkey cannot be described as a European country – either culturally, geographically, historically, religiously, or politically. I therefore believe that it goes without saying that a European Union that wants to call itself democratic should organise binding referenda on such a far-reaching step in all European countries – a step with consequences that are barely calculable, a step that could cause a massive migratory flux of people to the West, a step that could even result in the complete implosion of the European Union. If the citizens of Europe are denied this opportunity for democratic consultation, I believe that in the event of an enlargement that includes Turkey, the European Union will lose all democratic legitimacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Prime Minister Rasmussen told the applicant countries what was what, if you will forgive the expression, but in a way they could accept. I do not, however, want to forget either the enormous contribution made by Commissioner Verheugen in the negotiations that led to the success of enlargement. Many sceptics along the way must have aroused justified anger in you. Perseverance, however, was rewarded with success, and I think Parliament should acknowledge that across the parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement emphasises just how important our neighbours are. Russia has not become a new neighbour with enlargement, but an incomparably more important one none the less. The border will lengthen by hundreds of kilometres in 2004. When Romania and Bulgaria join in 2007 three countries still in a state of turmoil will be surrounded by the Union and Russia. These are Belarus, Ukraine and Moldavia. I am not proposing increased assistance for Russia, even though we spend only a fraction on cooperation with this our most important neighbour compared with what we spend on cooperation with the Mediterranean region. Nevertheless, the Union’s political focus should be firmly on Russia, and Russia should be helped, and even pressured, to introduce reforms. After that we can initiate private business interaction on a new level with the Russians and start investing in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chairman of our group, Mr Hans-Gert Poettering, has already mentioned the worst problem: the war in Chechnya. I am in full agreement with him on this matter. An example of the injustice and corruption that still reign supreme is the necessity to terminate the TIR cargo system agreement with Russia, as it simply does not work there: drivers of freight have had to be prepared for the most diverse range of charges, to grease palms, rather than engines.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission will be getting 10 new Commissioners in 2004, I think one of them should be appointed to be responsible for relations with our neighbours to the east, Russia in particular, with regard to day-to-day problems. Let us leave high level foreign policy to the High Representative, wherever he or she has her home in the future. Another Commissioner could focus, for the sake of balance, on developing real content for cooperation in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p class="contents">If one of Russia’s neighbouring countries, including my own, had a Commissioner specially qualified to offer support when problems arise and when positive developments start to take place, the EU could be involved as a background power in talks in quite a different way than is the case now.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, furthermore, good news coming out of Russia: the economy is growing. This is good for both Russia and the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can the advantages of enlargement really be expressed in euros and cents? Surely not! This enlargement will yield substantially more than can be communicated or depicted in sums of money. In any case, the whole process of European unification and cooperation between the peoples of Europe is something far greater than that, and bears no relation to the public conception of how much it all costs. I want to quote an example. What we spend on the European Union as a whole, on our work to promote research, economic prosperity, solidarity with others, young people, the protection of the environment, transport, the common foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs policy amounts to some EUR 100 billion per annum. In 2001, EUR 125 billion were spent on defence within the European Union, and as much as EUR 133 billion this year. So which is better – to keep putting away money for defence or to press on with a peaceful development such as that which is offered as an opportunity for the continent of Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing romantic about financial issues. We cannot approach them solely with a fine image of a beautiful future in our minds; rather, we have to look at the facts of the situation and have frank discussions with the public, which knows that this is of course a challenge that will demand something of all of us. It was, however, a good sign that it became clear in Copenhagen, where negotiations about money had to be carried on under these difficult conditions, that you members of the Council were at least able to agree on a certain outline. You are of course aware that we, being the second arm of the budgetary authority, also have a part to play in all this. We will enter into a constructive and positive dialogue in order to deal with the relevant matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We can take a positive approach to the initial evaluation of the Copenhagen financial resolutions. You have taken on board much of what we in this House had suggested. The financial package remains in a fixed framework, one that can be defended to the outside world without resorting to eloquent blandishments, but it still, of course, contains a few things that we need to talk about. There is the mysterious category X, which sounds like something menacing out of the X-Files or some such science fiction. We have to discuss what this is actually intended to do. We also have to talk about how things are to carry on after 2007 because you too have passed resolutions that go well beyond the financial perspective for the next two years. We have to have talks about this. This Parliament forms part of the budgetary authority. We will engage with you in a debate on these matters. Let me sum up, however, speaking also as a budget expert who is accustomed to keeping a very close eye on what money is spent, where it is spent, and how it is spent, by saying that we will take a very positive line on this enlargement as a whole. We will also put the Budget under the microscope and examine it very carefully. We will monitor what can be expected of our present Member States and of the candidate countries. What is important is that this European continent should have a sound foundation on which to grow together, and a sound foundation is also about sound financial provision, on which we will come to an understanding together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The result, a unified Europe, belongs to us all, but your good planning and political will were the decisive factors.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement has finally put the Second World War to rest. Last Friday, in the Polish press room, this was very clear. In the last century, Poland was one of the hardest hit territories in Europe, mistreated from both east and west by regimes whose totalitarian ideologies left behind nothing but destruction and terrible memories. The inequalities of the past have now been eliminated, Europe is reunited, the word ‘solidarity’ has taken on a totally new meaning, Europe has been healed.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is justice that holds sway, and not brute force, among our 25 countries and in relation to the countries around us. The EU thus represents the most binding and only democratic cooperation between independent countries in the world. We should be proud of this, and so we are. This unique cooperation makes heavy demands on us, however. Our citizens expect the right results and solutions; we have to be able to take decisions and be effective. We must therefore focus on the essential points while at the same time preserving our diversity. Decisions in the Council must be taken by qualified majority: this produces a willingness to compromise. The European Parliament must be an equal co-legislator, and, when the Council legislates, we must all be able to follow the process. Justice, not brute force, holds sway in the EU. It is the alpha and omega, therefore, that our common EU rules are observed by everyone, big and small, in the north and south, east and west. This is only possible if we have a strong Commission. An enlarged EU requires that we all uphold the values on which the Community is based. This was the message the summit sent out to Turkey. Turkey still has a lot to do and has to get back down to work. In 2004, it will be assessed in detail and, after this, provided it meets the Copenhagen criteria, will be given a date for the start of its accession negotiations. Turkey is thus being treated in exactly the same way as all of the other candidate countries; as it is justice, not force, that holds sway in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Copenhagen Summit has shown that the EU is built on great visions and historic decisions, but, at the same time, time-consuming and sometimes even ugly negotiations on milk quotas, suckler cows and all kinds of transitional arrangements. We politicians must be able to explain both sides of this fantastic European cooperation. A big ‘thank you’ to the President and, once again, hearty congratulations: you deserve to celebrate, and not just with a beer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this decision has succeeded very well in striking a balance between, on the one hand, recognition of the reforms that have already been adopted and those already announced, and the new government’s willingness to go even further if necessary, and, on the other, the ongoing need to stress that the European Union sees legislative changes as very important but that what actually happens with these legislative changes in practice is even more important. Consideration of this will take time, and I think that it is right to look at precisely what has taken place by the end of 2004. Let there be no misunderstanding; it is now up to Turkey to act.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU, however, must not sit on its hands. Where Turkey is concerned, it is no longer enough to simply refer to the Copenhagen political criteria, which are somewhat abstract. On the other hand, there is also no point in producing a whole stack of details without any form of prioritisation. I would therefore like to underscore the call made by the president of my group, Mr Cohn-Bendit, to the European Commission, and to Mr Verheugen, for it to be made absolutely clear once and for all what the changes are that we expect Turkey to make. To cite one example: the role of the army. Yes, this must change – lots of things must change – but what exactly does the European Union want to happen before negotiations begin? What must then happen while negotiations are in progress? Will the constitution have to be changed, for example? Will the National Security Council have to be abolished? These are all specific examples of areas in which the EU will have to be much, much more specific. If we are not, I am convinced that we will end up in a disastrous discussion about the interpretation of the political criteria, one that will be dominated by prejudices rather than by objective assessment. If we are more specific, however, this will give Turkey a chance – not by exerting pressure but by demonstrating that European values and standards are normative, in Turkey as elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the pre-programmed decision to welcome Turkey, however, it has also decided to put an end to this era and perhaps to the Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">At Copenhagen, a trap was laid which, as well as doubling financial aid to Turkey with immediate effect, could lead to accession negotiations with Turkey starting from the beginning of 2005. In order to justify this, we are hypocritically hiding behind a promise dating back to 1963 which does not actually exist, as, what was envisaged in 1963 was not for Turkey to join the Europe of the Single Act, to the Europe of Maastricht, to the Europe of Amsterdam, to the Europe of Nice. These Europes did not exist back then. What was actually envisaged was nothing more than for Turkey to participate in the Europe of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The peoples of Europe who do not want Turkey to join were deceived by the Copenhagen Council. The meeting of December 2004 was arranged with the usual cynicism in order to side-step the 2004 elections. This will probably not prevent the citizens from launching the debate themselves on this occasion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is our belief, however, that we should welcome our new partners in a particularly splendid way, and there is in my view no better way to do this than on the Acropolis, so that we celebrate the unity of Europe right there on the Acropolis. At this time, we should, however, also make some critical observations. For, if the newly-acceding countries are to be enabled to absorb change, efforts must be stepped up to develop the necessary administrative capacities in these countries. I believe it to be equally important for the monitoring<span class="italic"> </span>process, which has been agreed, to be implemented utterly openly and with the utmost rigour, so that we do not face problems at the end of it all. This is in the interests of the European Union as a whole and of its capacity to act even with 25 members. It is self-evident that we should make particular efforts to implement the institutional process in the context of the Convention's constitutional debate, and I think that the candidate countries should be given every opportunity to play an active political part both in this process within the Convention and also in the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference in accordance with the Laeken formula.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion in which we are engaged has, however, moved on to include Turkey and other countries. President Prodi, I am very grateful to you for addressing the issue of the wider Europe, to which we need to offer new options alongside full membership, with something like a ‘European Economic Area Mark 2’. Here, we must also have the right, as a European Union, to represent our interests in relation to the financial arrangements and the cohesive effect of the legal institution, and be enabled in this way to discuss future memberships or other forms of partnership. I am, though, especially glad that it has been decided that Turkey is to be dealt with using the Community method. Instead of discrimination, whether positive or negative, there is a progress report by the Commission, and consultation in Parliament and in the Council as to whether the results justify the inception of negotiations. I really do believe it to be an essential step forward that this has been made clear and that misunderstandings have been prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, like to point out in addition that we have to have a clear view of the European Union's cohesive power, so that the Union may in future retain its capacity for further development, and, when I see that Tony Blair is saying – as reported in yesterday's media – that, with Turkey we are entering the Islamic sphere and that we should also consider North African membership of the European Union, we should say loud and clear that what lies behind this is a plan to destroy the European Union. That is something we must have no part in; on the contrary, we have to remain within the boundaries.</p>

It is true that a number of practical difficulties lie before us, but we are heading in the right direction on the whole, and by this, I am referring not only to the first ten candidate countries, but also to Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another section of the summit results which deserves our attention, namely that relating to the European security and defence policy. The European Council has made progress on three dossiers. First of all, that on relations between the European Union and NATO. For months, there had been no progress on the issue of the Union’s use of NATO capabilities and resources. Permanent solutions have been found: this is a step forward that was needed. We also welcome the confirmation that the Union is prepared to replace the military operation in Macedonia as soon as possible. Lastly, the European Council also indicated that the Union was willing to carry out a military operation in Bosnia following on from SFOR’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">European ambitions are, admittedly, still modest in these three areas, but they at least constitute concrete steps forward. We now must hope that the Council, the Commission and the Convention on the Future of Europe, each working within its own area of competence, help to bring to life a genuine European foreign policy and a genuine ESDP.</p>
<p class="contents">One final, brief point, on a less optimistic note, regarding the timetable of the Convention and the IGC on the future of Europe. Not only has the summit failed to give any clarification, it has in fact added to the confusion. This timetable is very important, however, for the success of the reform and for the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Swedish Presidency ended, of course, as a bloody police fiasco, while the Danish peace meeting may end up in the history books.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, there is some justified criticism. Denmark has not succeeded in showing that the EU is a project for the people and not only for élites. No change has been made to the EU’s disastrous agricultural policy, which increases the fortunes of counts and barons but forces small farmers from Eastern Europe into bankruptcy. There has been no allaying of the anxiety, felt in Estonia for example, that EU bureaucracy will crush the newly won right to self-determination. There has been no explanation of why Poland is forced to build a new Iron Curtain towards the east. Mr Titley, the Iron Curtain is not disappearing. Instead, it is only being moved. There has been no understandable explanation of why freedom of movement should apply from day one to capital, but from a much later date to people.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement process has thus again become a unilateral annexation whereby Brussels dictates and the candidate countries knuckle under. Denmark, which has its own exemptions, should understand that an enlarged EU cannot be uniform, because it then becomes totalitarian. It must be diverse if it is to be democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, it is a question of ensuring that the referendums in the candidate countries are democratic. Above all, it is a question of ensuring that we do not decide about the EU’s constitution before the accession of the new countries. <span class="italic">If</span> the EU were to make a decision on a constitution, right under the nose of the new EU Member States, that would be a triumph for the arrogance of power, and democracy would have lost out.

I believe that the founding fathers too imagined a Europe of cathedrals, expressing an ideal, with an image of a civilisation which is not that of the minarets of Anatolia. I am thinking of Strasbourg cathedral, which was built by great master builders who, like the master builders of Europe, certainly did not think of Europe as including Turkey, of a Europe which would change its borders and become the direct neighbour of Iran, Iraq and Syria. What can I say of the inclusion in Europe of a Turkey which has just elected as its leader a person, Mr Erdogan, who said to the Turkish newspaper, <span class="italic">jumh</span> <span class="italic">Uriet</span>, that millions of Muslims throughout the world are waiting for the reawakening of Turkey to rise up, a Turkey which yesterday refused to allow a former Sakharov Prizewinner, Leyla Zana, to leave the country, preventing her from coming to Strasbourg to take part in the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought awards ceremony? This is a further warning to those in favour of Turkey’s accession, whom we would strongly urge to remember the Armenian holocaust which Copenhagen wrongly disregarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the disputes surrounding the financial arrangements, we have taken sound initiatives. In the discussions on Turkey, we were surprised by the highly original and appropriate formulations which placed responsibility for accession fairly and squarely on Turkey itself. A formulation that was even better than the final outcome. My compliments to Mr Rasmussen in particular. I must say that I was filled with pride by the starring role played by Bertel Haarder, who was formerly one of our colleagues in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verheugen can now indeed look back on the difficult task he has now largely brought to a successful end with a feeling of relief. Bulgaria and Romania still have some way to go, and they accept that. If they do not achieve the target of 2004, I believe that they will do so by the 2009 elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is a great deal more difficult. Up until the summit, Turkey gave us the impression that she was basing her accession to the European Union on seniority of membership applications. In doing so, she was forgetting that when she applied in 1963, the European Union was only an economic community with no internal market as we have today, no elected parliament, and no political aspects or ambitions. She is now suddenly asking a whole lot more, and that is the main issue here. While the European Union has been developing at high speed, Turkey has remained trapped in the disadvantages of its Kemalist system, a system with great internal tensions and therefore with widespread repression. Anyone who did not belong to the main population group of Sunni Turkish speakers had a difficult time. During a recent visit to Turkey I realised that as a Protestant I could not live in a place like Dyarbakir, for example, without coming into serious conflict with the authorities. That is ridiculous for a citizen of the European Union in an aspiring Member State. Things have only really been moving over the past two years. There is therefore still a very long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as with Bulgaria and Romania, I would urge us not to be over-optimistic as regards the speed at which Turkey can change. You only have to think of the special position of the army, for example, which Mr Lagendijk has already mentioned. This position cannot simply be changed by means of a few formalities. The system is too deep-rooted for that. If you take away a cornerstone, much more may come tumbling down. It may be important to compile a list of the changes we want to see, such as to public order, which is accorded such extraordinary priority that individual human rights also suffer in many other areas as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted with the stance taken by Mr Verheugen, who said that his investigation will not be based on any preconceived answers whatsoever and that it will be an honest and thorough investigation. I think that there is every reason to believe that it will be, and also that we must make sure that we are not too superficial in what we do – something that often happens. I have great faith in what Mr Verheugen has said. We want a normal Member State; we do not, for example, want a Member State that makes demands and goes through life exerting political pressure by banging its fist on the table, as we saw recently. This is unacceptable; in my view Turkey will have to demonstrate goodwill by putting an end to torture, the deliberate provocation of minorities and suchlike.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime we are looking forward to the participation of the observers from the first ten countries. This is a momentous event, and it is incredible to think that from 1989 to 2004 we have been part of this Parliament that has brought about such major historic changes.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the agreement that the new Commission should take office on 1 November. I welcome that agreement, but it must be clear – which it is – that the new Parliament must be the one to approve the new President and Commission. The details of this must be worked out, as Mr Barón Crespo said earlier, in an interinstitutional agreement between our institutions. I would like to see November become the permanent changeover date. Why should we, every five years, have a half-year period where the EU's work comes almost to a halt, while we first have the European elections and then an outgoing Commission that needs to be replaced by a new one that can only start work the following year in January? It would be good to introduce this on a permanent basis and not just on this one-off occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the issue of the signing of the new Treaty that emerges from the Convention, containing a constitution. It is fair enough that this has been set for May, when the new Member States will legally be members and can sign that new Treaty. However, I would not like to see the new date being used as an excuse for having a long, drawn-out IGC from autumn 2003 to May 2004. We must keep to the idea of having a short, sharp IGC in autumn 2003, with the participation of the new Member States, to approve the results of the Convention, which we hope will not need to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point is the question of the number of seats in this Parliament for Hungary and the Czech Republic. Under the Nice plans they are allocated two seats fewer than Belgium, Portugal and Greece – although those countries have a comparable population with Hungary and the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic and Hungary are right to ask for equality. Whether that is achieved by cutting the number of seats for the three current states – which may be difficult – or by raising the number for Hungary and the Czech Republic, the issue must be addressed in the Accession Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will therefore limit myself to a few points. First and foremost, I would like congratulate the Danish Presidency – and these congratulations are not just formal, they come from the heart – on the skill with which it has brought lengthy negotiations to a successful close. Secondly, we are witnessing an historic period of history, the full meaning of which we may not yet have grasped: for the first time in the history of mankind, a union of States is being built on the basis of a project of civilisation and shared values without recourse to military force. This means that we, the European Parliament, and the Council and the Commission, must evaluate very carefully something which President Prodi mentioned, namely the fact that, at this juncture, now Europe has been built, we need to make the rules. The rules of our founding fathers, the rules which were the basis for the development of the European Economic Community, now need very careful revision, revision which I am sure will be achieved by the Convention but which needs a further contribution. I would like to quote a statesman who lived two centuries ago in Italy – Count Camillo Benso di Cavour – who said. ‘We have made Italy, now we must make Italians!’ We have certainly made Europe at Copenhagen – now we have to make Europeans. And to make Europeans we need this large-scale information campaign promoting Europe – which our President mentioned this morning – which has been announced many times but will have to be implemented practically in the coming months, for what is happening here must be by common agreement between all our fellow European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also need to put an end to a much older division, by which I mean the difficulties preventing eastern Europe from moving from the Middle Ages to the present day, difficulties which condemned it to a period of endless stagnation and cost it dearly in terms of both money and blood. It is time we paid our respects to the people of eastern Europe for their persistence and for their faith in the concept of progress, which I hope will be vindicated today.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a parallel achievement in southern Europe. It does not have the same material dimensions as eastern Europe, but it does have similar moral dimensions. Look at Cyprus, an ancient European people, a Hellenic people, which found itself in the grip of a nineteenth century colonial regime and finally – and rightly – rebelled against it in the middle of the twentieth century. As in numerous other instances, the consequences of that rebellion were – in English for the benefit of my British colleagues – an ‘independence of sorts’, but an independence accompanied by the partition of two nations, with the colonial power playing one off against the other on the basis of the classic principle of divide and rule. Today’s Europe, with the admission of Cyprus and the call for the island’s two nations to be reunited, will remedy the tragic consequences of the colonial adventure in - or rather the retrogressive order which governed - this European country. This is what is important, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, not the fact that no agreement was reached. Of course, the Greek side responds fully to your call for an agreement to be reached by 27 February and, if there is a similar response on the Turkish side, an agreement will be reached. But what you should really be looking at is the response in the hearts of the Turkish-Cypriots, whose demonstrations show exactly what they think of their reactionary leaders. This is the real response and the real brilliance of Europe in the hearts of its people, when Europe sticks to its principles, and we must rely on this brilliance to move forward and build the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The subject of our work over recent days was a common vision for the future of our continent. A stroke of good luck but also intense and extremely commendable work by the Union, and especially by the candidate countries, has meant that the enlargement process, launched in 1992 in the Danish capital and forming the basis of the famous political criteria, named after Copenhagen, on democracy, the rule of law and human rights, has been completed in the same place.</p>
<p class="contents">Look at how much progress has been made over the last 50 years! Look at how many barriers have been torn down, how many misunderstandings have been overcome! Twenty-five – soon to be twenty-seven – States are finally working together to achieve the objectives of freedom, democracy and responsibility. Such cooperation honours the fight that millions of our predecessors waged at the price of intense suffering and sacrifice.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have a great deal of difficult ground to cover, no one has any illusions about this. The European Union must, in particular, respond to the need to make fundamental changes to the way it works and to its institutions. This is the work that the European Convention must bring to a successful conclusion under Mr Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. We hope that the European Convention will lead to a draft for a single constitutional treaty that is legible and which responds to the need for a Europe that is more efficient, more democratic and perceived to be more legitimate by all European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless we fundamentally reform the way in which the European Union currently works, Europe’s reunification will lead to weaker political will within Europe and this is something that we certainly do not want.</p>

It has been said quite rightly today that enlargement of this Union must go ahead. On the one hand, a number of countries – I am thinking here of the Balkan countries – await membership at a later date, and on the other, there are other countries with a well-founded claim to close partnership and equal status, by which I mean Russia and also the states bordering the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">An enlarged EU must, though, strike a new balance between flexible and efficient decision-making and the aspects of the decision-making structures that have to do with democratic policy-making. Together with the representatives of the Council Presidency – I see that Mr Haarder is present – Parliament, the Council and the Commission are engaged in the search for a common basis for dialogue on better forms of governance. Mr Haarder has gone to a great deal of trouble to provide a number of contributions. Even though he is now the representative of a government and no longer a member of this House, a certain awareness may be at work here. The main thing, though, is that there are a number of governments that are far more restrictive than he wishes to be. I see that as highly problematic, as not enough governments have made public commitments to transparency and public access, especially as regards their decision-making structures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to thank President Prodi for the way in which the Commission has again presented a range of proposals that point a way forward to possibly better and, at the same time, more democratic ways of governing, principally indicating how the Council and Parliament can participate in lawmaking with equal rights. Not all of the Commissioners have realised, however, that when this House delegates and cedes the power to make laws, we can, of course, do so only on certain conditions and in conjunction with a right of recall. I hope, though, that the next conversations, which we will be having at the beginning of the Greek Presidency, will bring us a result.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate it when the Commission and the Council keep on reiterating their obligation to insist on adherence to the Treaties, but I ask them to acknowledge that we in this House have to insist on the principles of democracy being guaranteed by the legislators' participation in the process of drafting laws. We will be having elections in 2004, which we will not win against each other; we can win them only with each other and only when we make it our real concern that there should be greater flexibility, greater efficiency, and also more democracy in the European Union.</p>

The accession of central and eastern European countries, together with Cyprus and Malta, is another step in the evolutionary process of the unique phenomenon we refer to as European integration and I should like to congratulate both the Danish presidency and the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen on their successful handling of the entire process.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have much time so I will make just two comments. First of all, because of the economic and financial repercussions of enlargement as the result of the accession of new Member States, the Union will have to be bold in adjusting its financial perspectives if they are to meet the demands both of enlargement and of its citizens and make an effective contribution to the stability and cohesion of the societies of the Member States, especially the new Member States. Secondly, I should like to comment on the accession of Cyprus and, more particularly, the atmosphere surrounding the Copenhagen Council. It seems to me that the Council satisfied all of us because it showed that Europe can manage its affairs both wisely and decisively, taking as its criterion the construction of a healthy, democratic structure in which human rights and the proper values of human society are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not, however, forget that a solution to the problem still needs to be found and that Copenhagen was unable to find one because the Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot leaders refused to focus on a solution. We must now make every effort and do all we can to bring about the integration of the whole island within the next two months. However, I would point out that the solution to the Cyprus problem, however badly needed, must keep the fundamental principles of the Treaties of the European Union intact. Any derogations from the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, any transitional arrangements included in the solution to the Cyprus problem must not leave factors which violate basic principles of the European Union behind once they expire. I call on the European Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, to keep a close watch to ensure that the solution does in fact abide by the Treaties of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to congratulate the Commission and Council teams that negotiated the accession of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council has therefore honoured the promise made at Helsinki to carry out accession, even in the absence of a political solution. Our hope of seeing a reunited island joining the Union has not materialised. We now know that neither lack of time nor external pressure can be cited as reasons why it is impossible to accept the UN Secretary-General’s proposals as a basis for a global settlement. The agreement was sabotaged by those who continue, even today, to advocate the existence of two separate States instead of one federal State, and who wish to see Cyprus join at the same time as Turkey, rather than in May 2004, as an independent and indivisible country. Mr Denktash and his entourage are largely responsible for this failure, and I understand the frustration and anger of a large part of the Turkish Cypriot civil society as well as the opposition parties. It is true that the two sides have committed to continue negotiations with a view to reaching a global settlement before the end of February; it is true that there is still the opportunity to bring down the last wall in Europe. However, the mental barriers that the privileged few of Mr Denktash’s regime still cling to will not disappear as if by magic because, for them, no solution is the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Denktash’s stalling policy could very soon turn out to be a threat to Turkey’s ambitions in Europe. At present, there is still a last glimmer of hope that the European Union should bank on: the new Turkish Government could lay a major deal on the table and thus demonstrate that its declared intention to persevere along the path indicated by Europe is, in fact, genuine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst I think that what was achieved in Copenhagen will still be sending out signals long after the end of the summit and will be of great significance for European integration in the twenty-first century, I of course want to pour a certain amount of cold water on this achievement in order to enlarge on a few points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first topic that I wish to address is as follows. We are of course already expecting the Czech Republic to take the initiative in making an unambiguous statement, even before we are called upon to vote on its accession treaty in this Parliament. In November, with reference to the Brok Report, Parliament expressed its position with perfect clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen, I would like to ask the Commission to give some thought to how we can work together to develop a sort of third way as regards Turkey. How do we bridge the gap in time between monitoring the compliance with the criteria and the day when we actually discuss negotiations? What types of cooperation can we offer that are in both Turkey's interests and our own? I think these considerations make 2003 a very important year. We should all – Council, Commission and Parliament – be working together on how a large number of individual projects, ranging from customs union to the common foreign and security policy, can enable us to achieve a new kind of co-existence with an important strategic neighbour.</p>
<p class="contents">My last topic, one that I want to address briefly, is the need for us to resist all the attempts at blackmail that are being made even from within the European Union. I do not want to go into the details right now, but various Council working parties are meeting right now to resolve a problem for a Member State that joined in 1995. I think there should be no support here for attempts at extortion on the part of Member States, and I am very grateful to the Council and to you, Mr President-in-Office, for not yielding to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the beginning of the film we see how his family reacts with relief to the news that the British and the French have announced that they will be coming to help the Poles following the invasion of Poland by the Germans. We all know that nothing came of that help until last Friday, the thirteenth. On that day the outcome at Copenhagen paid off an old debt. The success of Copenhagen is success for everyone – including for this Parliament, which has been so intensively involved in this process. We can be proud of this result. To paraphrase the words of the great social democrat Willy Brandt, something that belongs together is now really being given the opportunity to grow more closely together. What started with Brandt’s historic genuflection in that self-same Warsaw has now been completed in Copenhagen. The credit for this new historic moment goes mainly to those who brought about the momentous changes in 1989 and 1990 and who were astute enough to make the most of the opportunity to turn the new democracies into fully-fledged EU candidate countries. Many of those who were leaders at the time have now disappeared from the political stage, but the outcome of Copenhagen is also a tribute to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, our own European Union also deserves to be congratulated, as it may well have taken a long time to formulate the starting points and preconditions for accession, but it has subsequently maintained the agreed scenario and adhered to the agreed timetable consistently and efficiently. In this context I would like to pay particular tribute to Mr Verheugen's efforts. The candidate countries are also deserving of praise. Their staying power has really been put to the test. As rapporteur for this Parliament for Slovakia, I myself have experienced the efforts made by the Slovaks to meet the EU’s conditions at close hand. They were far-reaching, and there was very little time. The emphasis in the reports from the end of last week about the results of the Copenhagen Summit was on the financial arrangements for the negotiations and the Turkey question. Both aspects are important, but they are not the only weighty matters. Other problems also play a role in the European Parliament's final assessment that we have to issue for each candidate country. It is enough in this case to remember our earlier concerns on matters like the battle against corruption, the lack of administrative capacity in the accession countries and the discrimination against the Roma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to join our group chairman, Mr Poettering, in emphasising that this small country has produced a great achievement. This really means that we will not have to change this rotation system in the future. Experience teaches us that big countries sometimes do not do things very well, and that small countries sometimes do things very well indeed. I say to Denmark that you can be proud of the outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly I would like to make some comments on enlargement. I am delighted that Poland has made it to the first group of accession countries. This was of course not without problems. It would also probably be a good idea – and I am addressing this to Mr Verheugen – to give the Member States an even better explanation of what enlargement is really going to cost us. If we are aware that there is still a leeway of some EUR 25 billion before we reach the EU expenditure ceiling, and if we know that we will only be incurring costs of EUR 12 billion in the first year of enlargement, EUR 12.6 billion in the second year and EUR 14.9 billion in the third year, we will know that despite enlargement we will still have money left over in 2006. We must therefore make it clearer that this enlargement is not expensive; in fact it is cheaper than all the enlargements that have gone before.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly , I would like to mention Cyprus and Turkey. It is a pity that Cyprus has not been included in its entirety, but it is a good thing that we have made sensible arrangements with regard to Turkey, which does not yet have a date for accession, but will have to adhere explicitly to the arrangements agreed at Copenhagen and will be tested against them. I think that this is very important. Actually I wonder whether Turkey ever ought to accede, as we will then have to tackle the debate about Europe’s borders at some stage.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment is this: you had a visit from Mr Giscard d’Estaing, and I have the honour of being a member of the Convention. Mr Giscard d’Estaing once again spoke about the president of the European Union and the congress that would have to be set up. Those are his ideas. I can tell you that there is really very little support for this in the Convention. If we ever need a president of the European Union, it should be the president of the European Commission, and we do not need a European congress at all. It is this European Parliament that needs more powers. That is also what it says in the Benelux statement. If all small countries endorse this, we will fortunately be able to consign this nonsense of Mr Giscard d’Estaing’s to the scrap heap. I hope, therefore, that Denmark will back this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a result, two fraught days were spent in Copenhagen negotiating a financial package, with divisions at one stage threatening to stall proceedings. However, once this had been resolved, the EU formally invited eight countries from Central and Eastern Europe, plus Cyprus and Malta, to join in 2004. This was a momentous occasion in European history, finally bringing to an end the divisions created by the Cold War.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it must be said that enlargement is not yet complete. Negotiations have still to be concluded with Bulgaria and Romania and have yet to begin with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the commitment given at the Copenhagen Summit to start the negotiations with Turkey in 2004, subject, of course, to a review on progress on human rights and rule of law issues. I have consistently argued that the accession of Turkey could form an important bridgehead between East and West and help consolidate Turkey as a secular democracy and a calming force in an otherwise unstable region.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of these momentous decisions, our new neighbours will be Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. Now is the time to consider what sort of relationship we want to develop with these countries and how far we want it to go.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am pleased that the recent uncertainty regarding the timetable for enlargement, which was partly due to our rejection of the Treaty of Nice in the first Irish referendum, has been removed. It will now proceed in May 2004, ironically under the Irish presidency and indeed, Mr President, during your final six months as President of this Parliament. I look forward to welcoming the new accession countries into the EU family on that historic occasion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The introduction of euro notes and coins has made the internal market a domestic one. The Copenhagen resolutions have set in motion the process of ratification for enlargement as a precondition for the reunification of Europe, and have enabled the legacy of Yalta and of the post-war era to be overcome. This move also has knock-on effects on all the Member States and candidate countries, including my own country, which possessed the longest external – and dead – border. From Europe's margin, we have moved back, to be – as the Austrian national anthem puts it – like a heart at its centre.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task is to draw closer together, to build up Europe's stability and its capacity to act, to listen, to be desirous of mutual understanding, to tear down walls and cut through barbed-wire fences – wherever they were or will be set up. Neither Copenhagen nor participation in the 2004 elections to Parliament bring the accession process to a conclusion. Information, communication and reform continue to be needed. The European projects call for the public to be more deeply involved, and not only prior to the ratification of treaties. Far from being already at an end, the process of enlargement is moving forward, and I am thinking not only of Bulgaria and Romania, but also of Croatia and the countries of the former Yugoslavia, of Switzerland and Liechtenstein.</p>
<p class="contents">As my final point, let me say that transit policy is evidence of the fact that the Danish Presidency, to which I am very grateful, is at work right through to its last day. Let me tell you, as an Austrian, that we give the utmost support to the proposal to be found in COREPER, because it is right and good. It is my expectation that a resolution will be passed at 3 p.m. this afternoon, or, failing that, at the extraordinary council of Transport Ministers on 31 December. Let us put an end to transitional arrangements; let us establish European rules and introduce the infrastructure costs directive in 2003 at the latest!</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DA)</span> Several speakers, including Mr Poettering, Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Dupuis, raised the matter of Chechnya. Before I return to the subject of enlargement, therefore, I should just like to make one comment about Chechnya. The Danish Presidency has addressed the matter of Chechnya with great vigour. I think I can say that we have addressed it with greater vigour than has been seen in a long time. At the EU-Russia Summit, I had a very direct, very frank exchange of views with President Putin on this subject, and this exchange of views was so strong that it was not possible to reach subsequent agreement on a joint text. I believe that this serves to emphasise the considerable energy with which the Presidency has taken this matter forward. The EU supports a political solution to the conflict in Chechnya, whilst at the same time, of course, offering Russia our full support in the fight against terrorism. The humanitarian situation in the region is also a central concern for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there have been questions on institutional aspects. Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Corbett raised the matter of the institutional situation in connection with enlargement. The European Council intends that a new Commission take office on 1 November 2004, and, from the same date, the new provisions of the Treaty of Nice, regarding the Commission and the rules for voting in the Council, should enter into force. This will mean that there is just one Commissioner per Member State, that is, 25 Commissioners in all. If this timetable is to be adhered to, there must of course be close cooperation between the institutions. I should like to emphasise that the prerogatives of Parliament will of course be respected, and it is with a view to achieving this result that the Council is planning to hold consultations with the European Parliament as early as January 2003. I should also like to say to Mr Corbett, therefore, that it will be the new European Parliament that approves the new Commission and its President. Mr Corbett also raised the matter of the additional MEPs for Hungary and the Czech Republic; this issue has already been resolved: it formed part of the packages the Presidency presented ahead of the European Council meeting in Copenhagen. These packages have now been accepted by all and will form part of the accession treaty; the issue of Hungary and the Czech Republic has therefore been resolved to the satisfaction of both countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, a number of speakers raised the issue of the prospects for reform of the common agriculture policy following the Brussels and Copenhagen Summits. I should like to highlight three things in this connection. Firstly, the ceiling laid down for agricultural expenditure does not prejudice any future decisions on the common agriculture policy. The same goes for the temporary right to top-up payments that is given to the new Member States. This is an extraordinary scheme of limited duration, which has been applied in a very specific situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to emphasise that the work on the mid-term review of the common agriculture policy which is under way in the Council can continue without restriction; the mid-term review of the common agriculture policy remains on the table, therefore.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I should like to stress that the decisions from the Brussels Summit do not affect the international obligations that the European Union has undertaken, including in connection with the launch of the Doha Development Round. No obstacles have been placed in the way of future reforms of the common agriculture policy over the last six months, therefore. Furthermore, I should like to add – and here I am speaking just as much in my role as Danish Prime Minister – that I am a very strong supporter of fundamental reforms of the EU common agriculture policy. </p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I should finally like to say a few words about Turkey, which many speakers have mentioned. I fully understand the interest in this issue – it is a key subject and an issue that preoccupies our populations. A couple of speakers said that the decisions taken in Copenhagen promised Turkey membership of the EU. I deny this categorically – no promises of membership have been given. The decision taken in Copenhagen was that, in December 2004, the European Council will come to a decision on whether Turkey meets the criteria for the commencement of accession negotiations. It is important to stress that Turkey, like all the other candidate countries, must of course meet the Copenhagen political criteria before accession negotiations can be initiated. There is no question of giving Turkey special treatment, either one way or the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the main topic: enlargement. I should like to attempt to summarise the debate we have had on this, which, in my opinion, has been very good, and, as everyone has pointed out, despite the technical minutiae which crop up here and there, it is the historical perspective that we must keep in mind. It is true that the final negotiations in Copenhagen ended up concerning themselves to a great extent with milk quotas and VAT on buildings, indeed even with freedom of movement for nurses, with top-up payments and a number of other technical matters. We must never forget, however, what this is really all about; we must never forget the big picture. The big picture is that the decision we have now taken gives the new Member States a comprehensive package amounting to more than EUR 40 000 million. Although this may be seen as a very small sum by the rich existing Member States – and in reality it is – it is at the same time a very considerable sum to the new Member States: it actually corresponds to 2–3% of their GDP. It is a large sum to the new Member States, a sum that will be able to set in motion self-increasing, positive economic and social development in the new countries.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing we must never forget is that these transfers from the EU's coffers into the coffers of the applicant countries are not the most important thing to be gained from being part of the European Union. The most important gains are being part of a great community; having access to a large internal market; and being able to engage – to mutual benefit – in more trade with each other, make investments in each other’s countries, and create economic development. The most important gain is being part of strong political cooperation in which large countries show consideration for small ones, and where everyone is bound by codecision rules; it is being part of political cooperation that ensures that Europe is a continent where the large countries do not have rights at the expense of the small ones; instead, we all treat each other equally, whether big or small. The most important gain, the big, powerful picture, is that we are now, finally, reunifying Europe. Try to think about the fantastic prospect which is that we are now finally reunifying something that has been divided for so many years. Try to think about how the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have, in reality, been the unfortunate victims of centuries of wars and conflicts between East and West. We are now putting this right: we are reunifying Europe, we are creating a strategic partnership between the EU and Russia and thus an opportunity for the countries of Eastern and Central Europe to live in peace and security. Try to think about the prospect which is that there are, among the new Member States, three Baltic States, who have been oppressed by the Soviet empire for generations. They are now part of our community. Try to think about the fantastic prospect which is that NATO, too, is being enlarged this autumn by seven new countries, also including the three Baltic States, who were oppressed by the Soviet empire.</p>
<p class="contents">Dear friends, 2002 has indeed been a good and historic year. We have closed a dark, bloody chapter in the history of Europe and opened a new, optimistic one, as well as creating the basis for future generations of Europeans to live a life of freedom and peace, growth and prosperity.</p>

Commissioner, let us assume that both sides in Cyprus agree to a solution based on the Annan plan by 28 February. Provision has been made for a referendum to ask the people if they accept the plan and if they accept integration. If one side, let us say the Greek-Cypriot side, rejects the referendum, what then? Do we revert to the Copenhagen arrangements, which only make provision for the integration of the Republic of Cyprus? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, the situation cannot arise in which membership of the European Union is approved, but not the political solution to the conflict in Cyprus, and so your question is hypothetical. On the contrary, it is a fact that if, by a democratic process, the people reject accession to the European Union, we regret that very deeply, but, being a democratic institution, we have to respect it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
