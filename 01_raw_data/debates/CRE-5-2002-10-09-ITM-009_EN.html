<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, first of all, I would like to express, at the beginning of the debate, my deep gratitude to the House, and particularly to the rapporteur, Mr Berend, and to Mr Walter, as well as to the chairmen, Mr Caveri and Mr Wynn, for the high level of cooperation between our two institutions and for the speed with which you have examined this proposal for a regulation. We must now work as quickly as possible, not least in the area of the budgetary mechanism, so that the first funds can be provided before the winter. I would like to be able to provide the first funds in November. Given the progress made in discussions within the Council this very afternoon, I feel that we can say that an agreement on this proposal for a regulation is now within reach, and I am pleased to say that this has been made possible thanks to a very broad consensus between Parliament and the Commission, of which Mr Berend was one of the architects.</p>
<p class="contents">During this final stage of discussions, we still have three points to tackle. The first is the definition of precisely which disasters will qualify for the provision of compensation. Parliament is concerned that the mechanism should not be gripped in the vice of an excessively rigid definition. The Council, for its part, wanted to classify natural disasters as priority. The Commission, as I said the other day before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, has studied the recent history of disasters in Europe in great detail. In recent years 80% of the disasters which have occurred are natural disasters, such as gales, earthquakes or floods. I do not believe, therefore, that it is inconsistent to agree to the priority requested by the Council since the option for the Commission to intervene in other similar cases – ecological, environmental or technological disasters – would still be available in a very small number of specific cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the threshold, or thresholds, for drawing on the Fund. Like the Commission, this House attaches particular importance to the fact that there are two criteria, either one or the other, and not just one sole criterion, so that we can fairly assess the impact of a disaster on the economy of a State, whether this State is a large State, a large country such as Germany, or a smaller State. I am afraid that, as we are quite aware, the smaller States in our Union are at risk of experiencing genuine, serious natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though the Council wishes to significantly re-assess the criterion expressed as an absolute value – we had proposed damage estimated at EUR 1 billion, the Council is going no higher than EUR 3 billion – the principle of having two alternative criteria is not being questioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the third point, is maintaining a qualitative criterion to provide for intervention under exceptional circumstances to help a single region affected by a disaster. This is an absolute priority for the Commission, and it is the margin of appreciation that we have sought throughout the discussions. The higher the quantitative thresholds, and I have just said that they were increased in the Council proposal, the greater the need to have a margin of appreciation, because, of course, the worst thing that could happen would be, ladies and gentlemen, for this Fund to be so restricted, made so inflexible by very limited qualitative and excessively high quantitative criteria that, ultimately, it is never used. I have pointed out, and I reiterate this to the House, that, in 14 years, we have only identified, thank God, seven major disasters with a total amount of damages of more than EUR 1 billion. It is also for this reason that I proposed in the Commission’s first version to retain the quantitative threshold of EUR 1 billion. Once again, the worst thing that could happen would be for the Fund to be so inflexible, bound up in all sorts of criteria, that, once set up, it would never actually be used, even when peoples have been affected by disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is taking a very careful approach to the qualitative criteria. I would like to say here that neither the Commission, nor, I believe, Parliament, wants the functioning of the regulation to be hijacked by the systematic use of this qualitative criterion. The Commission wants to be and will be extremely strict in the use of this particular solution. What we want is very simply to ensure that victims of a disaster that is exceptionally serious for a single region can qualify for assistance from the Fund. Indeed, there are regions in Europe that are more at risk than others, such as islands, isolated or remote regions, or regions that we must protect, as, in fact, the Treaty stipulates that we must do in a specific article – and Mrs Sudre, who is present, knows it well – Article 299 on the outermost regions. I therefore think that we must have the facility, and it is precisely this facility that the Commission has provided, to help these regions primarily in conjunction with these quantitative criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Madam President, with your help and, on this basis, with the help of the rapporteurs, I now hope that an agreement will be reached very swiftly on this proposal for a regulation and on the amendment of the interinstitutional agreement. Because, behind the problems, the regulations, the thresholds, the rules, there are people – this we must not forget, I have met them and have been moved by their plight – people who have been wounded, injured, and are still waiting, and as we are quite aware, in addition to the injuries there are also people who have died. These people are currently waiting for Europe, together with the national and regional authorities, to help them reestablish, as a matter of urgency, the very basic conditions that they need to continue their daily lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berend (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the floods that hit Central Europe this August reached alarming proportions. They claimed numerous lives and inflicted massive physical damage. Entire regions and cities were devastated, and entire rural areas and cultural heritage monuments sustained severe damage. The extent of the destruction triggered a great wave of sympathy across Europe, and the desire to be able to provide assistance, also at EU level, to the countries concerned in mastering the countless problems they face quickly became apparent. Commissioner, the local populations gratefully recall that only days after the disaster occurred, you and Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, visited the regions affected to see the extent of the damage for yourselves. However, they were not only grateful, they were also hopeful. Your visit raised their hopes that in such a case, the EU would intervene. Until now, there have been no suitable instruments for this purpose at Community level, for as we know, an EU relief fund once existed, but was discontinued in 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur, I view the establishment of this new solidarity instrument as an important complement to the Structural Funds. It equips the EU with a flexible instrument with which to cut through red tape, which enables us to provide rapid on-the-spot assistance when disasters occur. The purpose of the Fund – which will be focused on immediate financial assistance – is to help the people, regions and countries return to normal living conditions as quickly as possible. Its scope will therefore be limited to the most urgent needs. The long-term reconstruction of infrastructures and businesses must be left to other instruments, and this EU aid will add to, not replace, the efforts of the countries concerned. The EUR 1 billion designated for this fund are 'floating': in other words, they are not earmarked for a specific budget line, but will be mobilised only when a disaster occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has rightly asked the question: What kind of disaster can this Fund be used for? By defining a major disaster as any disaster resulting in damage estimated at over EUR 1 billion or more than 0.5% of GDP, this should ensure that claims on the fund are restricted to very exceptional damage. That is why the committee agreed, by a majority, on a definition that refers to 'major disasters'. We have deliberately refrained from making any reference to natural, environmental, or technological disasters. After all, what would we say to the people concerned if the European Union were hit by a disaster such as 11 September in New York, on a scale which claimed a similar numbers of casualties? Faced with this scenario, we cannot say to people: Sorry, the EU is unable to help because this is not a natural disaster!</p>
<p class="contents">We should stick with the term 'major disasters' as well as the three-month deadline for the submission of applications for assistance from the Fund, as this is in line with the principles of urgency and immediate rapid assistance which underpin the Fund. As regards the availability of the financial resources granted, in my capacity as rapporteur of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which is the committee responsible, I call for a timeframe of two years so that the Fund can provide aid to restore immediately key infrastructures such as energy, water supply and treatment, communication, transport, health and education. The funds should also be used to provide auxiliary services, as well as to safeguard security infrastructures, take immediate measures to protect cultural heritage and clean up damaged natural areas, buildings and cities, and carry out emergency short-term repairs to dams. The stipulation that this grant must leave available 25% of the annual amount of EUR 1 billion allocated to the Fund up to 1 October each year in order to respond to disasters possibly occurring late on in the calendar year is supported by the committee responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the parliamentary procedure for the preparation and debate of this report is not without its problems due to the very tight timetable, I believe that the accelerated procedure adopted in this instance due to its particular urgency, with the aim of disbursing EUR 1 billion in November, if at all possible, is acceptable in this exceptional case. I think we should proceed as swiftly as possible. The people affected are waiting for assistance from the European Union.</p>

It is a matter of common knowledge that this is, on the one hand, about getting very diverse things done very quickly because people really are waiting for assistance after having undergone something that we can scarcely imagine. On the other hand, we would have to toil our way through three complicated subject areas if we were actually to be able to do something that will be equal to the pressures of the future. For a start, we have to create a legal basis; one is in place today. We have today already been engaged in negotiations about it, and have had discussions about it in a very good atmosphere. I believe we will be able to come to an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets attached primary importance to the need to embody all this in an Interinstitutional Agreement. We have to take care that we do not only give people the impression that we are now able to give aid with all speed, but must at the same time make it robust enough for it to last, to fit into the overall framework, to stand the test of time, and ensure that others affected at a later date may know that there are some things on which they can rely. What we must not do is again dangle a carrot before them and then later have to say that there is no basis capable of supporting what we want to do.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore put the emphasis on three things. The legal basis must be decided on as soon as possible, and so we have cooperated very constructively with the Committee on the Regions, to which I am very grateful for having taken the majority of our amendments on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the Interinstitutional Agreement is as good as concluded, but just one small problem remains. The Commission must, as soon as possible, propose a supplementary and amending budget in which the money – the EUR 1 billion of which we are speaking – is actually made available as quickly as possible, and an appeal can be made to the Member States to produce the figures with all speed so that we can make progress on this.</p>
<p class="contents">In our budgetary capacity, we have agreed that we want, in future, to hold out this EUR 1 billion at least as an offer. We will work together with everyone else as quickly as possible, but it must also be clear that we will do this as thoroughly as possible. My present optimism is founded on my past experience, in this House, of cooperation across all national boundaries, without regard to political allegiances, between the committees and also between the institutions – Parliament, the Council, and the Commission. I believe that the people of Europe can know that here there is real cooperation with human beings in mind. We, who, in our budgetary capacity are otherwise meant to focus our attention more or less exclusively on money, now know how valuable the human dimension is. There is now a need to provide assistance as quickly as possible, here and now, in Germany, in Austria, in the Czech Republic and, in future, also in regions which in the past sometimes felt that we, unfortunately, could not really meet their needs adequately.</p>

On numerous occasions, both I and several of my fellow Members have called for the European Union to take action on the ground when major disaster strikes the Member States of the European Union. Last year, I submitted an amendment during the budgetary procedure for disaster-relief action on the ground by the Union, but it failed to achieve the required majority in the European Parliament. The fact that we are now well on the way to adopting a Solidarity Disaster Fund is of course, excellent news; I just wish we had not waited until after the terrible catastrophe, the human tragedy in Central Europe this summer; but, nonetheless, the European Commission and Mr Barnier personally deserve our congratulations because, we are, at long last, on the way to adopting a Solidarity Fund for natural disasters and, of course, congratulations also go to our rapporteur, Mr Berend, on his report, his hard work and his proposed amendments, which are a step in the right direction and almost all of which were adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to say, in support of what Mr Barnier and Mr Berend have said, that it is right, first that there should be a broad definition of disasters and, secondly, that the European Commission and Parliament have laid down the right limit for including disasters in this regulation. I really hope the Council will not demonstrate the meanness it appears to be demonstrating on this particular issue and will be as generous as it should. The limit set by the Commission and endorsed by Parliament is the right one, it is not too low and it is not too high and I think that the message which all three institutions need to send out is a message of solidarity, a message that the European Union will act on human suffering. I trust the Council will take this message on board; as for Parliament, I think that, with Mr Berend's report, we are moving in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now and in the future, aid can be given at once when disasters strike. It is with gratitude that I, as a MEP from Saxony-Anhalt, see with what speed and unanimity the Commission and Parliament act. I have also found, among the flood victims in my region, that the European ideal can hardly be more clearly communicated than by aid. It is perhaps auspicious that we find ourselves debating this solidarity on this historic day when the enlargement of the Community has taken on a definite shape, for the Solidarity Fund is already open to the candidate countries and our solidarity is already being extended to them.</p>
<p class="contents">My group's concern is to retain as far as possible the precision of Commissioner Barnier's fine proposal for a regulation. The Solidarity Fund is an instrument of aid, one that makes immediate aid possible and whose tasks must be clearly distinguished from those of the Structural Fund. I would like to highlight two amendments to the Commission draft. Firstly, I wish to follow Mr Berend in highlighting the more comprehensive definition of a disaster, which we wanted, and which will allow us to respond flexibly to future catastrophic events that would otherwise be hard to include under the Commission proposal, for example droughts or the fallout from acts of terrorism. Secondly, the extension to three months of the period in which application to the Fund must be made. This gives an appropriate response time to those candidate countries that are as yet less well equipped to deal with administration and does justice to a situation in which important parts of the administration have also been destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this is not relevant to the Solidarity Fund, our discussion today should make reference to the call for a future European civilian emergency force. The flood disaster has shown that, whatever the efforts made, there were significant deficiencies in the leadership of operations, in materials, logistics and communication, at any rate as regards the cross-border dimension. This needs to be remedied. The Commission should start by encouraging or supporting joint exercises by fire brigades, by the agencies for technical aid, by the rescue services and so on in border areas. In the medium term, this could give rise to a logistically unitary aid network or even a civilian solidarity corps, which could indeed be deployable in the event of disasters outside the Community, for example after an earthquake such as that which recently struck Turkey. It is a vision such as that on which we should be working, and we should not wait until after the next disaster. My thanks – for I must not forget him – to the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must certainly all agree that we need a flexible tool that allows for quick action to repair damage caused by major disasters. Establishing the Solidarity Fund is such an important issue, however, that more time should have been set aside to discuss it. During the Committee debate and afterwards many factors came up which we have had insufficient time to consider properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is in favour of establishing the fund. The threshold for the use of the aid must be kept high. The fund must concentrate on immediate costs during the initial stage of major natural disasters. Actual reconstruction does not form part of the fund’s remit. Risk factors must be addressed through insurance and preventive measures whenever possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that the fund should not become a new variation on the Structural Funds, to be used up on a yearly basis. It must only be used when there has been an exceptional, major disaster, when help is really needed.</p>
<p class="contents">One or two questions came up after the committee debate. I would like to ask the Commissioner what the position will be on major disasters taking place in third countries and resulting in suffering for people in the Member States and the applicant countries. Secondly, what will the maximum amount of aid be as a percentage of the costs of damage? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By doing this, the Commission has in fact done its bit to meet the expectations of the citizens in the European Union's disaster areas for prompt aid. At the same time, I of course want to give my support to the discussion here in Parliament being a matter of urgency, and I expect the Council to go ahead with its project of direct dialogue to deal with Parliament's amendments to the Commission's draft. This would make it possible to actually make a start on allocating resources from the Fund with effect from 1 November, following adoption by the General Council on 21 October. I think this is virtually a world record for these three European institutions to get something from conception to realisation in such a short time. This is unmistakeably and tangibly symbolic of European solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">My group gives its support to the extension of the applicability of the Fund's resources to major disasters in accordance with the amendment brought in by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and is in consequence opposed to the Council's preference for concentrating on natural disasters. In the same way, as my fellow Members have already said, we are also, as a group, in favour of applying them to damage in excess of EUR 1 billion or 0.5% of GDP, 50% to be paid out at once, a three-month deadline for submission of applications, and the possibility of derogations for regions that are particularly severely affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though like to express my regret that, as the Fund is to be what one might term a fund with virtual money, it is not to be possible to transfer resources unused in one year to the following year and thus to accumulate them. To do so would have given us a more flexible instrument for giving as much help as possible to citizens, businesses and institutions affected even by major disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This budget heading had existed up until 1997, when it was deleted from the Community budget as a result of what was, in my opinion, a distorted interpretation of subsidiarity policy. Two years ago, I came up against the stubborn opposition of those Members who were using the lack of a legal basis as an excuse and denying me their support, despite the fact that I pointed out to them that genuine natural disasters ultimately affect environmental, agricultural, infrastructure, economic and social policies, as well as all the other Community-level policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, two years ago, I tried to make this House understand even just the psychological importance for the European citizens of being entitled to receive financial assistance from the Union, even if the assistance is only symbolic, at extremely sensitive times such as those when they have lost everything and, in many cases, find themselves having to rebuild their entire lives. A personal example of this is the earthquake which took place in Italy a few years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, two years ago, my arguments and political endeavours were not strong enough to convince the House. In summer 2002, however, everything changed. The tragic disasters which affected a number of both the Member States and the candidate countries unexpectedly changed our concept of subsidiarity policy. An astute political initiative – and I would like to thank you, Commissioner Barnier, in particular – turned the impossible into reality and, as a result, not only was a legal basis created in the space of a few months but, in addition, a new interinstitutional agreement was signed bringing about the immediate, guaranteed payment of these funds. I can only rejoice: let that be quite clear. When I reread the letters and speeches I had written during the 2001 budgetary procedure, I wondered whether I was suffering from the curse of Cassandra when I saw how often the fears I had expressed had subsequently become reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly welcome the fact that the Union has, at last, decided to shoulder what I consider to be one of its responsibilities. I welcome the fact that we have shown ourselves to be capable of speedy, timely, well-targeted action. I must admit, I am also glad that a good precedent has now, at last, been set, which will stop us trying to use the lack of a legal basis or similar arguments as an excuse for not doing something we do not want to in the future. I am also, however, annoyed because, yet again, all this had to go via the Council, it was not the result of our own action, whereas Parliament can and does make itself heard when it wants to. It is capable of acting on equal terms with the Council or at least – I am no fool; I too am familiar with the Treaties – it can do its best.</p>
<p class="contents">There you are, that is what we must do and we must be constant in our endeavours. In any case, I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for everything they have done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the amended proposal as it is now before us will in time lead to an untenable financial situation within the framework of the present budgetary agreements. The term 'major disaster' has hardly been defined and if damage does not exceed the threshold value, there are generous exemption situations. The way this fund is being organised shows in my view a lack of any sense of responsibility. Although this may engender a warm feeling towards the EU among the citizens affected, ultimately, they end up paying for the emergency aid themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The fund has to be streamlined in order to stave off this sort of hopeless situation. This means restricting it to natural disasters and adapting the threshold values and exemption situations to its complementary nature. This is with a view to penalising negligence, promoting preventive measures, making optimum use of existing international damage schemes and guaranteeing the fund's effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I was the only one to hold this view in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. I therefore foresee major problems when, after a few years, the financial balance sheet is drawn up. I doubt whether there will be any solidarity left between the states. For those who share my doubts, I warmly recommend our amendments. Otherwise, I pin my hopes on the Council's wisdom.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to add that I am pleasantly surprised by the acoustics in this Chamber. This is probably due to the additional equipment that has been installed. I can assure you that it is working extremely well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only do we talk in those terms, but we live in solidarity and set definite dates. I would remind you that, at its first September sitting, Parliament almost unanimously passed a 19-point resolution on the flood disasters in Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, that our second sitting found us voting the Budget lines, and that today, in our third part-session, this mini-plenary is creating the legal basis for all this. We are standing alongside the victims, acting swiftly, unbureaucratically and consistently, and it is for this reason that we have also chosen to use the accelerated procedure for matters of urgent importance. We are keeping our promise, and I would also remind you that we have doubled the proposal by the Council and the Commission for EUR 500 million to be allocated to the Fund. We also call on the Council not to alter our definition of a major disaster – over EUR 1 billion in damage in any one country or over 0.5% of its GDP – as any change would nullify the consistency of our stance. We call upon the Council to take up the proposal from Parliament and the Commission and make it a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We can and must tell the victims that, subject to the agreement of the Council on 21 October 2002, we will see to it that money can flow to the affected regions from 1 November onwards. Agnes Schierhuber and I are from an affected region in Lower Austria and represent many who know how much damage was done and how much hope has been kindled by the policy of acting speedily and naming specific dates. We rejoice and are also rather proud to be able to show by this example how we not only talk and make promises, but are also capable of fixing dates and acting promptly.</p>

By this, we are showing that the European Union is reactive and responds to the concerns of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the fact that the recommendations that the European Parliament is preparing to make emphasise an important point, namely an emergency fund, the aim of which is to provide essential relief items to those affected. The mechanisms for releasing the appropriations which are put in place as well as the timeframes specified must, as a necessity, take into account this specific point. European money must arrive quickly on the ground in order to assist victims at the time when they need it most.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the aim of this Fund is to demonstrate in practical terms the solidarity of Europe's citizens towards disaster victims, many Members of Parliament and I myself would like the intervention thresholds to be more generous and to take into account regional characteristics. It is now the Council’s responsibility to tackle this point. I believe, however, that if Parliament insists that flexible qualitative criteria be taken into account when releasing funds, it must be heard. It is possible that a disaster destroying poor regions of the Union, the outermost regions for example, or which completely devastates a territory, as has happened recently in the South of France, will not be able to benefit from European solidarity, because of nothing more than accounting reasons. I must say that, personally speaking, I believe it is essential that natural disasters are handled separately and as a priority, because, in this case, it is impossible to identify who is responsible and therefore to claim insurance. It is in these cases that European funds are most needed.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final, very brief, point, I would like to reiterate that repairs must go hand in hand with the implementation of a genuine policy of prevention and that of a European civil protection force, in order to give rapid assistance to those European citizens who are in the most difficulty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to highlight four criteria and finally mention a material error which has slipped into the proposal we are going to vote on tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to express my positive view of the adoption of the qualitative criterion by the committee, and therefore by Parliament, and I hope this will be recognised by the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would have liked the definition of ‘drought’ to have been made much clearer amongst the disasters to be incorporated, despite the fact that the Commission and several speakers have expressed the view that it is covered by the definition of disasters. From experience, I would prefer definitions to be much more specific and much clearer.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I believe it is positive that there is mention and clarification of the fact that it is the Member States who are the interlocutors with the Commission on the Fund we are talking about, in order that we may provide a rapid and effective solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, since I come from the Balearic Islands, I would like to express my gratitude at the approval of the amendment clearly incorporating the islands and the outermost regions; this brings us back to the issue I mentioned before in the context of drought: the situations must be clearly defined so that there are no doubts when this type of dramatic situation arises and requires an immediate response.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, please allow me to request that the services of Parliament review Paragraph 3 of Article 3 in Amendment No 13.</p>
<p class="contents">I tabled an amendment which requested the inclusion of urban areas in the final paragraph. I understand that this amendment was approved in the Committee on Regional Policy; in fact, in the justification for what is proposed for the vote tomorrow it is made perfectly clear that, in the amendment being approved, the cleaning up of cities is included. However, what was voted for in the Committee on Regional Policy was not taken up, despite the fact that it appears in the justification. I assume that this is an omission and I would be grateful if it could be resolved before the vote tomorrow. We believe that the incorporation of the urban areas is extremely important in terms of their quantification and repair, and in terms of the concentration of human beings found in them, and immediate action is therefore required.

I feel regret that we were not listened to following the disastrous storms of December 1999, the effects of which are still felt in many regions of France and Europe. I feel satisfaction, which is of course tempered by the tragic events in Germany and Central Europe, that the European Union has finally conceded that it must be seen to stand by our fellow citizens in times of difficulty and in the physical and material tragedies that affect them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to congratulate Commissioner Barnier and his department, as well as Mr Berend, for the exceptional resourcefulness that they have shown in preparing this dossier. I believe that this report is a credit to both the Commission and Parliament, and the European Union as a whole, both because of the speed with which it has been produced and because of its balanced approach, its recognition of the exceptional nature of disasters, and the prominence it gives to urgency, flexibility and adaptability. Nonetheless, disasters can be tragic or perceived to be so regardless of their extent, and I believe that this evening, since we are finally putting in place a mechanism that we can call upon when major events take place, we must also consider our presence when smaller-scale troubles, tragedies or natural disasters occur. No death can be classified as more or less important than any other, in the same way that no ruin can be classified as major or insignificant.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I shall, once again – and I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier for mentioning this – call for the creation of a European body for civil security. It does not have to be created from scratch and would allow us to establish and dispatch to the regions in difficulty civil rescue forces wearing the colours of the Union who will thus display our solidarity with the citizens in times of misfortune. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are building a Europe of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to highlight another value which I believe is absolutely central to this initiative – and we have all supported it and contributed to its timely achievement<span class="bold"> </span>– and that is the political benefit to be gained from it. I feel, Commissioner, that there have been very few situations or events in which many, very many of our fellow citizens have for the first time felt that Europe is genuinely close to them, that it is truly an elder brother ready to run to their aid when they are in difficulties. We must never forget that, in some cases, the only experience many of our fellow citizens have had of the European institutions is of a set of rules and regulations, bans and directives. I believe there is a political benefit to be gained from showing them the friendly side of Europe, as we are doing in this case, particularly at times such as this – and we are approaching a major referendum now, we all know the details – a political benefit which we must not allow to go to waste.</p>
<p class="contents">How are we to avoid wasting it? Commissioner, you put it very well and I fully agree with you. We cannot make this instrument, which was designed to respond to emergencies, rigid, unadaptable or inflexible, in other words an instrument which becomes ineffective or which is even in danger of not being used precisely because the rules to which we are linking it are too complex. We must maintain a certain flexibility in this matter and I can see that you are quite aware of this but – and this is the last point to which I would like to draw your attention, even though, I regret, you are not listening to me – I also feel that we must view this merely as an initial step.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, nobody here wants to see events such as these repeated, but we have a responsibility to be realistic. Soon, there will be 25 Member States, and it is quite clear that the climate is changing. I am afraid that, statistically, it is realistic to expect more such tragedies to occur.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in the face of tragic events which, I am afraid, will be repeated, I do not feel that EUR 1 billion will suffice. We must endeavour to explore further possibilities for the future, Commissioner, for the 2004 budget, if possible. I will only make one suggestion at a time, and I would like to hear your opinion too. Why do we not set aside part of our leftover funds – for there is always so much money left at the end of each budget which we do not know how to spend – why do we not use a set amount for this fund? I invite you to reflect on the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The floods have wrought their havoc, and we have taken immediate action. Let me take this opportunity to remind you of the resolution Parliament passed by a large majority – over 470 votes in favour – at the first September part-session in Strasbourg. We showed how aid can be provided quickly and secured on a durable basis, and that there can be an instant guarantee of European aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my gratitude to the Commissioner, who has so quickly taken on board this initiative by Parliament and submitted proposals, and say that it would be proper for Parliament to process these proposals without delay, even though our rules actually provide for a different procedure, and even though my parliamentarian convictions do not always lead me to favour our all too ready abandonment of our rights. In this case, though, it makes sense, and in this case it is right that we should act in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now created lines in the Supplementary Budget that we have just passed. We are now discussing the legal basis, about which we want to have agreement with the Council by the time we meet in Strasbourg at the end of this month. What this means is that the formal conditions for the disbursement of funds have been fulfilled. Two are required – the legal basis and the Budget line. What I ask is that the Commission should manage to come up with a supplementary budget quickly. That, Mr Barnier, is a job for your fellow Commissioner Mrs Schreyer rather than for you! Money must also then be allocated to these lines, because – as I have told this House three times already – if a disaster strikes in the middle of August and emergency aid takes until just before Christmas to arrive, then that is not emergency aid at all! We should not be deceiving ourselves. That being so, Mr Barnier, my request is to be passed on to Mrs Schreyer – who, I am glad to see, is coming in on cue – that a supplementary budget be set as quickly as possible, so that the lines can be funded and so that European solidarity can be a matter of deeds and not just words. This needs to be given expression, and it is time that we did so.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we in this Parliament have made our advance payment, and I hope that help can be given quickly, and in accordance with definite criteria, in any future disasters such as we have experienced in August, and that the events leading to the abolition, without legal grounds, of the former Disaster Fund do not recur. Not all the problems in Europe should be allowed to become European solidarity issues. This is where a clear dividing line must be drawn between solidarity and subsidiarity. If we manage that, we will be on the right track!</p>

As certain Members of this House have already pointed out, the distribution of resources for the affected regions is dependent on it, and that not only in the Member States, but also in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is this prompt action that helps the EU to be taken seriously as a Union for its citizens, and to show that the same EU is capable of responding with efficiency and speed to the emergency situations in which they find themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Karas has already referred to the fact that I too come from one of the regions affected, and I can assure you that people are really grateful for this solidarity. As well as the great damage sustained by roads, bridges, railway infrastructure and public and private buildings, over 20 000 hectares of farmland were devastated. Let me repeat that the damage in Austria amounts to something in the order of EUR 6 to 7 billion. The new Solidarity Fund is intended to be – indeed, it must be – a powerful instrument in an emergency and, for that reason, one whose use is targeted. I would like to give my wholehearted support to the rapporteur's proposals, and thus to those of the Committee on the Regions, as regards fixing the threshold at EUR 1 billion or 0.5% of GDP. The threshold of EUR 3 billion demanded by the Council strikes me as too high. It is also right to require that the financial resources be drawn on within two years. The two-month deadline cannot but be supported, as, if aid is to be given quickly, applications for it must be made with equal speed.</p>
<p class="contents">Demands continue to be made on the Member States, which cannot evade their responsibilities for preventive measures or long-term reconstruction work, for which we will yet need much in the way of resources. My especially warm thanks are due to the Commission for coming up with proposals so fast, and especially for the Commissioners having been on the spot with the President of the Commission, and for these funds of EUR 1 billion being available. I really do hope that we will vote in favour of this report tomorrow and thus enable the funds to get to the victims as soon as possible. Parliament and the Commission will then have done their duty, and it is my very real hope that the Council will pass the necessary resolutions in October, so that the money will at last reach the victims.</p>

<p class="contents">I also regret, however, that this statement is only being made after several years of repeated requests to the European executive to set up an instrument of this sort, the lack of which was, for example, particularly marked following the storms which hit France in December 1999. Mr Savary mentioned this earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">The powerlessness and inertia of the Community in such circumstances have been very badly perceived by the general public, even though efforts were undertaken to bring Europe closer to its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, following the catastrophic weather in central Europe and in the south of France, the imminent prospect of the implementation of an emergency fund with an annual grant of EUR 1 billion may, at last, give slightly more credibility to the concepts of European solidarity and a common destiny. In this respect, I believe it is essential to congratulate, in particular, Commissioner Barnier, who succeeded in drafting a proposal for a regulation of very high quality in a record time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fund will provide emergency aid to any area affected by a major disaster, whatever its status with regard to the Structural Funds. An additional qualitative criterion stipulates that, in very exception circumstances, namely when the disaster affects a substantial part of the population of the region or the State concerned, the assistance from this Fund can therefore be used. I knew that we could count on you, Commissioner, for this provision to include the particular case of the outermost regions, whose geographical and climatic situation often causes dramatically poor weather that has devastating consequences on their relative prosperity. Article 299(2) of the Treaty must be able to be applied, including in the scenario in question that I obviously do not wish to see happen again in a hurry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to express my gratitude for, and recognition of, the consensus which has existed in the Committee on Budgets in relation to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this demonstrates that Parliament ought to attach great importance to this issue since, as the only supranational institution in the world directly elected by the citizens, it is able to be sensitive to the needs and demands of the Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, the European Union will have dealt with one of its outstanding duties towards those who are suffering, or who may suffer in the future, situations which leave them literally devastated socially, economically and morally.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the articles of the document we are debating today, in relation to the way in which the payment of aid should be made, following the decision to invoke the solidarity instrument, I must say that it is necessary to provide the aid completely and immediately, in order to respond responsibly and coherently to the spirit in which this Fund has been created and which is taken up in the explanatory statement.</p>
<p class="contents">The text submitted for approval responds to the undesirable but unfortunately probable future situations which both the imbalances in the weather system and the changing nature of the planet itself may confront us with, whether through possible drastic changes resulting either from excessive activity or from defects in the rainfall systems or atmospheric circulation, through tectonic movements or volcanic activity, or through any other type of extreme disaster which may take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Through this document, the citizens of Europe are promising to show solidarity amongst themselves. It is our heartfelt wish here in Parliament that, in the future, this extraordinary aid will not have to be used, because financial measures cannot replace human lives and cannot put an end to the pain which feelings of loss can cause people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly appreciated your almost unanimous praise for the Commission, for its ability to react and to take the initiative. I do not accept these compliments for myself alone. Mrs Schreyer, who stands beside me, has worked extremely hard to create a flexibility instrument that will enable us to finance this fund and, of course, all of our staff will also have appreciated your words.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Sudre said, for three years now, I have thought that the European Union’s response to major disasters has not been equal to the task. I am reminded of conversations I had with Mr Hatzidakis a few days after I arrived at the Commission, the day after the earthquake in the Athens area. As a French citizen, I was moved, as I was when Germany was buffeted by storms; and there were also those disasters in the Azores ... Frankly, for a long time I have thought, with regard to this issue of risk and risk control, that the European Union’s response to major disasters has not been equal to the task. We have reacted in this way this time because the disaster that has befallen Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia is on a scale that has never been seen before. Under the auspices of President Prodi, we have all learned a lesson from this. I would like once again to thank your rapporteurs, especially Mr Berend, for their cooperation and their proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I heard Mr Lisi say: will EUR one billion be enough? I certainly hope so. I even hope that this billion will not be used up every year. This is already infinitely more than the small budget line that existed previously and which could only be spread very thinly. Mr Lisi, ladies and gentlemen, we shall put our best foot forward. As the years go by – and I hope we will not be seeing too many disasters – we will establish points of reference and in a few years we shall evaluate the management of this fund. I have already said that if, by the end of the year, this fund were completely used up – and I must make it clear that I mean at the very end of the year – we could use credits from the following year. Let us use this EUR one billion first, however, if we need to. We will then assess what needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say to Mr Ferber that in order to use this money effectively and rapidly, to benefit the communities that are expecting it – local representatives and businesses in Germany, Austria and in the two candidate countries that have been affected – we must be able to release these funds. I therefore insist on the fact that we must receive a request for intervention from the Member States and an assessment of the damage, even if the dossiers are not extensive technical ones. I said the same thing today to the Minister-Presidents of the German and Austrian Länder. We have informed the ambassadors of the countries concerned that we need assessments of the scale of the damage. To this end, we have been holding meetings with officials from the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ripoll i Martínez mentioned the very specific case of droughts. I have to say, Mr Ripoll i Martínez, that droughts are not intended to be the main target of this solidarity. I would also add that if periods of drought do occur, as appears likely, we do have other means in the European Union budget, under the CAP for instance, of helping and of demonstrating solidarity, in particular where farmers are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to reply to Mr Pohjamo, who asked me which countries apart from Member States of the Union could benefit from this fund. The proposal for a regulation lays down very clearly that this fund is designed for the countries of the European Union or those countries with which negotiations for accession have been opened.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, if you do not mind, since I have taken an interest in this matter for a long time, to say that in addition to this fund which I hope will be operational, thanks to you and to the Council, in a few weeks at the latest, there are lessons to be learned. Prevention is always cheaper than repair and consequently, I have had two ideas which we can discuss a little further. Firstly, although the Commission is not asking to be given competence in this field, I think it would be useful to have a benchmark study of the various insurance schemes in the Member States and candidate countries. I was struck quite forcefully the other day, during my visit to Saxony-Anhalt, when I met a businessman whose company had been totally destroyed and who told me that he had no insurance cover at all. I therefore believe that we must take a look, in each of our countries, at best practice and the best schemes and perhaps exchange these best practices in the framework of intergovernmental cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">My second idea concerns prevention, an issue mentioned by Mrs Guy-Quint and Mrs Schierhuber. In the proposals we are considering for the future regional and cohesion policy for the future agenda for after 2006 (proposals that I shall be making on behalf of the Commission at the end of 2003), I am determined to make prevention against natural risks and disasters a mandatory priority for the European Structural Funds in all of the Union’s regions and in all of our programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to conclude, because I am going as far as possible into the lessons to be learned, by replying to Mr Stockmann and Mr Savary, that I also think we should go beyond mere coordination. We have already made progress since earlier disasters, particularly under the auspices and the authority of my colleague Margot Wallström. I think that we should move towards this fine and effective idea of a European civil protection force, that we should create a network of specialised units in our various countries, which can be linked up and mobilised in the event of disasters within Union territory or beyond, and that it should not be Belgians, French, Germans or Austrians who set out - each with much goodwill but separately - but Europeans who set out to help other Europeans – their neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we should discuss this issue further. Once again, we are not calling for Community competence. I also know that competence for civil protection is often not national. It is sometimes regional. But where there is a will there is a way and I think that it would be a fine and effective idea to go beyond mere coordination and one day to set up a European civil protection force.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you, Mr President and I thank the rapporteurs. Thank you in advance for your vote on this issue tomorrow.</p>
