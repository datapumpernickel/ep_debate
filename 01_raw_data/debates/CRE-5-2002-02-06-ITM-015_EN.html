<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Glante (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies, gentlemen, and above all, you interpreters who are assembled here in such numbers for so few of us Members, it is always a pleasure to be able to discuss such an interesting and exciting topic at such a late hour. I hope that the lateness of the hour will not downgrade the project.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer to the Galileo satellite navigation system, the first great project to be shaped jointly by the European institutions and the ESA. In technical, economic and political terms, it is eminently comparable with such projects as the Airbus and the GSM mobile telecommunications standard.</p>
<p class="contents">This system will to some degree be in technological competition with the existing American GPS system, which is a good thing for European technology, but it will also be compatible with GPS – at least I hope it will, and that is something by which we set store – and be able to supplement it. I have been told that the United States is seriously concerned about developments in Europe. That cannot be a bad thing, and can mean only that we are on the right road and that we will make technological progress in Europe by the use of this system.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly in competition, in technological terms, with the existing GPS, but there is also the possibility of their interacting. We are working towards the system being able to use the same receivers for GPS and Galileo signals. That will increase the utility of both systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like, at this point, to refer to the coordination between GPS, Galileo and EGNOS. Most discussions fail to do justice to this point, but I think it too is important.</p>
<p class="contents">After 11 September and during the Afghanistan conflict, the United States had apprehensions about the security aspects of what is a civilian project, but these will be safeguarded. Both the civilian character and the public control of the Galileo project make disruption, interference and misuse impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">A certain levy on receivers will mean that broad use will be free of charge. Broad use of GPS is free of charge, and so will Galileo be. More exact services of a higher order will have to be paid for in order to guarantee the refinancing of the running and development costs. The service will, however, be permanently available.</p>
<p class="contents">This afternoon I had the pleasure of a conversation with the US Government's representative in Brussels, who again expressed his concern about the project's development. I was able to reassure him, but not in the sense that we would unreservedly submit ourselves to the GPS system. I made it clear to him that we are building our own system, that we are working towards cooperation, but that we will carry on with development and not let ourselves be led into some kind of technological dependency. I think that these informally expressed wishes and these remarks show that we are still on the right road.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States have delayed taking a decision for a long time, and I hope that they will enthusiastically endorse this project in March, despite certain problems that they have with the Price Waterhouse study – indeed, I get indications from various Member State governments that they will. I hope that we will get to that, and believe that it is high time we did. We are already a couple of months behind, but will be able to make up for them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to again express my gratitude to the Commissioner for the conversation we had and also for providing these documents, which again explain what Galileo is about and can allay any suspicions or misgivings.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us turn now to the report itself and to the proposal, which is not uncontroversial. I think there is, as there was in the past, overwhelming agreement that we want this project and that we want it to be a civilian one. As a result, though, of events last year and in recent months, we are also agreed that it needs to be available to some degree to our troops who are sent out to maintain the peace. That will be feasible, technically feasible, but it will also be politically desired and feasible. It is, though, to remain a civilian system, as it was before.</p>
<p class="contents">There were great problems in discussions about how private enterprise was to be involved in this undertaking. The Commission proposal works on the assumption that private firms will be involved, including financially. Financial participation is – shall we say – a symbolic act. It would be enough to finance the development stage by means of public funds alone, but industry is to be involved. That is what I want too, but I have had no clear indication from industry that they are becoming amicably disposed towards the Commission proposal and getting on board the Joint Undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposal that the development company should be established, coming into being in parallel with the Joint Undertaking but dovetailing closely with it, offers a compromise, a way out of the dilemma. Indications from the business world are variable – some are rejecting this proposal, while others have a very open mind about it. I have endeavoured simply to use this proposal to reduce to some extent the inhibitions that businesses have, and I hope that they will participate in the development company. In so far, I hope for broad support tomorrow. Unfortunately, I cannot support the European People's Party's proposals, which date back to the Commission proposal and thus, in my opinion, give industry another argument against joining in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Radwan, in his capacity as your shadow rapporteur, will further enlarge on the PPE proposal that you feel unable to support.</p>
<p class="contents">Having its own satellite navigation system has been one of Europe's concerns for many years now, but it exists only as an aspiration. No decision on it has as yet been reached. It is in connection with Galileo, of all things, that everything is weighed in the balance a thousand times over, every euro is examined closely, whereas in other areas the European purse-strings are much looser. What I reproach the Member States for is the way they delay and defer, hang back and hesitate, and that is what could stick in the minds of Europe's citizens. That is also what Europe's image threatens to become if we are not careful.</p>
<p class="contents">I, however, want Europe to be modern, technologically on the ball, quite literally the worldwide Number One. This is where Europe can play its trump cards – economic strength, a talent for innovation, technological capacity and vision. I do not want to make apocalyptic predictions, but I am convinced that, without Galileo, Europe could completely lose its position in an important sector and will fall back so far that it will, at the end of the day, be quite impossible for it to catch up. If we do not manage to get Galileo started and at last open the doors to new technologies, if we do not manage to make the necessary funds available, then we will become a laughing-stock across the world, and in outer space as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I telling you this? We need now, at last, a resounding ‘yes’ to Galileo and a competitive alternative to GPS! The Council wanted industry involved in Galileo as early as possible. The Commission submitted a proposal which Parliament put to the acid test, and which received – and still receives – severe criticism from different sides, and I do think there were omissions on the Commission's side as well. Our Committees have identified a number of problem areas. Industry involvement in the Joint Undertaking – whether direct or via the development company – must not, though, be made so hard to reach that Galileo's failure becomes a possible result. Europe needs Galileo, or, as the Commission puts it in its information note, Galileo is indispensable to Europe. That is why I hope Parliament will speak with a clear voice and that there will be a large majority tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has presented a proposal for the setting-up of a Joint Undertaking to complete the development phase of Galileo; this would provide a single management structure with legal personality which would be flexible and capable of concluding the necessary contracts. The founding members would be the Commission and the European Space Agency, which would contribute a maximum of EUR 520 million and EUR 550 million respectively. The European Investment Bank and any private company providing a minimum sum of EUR 20 million could be further members. The cost of this phase is estimated at EUR 1.1 billion, to be split equally between the European Community and the European Space Agency, with an extra EUR 200 million coming from the private sector, pledged through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in March 2001 by representatives of the main industries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community’s financial contribution will come from two budget lines: from B5-700 – Trans-European Networks – and from a token entry under the B6 Research chapter pending a final decision on the 6th Framework Programme. Out of the amount financed by the European Space Agency, EUR 50 million would be paid in cash and EUR 500 million in kind, as stated in the European Space Agency’s Statutes.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tabled two amendments in my opinion: the first concerns the possible future participation of the candidate countries in the development phase of Galileo, as called for by Parliament in its resolution of 3 October 2001. I have called for instruments to be identified in the budget which will allow them to participate, not least in order to avoid further widening the existing gap. The second amendment concerns the role to be conferred on the Budgetary Authority; I therefore call upon the Commission to inform it on a regular basis on the implementation of the development phase of Galileo, and for the annual report on the activities of the Joint Undertaking to be sent to Parliament and the Council and not only to the Court of Auditors as proposed by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All of one mind, we are on track to make Galileo a reality. I would also like to start by thanking the Commissioner, who repeatedly and doggedly pleads, and indeed fights, for Galileo at Council level.</p>
<p class="contents">Economically, technologically and politically, Galileo is a strategic project for the future. That has already been said several times. Here in Europe, we should remember how it was explained to us decades ago that we did not need the Airbus, we did not need a missile industry. They would do all that for us, and it would be for the best. Where would we be today if, for example, we had not developed the Airbus ourselves?</p>
<p class="contents">Now, though, I have two practical observations on Mr Glante's report. I consider it essential that industry should today already be actively involved in Galileo. There is no use in describing Galileo's importance in fine words; we need industry to make a clear commitment to Galileo. We must make a start right now on developing services to get products onto the markets of the future, products which would enable Galileo to be self-financing, which is what both sides of this House want: hence we need absolutely clear support for the Commission proposal to this end. We should, though, perhaps give thought to some reduction in the ‘front-loading’.</p>
<p class="contents">I see Galileo's political dimension as a second important point. We want Europe to have a common foreign and security policy. We have the Rapid Reaction Force, and we want, in the future, to send our soldiers to troublespots. Here, too, we need to assume responsibility for our soldiers, which means that we have information systems of our own and are no longer dependent on third countries. What this means is that Galileo is, to some extent, necessary if we are to grow up in the way we approach external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow should, therefore, see Parliament send a clear demand, for the sake of Europe's future, that the Council should decide in favour of Galileo!</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, we propose, as an alternative, that, if the Council proves to be Galileo's undoing, we might well have to have thoughts about the defence budgets, and I am very definitely of the opinion that it is our primary duty to ensure that Galileo remains a civilian product. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that divisive forces have also been at work in the European Parliament, but I am convinced, from what I have heard, that they will not succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, however we vote on the amendments, tomorrow’s vote will be an overall majority in favour of the Galileo report. The most important thing is that Parliament does not become divided, and that it continues to show its support for Mrs de Palacio and the Commission on this extremely important project. We cannot merely focus on accounting and notarial-oriented matters when discussing a subject of this importance, when the Americans are pouring millions of dollars into their aerospace and space industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We are today facing the acid test. Either the European Union is capable of launching a space programme as modest as Galileo, forty years after the daring innovations of Airbus and Ariane, or – as some Members who are sitting on other benches have said – we show that we are incapable of doing this. If we have to show that we are incapable of this, I do not want Parliament to take any responsibility for this and I hope that the Commission and Parliament will, in future, display a united front when showing the Council what its responsibilities are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not a question of deciding whether or not to approve the Galileo project. This has already been decided in the report by Mrs Langenhagen, as she herself has just pointed out, and I myself gave a favourable opinion on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Our objective is now to decide how to manage the project’s development phase. We agree with the rapporteur’s proposal to create a Joint Undertaking whose shareholders would be the European Union and the ESA, an undertaking which would be dissolved once the development phase is completed. We also agree with his proposal to create, alongside that, a development company in which the private sector will participate. It will enable conflicts of interest to be avoided whilst drafting the specification and the tendering procedure during the deployment phase. The Undertaking will not therefore be judge and judged.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not believe that the proposed monitoring committee will serve a useful purpose, since the Member States are already represented in the Joint Undertaking. However, we are in favour of setting up a committee with an ethical purpose, whose opinions will be consulted and which will ensure that Galileo is used properly and in accordance with the principles laid down by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we do not agree with the amendments tabled by Mr Radwan, which reintroduce the concept of Galileo being used for military applications, even occasionally, on the pretext that this could be done for humanitarian ends. If this amendment received a favourable vote, we could not vote for the report thus amended.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, if the use of Galileo for military applications is not reintroduced by any means whatsoever, we will vote in favour of the report by Mr Glante, in its current form, unless the monitoring committee concerned, which we recommended setting up in the first report, does not have an ethical purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We recognise the case for a complementary and alternative satellite radio navigation system. We recognise the importance of maintaining European technological capability for space activity. We welcome the emphasis on a civil project intended ultimately to be commercially viable in a number of fields such as communications and Earth observation, as well as position – finding. The difficulty lies in determining how to fund a venture until it becomes self-financing, particularly in view of the large sums of upfront investments required. We want to see industry fully involved in the planning, specifications and preparatory stages to ensure a better chance of technical success. That is why we have reintroduced amendments to lower the entrance fee for business to be part of the Joint Undertaking. We see no particular merit in the proposal for a development company at this stage which duplicates the Joint Undertaking structures. We are mindful of the difficulties of funding such a large-value infrastructures project solely from the private sector, which is why we have put forward the amendment enabling some funding to come from defence budgets provided it is used only for peacekeeping purposes. This merely supports the comments made in Annex 1 of the Commission's own information note concerning strategic considerations. In closing I would say that it is a great pleasure to be here as the other half of "les deux gilles ciel et espace" club, with my colleague, Mr Savary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank Mr Savary and Mr Chichester, the whole of the Sky and Space team and all the MEPs who backed a document supporting the Galileo programme with a view to the European Council at Laeken. Unfortunately, we were not able to achieve it on that particular occasion, but we hope to do so next time. We must not be discouraged and we still have time, although not much, to try finally to move ahead with a project which seems to me absolutely crucial to Europe and which furthermore is going to be a measure of Europe’s real will to have a presence on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I will just focus on three aspects which have been referred to here in relation to the report. We all feel that the participation of the private sector is crucial. Our differences lie in how and from when, if I have understood correctly. I wish to say in this respect – as Mr Savary and Mrs Langenhagen have said – that, regardless of the result of the amendments relating to Mr Glante’s report, I hope that the report, in the form it takes after the amendments or without them, has the greatest possible support, regardless of my preferences for one formula or another.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the private sector should be incorporated from the outset, not only because of the limited funds which it is going to provide during the development phase of 2002 to 2005, but because in the medium term it falls to that sector to contribute substantially during the following phase, not only in the implementation phase, but also in the operative phase.</p>
<p class="contents">The substantial increase in the financial participation of the private sector is an essential condition if we are to achieve, within the framework of the future financial perspectives, the necessary public funding in the latter phases. The participation of the private sector should not be improvised, but rather it should be prepared from now, and that was expressed in the resolution of the Council of Ministers in April of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal, which is being presented today, simply puts this principle into practice. It is true that there is a suggestion, raised by Mr Glante, which replaces that direct participation with the creation of a Joint Undertaking, with the creation of a promotion company in parallel with the Joint Undertaking, which does not seem sufficient to us, as I have pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that participation must take place within the undertaking and furthermore that there is a clear will, not only in the space sector, but also in the applications sector, to go ahead with this phase, with this public or private participation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that, by participating in the capital of the Joint Undertaking, industry is now beginning to accept a minimal risk, and I think that is appropriate, because it must also participate in the final definitions of the architecture of the whole system.</p>
<p class="contents">Some in the Council and in Parliament fear that conflicts of interest may arise. In my opinion, these days, national legislations provide formulae which prevent this type of conflict of interests.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said on previous occasions, we are giving aid and funding programmes, while there is a bank acting as financial adviser on the aid, while, linked to that bank, there is a non-governmental organisation, which carries out the programme and while, also related to that bank, there is a study group which is assessing the reality of the programme. And we say that all of that is correct and that there are sufficient barriers to guarantee that a conflict of interests is not possible. I believe that, in this case, there are even more concrete and clear ways, the famous Great wall of China, which would allow us to prevent this type of problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 9 of the Statutes says that, in the proposal we are making, in the field of contracting, the executive committee must act totally independently from the management board in which the companies participating in the Joint Undertaking would be represented, that is to say that the executive committee acts independently of the companies which may participate in tenders. To prevent concerns, there are formulae which may offer greater guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the role of the States of the Union, we fully agree with the approach taken in the report by Mr Glante, that is, the creation of a monitoring committee made up of representatives of the Member States, so that those States may closely and continuously monitor the activities of the Joint Undertaking. We have therefore proposed to the Council, and they have approved it, that in the Regulation, not in the statutes of the Joint Undertaking, but in the Regulation, a monitoring council should be established made up of representatives of the States. This council should meet before each meeting of the management board of the Joint Undertaking to offer its opinion on the positions the Commission intends to advocate in relation to the different points on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">These operating rules seem to us to be the most appropriate for achieving our objective, since they maintain the operating autonomy of the undertaking while allowing the States to control the activities of the Commission, which represents the European Community on the management board of the Joint Undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the military dimension, ladies and gentlemen, I will say that Galileo is a system designed for civil purposes, which will have to be managed by civilians and that, furthermore, that is one of its essential differences when compared to the GPS. Having said that, it is true that there is a service reserved for public administrations, which is intended for applications such as fire services and security, which at certain times can be used for other purposes, but at the moment the open GPS is being used for certain applications and for certain military uses. It is inevitable that they will carry equipment which is synchronised with Galileo.</p>
<p class="contents">By this, ladies and gentlemen, I mean firstly that this type of system always has a double use. Secondly, as you know, there is a free access signal, which is totally free of charge, and another access signal, pre-paid, with services, codified, but which is also free. And a third signal is reserved for the public sector, but – I insist – is intended not for military uses but for civilian uses such as those I have indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in relation to Galileo, all the elements for taking a decision are on the table in the Council of Ministers, and the funding for the whole of the development phase, without any State of the Union having to give a single euro more in order to implement the project. We must make it clear that the current financial perspectives cover the whole of the development phase of Galileo. No State should have to put in another additional euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Galileo is essential to European industry, to technological capacity, to European space technology, but also for a series of other factors, such as autonomy, sovereignty and the capacity to offer an alternative service to GPS, which would strengthen the latter, since, as we have often said, Galileo will be and should always be, compatible with the GPS, both should be mutually strengthened, and, in the event of the failure of either of them, the other should serve as an alternative for all users.</p>
<p class="contents">It only remains for us to see whether or not there is political will and I believe that this is one of those occasions which will demonstrate whether or not there is political will to move towards a Europe which counts in the world. The ball is in the Ministers’ court and we hope that they decide that there is that will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
