We must understand this. This is precisely why I understand and support the issue raised by the Chairman of our Committee on Fisheries, Mr Varela Suanzes­Carpegna. The truth of the matter is that the Morocco situation is an extremely important issue for many of us and it would be appropriate for the Commissioner to speak right at the beginning of the debate on this issue. I would say that, given the political importance of the Moroccan question, strict adherence to protocol on the agenda is of secondary importance.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, I am, of course, perfectly willing to start by making the requested statement on fisheries relations between the Union and Morocco. As you probably already know from the media, negotiations on a new form of collaboration in the fisheries sector were started with the Kingdom of Morocco following my visit to Casablanca in October, when the King of Morocco agreed to begin serious negotiations. As a result, a total of six rounds of technical negotiations took place between 30 October and 22 December.</p>
<p class="contents">I then met Prime Minister Youssoufi and Fisheries Minister Chbaatou for talks twice at the beginning of January – once for three days and once for two days. I took great pains to ensure that both sides understood the main aspects of future fisheries relations, especially with regard to fishing possibilities, the term of the agreement, technical fishing conditions and, most importantly, financial compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations were held nearly every day between the first and second political meetings this year, more recently at technical level. We have done a great deal of constructive work and numerous details have been clarified. The Commission has endeavoured throughout the negotiations to date to be as flexible as it feels it can be on Morocco's main demands, especially as regards the extent of fishing possibilities and compulsory landings in Moroccan ports.</p>
<p class="contents">We have stated from the start that we are prepared both to take account of Moroccan interests and to support the development of the Moroccan fisheries sector. We have also made clear time and again that we want to protect the Community's social and economic interests and are looking for help in preserving resources. Unfortunately, the Moroccan side suddenly took a very intransigent stance during my second visit on 8 and 9 January, especially on the important questions of fishing possibilities and technical terms, and made excessive demands for financial compensation. I tried to persuade the Moroccan side to reconsider its position, because an agreement was not on the cards on this basis, and I asked them to resume talks as quickly as possible in a bid to reach a final agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are prepared to pay a fair price for a balanced agreement, but the price must be in proportion to the fishing possibilities granted by Morocco and I have always clearly given the Moroccan side to understand as much. If our Moroccan partners are now prepared to return to the negotiating table and show willing to negotiate, then I am sure that, in the end, we shall broker a solution which is acceptable to both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that the question of cooperation with Morocco in the fisheries sector was one of the main points on the agenda for President Prodi's visit to Morocco, when both sides took the opportunity of reaffirming their wish to conclude an agreement. It was therefore agreed that we should resume negotiations at a technical level as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to thank Mr Fischler for his statement on the fisheries agreement with Morocco, and I also wish to thank him for all the effort he is putting into these difficult negotiations. We all knew they would be difficult and lengthy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you here, as he too has said, but I want to stress this, that it is the first time that a President of the European Commission has been personally involved in negotiating a fisheries agreement. It must be clear both to the citizens of the European Union and to Morocco that all the institutions in the European Union – and at the highest level – want this agreement: the European Council wants it, and it said so at Nice; the President of the Commission, who has been to Rabat, wants it; and the European Parliament in Strasbourg wants it.</p>
<p class="contents">So, for the time being, the one that does not want it, and I say for the time being, is Morocco, at least on the terms that the European Union is demanding. Let us hope that together we can soon manage to persuade them of the mutual benefits of this agreement and thus be able to associate President Prodi with this success. I just ask, Mr Fischler, that the negotiations be resumed as soon as possible – immediately if they can be – to make the most of the boost that the President of the European Commission himself has given them.</p>
<p class="contents">As has also been said here, I do not want Morocco to draw our attention away from the extremely important debate that we have here today. We have been summoned to debate four major reports to do with the common fisheries policy and its future. I am going to focus, naturally, on mine, the one for which I am the rapporteur, but first I should like to congratulate Mr Poignant and Mr Gallagher and also Mr Cunha on the magnificent job they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to point out in relation to the report for which I am the rapporteur that I think it is the first one that a Community institution has drawn up on globalisation in fisheries, and therefore I think our Committee has hit the nail on the head with the two own-initiative reports it has decided to produce; the other one is still in progress. In mine, in this report, what I want to stress is this: first of all, Commissioner, the fishing industry in the European Union must start to shake off this almost domestic or almost marginal image that it currently has, perhaps because of the fact that it is confined to peripheral regions or because of the coldness of the Community GDP contribution figures that are always being mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to recognise the global importance that fishing now has. We are becoming more and more dependent on imported fish; we have our own fleet on all the seas and we have enough technical knowledge of our own not to leave this strategic sector in the hands of third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2002 reform, therefore, must not serve just for us to carry on staring at our own navel in the form of our own Community waters, our own problems and our own misfortunes. What we really need is a fleet of the right size that is competitive at European and world levels. More competitive does not mean more predatory but simply more efficient at using the resources actually available, and doing this better than everyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">The fishing sector is now strategic – and will be more so in the future – as a food reserve: healthy and safe animal proteins for a growing human population. We must involve fisheries – and this is also shown by the fisheries agreement with Morocco – in the European Union’s foreign policy and commercial policy. Our Union’s foreign fisheries policy has to earn credibility and an image, which it does not yet have, standing before world public opinion as it really is: the policy of a fishing power as compliant as any other with the United Nations principles, that is, the development of the international law of the sea, the conservation of resources for all, cooperation for development, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore make it an active policy, both in fisheries agreements with third countries, adapted to each individual situation, and in the regional fishery organisations, in which we must play a leading role, as we have often said, and let us not resign ourselves to a situation in which the 15 states that today make up the European Union – tomorrow perhaps 20 or 25 – must forever have as much weight as, for instance, Estonia has now. The Council of Ministers of the European Union or the United Nations Security Council are examples to bear in mind of voting systems weighted by the specific weight of territories and populations, and we should bear this important example in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">My report states that the European Union has not yet woken up to the importance of its fishery concerns at an international level. Admittedly, as I said earlier, its relative importance to the Community GDP is small, but we must not forget that ours is the fourth largest fleet in the world. If we total up the processing and marketing industry, subsidiary industries, investment in other countries and specialised shipbuilding, EU fisheries-linked economic activity is the most substantial in the world. Other powers, like the United States and Japan, are aware of this and are investing in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In the World Trade Organisation we must not be afraid to stand up for our interests, and for our structural aid system too, since not all of it relates directly to fishing: some is aid for conserving and controlling resources, making vessels safer, improving fishery infrastructures and the selective arts of fishing. In the WTO we must demand the real liberalisation of port services, the freedom to invest and establish in third countries with full legal guarantees and freedom of access to ports. Let us denounce attempts to extend exclusive economic zones and lead the effective fight against flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">All this, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, is the real challenge facing the common fisheries policy from economic globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is today offering this report to which I refer as food for thought for everyone on the eve of an historic reform of the common fisheries policy, so that we can all be clear about where we are and where we have to get to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gallagher (UEN),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, Commissioner, at the outset I want to acknowledge the assistance which I received from the secretariat of the Committee on Fisheries and indeed from the secretariat of my own group in preparing this report. I want to thank Mr Poignant for his cooperation while producing my report.</p>
<p class="contents">Both myself and Mr Poignant had one major preoccupation – to make sure that our reports were not only complementary, but more importantly that they were not contradictory. After all they deal with the same subject, and I would like to think that the same spirit will prevail in the House when both reports are voted on tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the regulation establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture, the Commission is obliged to report at least every three years to Parliament, the Council and the Community bodies representing the sector on the implementation of measures and developments in the common fisheries policy. This report reviews the years 1996 to 1998. The timing of the present communication gives it a special significance in that it represents a bridge to the Green Paper to be published on the review of the common fisheries policy. Not only is this is an historical snapshot of the past, it is an important indication of the direction of Commission thinking about the future and shape of the CFP after 2002. This, of course, is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">The report covers all aspects of the CFP, including conservation and management of resources, structural policy, external fisheries policy, market policy and monitoring and control.</p>
<p class="contents">In the conclusions to its communication the Commission lists among its priorities: better coherence between the various objectives pursued by the CFP, such as conservation of resources, the economic efficiency of the fleet and securing employment in fisheries – dependent areas, taking account of the economic dimension of fisheries management, better integration of environmental and fisheries policy, improvement of management tools such as multi-annual management objectives and strategies, management of fishing effort, and full integration of the Mediterranean into the Community management regime, a more accountable decision-making process and maintaining the external dimension of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of these points can be endorsed by us, indeed as the Commission acknowledges, a number of these priorities are those which Parliament itself set and has long demanded. I would like to underline to you, as I have done in my report, a number of points that I feel strongly about. I regret the present unsatisfactory state of fish stocks in relation to technical conservation measures. I believe that more progress can still be made. In spite of initiatives taken by the Commission to strengthen its dialogue with the industry, I believe that these should be fully reinforced. I believe that fishermen must be more involved in the work of scientists in order to establish mutual confidence. I have strong suspicions that multi-annual programmes have operated in a discriminatory fashion without producing any major benefits to the fishing sector as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see a uniform inspection regime throughout the Community and the harmonisation of penalties for infringements. I want a strict enforcement of the Community control system with regard to third country vessels operating within EU waters. I am strongly in favour of a greater regionalisation of the common fisheries policy through the creation of a comprehensive series of regional management units and regional advisory committees based on the use of ICES areas and sub-areas to define the boundary lines. In this context, I want to stress that regionalisation of fisheries policy is not in any way the same as renationalisation or fisheries policy. It does, however, to use the Commission's own words, involve the participation of stakeholders, and I quote "in all the three phases of the management process i.e. consultation, decision-taking and implementation of decisions taken".</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the lack of cohesion in the regional application of the CFP must inevitably lead to a lack of confidence in the policy and in the Community institutions. I believe that it is necessary to define the application of the CFP in a clear and consistent manner, setting out a coherent system of regionalisation. I am convinced that this must entail such factors as closer links between fishermen, scientists, the recognition of the socio-economic factors in areas highly dependent on fisheries, flexibility and simplification. As I have done on so many occasions in the past, I repeat my call that in order to ensure an appropriate policy of decentralisation it is essential to maintain access to the territorial waters of 12 miles as the exclusive sovereign preserve of the coastal States and to extend this preserve to 24 miles, as previously agreed by this House in February 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">On a personal note I would point out that these last two issues are fundamental to my own country, Ireland. I believe that the utmost respect must be paid to the need for social, economic, regional cohesion, and that the highest priority must be given to the defence of the populations of regions highly dependent on fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to see the Commission review the application of relative stability so as to take better account of the need for economic, social and regional cohesion. There is no doubt in my mind that this must be done without calling into question the fundamental principle itself. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on his report. The fact that there are no amendments tabled is a clear indication that we can all agree on this text. I am pleased to say that all the ideas contained in my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Industry have been included in the report in one form or another. Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has outlined to us in detail the importance of the multi-functional role of the EU fisheries. This is something that must be taken into account in future WTO negotiations to ensure that EU producers are not put at a disadvantage. The Commission must come up with appropriate negotiation proposals. Unlike what was done in relation to agriculture, I would invite Mr Fischler to consult this House on the fisheries proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am pleased that Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has recognised the need to take into account social and economic factors, such as employment in coastal areas. This must be taken into consideration in the WTO talks and the review of the common fisheries policy, and I welcome the reference to an environmental and health food standard in Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna's report. I also want to congratulate my colleague Mr Cunha on his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been subject to intense and, at times, heated debate in committee, because it is one of the first reports, like those by Mr Gallagher, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and Mr Cunha, to force us to consider the common fisheries policy for 2002 rather than because it is crucial or likely to lead to decisions being made.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a sensitive subject, involving a sector with very specific characteristics and one which affects some quite typical and fairly limited regions in Europe. The activities of the sector usually generate a great many jobs both up and downstream, making many regions dependent on fisheries, with no easy alternatives to turn to in times of crisis. Everyone in these regions knows that 31 December 2002 will be crucial, since this is the deadline for the common fisheries policy, as in 1992 and 1982, as if we produced a new one every 10 years.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to forming as rounded an opinion as possible in order to prepare for this deadline, which I believe was a good idea, the Commission organised a systematic consultation process involving everyone associated or involved with this activity, sending out questionnaires and arranging meetings. Thirty meetings were held, attended by nearly 1 500 people.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the form of proceedings, the method of the report was discussed. Some Members would have preferred not to examine the subject in too much depth. We debated the matter at great length within the parliamentary committee and, in the end, the Committee on Fisheries went along with the opinion of the rapporteur – as, in my view, there really was no other option – with everyone able to argue their own corner on the subject, just as usual. With regard to the substance, however, national and even regional differences within the Member States were seen to be more intense than the rather traditional political differences, and that is why a number of amendments were tabled. These amendments show that, although the original positions were sometimes far apart, the political debate allowed groups to be reconciled, leading to an open-minded text which provides a sound starting point, along with the other reports, from which to undertake the reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the amendments and more generally, most of the provisions voted on in committee adopt the rapporteur’s point of view, with some additional specification or clarification. A Green Paper is due to be issued in the coming months – at the end of March of this year, I believe – followed by the legislative text in the course of 2002. At the moment, two main schools of thought are discernible. The first would like to see a thorough re-evaluation of the entire system and all the foundations, past and present, of the common fisheries policy. The second, while avoiding a complete re-examination of the existing foundations, would like to see the system clarified, amended and improved so that the fisheries sector can develop while, of course, preserving fish resources. Quite obviously, the European fisheries sector has to deal with the problems that most other fishing industries throughout the world are currently experiencing. They do not affect just our continent or our waters. Overfishing reduces stocks, catch sizes and revenue, and is the main threat as far as the future of resources and the fishing industry proper are concerned. Increased competition, associated with the globalisation of the market in fishery products, is a further problem.</p>
<p class="contents">If the fisheries industry is to become more competitive, it will depend on the sector’s ability to adapt in order to face up to the constraints imposed by both the state of its resources and by commercial demand. The common fisheries policy is the European Union’s management tool for regenerating the fisheries industry and aquaculture. This policy was drawn up in order to manage a common resource and to respect the commitments laid down in the first European Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, therefore, expresses views on the four aspects of the common fisheries policy, which are conservation and management of resources, structural policy, market organisation and relations with third countries. Review of the main areas of the Union’s fisheries policy is called for throughout. That is the guiding principle. The precautionary principle, the latest thing, so to speak, is clearly included, as is the commitment to developing a responsible fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I would like to highlight some suggestions, especially maintaining the <span class="italic">status quo</span> position on the 6/12-mile zone; maintaining boxes after scientific checks have been carried out along with, inevitably, the issue of access to the North Sea, which will be more difficult in view of our enlargement plans; maintaining the system of TACs and quotas, on condition that they be reviewed; vigilance regarding individual transferable quotas and a thorough review of the Multiannual Guidance Programmes; harmonising inspections and infringements and, of course, committing to fisheries agreements and action programmes specifically designed for the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by adding, as Mr Gallagher said, that we do not wish to see regionalisation become renationalisation nor do we wish for further social measures to be introduced into the common fisheries policy. Perhaps Mr Gallagher and I have given the impression that we are repeating ourselves. Politics involves repeating oneself and contradicting oneself. We have opted to repeat ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to warmly congratulate Commissioner Fischler for the commitment he has demonstrated in the negotiations to renew the fishing agreement with Morocco, but these thanks should also go to the Commission's entire Directorate-General for Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">From the start of the negotiations we were faced with intransigence on the part of the Moroccan negotiators, who presented arguments such as “the sustainability of fishing stocks” to reduce access for the European Union’s fishing fleet. However, we know that these were not the real arguments, since they did not apply the same criteria to other third countries with which they concluded agreements nor to private agreements with various operators, including some from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance of the agreement with Morocco to the European Union’s fishing industry, this issue should have immediately been raised as a matter of great political priority within the European Council itself, in the Foreign Affairs Council and, of course, in the Fisheries Council. My impression is that Commissioner Fischler and his staff stood practically alone in this struggle, apart from one important but isolated speech by the President of the Commission. It is incomprehensible, given that the European Union is home to so many millions of Moroccans and that we have provided that country with so many trade concessions to ensure its products access to our market, that they should have reciprocated our openness and cooperation so little. This meant that the Community authorities at the highest level had major political trump cards to play, with the help of those Member States most closely concerned. We see now, however, that these cards were not played. Why was this the case? In time we will see why, but in any event, I fervently hope that we can rapidly negotiate a reasonable agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now proceed to the subject of my report, which is Guinea­Bissau. The protocol governing fishing arrangements between the European Union and the Republic of Guinea­Bissau was signed in June 1997 and came into force in December of that year, remaining valid until June this year. Following an armed conflict in that country in 1998, the Commission presented to the Council and Parliament a proposal for a decision requesting that this agreement be suspended. Parliament’s Girão Pereira report, at the beginning of 1999, considered the Commission’s proposal to be justified and legitimate and delivered a favourable opinion. Parliament thereby authorised the suspension of the agreement for the duration of hostilities, after which the suspension would be lifted and the Government of Guinea­Bissau would be given help for <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> support actions for the local fishing industry, for infrastructure and for monitoring activities.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of certain procedural and legal problems raised by a previous Commission proposal, the Commission is now tabling a new proposal. The purpose of this new text, as with the previous one, but using a different legal formula, is to grant the legitimate authorities of Guinea­Bissau a sum equivalent to the unpaid part of the financial compensation laid down in the agreement currently in force, which totals around EUR 6.5 million and which is intended solely for supporting local fishing activities, for improving monitoring measures and for reconstructing fisheries infrastructure damaged in the intervening period.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of a programme of actions proposed by the Government of Guinea-Bissau, the Commission will pay over 50% of the compensation that has been provided for and will pay the balance when the government of that country has submitted a detailed report on the progress of the actions it has proposed and the results that have been achieved. This report is due to be submitted to the Commission by 31 May 2001. The date for payment may, however, have to be postponed if major problems are encountered in the organisation of Guinea-Bissau’s administration, that is, its government, following this armed conflict. Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries has therefore approved the date of 31 May 2003 as the final deadline for the processing of payments instead of the initial proposal of May 2001. Therefore, given that the Commission’s proposal is basically the same as the one to which we gave our assent in March 1999, given that the amount of money stipulated is exactly the same and given that the proposal has precise objectives, I, as rapporteur, feel that Parliament should deliver a favourable opinion on this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It gives me special pleasure, Commissioner Fischler, to be able to welcome you here today. For a long time, fisheries debates were held in Strasbourg on Fridays. This year we have done away with Fridays and brought the debate forward to Tuesday, and while many Members are still not listening to us today, you at least are here and I thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The new year is a time of hope and expectation, especially for our fishermen. I need only mention the reform of the common fisheries policy and the Commission's eagerly awaited Green Paper. However, I am forced to admit that the worry lines on my fellow Members' brows and – as far as I can see from here, on your brow, too, Mr Fischler – are still as deep as ever.</p>
<p class="contents">One reason must surely be the continuing and difficult negotiations on the fisheries agreement with Morocco. I am afraid that there is still no light at the end of that particular tunnel. The Commission's cautious and diplomatic approach – if I may express it thus – be it on your part, Mr Fischler, or on the part of Commission President Prodi, has met with little response and hence no real progress on the other side – I am tempted to say the opposing side. I think that is a crying shame because I want an agreement although, let there be no mistake, I do not want an agreement at any price.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial framework is limited and EU payments must be in proportion to the benefits granted in return. In the final analysis, the Kingdom of Morocco needs to take a realistic and trustworthy approach. Otherwise, Morocco's obstructionist stance hitherto may well come back to haunt it, because fisheries are not the only link between Morocco and the EU. The EU should not be the bull in diplomacy's china shop, but nor should it merely be an irritating fly buzzing around.</p>
<p class="contents">The next round of financial compensation for Spanish and Portuguese fishermen is coming up. It really is time we started thinking about and naming alternatives, however drastic they may be, because aid cannot and should not be a permanent solution. We are looking forward, at last, to taking a closer look at the study on the cost-benefit analysis of the fisheries agreement and drawing the necessary conclusions. Mr Gallagher addresses this particular point in his report. We had an initial presentation an awfully long time ago and after that mum was the word. But we must watch out – it could be the calm before the storm, because there is every sign of a storm brewing.</p>
<p class="contents">But first I should like to thank Pat Gallagher for his excellent report. As one of our most active comrades-in arms in the Committee on Fisheries, he has yet again done a creditable job. There really is no longer any need to make a point of stressing just how important an analysis of measures and developments is, especially in view of the reform of the entire fisheries policy. But just what will the Commission's long-awaited Green Paper propose? The objective – on this we are clear – must be to reconcile the need to improve fish stocks with the social and economic importance of fisheries, in which case it is vital for interest groups to be more involved and, given the considerable shortcomings now coming to light in the agricultural sector alone, for example as the result of BSE, it also means finding a new, attractive way of marketing fish as a healthy, protein-rich food.</p>
<p class="contents">As I am sure you are all aware, a huge programme of work awaits us. I am looking forward to a stimulating and controversial debate in the interest of the future of European fisheries. In any case, I think we should not slacken in our efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I thank Mr Fischler for having come before this House. He is here because, at the Conference of Presidents, the Group of the Party of European Socialists asked him to come. May I remind you, Commissioner, that in October 1999, a month before the agreement expired, you said here that you “would do everything in your power to find a solution” and that you “would get your feet wet”. Fourteen months later it is the Community fleet that is getting wet, but the water is up to its neck. But I am not one to blame you. I believe you have done what it was within your power to do, which really was very little. The problem for me is that there has not been a concerted effort by the various Commission services, and there has not been enough political pressure from the Council, and what is worse, in my opinion, is that there has been no clear thinking, skill or hard work in parallel by the government of the country most affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Varela, I believe Mr Prodi’s visit – which I think was very positive – rather than reassuring the sector has made it more worried, precisely because of the moment in the process when it took place. Such are the doubts and vacillations that the sector feels at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The sector keeps on repeating that it does not want an agreement at just any price, and it is afraid that an agreement will be signed just to save face. The sector says that what the Moroccans are offering – the technical conditions that they want the Community fleet to submit to – is unacceptable, and there are a number of limitations on freezer trawlers and shrimp vessels that are unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Moroccan authorities need a clear message from the Union. The Union would like to have fair cooperation with its partners, and now we all realise that we would have gained a lot if the Moroccan Government had responded in time to Community appeals. It is unacceptable that for 14 months the Moroccan Government repeated that it did not want an agreement, and now they are trying to blame you, Mr Fischler, for the failure to conclude one and for the negotiations having broken down. The result will be that the next Austrians – like yourself – or Swedes who negotiate in Rabat will think that what the Moroccans want is exactly the opposite of what they are thinking or saying.</p>
<p class="contents">This whole absurd process, which has been going on now for 14 months, is not having any positive effects for one simple reason: because in certain sectors in the Union it is generating a rejection of the European Union itself. Here we spend days on end discussing the Union’s democratic deficit and good governance, and then, when we have a subject on our hands that directly affects more than 4 000 fishermen, we pretend not to see what is obvious and not to do what any government would do to stand up for such an important part of its productive fabric. There are some who say that President Prodi should have blocked not just fisheries cooperation but the whole MEDA II programme.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Poignant and Gallagher reports, which bring forward many points for debate on the forthcoming reform of the CFP, I think that if a number of amendments are approved we shall be able to achieve two balanced resolutions and correct some contradictions. But a balanced agreement – such as the one we should reach on the Green Paper – does not mean that it is a compromise between various extreme positions but rather a coherent report endorsing the future of the whole sector and the viability of fishing as an economic activity throughout the European Union. The balance that we socialists desire can only be achieved through a fisheries policy based on scientific criteria and adapted to the market, with the suppression of the political discrimination that still persists.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform process must be participatory, in the words of Mr Poignant, whom I congratulate on his work, performed under difficult conditions. His report reveals many of the problems that we are going to have to discuss during the process of reforming the common fisheries policy. He has supplied many solutions, for instance the socio-economic aspect of fishing, the development of the social aspects of the CFP, and the updating of criteria that define regions as fishery-dependent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Gallagher report is also interesting in that it refers to social aspects or regards agreements with third countries as a fundamental part of the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">We are requesting clear legal and scientific opinions on access restrictions. We believe that the reform of the CFP should not contain any discriminatory element whether political or based on nationality. Our amendments support keeping the current 6/12 mile zone.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to congratulate Mr Varela – and also Mr Cunha – for the excellent report on the challenge of globalisation and the dangers that certain aspects of it pose for the Community fisheries sector. The international side of the CFP, our ever more necessary participation in multilateral organisations, is a challenge that still awaits us. This question is going to return and be debated many more times in this House. I congratulate Mr Varela on his political foresight, which could almost be called poetic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I speak specifically of the issue of regional management of the common fisheries policy. In fact the term zonal management better expresses the kind of development that we would like to see implemented. This would involve much fuller participation in decision making by all those with a direct interest in each of the ICES divisions, whether engaged in fishing, fish processing, science or conservation. If such a system were already in place we would not be facing the difficulties we face at present over the Commission's proposals for a cod recovery plan for the North Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the clear view of those most directly involved that, as initially announced, the plan would have both a disastrous effect on the industries concerned and an adverse effect on cod stocks, and this view is supported by conservationists.</p>
<p class="contents">The Scottish MEPs are most grateful to the Commissioner for meeting us and for his assurances that these proposals are not yet firm ones. A great deal of work has been done locally, both in Scotland and around the North Sea, on conservation measures in general and on cod recovery in particular. I hope that the Commission will take the results of this work very seriously indeed. In particular, I would ask it to abandon the idea of requiring 140 mm mesh size and also to recognise the extent to which the Scottish fleet depends on a mixed fishery. Accordingly, instead of imposing blanket restrictions on some 15 000 square miles of the North Sea, I trust that it will opt for seasonal closures in areas where the cod concentration is high. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hudghton (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Commissioner, it was inevitable that the Gallagher and Poignant reports would not only comment on the past but would focus in detail on the CFP review, and I consider it entirely appropriate that the MEPs should seek to influence the review process in advance of any formal consultation with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I contend that the principal objective of the CFP, namely the conservation of fish stocks, has not been realised and as a result we have had to face dramatic year-on-year fluctuations in quotas, as exemplified by the current cod crisis. In addition, we must re-examine the process by which, and the level at which, decisions are made. Various amendments tabled with my name attached seek to establish certain important principles for the CFP review, including that relative stability should remain since the good reasons for its inclusion as a founding principle remain valid. That in the light of experience with areas like the Shetland Box, specially protected areas based on scientific advice should continue in the future. And a system of zonal management should be established based on the ICES areas and with representation from fishing, science and conservation interests able to participate meaningfully, not to renationalise the CFP, not to take away power from the Council or the Commission but to allow each Member State with quotas in a particular zone to assist in devising and recommending controls which are relevant, appropriate to these areas and, therefore, more likely to succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events have led to even greater lack of faith within Scotland in the decision-making processes and in the structure of the CFP itself. How can, for example, the Commission justify continuing levels of industrial fishery and even increases in white fish by-catch while on the other hand reducing quotas of fish for human consumption?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us use the opportunities arising from the review of the CFP to achieve a solution which works. I challenge the Commission and the Council to look seriously at zonal management within a framework of Community-wide objectives, of course, but so that interested parties can participate more fully and so that the new CFP, once agreed, can actually achieve its purpose, namely the long-term sustainability of European fisheries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is that the amendments emphasised this view, and generally in some respects they have even come to approve contradictory points. I hope that in tomorrow’s votes these issues may be calmly corrected, because my group would like to vote for both these reports.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the matter of fisheries and globalisation, it must be recognised that the low level of Community self-sufficiency in fisheries products has encouraged the liberalisation of trade sooner and more fully than in other sectors. While the nature of fishing itself, the growing nationalisation of fisheries or other circumstances may have their own particular features, they also have effects similar to those of globalisation and can have an especially hard social impact, with sometimes serious effects on working conditions or the displacement of fishery-related activities. I think the excellent Varela report points out corrective measures for these negative effects. I should also like to congratulate Mr Cunha.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of Morocco I want to point out two things: first, the negative effects that the lack of agreement is having and will have in disadvantaged areas of the Community both on the fishermen themselves and on fishery-related dependent activities. Because they are disadvantaged areas, restructuring activities stand very little chance of success.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that the attitude of the Moroccan negotiators hardly squares with that of a state linked with us through an association agreement. In this situation it is to be hoped that the Commission will be able to make the Moroccan authorities understand that the association can only be based on reciprocity, and that, if necessary, it will be able to adopt suitable measures. What the media is saying is that if there is agreement, it may even be highly detrimental to the interests of the European Union. I should like there to be an agreement, and I hope the Commission will be able to assert its right to reciprocity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that this should be considered in the reform to be initiated in 2002, since it concerns the situation of fishing in the outermost regions. It is also important that the common fisheries policy should take account of the amendment made in the Treaty of Amsterdam and highlight the potential that flows from their situation. This applies particularly to Portugal, with its outermost regions, the Azores and Madeira, but also to the French and Spanish outermost regions. The European Union has an opportunity to draw up an exclusive economic zone in these particularly less-favoured regions, and this strategic value in this field must be emphasised for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Morocco, we are grateful for the information that the Commissioner has just given us, although for the Portuguese this is scant consolation. The situation in Portugal is that 40 boats have remained inactive since December 1999 and if the agreement is concluded one day, many of these businesses may by then have become unviable. I therefore support the remarks made by Arlindo Cunha and Rosa Miguélez Ramos to the effect that both the Council and the Commission must attempt to adopt a more dynamic approach in their dialogue with the Moroccan Government.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, we have maintained an attitude of prudent optimism towards the revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002. It is widely known that the view from Portugal is highly critical, because whereas fishing should be a source of employment, the Portuguese experience is that the common fisheries policy has been a source of unemployment. We hope that maintaining the quotas, which was decided on this year, is a first positive sign for the future. We are particularly interested in the fact that attention has been paid to the feeling of discrimination that has emerged from consultations held in recent years, and the fact that the problem of planning and development has been given due consideration. Lastly, as Mr Gallagher has pointed out, we would like to see an exclusion zone of 24 miles for coastal fishing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, Mr Gallagher and Mr Poignant have presented views in many cases contrary to the measures that the CFP should contain. We cannot fail to recognise the effort that has been made <span class="italic">a posteriori</span> to try to unify viewpoints, but the European People’s Party believes that in some fundamental areas there are still some clear contradictions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore tabled a series of amendments above all to try to eliminate the impression that Parliament does not have a definite attitude towards the future of the CFP, because that is not the case. It may be that we do not agree on specific measures, but if something comes out of these reports it is that Parliament is in total agreement with the fisheries sector in that the CFP requires some fundamental changes. I therefore ask for our amendments to be approved, because far from entering yet again into sterile discussions they reflect this desire for change and the need for careful thinking about the fisheries policy, with our sights set on the future and not the past.</p>
<p class="contents">If there were no clear need for this, the Council of Ministers last month would have given some indication that this were the case. Things cannot go on like this. The fundamental flaws that have encumbered the CFP since the beginning have to be paid for by the industry at the end of every year with a series of increasingly brutal cuts to its operations. When you come to the extremes that have been reached this year, you have to wonder what economic sector could survive with these rules of play. If resource levels are getting worse and worse, it is because a sequence of failures in the policy that governs fishing not only allows it to happen but actually causes it. A sector constrained by a series of outdated, contradictory and often incomprehensible rules can only have very limited responsibility in this state of things, and yet it alone has to pay the price.</p>
<p class="contents">The CFP is in need of very far-reaching changes that will provide solutions for a fishing industry which, unlike the rules which govern it and even despite them, has managed to survive and has done everything it can to evolve and continue to provide coastal regions with wealth and jobs. That is why I must again stress that, when there is evident dissatisfaction with the resources policy, the brilliant results of which we have just seen yet again at December’s Council meeting, with a TAC system that encourages discards, when issues such as relative stability and freedom of access have yet to be resolved, not to mention the matter of bringing the only Community policy that still discriminates on grounds of nationality into line with the Treaties, the Commission cannot seriously propose a draft Green Paper like the one it has drawn up. If the Commission really believes that the future of European fisheries depends not on the simple modification of a regulation, but on the proposal of measures already contained in current regulations, if the Commission’s great proposal and great discovery for the future CFP is to be multiannual TACs and the encouragement of aquaculture, perhaps the moment has come, Mr President, to ask in all seriousness for it to make room for other people who can bring in new ideas and the tiniest sense of responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Candal (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, very briefly and concisely, to make three observations on the planned revision of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point concerns access to waters and to internal resources. Maintaining the traditional activities of every fishing community should be one of the European Union’s main concerns. I therefore feel that it is crucial to at least preserve exclusive access to so-called “territorial waters”, particularly given that activities involving small-scale fishing have a considerable effect on the coastal resources of every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to the principle of relative stability and the full use of fishing rights obtained outside Community waters. The principle of relative stability is a fundamental pillar of the common fisheries policy. However, the application of this principle to fishing quotas obtained by the European Union through financial compensation, either in agreements with third countries or in waters governed by regional fishing organisations, may lead to perverse situations. For example, the Community is not taking full advantage of the quotas that it obtained with such difficulty in the waters of some third countries, even though there are Member States keen to use them. Therefore, although the so-called agreements “with southern countries” lay down that once Member States have made use of their respective fishing rights, the unused part should be made available to all interested Member States, this mechanism is not implemented under the so-called agreements “with northern countries”.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is not making full use of the fishing quotas for the open sea that it has obtained through regional fishing organisations, even though there are Member States that are keen to take over the quantities that are not caught by the “highest bidders”, as they are called. They are thus exposing themselves to the risk that their share will be reduced once a review of quotas allocated to the parties involved takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to the role of the European Union on the international stage. Since the Union as a whole is a world-class fishing power and one of the largest markets for fish produce, it must claim and adopt a role that matches its importance in international organisations and specifically in regional fishing organisations. I am very grateful for the Commissioner’s speech and I urge him to use the power of all 15 Member States in negotiations with Morocco and not simply to argue the case for Portugal and Spain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is due, at least in part, to the conflicting nature of some of the objectives of the CFP as laid down in Regulation 3760/92.</p>
<p class="contents">It is impossible to simultaneously satisfy both the market and industry while conserving resources. When the CFP is revised next year it is essential that the conservation of fish stocks and the protection of the marine habitat be made its primary and overriding objective, and the only way to do this is to implement a rigorous and comprehensive precautionary approach to fisheries management. The precautionary approach should mean that before any stock can be fished on a commercial basis there must be, at the very least, a scientific assessment of the stock and a conservatively-based total allowable catch.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the current pillage of certain types, certain deep-water stocks by some EU countries would not be allowed to happen. It means that any new fishing gear or any significant modification of existing gear must be evaluated for its potential impact on the target stock as well as any species caught as by-catch or any impact on the marine habitat. It means being conservative when one decides the level at which one wants to maintain a fish stock. The use of maximum sustainable yield or any of a number of other reference points is quite simply wrong, for they lead to over-fishing and stock collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">Targets and limited reference points must be established which will maintain the fish stock at a high enough level that the risk of stock depletion or collapse is insignificant. The best definition to date of the precautionary approach is the one contained in the UN fish stocks agreement, and many of these and other principles are defined there. The EU has accepted these ideas for some stocks and I think it is high time that it implemented them for its own stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of things have been said already about Morocco and I just want to say that we would insist that it is entirely up to Morocco, as a coastal state with sovereignty over its fish and its exclusive economic zone, to decide what it wishes to do with these resources. We are therefore opposed to any kind of political or economic pressure being brought to bear on Morocco in order to encourage it or to coerce it to sign an agreement with the European Union. Secondly, we are adamant that no potential agreement with Morocco should involve any access to waters of Western Sahara. We do not recognise Moroccan sovereignty there and so Morocco has no right whatsoever to discuss access to EU vessels there, nor for that matter has the EU any right to enter into such negotiations with Morocco or to allow EU flag vessels to go there as has happened in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, as has been confirmed at regional conferences, there is profound criticism of the common fisheries policy, both with regard to the TAC system and quotas and with regard to the system of Multiannual Guidance Programmes, which have led to discrimination and have not brought any major benefits to the industry. This makes it essential that Member States which have achieved their objectives should not be penalised through further reductions of their fishing effort whilst other countries have not achieved the objectives laid down in previous MAGPs.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also become clear that most of those working in the fishing industry harbour doubts about scientific opinions on the management and conservation of fish products, although they do not question the need to conserve species. What is needed, therefore, is a thorough review of the common fisheries policy, involving fishermen and other interested parties in the decision-making process, to ensure that their experience and knowledge can contribute to the creation of a more workable and realistic system. We need appropriate structural measures to guarantee the survival of communities dependent on fishing and socio-economic measures that improve the standard of living of fishermen, who must not suffer as a result of possible measures to protect species, as has happened to the sardine fishermen in the north of Portugal. </p>
<p class="contents">We must also take account of the specific nature of the outermost regions and it is particularly important, as the Gallagher report states, that we move towards extending the exclusion zone to 24 miles, which is, in fact, something on which Parliament has already taken a decision. With regard to current negotiations in the World Trade Organisation, it must be emphasised, as it is in the Varela Suanzes­Carpegna report, that Community fishing activity cannot be analysed from a purely economic angle based on trade in goods. Fishing in the European Union is multifunctional in nature; it contributes towards the integration of the social and economic fabric of coastal areas, representing a way of life and a factor for cohesion in large areas along our coastline, while at the same time guaranteeing food supply.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish, Mr President, to mention international fishing agreements, which have a fundamental role in supplying the European market by means of the European fishing fleet. What is of particular concern, however, is the information that we have received not only on the delay in the fishing agreements with Angola, but also on the difficulties in renewing the fishing agreement with Morocco. We need more than just a rehashed explanation. What we need is the adoption of measures that will guarantee the protection of fishermen and the rights of shipowners who are caught up in this situation, as is currently happening in Portugal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, it is of utmost importance that the Commission should actively involve the fisheries industry itself in the preparatory activities leading up to its decisions. When translating research results into catch restrictions, the Commission should not only take the advice of scientists, but also the fishermen. If not, imposing total allowed catches and quotas will meet with unnecessary resistance from them. Fishermen, especially in the Netherlands, recognise the benefit of catch restrictions, provided there is a good reason for them. A bad example is the recent catch restriction imposed on Dutch fishermen for plaice and sole, which will set them back EUR 35 million. This is a restriction which, according to the European Fisheries Council, is required in order to protect cod, whilst biologists claim that such recommendations were never made and that this was a political decision.</p>
<p class="contents">European fishermen are active in very different waters. This requires a regional approach which is entirely in compliance with the European Union’s principle of subsidiarity. That means that in the case of the Netherlands, it will develop the policy for the North Sea in conjunction with other North Sea countries. These countries will decide whether the fragile system of the North Sea can accommodate ships from other regions. If the Union insists on other ships having access to the North Sea, the quoting of as yet unquoted fish species would be a real way of keeping additional catches of quoted fish within limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would echo rapporteur Gallagher in his request for a cost-benefit analysis of fisheries agreements which the Commission concludes with third countries. Do all Member States benefit proportionately from spending Community funding in this way? I doubt it very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we contemplate the radical reforms of the CFP, which are clearly necessary and long overdue and which are highlighted in these reports, we do so in the knowledge that fish stocks are in spiral decline. Too many fishermen are chasing too few fish. As a result, EU fishing fleets are shrinking and many thousands of jobs are being lost at sea and on shore.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in the North Sea is of particular concern. Savage cuts in the total allowable catches and quotas were announced in December by the Council. Now the Commission is seeking to implement emergency interim measures to aid the recovery of cod stocks, which have fallen to unsustainable levels in that sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely grateful, like my colleagues, the other Scottish MEPs, to Commissioner Fischler for agreeing to meet us earlier this evening to discuss these dramatic emergency measures. We welcome Mr Fischler's generous offer to meet with leaders of the industry to discuss alternatives to the draconian proposals which have been widely publicised by the Fisheries DG in the last few days.</p>
<p class="contents">A sensible, multiannual cod recovery plan embracing realistic technical conservation measures, the closure of cod spawning grounds and the decommissioning of the larger new fishing vessels will surely be more sensible than the pursuit of a plan which would allow industrial fishing to continue in vast restricted zones and which would potentially lead to the bankruptcy of half the Scottish fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">The Poignant and Gallagher reports have attracted some amendments, which seek to do away with the 6/12 mile limits and break open the Shetland Box and gain free access to the North Sea. Clearly there are some Member States that still regard the resources of the North Sea as a rich prize. I hope that this debate may bring them to their senses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This question has stirred the emotions of everyone involved in fisheries for some time now. The Poignant and Gallagher reports are important milestones in the preliminary debate. The actual debate on reform will, however, not start until the Commission's Green Paper has been submitted within the next few months although, quite understandably, representatives of highly disparate fisheries interests in the European Union are already trying to influence the preparatory process within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">A great many demands have been made on the Commission. I think it is still too early for the European Parliament to commit itself one way or another. We should confine ourselves, within the framework of these two reports, to addressing the problems and discussing various possible solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Both rapporteurs have done a great deal of work and have highlighted the basic problems of the common fisheries policy and I am grateful to them for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to single out just three of these basic problems. First, the problem of access to waters, which should at least be re-examined as part of the reform. Protection zones must be defined on the basis of scientific studies and the relevant conclusions must be drawn from their results.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: regionalisation is another catchword which repeatedly gives rise to controversial debate. But regionalisation does not mean some form of renationalisation. We have a common fisheries policy in the EU and that is how it is going to stay.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: I should like to finish by again highlighting how important it is for the whole fisheries sector – fishermen, science, industry and so on – to be involved in the forthcoming reform process. This is the only way we shall be able to ensure that the new common fisheries policy is well accepted by those whom it affects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to tackle it from the point of view of globalisation and in relation to the specific problem of Guinea-Bissau.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Group of the Greens is concerned, I would remind you that we are in favour of a fisheries policy that respects the natural balance, in favour of developing offshore and inshore fishing, which creates jobs, and in favour of selective fishing, which takes account of available stocks. This is a question of achieving economic growth to satisfy businesses as well as protecting social aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">We are against granting subsidies that encourage excessive industrial fishing, which catches everything indiscriminately, to the point of wiping out species and harming food safety and biodiversity, a fisheries policy which allows fleets to grow out of all proportion, and so forth. Because of this, we consider that untrammelled market forces represent one of the factors leading to such over-investment and that these issues should be taken into consideration in the next round of WTO trade negotiations on liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore request that the Commission present appropriate proposals, both on the issue of the future direction of the subsidised sectors and on social aspects to the other members of the WTO. Furthermore, we are, generally, not particularly in favour of the bilateral fishing agreements between the European Union and third countries, often small countries, whose entire budgets are occasionally no larger than the subsidies granted them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that we remain as integrated as possible. However, we accept that a reserve of EUR 6.5 million was allocated to Guinea-Bissau, given that it is assigned to an action programme which will support the local fishing industry, infrastructure and controls and that a detailed report on how these funds are being used will be submitted to Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it cannot be denied that, as has already been mentioned, the points and issues we are discussing today are the same as those dealt with by the Gallagher and Poignant reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not go back over the technical reasons why these issues are sensitive: the 6/12 mile limits, protected areas, maintaining the principle of relative stability, regionalisation which can somehow be interpreted as renationalisation. I, too, see the nature of these issues as very specific and share the view stressed by my fellow Members that they are sensitive. With regard to this, I repeat that, for the very reason that we are going through a period of reform – and if we are carrying out reforms then it is because our current strategy is not working or the possibility of reform would not arise – we must be very aware that we cannot leave everything as it is, nor, moreover, can we continue to be inconsistent in our recommendations. In this regard, the Group of the European People’s Party has tabled amendments aimed precisely at achieving greater coherence between the positions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, make one entreaty to the Commissioner and to all of us: it is important that a balance is found, for a major political reason apart from anything else. At the last part-session in December, we all – Commission and Parliament – criticised Nice because the countries' desire to protect their own national interests took root once again and we condemned that Council for placing the Community method in crisis. Now we must work to ensure that a common policy is genuinely achieved in this typical sector, but in order to do so we must respond to those who are complaining – namely the operators – that there is insufficient participation or backing for the choices made, therefore that there is no cooperation in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do this, we will be able to prove – and I am convinced that we are capable of doing so – that it is possible to achieve a sound common policy, valuing differences rather than penalising them and involving the operators of all the Member States, particularly the fisheries operators in all their diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reform of the CFP and the forthcoming launch of the Green Paper mark a critical time for the fishing industry. On the one hand all of us here in this Chamber want to see the existence of the fishing industry, not least because we enjoy eating the product; but on the other hand we are faced with grave scientific evidence of depleting fish stocks, so much so that certain species may no longer exist in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In Scotland, as mentioned this evening by many of my Scottish colleagues, the issue of cod is dominating the news agenda. Some say that even before the launch of the Green Paper there could be little left of the Scottish fleet because of cuts in TACs, quotas and the proposed cod recovery proposals. Others say that in order to have a fishing industry at all we need to conserve, they hark back to the 1996 article in <span class="italic">Nature </span>warning of the collapse of cod stocks. I really do not know how you square the circle, but by the end of 2002 we must.</p>
<p class="contents">From talking to people in the industry, those involved in scientific research and those involved in conservation, it seems there is a willingness to be involved and a need for greater participation of all those concerned. In Scotland, the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and the WWF have joined forces and suggested a better way of working. The proposal for zonal management and greater regionalisation of the CFP is a serious one that has the support of fishing and conservation groups alike. In other countries there are also suggestions. This can only be good for debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, this year and next will provide an opportunity to get the CFP right. I look forward to debating this on future Tuesdays in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we consider the fisheries policy, then there is actually one aspect which needs to change on a number of levels, and with regard to that debate I should like to put forward a few initial points, which are also based on the situation in my region, so as to give you an indication of the expectations we have from the Green Paper. To begin with, there is the issue of control, especially quota control, within the EU. This will need to be regulated more effectively in future, for any policy hinges on control, and if we want to adopt a policy in a truly structured manner, sound control is vital. This is also the key point, and in due course, we will need to consider sanctions in this field in the event that countries do not have adequate systems for quota control.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important point for the future policy is a restructuring programme which needs to be developed to replace the present multiannual orientation programme. European subsidies should benefit actual capacity reduction first and foremost, as well as environmental and quality investments with the following action points: a sea-day scheme in all EU countries – in my own country this scheme has worked excellently, which was also evident from the fisheries conference held in Brussels a couple of months ago. A second point is a premium scheme for the use of nets, which restricts additional catches. This is a truly technological improvement. The third point is the so-called set aside scheme for regions which are hit hard by the dwindling fish stocks. I am, for example, thinking of regions in Europe which heavily depend on cod stocks and the decline thereof. Europe should definitely invest in this.</p>
<p class="contents">A fourth point, in my opinion, is the reorganisation of the fisheries policy which must be further developed.</p>
<p class="contents">A fifth point is the actual investment in food safety, because the dioxin issue will soon be hitting the fisheries industry, and we must be able to deal with this adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">A sixth point is that, in the light of the environmental problems in candidate countries upon EU enlargement, we will need to pay particular attention to the problems which occur there in the field of food safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The latest Euro-barometer data shows scepticism is rising, perhaps as a true reflection of this inability to negotiate.</p>
<p class="contents">In the agreement with Morocco they have had no weight whatsoever. Even the French Presidency told us at the time that it was unable to secure an agreement. We are going to have a major social problem on our hands, and we have no real alternative. Now some of our fishing towns are going to develop their economy partly around and thanks to the drug that Morocco grows and markets and we Europeans consume.</p>
<p class="contents">To Moroccan blackmail of negotiating with the resources of some fishing grounds that belong to the Sahrawi people, the Commission responds by seeing Community fishermen as real enemies, cutting their quotas and signalling to Morocco that that is the way to go, without proposing an alternative. Can anybody be sure today that all the Community boats that have had anything to do with fishing in Morocco are tied up? Well, then, Morocco-European Union relations must be seriously affected. All the funds poured into this agreement should be used to finance alternatives in the areas affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the Commission Presidency is trying to settle a very long-standing problem at the last minute. We are concerned that the solution proposed is just a makeshift solution for the sake of the media and not a real solution to the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully agree with Mr Varela when he describes globalisation as a phenomenon whose repercussions vary according to specific cases. Although, for many, it is a challenge which generates wealth and opportunities, for others, those who have difficulty in adapting to change or are unable to do so, it is a source of problems and discontent.</p>
<p class="contents">Adaptation to a global economy has had varying effects on the fisheries sector. In fact, in situations such as that of Sicily or Sardinia, some of the traditional coastal fleets, which have grown up and survived in a local context thus far, feel threatened by the impact of globalisation. The work of such fleets is frequently the lifeblood of local communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, when we talk of negotiations underway within the World Trade Organisation on the liberalisation of trade, we must take into account the different specific circumstances in order to avoid bringing about total liberalisation of customs duties which could lead to irreparable damage and the destruction of the entire sector. We must, therefore, uphold a tariff policy based on reciprocal trade, taking into account the fact that, in many countries, imports from Europe are subject to non-tariff barriers which hamper the smooth functioning of the free market.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we must prevent the fishing of certain migratory species which, in Europe, are subject to tying-up periods but which, in other countries, can be fished and then sold on the Community market.</p>
<p class="contents">It would also be appropriate to revise the system of existing trade preferences, for sometimes the level of development of third countries no longer justifies the granting of these preferences.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must uphold the European Union policy which makes access to the Community market for products coming from third countries dependent upon access for the European fleet to the fishing waters of the countries with which we are negotiating. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, on behalf of the Commission, I should first like to thank all the rapporteurs, the Committee on Fisheries and the other committees involved for their comprehensive work in the run up to today's debate. I should also like to extend special thanks to the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Varela, for coordinating all the work and for his interesting own-initiative report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Varela, you make it quite plain in your report that it is impossible to discuss the future of the common fisheries policy without taking account of the broader economy surrounding fisheries. Like every other economic activity, fisheries are affected by globalisation. I fully endorse much of what you say in your report and in the resolution attached to it. You highlight the fact that European fishing is committed to the principle of multifunctionality, i.e. the principle of a sustainable fisheries economy which preserves fish stocks and protects the marine environment and makes an important contribution to the economic and social structures of coastal areas engaged in fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome your support in the fight against illegal and irresponsible fishing. We shall have an opportunity to discuss Community solutions to this burning issue. But I can already see that you, too, are in favour of a more resolute approach here.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we need further discussion on three points in the report. First, the report shows a certain tendency towards more protection from international competition on the grounds that fisheries provide a great many jobs in certain coastal areas. That is certainly true, but if we unilaterally insist that jobs must be safeguarded solely with the help of the fisheries policy, without taking overall local conditions in a coastal area into account, then we run the risk, under certain circumstances, of subsidising in the wrong direction. That would be counterproductive, both for fish stocks and for jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Fisheries needs to stand on their own two feet. This may lead, in numerous cases, to a reduction in the <span class="italic">status quo</span>, but when regions are affected by such structural adjustments, then the Community must, of course, help. The most efficient form of help we can provide is by giving young people a future and offering them alternative employment to fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to comment on the WTO negotiations which you mention. As you are aware, we do not yet know if a new WTO round will even start and, if so, to what extent. But even if there is a comprehensive round, I very much doubt that the Community would be willing to accept reciprocity in fisheries on the questions at issue, such as investments or the right of establishment. Until now, only natives or nationals of an EU Member State have been allowed to invest in the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, I should like to remind you that it has been accepted since the beginning of the common fisheries policy that the Community has one seat and one vote. This purely numerical disadvantage is more than offset by the advantage of having a greater say in the shaping of international fisheries policy. To summarise, Mr Varela, your report makes an important contribution to the continuing debate on the future of the common fisheries policy. The Commission will certainly take your thoughts into maximum consideration in its forthcoming Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the reports and motions for resolutions from Mr Gallagher and Mr Poignant. Both reports start from the same premise. The fisheries sector in the Community is under equal pressure from several quarters. Fish stocks are declining, there is excess capacity in the fleet and it is becoming more and more difficult to access third country waters. I am delighted that you basically subscribe to the analysis in the Commission report on the application of the system for fisheries in 1996-1998. It is true that some progress was made – I need only mention the flexibility in year-to-year stock management or the new TACs in the North Sea for non-regulated species or the regulation on technical measures or the introduction of the VMS – but we still have to admit that we have failed to reverse the negative trend in numerous important stocks, such as cod or hake. Both rapporteurs also highlight the following serious shortcomings, as identified in the Commission report: effort limitation has either not worked or has been unsatisfactory, the regulation on technical measures in the Mediterranean has been patchily implemented, the fourth MAGP is not nearly ambitious enough and control arrangements have not been made stricter, as we proposed in 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">Meetings with various representatives of the fisheries sector have also shown that we need either to improve or to overhaul numerous aspects of the fisheries policy if we are to achieve responsible, sustainable fisheries. Differences of opinion notwithstanding, the majority of those affected are agreed that we need to do more. In particular, we need stricter controls, we need better application of the rules, we need to reduce discards, we need to promote scientific research and we need to involve those affected, especially the fishermen themselves, at an earlier stage and more intensively when taking decisions on fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore agrees to the motions for resolutions on several points. However, it has the impression, as regards the delicate question of the 6/12-mile zone, that the majority of those affected are in favour of maintaining the <span class="italic">status quo</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will publish its Green Paper in a few weeks' time, together with the reports under Article 14 paragraph 2 of Regulation 3760. We must use the ensuing debate to discuss how to rectify the shortcomings identified in the reports and suitable solutions for doing so in order to put the fisheries sector in the Community back on a viable basis.</p>
<p class="contents">On the evidence of the motions for resolutions, the main objectives of the reform process identified by all three rapporteurs are as follows: to reduce excess capacity and improve coherence with environmental policy measures in order to maintain and re-establish stocks; to ensure that the people directly affected are more closely involved in decision making and to resolve local or urgent problems more efficiently in order to ensure that the rules are adhered to and applied and fisheries management is improved overall – in other words, everything which qualifies as good governance. Then, to create a fisheries sector which is both sustainable and economically viable and internationally competitive – while at the same time helping those who are forced to look elsewhere for work; to develop a modern foreign fisheries policy which is closely coordinated with other Community policies in order to achieve responsible and rational use of resources, and, most importantly, to redevelop the Mediterranean dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to Mr Cunha's report on Guinea-Bissau. This resolution will guarantee the activities of the Community fleet in question, while at the same time supporting the local sector. I am delighted that the rapporteur supports our proposal. The sum of EUR 6.5 million now released will be used specifically to restore the fisheries-related installations which suffered serious damage during the armed conflict in Guinea-Bissau. This will help the Community fleet to make better use of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In detail, we want to support the following activities: reconstruction of the infrastructure, controls on and monitoring of the fleet and new research programmes. I should like to make a few comments here on the terms of payment: a tranche of 50% of the overall amount will be paid out first, as soon as the government has submitted an action programme. The remainder, in other words the second half, will be paid out once Guinea-Bissau has filed a detailed report on the implementation of individual activities under the action programme and the use of the funds earmarked for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a brief word on the proposed amendments. Proposed Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 extend the deadline for implementing the activities required to 2003. I think this proposed amendment is both reasonable and justified and the Commission can therefore support it. We fully share the concern expressed in proposed Amendment No 4 but, as we already inform the budgetary authority of all financial and budgetary transactions under the terms of our Interinstitutional Agreement, proposed Amendment No 4 is in fact superfluous.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the contributions to the debate on the current state of negotiations with Morocco are concerned, I should like to thank Parliament for its obvious confidence in the Commission's work. I have to tell you that the agreement ceased <span class="italic">de facto</span> to apply 14 months ago, and that the Moroccan side was, unfortunately, not prepared to enter into serious negotiation on a new agreement until the end of October last year, in other words, just three and a half months ago. We did, however, make good use of the time up to Christmas, with one technical discussion a week in either Brussels or Rabat. Negotiations were held practically every day in Rabat between 2 January and 9 January. We really have done our utmost here. For the rest, it is wrong to say that we have received no support from the Council. Both the main countries affected and the presidency have supported us in our efforts and I think that, at the end of the day, the meeting between the King of Morocco and our Commission President was a useful one. I hope that negotiations will again get properly under way, and that hopefully we shall soon be on the home straight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
