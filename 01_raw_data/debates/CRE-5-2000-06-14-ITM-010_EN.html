<p class="contents">However, the current context is not favourable to increasing the budget, as was demonstrated in the Agenda 2000 negotiations, and this is not the right moment to reopen this debate. Within the Interinstitutional Agreement reached on 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improving the budgetary procedure, of which the financial perspectives are an integral part, you will remember that amounts were established which represent an annual maximum limit on expenditure for the European Parliament, Council and Commission. These three institutions undertook to respect these limits.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council currently considers that there is no need to revise the financial perspectives. With regard to expenditure arising from enlargement, the aforementioned Agreement specifies that, in the event of enlargement of the EU to include new Member States during the period covered by the financial perspectives, the European Parliament and the Council, deliberating on a Commission proposal, will jointly adopt financial perspectives taking into account the need for expenditure arising from this enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this alteration of the financial perspectives must respect the maximum limits contained in the guidelines on the financial perspectives for an enlarged Union with 21 Member States, as indicated in Annex II to the Interinstitutional Agreement. This clearly depends on the results of the accession negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, resources budgeted for other commitments are usually cut back; this happened, for example, in order to find money for Kosovo and for developing the Balkans, for the earthquakes and for other issues which have arisen. I just wonder why we are not making an effort to take payment appropriations up to the legal ceiling of 1.27% of the GDP of the European Union, so that other programmes do not have to be sacrificed, and why the European Union is taking on more and more and, at the same time, limiting payments of approved appropriations, which account for a mere 1.10% of GDP. Also, can the Council reassure the people in the poor countries of the European Union that enlargement will not result in budgetary cutbacks...</p>

The truth is that the changes which have been made to the funding allocation plan, particularly in the last year, have not affected the Union’s compliance with its undertakings in these areas. These changes have also been made based on appropriations that remain unspent in certain areas. However, if the situation worsens to the extent that some of the commitments made by the European Union cannot be kept in accordance with the financial perspectives, then this mid-term revision may clearly occur, as specified in the financial perspectives and for the first time by qualified majority voting. In this way, some of the expenditure arising from enlargement, if this takes place in the meantime, may be covered. However, given that we are currently in the first year of implementing the financial perspectives, there is no reason at the moment to justify any reassessment of the commitment made in Berlin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was involved in the Agenda 2000 negotiations and I clearly recall the concept of real stabilisation which was proposed. In practice this meant reducing the amounts established. In our opinion the European Union will sooner or later have to make a choice. It must opt either for a structure with a solid set of policies and a corresponding budget at the same level or simply for a kind of savings fund. If we were to regard the Community budget as a kind of savings fund and were to act increasingly through subsidiarity in terms of financing, the future of the EU’s policies would very probably be in doubt, particularly from 2006.

<p class="contents">My question pertains particularly to radioactive emissions. I know France is part of the troika and will be taking up the presidency in July. France pushed quite hard and was part of the agreement on lowering radioactive emissions, but a recent Greenpeace study shows that there are quite strong emissions of radioactivity from Cap La Hague. Is the Council aware of this study? Would it like more information about this study? Will it bring it to the attention of the French presidency?</p>

In principle this does not come under the Community competence but is the exclusive competence of the national authorities and in particular, as stated by the Member in his own question, of the Greek High Authority for Data Protection. As I said, no proposal has been presented to the Council on this issue. If the conduct of the Greek authorities led to any infringement of Community legislation, the Commission, as the Guardian of the Treaties, would clearly not hesitate to take the necessary steps to bring any action before the Court of Justice in respect of this infringement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this does not come under the Council’s competence but is rather the responsibility of the Commission. It is up to the latter to determine whether or not the reference to religion on Greek identity cards complies with the principle of non-discrimination on religious grounds. However, from a preliminary analysis of this issue, we feel that the mere reference to religion does not in essence constitute any violation of the legal and political <span class="italic">acquis</span> of the European Union, if this reference is only for information or even statistical purposes and if it is not accompanied by any specific measures discriminating against those practising a particular religion. In any case we are talking about actions by free and democratic countries. In order to challenge a measure of this type, a specific legal framework for complaints exists at national level. Clearly, the Community bodies can be appealed to following action before these national bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the honourable Member mentioned, the Helsinki European Council recognised Turkey as an applicant country. At this same European Council, the applicant countries were also urged to make every effort to resolve all existing border disputes and other similar issues. Unresolved disputes must be brought before the International Court of Justice within a reasonable period of time or at the latest by 2004. The Council will then re-examine the situation. With regard to relations between Greece and Turkey, which form the basis of this whole issue, the Council can only welcome an improvement in these relations. It is hoped that this positive process will continue so that the issues relating to the Aegean are successfully resolved in accordance with international law. It should be recalled in this respect, as this is also extremely positive, that Turkish troops participated in the NATO exercise which took place in part on Greek territory. Turkish troops have never before participated in exercises on Greek territory. The Council notes that the Greek Defence Minister described the cooperation between Greece and the Turkish armed forces as excellent and added that the exercises were carried out with full respect for all the sovereign rights of Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important point. I must also note that, in terms of bilateral relations, the Foreign Ministers of Greece and Turkey, while at the NATO Summit in Florence, presented a proposal to include a range of good-neighbourly measures on the agenda for negotiations between Greece and Turkey. The aim of these measures will be to consolidate the climate of security and harmonisation between these two countries. These are in addition to the confidence-building measures in the Aegean.</p>

The decision taken to recognise Turkey as an applicant country was made in view of this overall balance. However, certain conditions were indicated in the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council, particularly with reference to the resolution under international law of the conflicts involving the Aegean. A timetable was also set for this which is indissociably linked to Turkey’s ambitions for its accession to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must all bear in mind that we should be trying, in this specific area, not to aggravate the bilateral tensions which may arise here or there, where these clearly do not involve fundamental principles of identity and the basic interests of the country. We must realise instead that it is essential to reduce these tensions. It is particularly important that we use the time factor. At the moment signs are apparent on both the Greek and Turkish sides, with effects evident also on the Cypriot side. We should allow these countries some time before we start systematically highlighting the small incidents which may ultimately stop us from seeing the bigger picture which, after all, is much more important than these small incidents. It would be politically more responsible at this time to try and reduce the tensions. We must therefore particularly support the efforts which the authorities of the two countries have been making, especially through their respective Foreign Ministers, in order to prevent certain incidents from being exploited, for the sake of the overall situation which is itself of considerable significance and whose resolution may be vital to ensure the balance of the geographical area concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For Greece, as far as Turkey is concerned, there is only one issue which needs to be settled and that is the boundaries of the continental shelf in the Aegean. Turkey has disputed a number of issues in the Aegean at one time or another. And one of these issues is the status of the grey zones or island rocks in the Aegean. My question is quite specific. Do you consider, given the spirit of the Helsinki resolutions, which call on Turkey to settle its border and similar disputes with its neighbours by 2004, that the status of the island rocks or grey zones in the Aegean counts as a border dispute? What is the Council’s opinion; is this what it is calling on Turkey to do? To settle as a border dispute the status of the Aegean, where Greece does not acknowledge that there is an issue? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So far these two countries have adopted a totally antagonistic attitude towards these issues, as there are points which Turkey wants to discuss under international law but which Greece considers do not fall within this context. Conversations and negotiations are now occurring in this respect and bilateral contacts are being made, accompanied by confidence-building measures. We should allow some time for this process to develop before becoming involved in any potential conflicts. We know that these differences of opinion exist and that up to now these have formed the essence of what seems to be a conflict about the Aegean which could basically, under international law, be viewed in linear terms. We know that this is not the case and that we all have different ideas about the same subject. This is also true of Greece and Turkey but there is now a negotiating framework for this. We must bide our time and ensure that this negotiating framework can operate, particularly bearing in mind the currently positive Greek-Turkish relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also concerned about the difficulties which are being experienced in terms of consolidating democracy and improving the standard of living of the people of that country. We are therefore giving political and economic support within the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 July 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">During the EU Summit with the three Heads of State and Government of the Caucasus in June of last year, an important declaration was approved which sets out the bases for relations between the European Union and the Southern Caucasus. This same resolution indicated the importance of developing regional cooperation, establishing friendly relations between the countries and sustainably developing their economies. Moreover, the European Union indicated that it was ready to use its support instruments in order to create a suitable environment for resolving conflicts in the Caucasus. In this respect, the Cooperation Council between the European Union and Georgia, which was held on 12 October, decided that the cooperation in 2000 should particularly revolve around intensified efforts to find a solution to the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p>
<p class="contents">I must remind you that the European Union is the largest donor of aid to rehabilitation projects in South Ossetia and is ready to support measures aimed at creating a climate of confidence, particularly by rebuilding the north-south infrastructures which connect Russia to Georgia. Moreover, the EU has also been giving assistance to almost 300 000 displaced persons within Georgia who were forced to abandon their homes due to the conflict. The EU is encouraging the resolution of this conflict so that these people can return to their homes as quickly as possible and is ready to offer additional assistance in this event.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council supports all the efforts made by the competent international bodies, particularly the OSCE in South Ossetia and the UN in Abkhazia, with the aim of contributing to acceptable solutions which can return the political and economic relations to normal and ensure the return of the refugees under safe conditions. The war in neighbouring Chechnya represents an additional threat to Georgia. The Council fears that this conflict may spread to Georgia and welcomes the extension of the OSCE’s monitoring mission along the respective borders. At the request of President Shevardnadze, the European Union is now studying possible ways of helping to reinforce and ensure the efficacy of this monitoring mission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You should remember that we have a limited capacity for intervention in certain areas and that, as was said today in other respects, the difficulties in the EU’s external action framework and the financing of this framework limit the EU’s capacity to be present in all conflict situations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, given the strategic importance of the area, the European Union has been doing whatever it considers possible in this respect. I agree that other measures may be possible but there is not currently a framework of financing which would allow us to go further, particularly in terms of acting to reinforce the infrastructures. As for the situation in Russia, regardless of political opinion and what may be underlying the Russian position, there are currently no practical signs which point to an objective intention by Russia to destabilise these countries. Effects are being felt, as I said, from the war in Chechnya and are likely to be felt in the future by neighbouring countries but I cannot infer from this that there is necessarily an intention on the part of the Russian authorities to spread any kind of instability in neighbouring areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are continuing to closely monitor this situation. In the meantime a series of positive events has occurred, in particular the release of the secretary-general of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights and the implementation of the law on non-governmental organisations which it is hoped may bring about greater freedom of expression. At every opportunity and at various levels, the European Union has reminded Egypt of its concern about the human rights situation and about the need for Egypt to respect fundamental freedoms, particularly given its status as a member of the EU-Mediterranean partnership. The negotiations on the Association Agreement with Egypt were concluded last year and it is envisaged that this will shortly be signed. Once in force, this Agreement will turn the political dialogue between the European Union and Egypt into an institutional matter, especially in the area of human rights, which will naturally enable greater intervention and more scope for political pressure in respect of anything which may be regarded as non-compliance by Egypt with its obligations under this Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 2 of the draft Agreement specifies that the relations between the parties, like the provisions of the Agreement, are based on respect for democratic principles and the fundamental human rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This will naturally form the backdrop to the bilateral relations and political dialogue which are integral to this Agreement. In this context, we will of course continue to remind Egypt, as we have done prior to the establishment of this legally binding framework, of its responsibilities and, in particular, of the need to respect human rights and to preserve fundamental freedoms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue has been addressed in the bilateral political dialogue and has naturally been raised within the normal framework of relations between the European Union and third countries. In this particular case we believe that the Agreement has its own negotiating context and it would not be right, after the Agreement has been approved by the European Union and agreed by the Council, to make its final signing dependent on the resolution of an issue, however important this may be, which is only one part of the whole picture. On this particular issue and regardless of whether we strictly agree with your reading of the situation that the Coptic community is being subjected to specific measures, our information indicates that, even if the Coptic Christians are being affected the most by these repressive measures, this does not point to an attitude of particular retaliation against the Coptic community. There is an ongoing conflict between traders and certain local communities which has affected the Coptic community but which does not necessarily indicate a specific intention by the Egyptian authorities on this issue.</p>

It is practically impossible for the European Union to constantly monitor all situations in all the countries with which we have a relationship within the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. Within the Common Foreign and Security Policy and particularly bearing in mind the assessment being made, especially in the framework of our political dialogue within the association agreements, we continue trying to highlight our concern about the gravity of various situations. We cannot expect the European Union to operate as a kind of international human rights monitor. There are other specific institutions to do this work. However, we will ensure that the due consequences are felt in our bilateral political relations with regard to any negative development in these respects. I also agree that there are much worse situations in other countries within the Barcelona process, some of which perhaps do not occur to us when we are speaking, which must also be duly assessed.

The third phase of economic and monetary union saw the beginning of informal meetings of the Euro Council or Euro 11 as it also known. This brings together the finance ministers of the countries in the euro zone. These meetings are held monthly and before the formal meetings of Ecofin which involve all fifteen Member States. Euro 11 meetings essentially address issues relating to the specific responsibilities which the eleven countries share in matters involving the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Whenever the issues go beyond this scope, the meetings are extended to all the Member States as is laid down. In all cases where decisions must be taken, Ecofin takes these in accordance with the procedures established in the Treaty. This was the guidance given by the Luxembourg European Council of 12 and 13 December 1997. Any other mystery for which the operation of Euro 11 may be criticised can only stem from a failure to understand this reality and the information which is actually in the public domain. The issues discussed by Euro 11 and transferred subsequently to Ecofin, which is attended by all the other countries which have not adopted the euro, are widely known, even in the press. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Euro 11 and the institutionalisation of the third phase of economic and monetary union require a form of closer cooperation which is pre-established in the Treaty, the question is whether an <span class="italic">acquis </span>will be created in Euro 11 which must be transposed to the full Union. There are currently no elements of policy coordination between the countries in Euro 11 which naturally affect or should affect their behaviour in Ecofin. However, it makes perfect sense that countries which are part of an effective policy model and which are involved in implementing policies involving, for example, the single currency framework can separately define and coordinate a position. However, this can only be ratified in Ecofin. This point is important for understanding that perhaps in the future, when different policy integration models exist, we will see more elements and more ways of working of this kind. This may be the future and we will see whether the Feira European Council integrates closer cooperation into the Intergovernmental Conference. If so, we will very probably see several models emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we avoid this? For a country such as the honourable Member’s perhaps the problem will be solved by being part of the Euro Council. However, until this decision is taken by the authorities in his country, the Euro Council will consist exclusively of the eleven countries which have actually adopted the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have never seen any such agenda, and I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to state clearly to what extent agendas are available in advance of the meetings. The reason why both Swedish and Danish MEPs are raising these questions is that we have obtained the impression that the Euro 11 is an influential body.

Issues relating to the single currency are addressed jointly but solely by the eleven members of Euro 11. If Euro 11 wants to address any other type of issue which does not concern the single currency, this decision is shared with the other Member States which are not part of Euro 11. It is as simple as that. What cannot be avoided is that the coordination of the policies of the Euro 11 countries, particularly on the single currency, and the effect that these policies have on the overall context of the EU’s economic and financial policy do not appear to be linked to the EU’s own coordination. It is natural that there is prior coordination between these countries and it is natural that this coordination ends up having some influence on the final decision taken in Ecofin. This happens at contact group level and in the relations between various countries in various contexts. I know of several cases in which government sectors of EU countries meeting at Council level have talked separately and coordinated their positions so that these appear linked in the institutional contexts of the Union. You will say that this is not part of the normal procedure. That is true in that case but in the case of Euro 11 this is institutionalised in the Treaty and it is this which is specified. There should be no doubt on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet this assertion by the Council causes the honourable Member some confusion. On the specific case mentioned, what is happening is as follows. The fact that Belgian fishermen will not be fishing in the Irish Sea does not stem from any Council decision as the regulation approved by Council provides for fishing quotas to be granted to Belgium in these waters. It actually stems from each Member State’s right to exchange with other Member States the fishing quotas allocated to them. In accordance with the basic regulation of the common fisheries policy, the Member States, having notified the Commission, may exchange all or part of their fishing quotas. The same article establishes that Member States shall annually inform the Commission of the criteria which they adopt internally for distributing their fishing quotas. Therefore, the quotas available to Member States are established and allocated by a Council decision, with each Member State being responsible for distributing these among the national fleet or, if appropriate, for exchanging part of these quotas with another Member State. In this case the latter only needs to inform the Commission to ensure the effective control and management of fish stocks. We therefore cannot find any Council document which refers to the exchange of notes between Belgium and the United Kingdom given that, under Community legislation, it is Member States which are responsible for deciding this by mutual agreement and given that this does not require approval by the Council. However, with regard to the overall distribution of quotas, the honourable Member must be aware that this is published in the Official Journal, in the minutes of the Council of Ministers’ meetings and also in the annexed declarations. We do not feel that there has been any breakdown in the transparency for which the Council is responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Measures to reinforce the effectiveness of the checks carried out by Member States at their external air and sea borders have been implemented, particularly within the Schengen area, and are now being integrated into the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span> following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Although these measures are carried out by Member States, the Council controls their actual application through its competent bodies. By way of example, based on a decision of the Schengen Executive Committee of 18 December 1998 on the coordinated use of consultants in respect of documents, measures are being introduced which are intended to combat illegal migration by air and sea in cooperation with various African countries. Moreover, a 1999 decision of the Schengen Executive Committee approved a mutual aid project for the exchange of officials to give assistance and advice in carrying out security and control tasks at external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span>, practical measures of the same type are also being taken on behalf of the European Union. These are generally based on the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span> and particularly on the common position of 25 October 1996 which established the assistance and information missions carried out away from the border. Such measures are coordinated within the competent bodies of the Council but do not for the time being cover any African countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of addressing the deep-rooted reasons for people wanting to escape and emigrate from certain African countries, we can refer to the action plan for Morocco approved in the Council in October 1999. This action plan is one of a set of five, each containing an exhaustive and coherent approach focused on the existing situation in a country of origin or transit of asylum-seekers which is regarded as being important. For each country selected, the action plan presents a balanced combination of options which the European Union offers in terms of foreign affairs, development and humanitarian and economic assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">In the action plan for Morocco, which specifically covers the situation referred to by the honourable Member, this country is regarded as a country of origin and transit for economic migration to the European countries. The measures recommended in this action plan include using existing channels and improving information-gathering, distributing correct information on immigration, creating strategies for combating illegal trafficking and promoting measures intended to apply the readmission agreements. Also recommended is the promotion of direct foreign investment and vocational training, in which small companies are also involved, and assistance for the voluntary return and reintegration of Moroccans who live in EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In signing the action plans established by the High Level Group, the Tampere European Council of 15 October 1999 recognised that the European Union still lacks an overall approach to the immigration phenomenon which covers the political, human rights and development issues in countries and regions of origin and transit. This is an important point. To achieve this objective, poverty must be combated and living conditions and employment opportunities must be improved, conflicts must be prevented and democratic states consolidated. This requires greater coherence in the internal and external policies of the Union which are the responsibility of both the EU and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Partnership with third countries also constitutes a key element in the success of this policy. The EU is aware that, in order to implement the action plan for Morocco, partnership and cooperation with the Moroccan authorities will be needed. In this context, in June of last year, a mission to Morocco took place before the action plan was finalised in order to establish a dialogue with the Moroccan authorities. Another mission of this type is now planned for the end of this month, specifically intended for holding discussions with the Moroccan intermediaries.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, the EU’s policy covers development and humanitarian and economic assistance for Morocco. The consolidation of the action plan for Morocco is clearly a long-term strategy but it is through the dialogue now under way in this context and on the Association Council that progress will be made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is indeed a very serious situation involving regular and even daily human tragedy which must be addressed. The Spanish authorities have been in contact on this issue with the Moroccan authorities and the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Aznar, had a meeting just recently with his Moroccan counterpart about this problem. Development measures are being introduced in the northern area of Morocco, which are starting to improve this situation and the economic conditions that have led to these migratory flows.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the possibility of us periodically carrying out a quantitative assessment of these incidents, I believe that the Spanish authorities may be able to provide the necessary information in this respect. This information is in fact widely available within Spain as it is distributed by the Spanish authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">What I want to try and explain to you – and this is why my original explanation was so long – is that the measures taken by the European Union in this respect or which are intended to have an effect in this respect are long-term measures which obviously cannot provide an immediate response to a given situation. They are measures which are intended to work at the root of this situation by creating the conditions to keep the Moroccan people in their own country. They are development measures which are within the spirit of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that your immediate reaction may be that the practical effect of this type of long-term measure is limited. I did say that these measures would involve many small steps. We must all realise that the European Union has a set of policies which it aims to implement and that these policies involve strategic choices. These choices cannot be systematically prejudiced by overly general actions leading to worse humanitarian effects than may have occurred anyway. We must realise that, in their bilateral relations with Morocco, the Spanish authorities are currently responsible for solving part of the problem. The European Union is generally involved in a series of projects, in the context of its relations with the southern Mediterranean countries, which include projects for development, population settlement and guarantees of improved economic conditions. We cannot turn the European Union into a kind of technical instrument for the practical resolution of specific situations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The headline goal specifies a capacity of 50 000 to 60 000 personnel. This decision reaffirmed that the European Union’s crisis management actions will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and the objectives of the OSCE’s Charter for European Security. The Helsinki declaration, which was approved by the Heads of State and Government of the Fifteen, expressly states that the European Union recognises the primary responsibility of the United Nations Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to respect the principles of the UN Charter and the Charter for European Security is clearly recognised, so much so that the report to be presented by the Portuguese Presidency to the Feira European Council next Monday stresses the fact that, in the area of crisis management and conflict prevention, the European Union must establish close cooperation with the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe. Yet a UN Security Council resolution is not needed to generally legitimise the EU’s action. However, the EU undertakes politically and at the highest level to respect the primary responsibility of the Security Council. Therefore, for a given operation, the Union undertakes to respect this responsibility and the resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="contents">However, you should note that some of the Petersberg tasks may be carried out without the authorisation or approval of the UN Security Council. In fact the Petersberg tasks include, and I quote, ‘humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace making’. Therefore, only in the latter, for which the use of military force is required, is the existence of a UN Security Council resolution considered necessary. It is clear that the implementation of actions, particularly humanitarian ones, does not require legitimisation by the UN Security Council. This does not mean, however, that the principles of the UN Charter do not have to be respected when carrying out this type of task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Swedish Foreign Minister has stated that the expression ‘in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter’ is to be interpreted as ‘following a decision in the UN’s Security Council’.

As you know, Finland is a country which has very legitimate national concerns in this respect and which clearly will have taken these aspects into account. What we are currently trying to create within the European Union, and will eventually create, is a capacity for specific intervention which, in those areas not requiring the use of military force, will not need a mandate from the UN Security Council. In other areas a resolution will of course be necessary. We expressly accept the need for this Security Council resolution where military forces are to be used in a given context.</p>
<p class="contents">The traditionally neutral countries, particularly the EU Member States which are not members of NATO, have managed to safeguard all their concerns in achieving this balance because this issue is clearly very delicate for these countries. They are not deceiving their people nor are they being economical with the truth. They are saying exactly what their commitment is. Clearly, their right of final veto over any decision is always guaranteed by the decision-making mechanism itself. Therefore, they can decide on a case-by-case basis as they see fit. This is the fundamental rule of the European Union for any situation requiring the participation of military forces. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the insurrection in Chiapas there is evidence of increasingly serious violations of human rights in Mexico, with torture, arbitrary arrests and 'disappearances' etc. The European code of conduct on arms exports, adopted on 8 June 1998, prohibits exports of arms to countries where there is a risk of the arms being used in an internal conflict.</p>

Respect for human rights is one of the code’s main conditions which must be met in order for authorisation to be granted. Although decisions are taken individually by each Member State, the latter must take full account of the provisions of the code of conduct. This is therefore a matter of political good faith. The Council does not receive any information on the reasons why Member States grant or refuse export licences and therefore cannot assess the grounds on which these decisions are based. However, particularly since the establishment of the code of conduct, the exchange of information on arms exports has begun to occur within the European Union. This exchange is the subject of an annual report and will clearly help to identify common ways of tackling the problems. We must realise, however, that this issue is still subject to subsidiarity in that the decisions are taken by each Member State, even though the code of conduct forms the backdrop and reference for these decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the current code of conduct was the only one possible. I can say this as I attended and participated in the negotiations on this code. The reality is that the code clearly gives no guarantees with regard to monitoring how the Member States interpret their responsibilities. Quite frankly, there has not been until this moment, within the European Union, a consensus on or even a majority inclination towards reconsidering this issue. The code of conduct was regarded at the time as a very important qualitative step forward in terms of the disparate practices of the Member States which existed at that time. The aim was to tie the various Member States to a basic set of principles and to the observance of certain standards, while still leaving them completely free in this matter. This is what is happening today. I realise that the code of conduct is very weak, it particularly does not have a binding nature and cannot go any further than a political sanction. Therefore, publicising this type of situation – and I am not just referring to the situation raised in the question – particularly where this is taken up by the media, will put healthy pressure on the Council. In this way the European Union will one day be able to guarantee that the practices of its countries and those involving certain types of lucrative activity will be in harmony with the principles which the EU claims to defend. This is the big test that the European Union and its Member States will have to face in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not a matter for the Council. It would be different if, by not complying with any aspect of the Treaty on European Union, Austria were found to have infringed the principles of Article 6, for example, and therefore had to be punished or the application of the provisions of Article 7 had to be justified.

I am not aware that Austria has participated in any debate or vote in Council in which any type of measure has been adopted against it. No EU body has adopted any measure against Austria. During the term of the Portuguese Presidency, there has been no working body of the European Union in which Austria has not had, like this Parliament, the option of full and active participation with regard to the whole of the EU’s operation. The bilateral decisions, not sanctions, which were taken by the 14 Member States in respect of Austria are political acts which one country is entitled to adopt in respect of another. Every country has every right, with regard to the development of the political situation in another country, to adopt an attitude and to draw the due consequences from this. The consequences in this matter are that Austrian candidates are not being supported in international organisations, Austrian ambassadors are not being received at a level above director-general and there is a freeze on political visits. These are the famous ‘sanctions’. If any country has interpreted this attitude more extensively then this is a matter for each country. These ‘sanctions’ are therefore bilateral as each country is doing what it wishes in this respect and the responsibility is collective. The responsibility for the position taken by the 14 Member States was freely assumed by these countries. Any of these countries is free to disengage itself from these measures and we have to ask ourselves why up to now none of the 14 countries has done this. This issue is therefore not a matter for the Council. The Austrian authorities have had the opportunity to raise this issue within the European Union. It was in fact raised by the Austrian Foreign Minister during the informal meeting of foreign ministers. It was raised the day before yesterday by the Austrian Foreign Minister in Luxembourg and Doctor Wolfgang Schüssel will very probably take the opportunity afforded by his presence in Santa Maria da Feira to raise this issue. However, this decision is not a Community decision but a bilateral one, whether you like it or not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I said at the start, in terms of strict compliance with its Community obligations as specified by the Treaty on European Union, Austria has not behaved in any way which may lead to action in the specific context of Article 7. This is clear and no one can dispute this just as no one can dispute that the Austrian elections were free and that the Austrian people are free to choose the government they want. What can also not be disputed is that the other governments are free to be unhappy about the Austrian Government if they consider that this government contains a party which does not respect a set of basic principles which these governments have collectively undertaken to respect and which Austria has also undertaken to respect. What I must say to Mrs Maes is that we are all Austrians in that we all have citizenship rights which must be respected in Austria. We are therefore not indifferent to a political development which may lead to the presence, in the executive bodies of a Member State government and therefore a friendly government which shares with us and which has decided to share with us a basic set of principles, of a party which clearly conducted an electoral campaign based on other principles. With regard to the issue of using the Community bodies to raise this issue, we are a free Union in that each Member State has the right to raise this issue formally or informally in the specific context of the Union. As this is not an EU matter, this issue was never placed on the agenda and this will not occur under the Portuguese Presidency in any formal Council body. The representatives of the Austrian Government are clearly totally free to raise this issue and will have every opportunity to debate this if the Member States want to do so. At the Lisbon European Council, the 14 Member States decided to entrust the Portuguese Prime Minister with giving a collective response. At the informal meeting in the Azores there was a debate and several Member States expressed their opinions on the situation. I am not sure what will happen in Feira but clearly Doctor Wolfgang Schüssel is totally free to express his opinions and to see the reaction of the other Member States to his words and arguments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, does he believe that the Portuguese presidency acted in haste as a result of a series of telephone calls throughout Europe when that decision was taken? Would it not have been wiser to summon a meeting of the heads of state for an important decision like this which – remember – will have consequences long after our time here in the European Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to hear the views of the Portuguese presidency, and maybe other presidencies, when others coming from the extreme right or indeed the extreme left enter government within the Union. This should be a Europe of unity and solidarity. To use a slang word it is a ‘cop-out’ to say that it is not a matter for the Council. Someone must take an initiative to resolve this serious problem. It has given stature to an individual who does not deserve that stature. In fact it has strengthened his position, not weakened it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was Doctor Wolfgang Schüssel who did this by agreeing to an alliance with the party of Mr Haider. With regard to the result of the Austrian elections, I clearly said that we fully respect the result of these elections. Austria is a free country and one where the elections are held in a totally legal manner and with full transparency. The problem is that the result of this free election, as has happened in the past in other countries, brought a certain party to power. You should realise that there is actually something strange in the Austrian internal situation. The party which received the most votes was the Social Democratic Party which did not want to form a government. The party with the second highest number of votes was the FPO which was not invited to form a government. It is rather strange, in terms of usual constitutional arrangements, that in a European country the second-placed party was not invited to form a government but the third-placed party was instead. Therefore, this is not a case of business as usual. It actually involves a kind of reassessment given the potential capacity of Mr Haider to become the leader of an Austrian government.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not dispute the Austrian elections and we do not dispute the right of the Austrian people to choose the government they want. However, no one can force us to enter into relations with a government containing a party which has so far not renounced what it said in its electoral campaign nor the gravity of what it said. It is a shame that this is not being clearly emphasised. The gravity of what was said by Mr Haider and by the FPO in the elections is something which should make us all think, bearing in mind the future of Europe. We should think about the racist and xenophobic statements which have been systematically made by this party. Curiously, it did not distance itself from these during its last conference, and instead reaffirmed all its pride in its past statements when it had a specific opportunity to rectify the current situation. Nothing leads us to believe that there has been any positive change which may justify a new attitude of the European Union and, in particular, which may create the opportunity for any type of discussion on this matter within the European Union. We do not feel that this issue is a matter for the European Union but is rather for the other 14 governments to decide. So far – and we will have to wait and see what happens next – these governments have maintained a position of recognising that this situation is serious and that it requires a change, but not necessarily by the 14 governments. There is in fact an almost media-wide presumption that the change in attitude at this time should come from the 14 countries. Why? What has changed in the Austrian situation which could lead us to change our attitude? Only time? We consider that it is the Austrians and the Austrian Government which must change if they want us to adopt a different attitude. That is the essence of the matter. Why systematically place the onus on the 14 countries? Why must the 14 Member States change? What has happened in Austria to justify this change? Clearly this does not necessarily mean that we will not consider other ways in the future of assessing the development of this situation and in fact this is what will happen in the coming days. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
