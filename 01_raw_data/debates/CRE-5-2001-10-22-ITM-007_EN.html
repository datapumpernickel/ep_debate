<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmidt, Olle (ELDR)</span></span>  <span class="italic">, rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, let this be the end of twelve years’ debate of the ‘UCITS Directive’! In February of last year, we had the first reading. One and a half years’ later, in July, the common position was finally adopted, and now it is our turn.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the first proposal concerns the UCITS itself and what investments it may engage in. The second updates and extends the rules relating to the actual management of the funds. Both proposals were broadly supported by Parliament at first reading. A total of 37 amendments were adopted for the two proposals. Of these, 30 have been accepted in full or in part by the Council. As for UCITS-1, the Council wholly or partially approved 20 of Parliament’s 24 amendments. Moreover, it has made a number of changes of its own. The most important concerns OTC derivatives, the use of which the Commission opposed from the start. However, Parliament considered that OTC derivatives could be employed more broadly, but according to stringent criteria. The Council adopted the same policy. In several cases, the Council adopted a still more prudent approach than Parliament on the issue of OTC derivatives and considered that investments in these had to fulfil more stringent qualitative criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Where comitology is concerned, the common position does include comitology provisions in the field of financial services. I nonetheless want to stress that there is no obvious link to the subsequent proposals made by the group chaired by Mr Lamfalussy.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1985 directive created the so-called UCITS Contact Committee which was set up to advise the Commission. The extension of the Contact Committee’s powers to include new powers was foreseen in the original proposal. Parliament accepts parts of the proposal, but not the part concerning the adjustment of limit values, as adopted by the Council. In the same way, both the Commission and the Council accepted Parliament’s request to limit the scope of the delegation to the Committee. In my view, Parliament has thus agreed to the use of comitology and, moreover, successfully amended the scope of its powers. I do not therefore see any reason to re-open this issue at this juncture.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nonetheless an amendment from Mr Goebbels, Mr Jonckheer and Mr Herzog. Should it be adopted, I am afraid that we should be facing conciliation and not knowing where it might end. The Lamfalussy agreement is in danger of being delayed and the UCITS directive of being halted in its tracks. That is something that no one can want to see happen. I hope that Mr Goebbels is able to share my view.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to UCITS-2, the Council has, for the most part, accepted the concerns expressed by Parliament at first reading. Ten out of Parliament’s 13 amendments have been incorporated in part or in full. The most contentious issue was that of the capital requirement for management companies. The compromise finally reached by the Council is, broadly speaking, in line with Parliament’s stance. Given how complicated these two directives are and how quickly the market is developing, the committee proposes a review of the rules within the next three years. There are two reasons for this. First of all, the compromise reached in Council is a very fragile one, and it would not serve anybody’s interests to open the Pandora’s box of detailed, technical or politically sensitive amendments. A conciliation would delay this review, for which there is already a need, and it might also stop the legislation from ever seeing the light of day. Secondly, the two common positions strike a good balance between investor protection and investment freedom. As I say, the majority of those changes we proposed last time have been introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">There are nonetheless certain unresolved issues. In my opinion, these are better tackled in a wider context. The committee was kind enough to follow my recommendations. There is therefore only one amendment to UCITS-1, setting out some guidelines for a future review process. A ‘grandfather’ clause is also proposed, whereby existing funds should not have to comply with the new legislation for a transitional period. There is also an amendment to UCITS-2, seeking to align the review period for the capital requirement with the general review.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the committee’s reading, I have been in contact with the Council, as recently as a few hours ago, and also with the Commission. Together with Mr Goebbels, I am therefore tabling a new amendment to reduce the transitional period. In this way, it will be possible to introduce the UCITS directive into the Member States by 2005, that is to say the year in which the financial action plan is to be implemented. The purpose of this is to avoid conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">The work on renewing the regulations governing UCITS has been going on for as long as twelve years and is a clear example of why decision-making within this area needs to be reformed. If Europe is to have a chance of competing with, for example, the American economy, it will have to be possible for changes of a more technical nature to take place significantly more simply and quickly. There is now a good balance between a well-functioning market and reasonably secure protection for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has been proactive and shown an ability to act quickly and to compromise when it really counts. May we continue along that route! Well thought-out, prompt and effective legislation – that is what Europe needs.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to end by thanking everyone involved: the Commissioner, his efficient and friendly colleagues and my fellow MEPs who have all really shown willing during this difficult period. I hope that, tomorrow, we can thus draw a line under twelve years’ work for the benefit of Europe’s consumers and investors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issue of concern to us, however technical it is, is of extraordinary political and social importance because it is widely known that undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), including pension funds, are currently the preferred form of saving for the majority of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The first problem we came up against was that there were two directives: one called a ‘product’ directive, which allowed these bodies to invest in products from which they were hitherto denied access, and another, which proposed substantially increasing capital requirements. Both the Commission and Parliament were tempted to immediately adopt the so-called ‘product’ directive and delay the adoption of the so-called ‘management’ directive. This Parliament warned that it was dangerous to allow these undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities – which, I repeat monopolise the market in public savings – to move into deeper waters without any guarantee that their ships were prepared for what would be a more daring day’s sailing than they had hitherto embarked on.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur indicated, the purpose of the first discussion – and I am limiting myself here to the product directive – was to decide what they could invest in. He referred to non-standardised derivatives, index funds, the cascade effect, etc., which are technical issues that I will not go into now. What I do want to say is that, in my group’s opinion, a balance has been achieved between giving greater opportunities to management bodies and, therefore, greater opportunities to investors and the protection, the caution, that must be present in any discussion of such delicate matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament wanted to send a message to the Commission. As on previous occasions, Parliament wants to be flexible on the adoption of the directives of the financial services action plan. We want this directive to be adopted rapidly and we do not, therefore, want to have to go to conciliation. We have therefore, limited our amendments to one – which I personally am not in favour of, although I will be voting for it – which consists of creating a ‘grandfather’ clause, in other words, creating a transitional period so that currently existing bodies have additional time in which to raise their capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention has been made of another amendment by Mr Goebbels, which he is going to withdraw, but I think it is extraordinarily intelligent and is the second message that Parliament is sending to the Commission. The first, I repeat, is not tabling amendments that cannot be accepted by the Council and the Commission. The second, even though we are not involved in a Lamfalussy procedure, is to warn that we will always have to be flexible. We will always show willingness to be flexible on the legislative procedure, but we are not prepared to concede the codecision powers that Parliament has taken such a long time to gain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are, in all likelihood, going to withdraw that agreement, depending on the replies which Commissioner Bolkestein is soon to give us.

Nor is it appropriate in the context of the ongoing discussions over Lamfalussy. Indeed, I would go as far to say that by insisting on call-back, which was not a phrase which appeared in Parliament's second resolution on this subject after the Stockholm Council, we risk calling into question our <span class="italic">bona fides</span> in the lengthy negotiations which some of us have undertaken with Mr Bolkestein.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope, therefore, that the people who have put forward this amendment will withdraw it, and that discussions will take place in an appropriate place.

You want call-back, Mr Goebbels, I want call-back and so does Mr Bolkestein. The fact remains that it is not feasible to have a legal call-back within the terms of the Treaty. Therefore, it is up to us to find a political agreement and a form of words which will do until 2004 when we can review this whole issue. Indeed I believe the Commission is committed to such a review. It is vitally important that we come to this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">On Mr Schmidt's report, it is excellent to see the modernisation of the framework for UCITS by the inclusion of derivatives and OTC derivatives. Parliament is leading the way on this, and Mr Schmidt has played a particularly successful role in updating the directives in this way and very much led the way on the derivatives issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to see the capital requirements in the form that they are. I believe that UCITS managers should be subject to capital requirements, but I do not believe those contained in the directive are sufficiently risk-sensitive. I do not believe that they are consistent with the general framework that we hope to implement. I do not think that assessing capital according to risk under management actually reflects the risk undertaken. I am also concerned that this formulation of the directive will produce an uneven market opening, leaving the market closed in one Member State and open in the other 14. But I have been persuaded by the rapporteur and our esteemed shadow rapporteur not to table amendments on these defects because we are very keen to get these two directives on the statute book to modernise the framework for a unit trust and UCITS in the European Union. I commend the directive to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Scotland, there is a long tradition of investment management going back to the opening of the American west in the 19th century. These investment managers were usually law firms, private partnerships, which managed the assets of their clients very successfully. To this day, there are investment firms of this type, private partnerships, sole proprietorships and other structures with limited capital. The interests of clients are fully safeguarded as their assets are held by independent and fully capitalised and regulated depositories.</p>
<p class="contents">It is largely irrelevant to set capital requirements on the investment management firms themselves. I am relieved that the Council has reduced slightly the capital requirements set by this Parliament at first reading and has set a top limit of EUR 10 million. But this is still substantial for private partnerships and sole proprietorships. Incidentally, the largest and most successful firms in America and in the world – Fidelity is a good example – are exactly of this type.</p>
<p class="contents">The requirements of this type will be a hurdle for new enterprising entrants into an industry which requires a regular injection of new blood. At the very least, it should provide for this capital to be available by means of guarantees from banks or by insurance policies to cover professional and operational risk. But the common position, for some not very apparent reason, restricts such cover to only 50% of the requirement. Why? The common position provides for the Commission to report on this matter within five years of entry into force of the directive. I should like to put on record now the request that such a report should specifically consider whether any capital requirement at all is necessary for investment management companies, and certainly that it should be greatly reduced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lulling (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, while, in many areas, the European legislation which we produce here is often openly criticised – quite rightly – we should recognise that the 1985 directive on undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities was, for once, a masterpiece. The success it has had in the investment fund sector and with the clients of these funds bears witness to this. It has also become an example for legislation on a world scale. Since it entered into force in 1989, not only have the assets of the UCITSs increased dramatically, but also cross-border trade has developed very strongly. It has therefore achieved the objectives it was intended for.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if, after ten years, this directive needs a ‘facelift’ in order to adapt to the evolution of the markets, to the increasingly sophisticated financial products available, I remain concerned about the fate of the older funds, which do not meet the new demands. That is why I had advocated a clause for these funds, a so-called ‘grandfather’ clause, which would be unrestricted. Also in this field there are acquired rights, which it would be unfair to modify in a backdated fashion. If there is no such clause, there will be a significant risk of market insecurity, which would have disastrous effects on the performance of the funds, prejudicing not only the industry but also the investors. And above all, the weaker consumers, who do not keep so up-to-date with financial matters and who therefore react more slowly to them, will be the most affected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has finally expressed its preference for a clause which is restricted in time. This is the lesser evil, even if this clause may have negative effects, in terms of competition, for the older UCITSs, all of which will probably not be able to adapt to the new provisions of the directive in the best operational and financial conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I therefore hope that the House will vote in favour of this restricted clause. Please allow me to point out that I am also opposed to the amendment by Mr Goebbels, which would have the effect of delaying, indeed sacrificing, the modified directive, which we are able to live with, despite its shortcomings – but it would appear to be a lost cause from the outset. Mr Goebbels would do well, I believe, to withdraw his amendment. He can put it in cold storage until there is a better occasion to table it once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of my staff – about whom Mr Schmidt had some extremely kind words to say – I thank the rapporteur, and the Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their extremely constructive approach on these important files. The common positions are crucial elements for delivering the FSAP – the financial services action plan – on time, in other words, by the year 2003 for an integrated European Union for securities markets and 2005 overall. These proposals, taken as a whole, represent a highly delicate and complex compromise which the Commission fully supports, as does European industry. That is an important fact to bear in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the capitalisation of the UCITS market – nearly EUR 4 trillion – the expected benefits to be had are large. Firstly, the proposals will widen the set of financial instruments eligible to be used in UCITS portfolios while enhancing risk management requirements. Thus they will provide greater financial diversity while keeping the original concept, namely risk diversification with the highest standards of investor protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the management companies which generally run these savings schemes will enjoy a European passport and will be allowed to provide additional services to customers who request, for example, individual management of their assets. But they will have to comply with a comprehensive set of requirements and rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, investor information will be strongly improved by detailed disclosure of risk profiles, along with a fully harmonised, simplified prospectus to play the role of a single, investor-friendly pan-European marketing tool.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I come to the amendments tabled. I should like to stress that the provisions contained in the first three amendments, namely the twin review clauses and the grandfathering clause, pose some difficulties for us – not because of the substance, but with the timetables proposed in each case. We would much prefer a single deadline for both, that is, 2005 – the date of the conclusion of the financial services action plan, which we think would be more logical.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in a spirit of compromise and because we must now lay this matter to rest after twelve years of discussion, and in recognition of the efforts this Parliament has undertaken, also considering the last amendment of the rapporteur with would shorten the grandfathering period foreseen in Amendment No 1, the Commission will, in the end, support Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to Amendment No 4, which would introduce a so-called "call-back" clause regarding the UCITS Contact Committee. I should like to be clear that this is not acceptable to the Commission. We believe that it would not be acceptable for the Council either. It is not acceptable to the Commission because firstly, the clause which has been tabled is not compatible with Article 202 of the Treaty, as Mr Goebbels knows full well. It is also in contradiction with existing comitology rules. Of that, Mr Goebbels is also aware.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption from Mr Goebbels)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Not before 2004, Mr Goebbels, as I have explained on behalf of the Commission many, many times.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason why this amendment is not acceptable to the Commission is that the UCITS Contact Committee's mandate was discussed by Parliament at first reading. Parliament then gave its full support to the mandate of the UCITS Contact Committee. Indeed, the first common position fully incorporated what this Parliament wanted. So I suggest that Mr Goebbels does not back-track on what Parliament has previously agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reason why that amendment is unacceptable to the Commission is that accepting it would lead to an institutional dispute in conciliation and seriously put at risk the adoption of both directives. That is the last thing the Commission and – I assume – this Parliament would want.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us agree on Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3. In particular, I would address the following words to Mr Purvis, who referred to the United States' system, which is different from the European system. Depositing is fundamental for the European system. We are going to consider updating, following the Ecofin Council of December that the European form of UCITS need capital because they cannot assume debts in order to provide themselves with working capital. That is possible in the United States. Therefore the need to provide such undertakings in the United States with capital is less than in Europe. Once again, the European undertakings cannot use debts for their working capital and therefore must provide themselves with capital.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the vote will be taken tomorrow and I hope we can now agree to Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 and to the proposals as such. This would allow us to move ahead constructively for the sake of European investors, European industry and the European economy. I hope that after twelve years of discussions these proposals can now find their way to the statute book. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
