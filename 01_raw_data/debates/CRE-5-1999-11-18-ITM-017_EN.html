<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rühle (Greens/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur </span>– <span class="italic">(DE)</span> I wish to thank you all for waiting so long as we have been relatively busy today and for a long time we did not know when the report would come up. However, today and tomorrow I should like to be able to vote on the procedures of guarantees by the Community for the European Investment Bank, the EIB for short, because if possible, we want to decide before the Council and because we also want to make certain changes, which I shall refer to in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">The provision of these guarantees concerns the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, Latin America, Asia and South Africa. It relates to the period up to the year 2003 under my proposal, to be precise until 31 January 2003, then there will be a review half way through and we shall then deal with it again or extend it until 31 January 2007. It involves a sum of EUR 9 475 million and the provision of guarantees amounting to a maximum of 60%. There are few inconsistencies in this regard. The inconsistencies are to be found in other areas. The main problem area with which my report deals, which became clearer as I worked on the report, is that the European Investment Bank, as far as modern business management, transparency and public work are concerned, is trailing rather far behind.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the people I have spoken to have explained that the European Investment Bank is trailing some twenty years behind the World Bank as far as modern business management is concerned. I therefore believe it is important that we deal with this subject more intensively. The European Investment Bank is the largest public bank in Europe, its general owners are the Member States and it works primarily with low-interest loans. Owing to the fact that its shareholders do not expect high interest rates and the thus possible low gearing rate, that is the ratio of the lending volume to equity capital, of 2.5 – market rates are usually over 10 – the Bank enjoys considerable confidence on the capital markets. This high level of confidence on the capital markets enables it to take up loans under favourable conditions and to on-lend at accordingly favourable rates. Furthermore, the Bank enjoys tax exemption and not least, guarantees from the EU budget for political risks too.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this direct and indirect assistance to the Bank from the European Union, the EIB is keen to appear to the public as a quite ordinary bank and in the past that was how it justified its relative inaccessibility for cooperation and monitoring to the public compared to other public institutions like the World Bank. In our view, that should and must now change as a matter of urgency. My report therefore also deals first and foremost with the subjects of accountability and transparency, that is, modern business practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few years there has been a lot of criticism of the internal administration and business management of the EIB. Nevertheless, for a long time the Bank refused to allow the Court of Auditors or OLAF to inspect its books, invoking its special nature as a bank. The particular “constipation” of the EIB in matters of public monitoring and transparency even led the ECOFIN Council on 8 August 1999 to state the following, and I quote: “In view of the important financial task assigned to the European Investment Bank by the Treaty and a series of Community regulations, it must take an exemplary attitude to fraud control and allow OLAF, where necessary, to undertake inspections. The Council does not doubt that the governing body of the Bank will shortly submit a proposal to their board of governors for a decision in accordance with the inter-institutional agreement.”</p>
<p class="contents">We are now seeing the first signs that the Bank will open its books. However, in my view they are not yet adequate and there is still mistrust. This mistrust is increased further by its dealings to date with Mr Blak, the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgetary Control, who has been waiting for a long time to answers to his questions. I should like once again to thank the Committee on Budgetary Control for its preparatory work in this regard, which has allowed me in the short time available to draw up this report, and I should especially like to thank Mr Blak and Mrs Theato.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future we shall also have to watch the development of the EIB with regard to more transparency and for all sceptics, it is also a matter of economic efficiency. A business that cuts itself off will be taking its decisions on a very narrow basis. Dialogue with society in general, as the World Bank, among others, has been practising in the meantime, also provides information for investment decisions. Here, also, the Bank has been criticised in the past, both regarding its investments in the health sector in my own country, that particularly consolidate antiquated structures and in the transport and environment sectors in Eastern Europe. It cannot and may not suffice in the future for the Bank to restrict itself to the isolated inspection of individual projects – such as, for example a section of motorway -, it must also inspect the projects in context – for example within a transport development plan in a particular country, in order to be able to identify duplication and to develop an acceptable and financially sustainable alternative. For this reason the Bank should undertake a public relations offensive in the regions that have received assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should therefore in the next few years direct its attention to the development of the EIB. The bases are set out in my report and I hope that they will be adopted tomorrow. Thank you very much! I have overrun a little, but I wanted you to understand what this report is all about because the report is all Greek to most people!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am the newly appointed rapporteur on the EIB, the European Central Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the amendments proposed by Mrs Rühle as they express clearly real concerns about the EIB's transparency, efficacy, accountability and conformity with the Community's objectives and policies. I will address briefly each of these concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is widespread concern about the EIB's transparency. My predecessor from the Socialist Group, Mr Freddy Blak, Mrs Rühle, the author of the report, many Members of Parliament and the Court of Auditors have all expressed their opinion about the lack of transparency in the operations of the EIB. Even the World Bank and the East European NGO called Bankwatch have publicly stated this view.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, let me turn to efficacy. Mrs Rühle states the need to evaluate the effectiveness of EIB operations. I, as the new rapporteur for the Bank, requested Sir Brian Unwin, the President of the EIB, for an initial meeting to set out a framework to assess the efficiency of the Bank. I am sorry to report to this House that Sir Brian has not even bothered to ring me or arrange to meet despite numerous telephone reminders. Such disregard for this new European Parliament will erode, yet again, public respect and confidence in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what about public accountability? In May 1999, my predecessor, Mr Blak, Vice-President of CoCobu, asked 26 specific questions about alleged fraud, mismanagement, corruption and cover-up – I mean cover-up – in the Bank's activities, including in treasury operations, over the period 1993-1998. The questions are specific, detailed and relevant. They require a written response from the Bank. I have asked Sir Brian for such a response but, once again, he has chosen to ignore my request. I have been told by Mr Martí, one of his vice-presidents, that the EIB is owned by the Member States and, as such, according to the Treaty, it is not an EU institution obliged to respond to the European Parliament, the Court of Auditors or OLAF. Only matters relating to loans to non-EU countries where the Community gives loan guarantees can be discussed with Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask this House, what are the Member States? Are they not the governments of the people who live, work and pay taxes in the countries that we call Member States? Are we not, as the only elected representatives of the people of these Member States, expected to safeguard the interests of the people who live in the Member States? Does the Treaty specifically forbid the European Parliament from having access to information? Certainly not. Therefore, if the EIB is confident that it functions well and has nothing to hide, why is Sir Brian Unwin, its president, denying access to Parliament, the Court of Auditors and OLAF?</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the Treaty needs to be amended to specify such access in bold print. I suggest that those involved in the IGC take note. Clearly there is support for this as Ecofin, in its meeting on 8 October in Tampere, reinforced its previous criticisms of the EIB's management and performance by directing it to open its doors to OLAF and the Court of Auditors. I have seen the decision taken by the EIB concerning this directive and according to paragraphs 5 and 6 of the decision taken by the Bank it will not open its doors to OLAF. It is about time this House told the Bank to open its doors to OLAF and the Court of Auditors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to this budgetary boost, it is also essential to strengthen support for Turkey by means of credit on favourable terms, and we therefore support the rate of risk cover by the Community budget. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it was with a certain amount of pleasure that we received the news, recently, that the European Investment Bank has finally accepted the scrutiny of its management by Community institutions. In any event, we think that it is essential for the forthcoming revision of the Treaty to establish the European Investment Bank as an institution under the full control of the Community, under the supervision of the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament, so that it does not merely answer to a general assembly of Member States, as it seeks to do at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as all the Bank’s activity is supported by a considerable Community budget effort, which guarantees the risks linked to banking activity, the scrutiny of its accounts must be developed with the utmost rigour and care. When both Parliament and public opinion were surprised at information published in the press, according to which an institution that we thought was involved entirely in structural investments had lost very considerable sums in short-term speculative operations, it became clear that there was a need to scrutinise the EIB’s investment policy thoroughly. </p>
<p class="contents">The multiplying effect of a banking guarantee means that investments resulting from EIB credits are of crucial importance in the context of policies subsidised by the Community budget. It would not, therefore, be reasonable, through this guarantee, to support different policies from those decided on by the European Union. This is not a question of interfering in commercial lending policy, a matter which is the sole competence of the EIB’s management, but merely of guaranteeing respect for democratic decisions and for stringent, transparent rules. The EIB is the trustee of a valuable Community inheritance, both from the point of view of the actions that it has helped to implement and from the point of view of the amounts of money that it has accumulated. We are sure that the EIB will continue to play this role in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reports by Mrs Rühle and Mr Seppänen both concern the same issue: guarantees against loans granted to the European Investment Bank. In itself, the European Investment Bank is an excellent instrument for financing specific projects. As the EIB has a high degree of creditworthiness, it can acquire cheap capital from the markets and target it at those areas the EU considers necessary. In this way the direct need for financial aid diminishes. There is a budget guarantee for those loans for which the EIB is responsible on behalf of the EU, which amounts to 70%. Now the matter being raised is the reduction of this figure. The Commission is proposing 60%, but the Council has decided on a provisional rate of 65%. For that reason, Parliament must first determine its position on what the correct rate should be.</p>
<p class="contents">In determining the percentage figure our starting point is that the EU should bear the principal political risk relating to the financing of projects. This means that if the political situation in a country in which a project is to be carried out continues as predicted, there is only a financial risk attached to lending. That is normally the responsibility of the party granting the loan. In fact, the EU guarantee has also borne part of the financial risk, as these two different factors cannot be clearly distinguished from one another. The percentage rate obviously has a bearing on how many loans can be guaranteed by a sum that is contained in the financial perspectives and which is at present EUR 200 million. In practice, changing the rate may not have an effect except as a means of regulating the overall amount of loans, as the guarantees do not often have to be paid.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, with these remarks I would like to express my support for the reports by Mrs Rühle and Mr Seppänen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bringing new countries from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean area into the EU, like developing cooperation with other neighbouring countries, is not just a question of reaching good agreements. It is at least as much a question of in actual fact developing these countries’ societies and economies so that they can manage the new environment they are to be integrated into. It is therefore a serious matter that it is now so unclear how much confidence can be placed in the Bank. </p>
<p class="contents">The content and consequences of the EIB’s programmes must be developed in such a way that loans vigorously support the European Union’s political objectives. The rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets particularly point out that the Bank’s projects must support important objectives, including the European Parliament’s decisions concerning, for example, the fight against poverty, the defence of democracy and human rights and the protection of the environment. </p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the European Union must continue to back the EIB and guarantee its loans, especially against political risks. We take a favourable view of the desire that now exists to carry out assessments in such a way that differentiation takes place on the basis of how risks and financing opportunities appear in different parts of the world. It is also important, however, not only to make improvements to the programmes themselves. Instead, there must also be improved public scrutiny of the Bank’s activities. For example, it is important that the Bank should work with clear, assessable objectives so that we might in actual fact ensure that the resources are used efficiently. This is also important in order for us to be able to learn from the results of the Bank’s activities and use our analyses to develop activities in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of my colleagues have spoken of the importance of openness. I shall just touch briefly upon this issue. All EU institutions, like the EIB, must now subject themselves to more stringent monitoring and supervision. That is why we are now demanding increased openness. It ought to be obvious that both OLAF and the Court of Auditors should have access to all documents which are required for the purposes of good supervision. That is the significance of the important amendment No 5, and something which I understand that the Bank has now in fact begun to consider agreeing to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been a real pleasure to work together on this matter. The European Investment Bank is an important tool in connection with aid to developing countries but, in order to help, the Bank needs loan guarantees provided by the EU. The guarantees are necessary if the Bank’s potential is to be used fully. I should therefore like to recommend the report, but I also have just a couple of remarks about the Investment Bank. </p>
<p class="contents">Combating fraud, muddle and incompetence in the EU’s systems is incredibly important. If we do not overcome the fraudulent use of taxpayers’ money, the population of Europe is never going to regard us in a positive light. It makes cooperation more difficult. Combating fraud is therefore something which should be given the highest priority everywhere. This also applies to the Investment Bank. In the Committee on Budgetary Control, we have fought a hard struggle over six years to obtain an insight into the Bank’s affairs and, yesterday, we finally got an agreement in regard to supervision of the Bank by the fraud office, OLAF. I think, however, that it is incredible that it should have been necessary to exert pressure on the Bank in connection with its guarantees from the EU before it became at all possible to talk with its officials. It ought not to have been necessary for us to take steps of that kind. I will put it like this: it would have been easier to enter Fort Knox in the United States than it was to enter the doors of the Investment Bank. The fact that the Bank has now been opened up means that OLAF can ask for information from the Bank. It also means that the Bank should turn to OLAF whenever it discovers fraud. Then, things will really have started to move. </p>
<p class="contents">Basically, the Investment Bank has now undertaken to cooperate to the maximum with OLAF in order to get to grips with fraud involving taxpayers’ money. The only way in which we can obtain a better relationship with the population of Europe is by being open and showing that we are using their money honestly and properly. The Bank has therefore decided that OLAF must begin an investigation when it comes to the matter of EU resources. This is in actual fact a tremendous victory for Parliament, and I therefore want to say that it has been a pleasure for me to lead this struggle. Now, my colleague can take over, and I am quite sure that he will be a very popular man throughout the Bank. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes Mira,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like to make two comments, one concerning the main objective of the subject of today’s debate, the guarantee by Union budgets of the external loans of the EIB, and another on the issues which I know concern this Parliament especially, those of transparency and the efficient use of the Bank’s resources.</p>
<p class="contents">First point: In the ECOFIN of 8 November, a political agreement was reached on the Commission’s proposal of 23 April. It is true that the Member States still have some reservations. With the favourable opinion of the European Parliament we hope to approve this Council decision in the next meeting of the Council on the 29th of this month. The issue is especially relevant, given its urgency, insofar as we do not have a lot of time to implement the new procedure, since the current system ends at the end of January and we need to reach a bilateral agreement between the Bank and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I would like to thank you for the work on the budget, especially Mrs Rühle, for her invaluable cooperation on this specific issue of the forecast of the issues. Having said this, I would also like to tell her that, with regard to the report, many issues have been accepted, while others we have not been able to accept for either technical or economic reasons. Our positions are perfectly well known and I do not know if it is worth repeating them. I would simply insist perhaps on the last proposal, which refers to amendment 11. As we have already told you, we think that it is much better, on the subject of the definition of policies, to speak of a solution by means of a Commission declaration to the Council rather than a modification of the decision.</p>
<p class="contents">However the problem which has been of most concern in today’s debate is that of transparency and the efficient use of Community resources. It is clearly not a new issue and many of you have worked on it for many years, and I would like to be a little less negative than some of you. Less negative in the sense that the framework of EIB relations with OLAF and the Court of Auditors is beginning to become clearer.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true – and some of you have said so – that, with regard to relations with the Court of Auditors, there is a problem of primary legislation which will clearly have to be amended, if the European Investment Bank is receive the same treatment as the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I insist once again that this issue is well-known, but no less important for being so: the Member States are the Bank’s shareholders and the Member States must take some decisions which, logically, do not correspond to other Community institutions. We are not talking about a greater or lesser degree of representation but rather simply a distribution of competences which at the time were defined in a particular way.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: Having said that, in what respect do I believe we have moved forward? I believe that we have moved forward greatly in the sense that the European Investment Bank has accepted that OLAF has all the information and means necessary to analyse the loans subsidised with Community funds, which must undoubtedly be our main concern.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we are still debating what will happen to the Bank’s activities in the cases where it uses own resources. And when we talk of own resources we are in fact talking about two different realities: loans with own resources and guarantees from the Union or loans without guarantees from the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like this principle of openness which has developed in relations with the Bank to move forward and that finally we may arrive at a result which is satisfactory to the Parliament and the European Investment Bank, without forgetting, as I said before, that the EIB is a financial institution which can provide information with no restriction on any kind of issue. It can provide information, with some restriction, to OLAF and, of course, with regard to the Court of Justice, the final position will have to be that which is decided in accordance with the amendment of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the debate has been enormously interesting and I hope that what I have heard today will not be an obstacle, however, so that we can move forward with the approval of the distribution of resources, the distribution of loans, as from next year and that Community procedures are not delayed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
