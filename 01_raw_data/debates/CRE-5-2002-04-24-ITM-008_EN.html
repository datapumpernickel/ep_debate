<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thorning-Schmidt (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, this is a splendid evening. I think that everyone who is concerned to secure a better working environment for European workers has reason to be satisfied. The Council and Parliament have succeeded in reaching agreement on a ground-breaking new directive. As far as I know, this is the very first time that genuinely binding rules have been laid down governing the shocks or vibrations to which workers are exposed in the course of their employment. That is why, of course, there have also been strong exchanges of opinion along the way. We have had a lively discussion as to whether the scientific basis was in order. We have heard from many, in fact a great many, lobbyists, and not all of them took a positive view of the preparation of these binding rules.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of this directive, we have, however, achieved recognition that vibrations – both hand and arm vibrations and whole body vibrations – constitute a health risk. That is gratifying, for damage to health may be associated with exposure to such vibrations in the course of one’s work. It is also gratifying that everyone – the Commission, the Council and Parliament – have agreed upon a method of limiting vibrations and other physical agents. The method involves introducing both action values and limit values that should never be exceeded. In the light of the fact that we are concerned here with a completely new area within legislation governing the working environment, I believe that the conciliation achieved is really good, and I should like to say that directly to Mr Herman Schmid and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left because the conciliation strikes a reasonable balance between commercial considerations and worker protection. It is a very big gain in itself that we are now in actual fact acquiring a directive. It is not something we knew all along that we would obtain, but all European countries are now obliged to take the problem of shocks and vibrations completely seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I have therefore accepted that the limit value for whole-body vibrations should be set at that level proposed by the Council in the common position. When the directive has been in force for a certain amount of time, we must see whether, on the occasion of a future revision, we can reduce the limit value further. There has been a lot of focus upon whole-body vibrations, but I should like to emphasise that Parliament has in actual fact reduced the action value from 0.6 m/sec2 to 0.5 m/sec2. That, I think, is a very important victory, since the action value is a very crucial figure. Why is that the case? Well, it is because it in actual fact entails a duty on the part of employers to take the problem of vibrations seriously and to actively prevent workers from being exposed to powerful vibrations. When the action values are exceeded, employers must come up with practical action – that is why they are called action values – by, for example, changing the way in which the work is organised or investing in better equipment. It is precisely this method which, on the one hand, provides flexibility and, on the other hand, attaches a very great deal of importance to prevention in preference to actual orders and bans. It is this preventive effort which, in my view, is the most important thing for employers now to begin to engage in.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the conciliation creates a good framework for a sensible implementation of the provisions of the directive. The reports, which are to be implemented at the same time as the directive is implemented, must also contain examples of good practice. In that way, good experiences in one Member State can contribute to other countries’ learning something from these. It is the same principle which we have just been talking about with regard to employment policy and which can perhaps also be used within the working environment. Transition periods will of course be required to ensure that industry is given time to adjust to these new provisions, but the Council’s common position contained a number of transition periods which were a little too long, and this matter too has also been successfully straightened out. In the cases of agriculture and forestry, to which special conditions apply, there is still, however, a transition period of as long as twelve years. That is a long time, but it means that we shall be quite certain that these businesses too are able to adjust to the new provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also put forward a couple of critical observations. It is difficult for ordinary people who are not involved with the EU on a daily basis to understand that it takes such a long time to prepare a directive. When people hear that the first proposal concerning physical agents goes right back to 1992, the reactions are very critical. Can it be right that it should take us more than ten years to complete the negotiations for putting a directive in place? It does not increase people’s faith in the decision-making process. I would therefore once again urge the Commission to table proposals for directives on the two physical agents for which there are still no directives, namely electromagnetic fields and optical radiation. Turning now to something more positive, I would thank the Council and the Commission for their really fruitful cooperation, on a completely informal level too, and I would also thank the rapporteurs from the other political groups. The cooperation has been very constructive, and we have in actual fact ended up with a result that we can all be proud of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we see, for example, someone working with a pneumatic drill on the street, or a tractor driver sitting behind the steering wheel on a farm, these people – and I am not speaking as an expert in these matters – are probably not aware that they are facing a risk that could have serious consequences to their health. For this reason I believe that today is a day to celebrate because, despite the fact that nine years have passed – as Mrs Thorning-Schmidt said – this first directive of the four planned in the proposal presented by the Commission in 1992 has come to fruition. From this day forth, therefore, we shall be able to count on a series of protective measures to try to prevent these risks I was referring to from turning into a disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout this time, the Group of the Europe People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has maintained an attitude that has, more than anything, sought to encourage constructive work and a spirit of dialogue with all of the interested parties, with the aim of achieving better applicability of the provisions of the directive and, as a consequence of this, increased effectiveness of workers’ protection methods. For this reason we are particularly delighted that the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 8 April has taken into account the difficulties in applying this directive encountered by a large number of, mainly small, companies, and also by many economic sectors in the search for a compromise on limit values and on the implementation deadline for the requirements imposed by the new directive on companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Technically, the great reduction in the limit value for daily exposure to vibrations, as well as the setting of the daily exposure values, has allowed us to reach this agreement. I feel we have to welcome the fact that the Member States can have a longer period of time, until 2010, to apply the precautionary measures, as well as special consideration for the agricultural and forestry sectors, which in many Member States include a collection of small and very small companies, which have longer still to implement the measures, until 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I think that the desire to make improvements, an observation of reality and common sense are good examples and good formulae to work on in the hope that these new directives on the aforementioned risks and others that are still being studied can soon be approved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish, therefore, by congratulating the rapporteur, the Commission, Parliament, the Council, and above all, all the workers affected, because from today they will have an instrument in defence of their health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, having said that, I am very pleased that we have reached an agreement. It is not ideal, but it is better than it might have been. I would have liked it if we had kept the derogation for agriculture and forestry. That was extremely important, but I am pleased, however, that we have agreed that agricultural machinery will not have to be changed until 2014, that is, if the machinery has already been bought by 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that we have moved back to the common position limit value of 1.15 m/s2. It is far better than what the PSE Group rapporteur suggested in the first place, which was 0.7 m/s2. The PPE-DE Group suggested 0.8 m/s2. We have moved back to something that is reasonably sensible. If we had not, tractor and dumper-truck drivers would have had to drive their tractor or their dumper-truck for between two to four hours. There is still going to be a problem with harvest time, but most of industry can cope with this apart from the agriculture sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us who insisted that the levels suggested in the first edition of the report were unworkable won the day. I would like to congratulate everybody on the hard work they put in. We have achieved a worthwhile compromise. It is not ideal, but I will reluctantly be asking my group, ELDR, to vote for the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this I would like especially to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, and the Spanish Presidency of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This instrument introducing measures to protect workers from risks in the workplace arising from vibration represents an important step in the improvement of workers' health and safety. All workers in the Community are now ensured a minimum level of protection, which the individual Member States are able to go beyond. As you know, it was decided in 1999 to divide the original Commission proposal, which had applied to all of the four areas of vibration, noise, electromagnetic fields and optical radiation, into four individual proposals. The first step has now been taken and brought to its conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">As the second reading in plenary at Parliament's March part-session showed, we can also point to good progress in the problem area of noise. I am relying on Parliament and the Council to start work shortly on the regulations on the other two physical agents – optical and electromagnetic radiation – so that we can at length complete the legal framework for these important aspects of health and safety at work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
