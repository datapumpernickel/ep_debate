<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Breyer, for her report which responds to the question put forward by the Commission. The question was which foods should be allowed to be irradiated in the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission put this question to Parliament and the Council following a consultation of industry and consumer organisations and other interested parties. The consultation received a polarised response. Stakeholders were either totally against this technology or in favour of it. There would seem to be no common ground between these two camps.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, the European Union-wide positive list of products authorised for irradiation treatment contains only dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings. For the completion of this list, the Commission presented three options for discussion. The first option proposed allowing the irradiation of shrimps and frogs’ legs, as these foods are often imported from subtropical and tropical countries and a certain microbe content can hardly be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">The second option proposed to allow the irradiation of a number of foods in addition to shrimps and frogs’ legs, all of which have been, and continue to be, irradiated in the Member States in substantial amounts. Such foods include dried fruits, cereals, chicken, offal, egg white and gum arabic. The third option proposed that the current positive list should be regarded as complete, which would mean that only dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings could be irradiated in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The report adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy provides the possibility of adding further products to the current positive list if the safety of these products can be proven. The adoption of Amendments Nos 2 and 3 tabled by the rapporteur and other Members of Parliament would, however, result in the third option, which is the most restrictive one. The Commission will take note of Parliament's conclusions but must await the reaction of the Council before making any formal proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like, on behalf of my colleague, Mr Byrne, to take this opportunity to clarify a few points. First, I would like clearly to reiterate that the Scientific Committee on Food has concluded that irradiated foods are safe. This opinion is based on many scientific studies and is shared by the World Health Organisation and scientific bodies. Therefore, additional toxicology studies are not required, as the views of the scientific community are very clear on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many misconceptions about this technique. I would stress that not all foods can or will be irradiated. This is a similar situation to cooking and freezing: not all foods are cooked and not all foods are put in the refrigerator. Irradiation is just one method of food preservation. For some foods it is better than other techniques, for others it is not. The European Union has very strict labelling rules for irradiated foods. Even if a compound food contains only small amounts of irradiated ingredients, this fact has to be clearly indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have the technical tools to enforce correct labelling. The Commission has financed the development and standardisation of methods for the detection of irradiated foods. These methods are used by the food control authorities to check foods on the market. The first report of the Commission on food irradiation, published recently, shows that the overwhelming majority of foods on the market are correctly labelled. This means that consumers can choose freely between irradiated and non-irradiated products. I would also like to reiterate that current legislation already requests Member States to report the results of their checks on irradiation facilities and on food products. If products are detected by the food control authorities which do not comply with legal requirements, they have to be removed from the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I note that the report stigmatises third countries, in particular the United States and Brazil, for using this technique. I consider this to be inappropriate as our own Scientific Committee considers irradiated foods to be safe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report finds us again debating the extent to which food is irradiated in the Community and the ways in which this should be regulated. The end of the 1990s saw the adoption of a directive, after lengthy debate, which allows only dried aromatic herbs and spices to be irradiated in the EU. The EU is now, again, faced with the decision as to whether only herbs and spices should continue to be permitted to be irradiated, whether this list should be extended to include a few foods with problematic hygiene conditions, such as frogs' legs and prawns, or whether the list should include foods permitted to be irradiated by the transitional arrangements in the individual states, such as potatoes, poultry, vegetables, prawns, shellfish, frogs' legs or protein.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission – as the Commissioner has just made clear – lists these three options in its communication and thus more or less leaves it to us in Parliament to decide which of them to approve. In its report, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has in fact come to a contradictory decision on the subject, which, I believe, the Commissioner has briefly addressed. On the one hand, the demand is made in item 3 that we should take note of the Commission proposal and regard the present list as complete, and the view is expressed that further herbs, spices and seasonings derived from plants should be allowed to be irradiated in the EU only if this is scientifically recognised as being harmless and efficient. At the same time, in item 4, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes that irradiated products, which are numerous in some Member States, should be added to the positive list in so far as this technology can make certain foodstuffs safer.</p>
<p class="contents">What this actually does is to make clear our lack of an unambiguous position, as, on the one hand, we state in item 3 that we want a very restrictive decision, whilst, contrariwise, in item 4 making it clear that we favour a decision that goes further. Parliament, though, is quite clear about its position, expressed in item 5 of the report, which is that each foodstuff must be subjected to detailed analysis before any proposal is submitted to add it to the positive list, the object being to demonstrate that each of the conditions for authorising food irradiation have been met in accordance with Annex I of the 1999 directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication makes clear, and the Commissioner has just said equally clearly, that there is in fact no consumer demand for food irradiation, that indeed the greater part of the food industry rejects it and declares it to be superfluous. Even Eurotoc, an independent association of consumers promoting healthy eating – with whose chefs we are all familiar – has made it clear that the irradiation of food is incompatible with its conception of its own purpose and gained, within only a few days, quite enormous approval for its resolution rejecting food irradiation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this makes it clear that the directive on irradiation deserves to be strongly criticised and its presuppositions refuted. There is one thing that we must be clear in our own minds about, and that is that irradiation only makes any sense if it is used to conceal and draw a veil over hygiene conditions that are unacceptable to our way of thinking and are perhaps simulating for the benefit of consumers a quality which is in fact absent. Only then does it make sense to treat food with radiation, as, if hygiene conditions were good, there could be no misgivings about the products and they would not need to be irradiated.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that irradiation is principally about keeping foodstuffs fresh throughout long journeys. Prawns are a prime example of this, in that they are taken from northern Germany to Morocco to be peeled. That too – as we have heard from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism – should of course be seen in a very critical light in terms of an environmentally sound transport policy, and our committee has often called for the mainstreaming of environmental policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, by way of conclusion, do other than to reiterate that in items 3 and 5 the committee has adopted very divergent positions, and tomorrow's vote will show whether we will take our stand on the side of consumers and of consumer protection, or whether we will make concessions to the industry, which has engaged in energetic lobbying over recent weeks. I believe that we should all be aware that irradiation should be viewed in a highly critical light, that it can also involve certain risks, not all of which we may at present be aware, and that consumers reject it. I hope that our decision tomorrow will be in favour of consumer protection, enabling the Commission and the Council to get on with their work, that we will also somewhat clarify the Committee on the Environment's rather contradictory report, and will be able to come up with an unambiguous position, one that will serve as a basis for further work by the Council and the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Grossetête (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I have always believed that consumer and health protection should take precedence over all other considerations. Compliance with the precautionary principle, however, does not mean preventing any technological progress in the field of processing foods.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the ionisation of foods, therefore, the communication from the European Commission – because I must specify that this is indeed a communication and not a legislative text – emphasises that the scientific community believes that irradiating foods poses no risk to consumer health if good manufacturing practices are applied. Nonetheless, ionisation must not, of course, be used to compensate for negligence with regard to hygiene.</p>
<p class="contents">I found the draft report that Mrs Breyer presented to us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy last September particularly disappointing. It is essential that we avoid the confusion caused by some Members. What we are discussing here is the content of the report by Mrs Breyer and not the Commission communication. I would, however, like to tell Mrs Breyer that I have not been subject to any pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, following the adoption of most of my amendments and those of Mr Bowis, was adopted unanimously by the Parliamentary committee. My group considered that a balance had been struck and that this report could be accepted as it was, even though some particularly crowd-pleasing paragraphs remained. Paragraph 14, for example, adds nothing at all to the report. The Member for the Green Party considers that it should be obligatory for food manufacturers to prevent risks to workers, human health and the environment. How can we retain our credibility in the eyes of consumers if we restrict ourselves to this type of statement?</p>
<p class="contents">We must concentrate on taking practical decisions that increase consumer safety effectively. It was to this end that I tabled the amendments adopted in committee seeking to increase controls to prevent illegally-ionised products from being placed on the market. On the other hand, since ionisation has proved to be extremely useful for destroying micro-organisms or insects present in certain types of foods, I believe it is reasonable not to close the door to this kind of treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I do not share the rapporteur’s views on the transport of goods. I believe it is beneficial today to be able to import and export products that could not have been transported in the past. Spices, for example, can be transported over extremely long distances. I do not see how preserving foods for longer compromises the objective of sustainable development that we all want to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to make a general comment. I believe it is thoroughly regrettable that Parliament is prepared to speak and draft reports on every and any communication from the European Commission. This kind of procedure was useful when we were only being consulted. Today, however, it would be more effective and more logical if we concentrated on our legislative work. We would earn increased respect, we would streamline our overloaded agenda and be able to spend more time on legislative procedures, and lastly, we would avoid doing the work of the Commission by establishing our position on a dossier before even having received a proposal from the Commission. I shall not say any more on this matter, which, in my opinion, did not really need further amendments or another debate in plenary. Devoting a significant amount of time to a report on a Commission communication, for just three amendments tabled in plenary, does not seem to me to be behaviour worthy of the debates we should hold here in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that it is right for Parliament to be consulted. We believe that in a number of areas which are contentious – for example, the dangers of non-ionising radiation – not enough is known within the science for us to pass this by.</p>
<p class="contents">My group will also support the amendment, which other colleagues and I have signed in the name of the Socialist Group, for the deletion of paragraph 4. Why do we do that? Not because we necessarily disagree with the Scientific Committee on the issue of whether radiation can be safe for foodstuffs, but because it is not the whole story. The question is, why is this being done? Is it really for the benefit of the consumer? Is it something for which there is a consumer demand? If that was the case, we would not have as many cases as there are, certainly in my country, of illegal and covert irradiation. This has been carried out because they do not want consumers to know about it. They particularly do not want people to know about and reflect upon the trade which is more concerned with cost-cutting than with the end product in terms of consumer satisfaction. Mrs Breyer referred to shrimps being taken from one market to another, peeled in one continent and brought back to another. This is not due to safety concerns or the attractiveness of the product: it is all about the profits that go into this business.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the Commission's options as presented, we, like the rapporteur, take the view that the list should not be further extended at this stage. The onus of proof continues to be on those who wish to do these things. The proof has not yet been provided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was very similar to the debate on GM foods we have today. It is a fact that unified scientific opinion, the WHO and the FAO say that irradiation in itself is not at all hazardous. It is therefore safe to say that recitals I and J of this report are quite misleading. The technology is presumably good for those parts of the world in which food safety quite simply means having anything at all to eat.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I would, however, also insist that there is no reason whatsoever in modern Europe for irradiating anything other than, specifically, spices. That is something there are good reasons for doing, because other methods of sterilising spices are still less appropriate from health and environmental points of view. In other cases, it is unnecessary to use this technology in a part of the world, and in a system, in which we work incredibly hard to create a high level of safety throughout the food chain. If we maintain a sufficiently high level of hygiene, apply good production practice and ensure that the refrigeration and freezing chain remains unbroken, we have no need for a technology that <span class="italic">may </span>– and I am not saying that this always happens – be misused to conceal a lack of hygiene or deficiencies in the refrigeration chain etc. It is a touch too difficult to monitor this. Naturally, we can say that this treatment is all right, if it is only apparent from the labelling, but I think that the risks of this technology’s being abused are too great. I do not believe it is dangerous, but I think it is extremely inappropriate for ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead, quite a few Member States should be exercising tighter control over the irradiation of food that ought not to be irradiated.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to tighten up the report by adopting Amendments Nos 2 and 3 and so making these constitute Parliament’s position.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an obvious risk of irradiation’s being used to conceal poor hygiene or the fact that food is too old really to be put on the market. We have no reason to permit methods that make this possible. It is also a fact that, if it is irradiated so that it will keep longer, food is in danger of losing some of its nutritional value and so becoming less good for consumers. I believe that consumers are thereby in a way being tricked into buying things that are not of the same quality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also partly a question of what kind of agricultural and food policy we are to have. Are we to have extremely large-scale production of goods transported over very long distances and with long shelf-lives, or are we to develop an agricultural and food policy based upon most food’s being produced locally and delivered and consumed within reasonable periods? We recommend the latter alternative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Every year, many people die as a result of poisoning by Salmonella and Campylobacter in chicken, for example. These bacteria can be controlled by chemicals, such as methyl bromide, which is toxic. A major disadvantage of using this method is that traces of these toxic substances can be found in food. Food irradiation forms a good alternative in order to kill microorganisms and prevent subsequent food poisoning.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to eat fresh produce, then it is impossible first to treat it thermally. However, in order to prevent vegetables, fruit and cereal products from going off, we can irradiate them. This is therefore a great way of keeping produce fresh after all. However, it would be unfair to say that food is irradiated for the wrong reasons – in order to give it a better appearance, or to disguise any imperfections. Any harmful substances already produced by the microorganisms cannot be eliminated by irradiation. Hygiene and sanitary regulations therefore need to continue to apply during production and agricultural processes.</p>
<p class="contents">How, though, do we now know that this fresh produce is also safe? First of all, experience has taught us that food irradiation is common practice in countries both inside and outside the European Union. Moreover, the safety of irradiated food is borne out by the record of fifty years of research by the World Health Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency, among others. The irradiation of food does, however, result in new substances being formed, as is also the case when food is cooked. Only in the case of fats is it not entirely clear whether irradiation could have adverse health implications. This requires further investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">From the above, I conclude that there is a technical need for food irradiation, that there is no danger to public health, that it is useful for the consumer and that it is not an alternative to hygiene regulations. The four conditions laid down in the 1999 framework directive are thus met. I would therefore like to make provision for adding, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, vegetables, fruit and cereal products to the positive list.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the resolution has been improved by the incorporation of amendments. I do, however, still have a comment on labelling. Labelling should not function as a warning sign. Once it has been proven that the product is safe, a warning is no longer relevant. This would wrongly give the consumer the idea that something was wrong with the produce after all. To avoid any confusion, the designation that this product has been irradiated for hygienic reasons may suffice, just as it is stated on a carton of milk that the latter has been pasteurised.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end by saying that I would conclude that food irradiation is necessary in a number of cases in order to let fresh food and safe food go hand in hand. We should therefore not reject food irradiation out of hand but respect it for what it is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the time, the Commission wanted to take swift action and irradiate far more foods than simply herbs and spices. At least now we are discussing it first, which is an improvement. Different arrangements exist in the fifteen countries. In my own country, the Netherlands, potatoes are irradiated but I have never seen this displayed on the label. European law is not applied properly in this area. Irradiation is not necessary. There are many alternatives. If labelling were honest, consumers would not buy the products. This is also the reason why there is fraudulent labelling. Cyclobutadiene is a substance that is always detectable when food is irradiated. It is therefore perfectly possible to label properly, as the substance is always detectable. This is the Achilles' heel of the irradiation industry, for consumers do not want it. If the substance were labelled explicitly, this industry would die a slow death. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thought he got it right, with one exception: he was misreading paragraph 3. It is not as negative as he suggests. The original text from Mrs Breyer, which welcomes the Commission's suggestion that the current list be regarded, has now become 'notes the Commission's suggestion that the current list could be regarded'. That has been changed quite significantly. You need to look at all the changes that took place in committee. After all, food has been treated with ionising radiation for some 50 years, as the rapporteur rightly said. In my country, the UK, products include vegetables, fruit, cereals, poultry, fish, shellfish – not too many frogs’ legs! All that range, to a certain degree, is given this treatment. Different countries have different lists. The common ground between us is that it must not pose a health hazard, is of benefit to consumers and is labelled. If there is a need and if it is safe, then why not? That is the committee's broad view.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, it is safe. The WHO says so. The EU Scientific Committee on Food says so, and it therefore is an element of consumer protection in itself. There is a need, for instance, in hospitals, to protect the food of some very vulnerable patients from dangerous bacteria. It can protect food from contamination. What it cannot do is to reverse contamination or putrefaction in food.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission came forward with a perfectly sensible communication – a discussion paper – with its options of the current EU list, plus shrimps and frogs’ legs, of the current wider Member States' list, or of the current EU list alone. I suspect the answer is somewhere around the first and second options, but we are not at this stage dealing with the legislative proposal. The Commission is in listening mode. We needed cool, calm reflection on this. That is a thousand miles from the threat of Armageddon that we saw in the original report, with spectres of dangers, such as the long journeys that are actually of benefit to the developing countries in exporting their goods. The picture of the radioactive sources posing safety risks and risks to security through the acquisition of radioactive materials by terrorists seeking to make dirty bombs has been banished from the committee's view. We are looking for something a little more measured.</p>
<p class="contents">The report in its original form was more like the description of the Merovingian dynasty as despotism tempered by assassination. The reality is that we have a process that is safe if used properly. It can bring benefits and it should be considered carefully with proper risk assessment and risk management, but without scaremongering.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments that Mrs Grossetête and I proposed and the committee supported bring this report back to where the Commission might prefer it to be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also grateful to the Commissioner for the clarity of what he has had to say about this problem area.</p>
<p class="contents">As long ago as 1999, when we were working on the directive, our fear was that the Commission would not succeed in producing a comprehensive positive list by 31 December 2000. And what has happened? It will soon be 31 December 2002, and, rather than discussing whether or not to adopt the list, we are again going over the discussions we had in the days before the directive was drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">Things cannot, I believe, be left as they stand, and the situation is unacceptable. The Commission, in its communication, notes that both the FAO and the WHO regard it as scientifically proven that irradiation is quite safe for consumers. The WHO, indeed, urges that it be used more, as the procedure reduces risks to the consumer. The Scientific Committee on Food notes, with reference to 17 product categories, that treatment with ionising radiation is harmless, and those categories include all those products treated to date in the countries of the European Union. It states that there have been no occasions on which the critical dose has been exceeded in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is noted in the Commission communication that the most important conditions for treatment with ionising radiation – licensing, labelling and control – have been met and that the methods for detecting irradiation have been validated, in other words, that they also meet requirements. I am slowly finding it intolerable that we are constantly, in this context, being told that there is the possibility of cheating, that there is room for fraud and so on. The detection methods are in place. We can determine whether products have been treated, be it legally or illegally. Why, then, do we constantly have to go over this discussion again and again?</p>
<p class="contents">We see, then, that all the conditions have been met for a positive list to be drawn up and for the Commission to deal with it. The Commission, though, is getting cold feet. The reasons for this are apparent from the survey that it has carried out, which, to take one example, discovered that the food manufacturers do not want this treatment. Why, then, do they not want it? As the communication makes perfectly clear, they fear a boycott of their products, as the European Union and this discussion itself have been permeated by an ideology which ignores all the scientific findings and simply refuses to accept all that has been worked out and set out to date. And so we go back to our discussions and to bemoaning this dreadful state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is then that the hygiene argument is produced. I helped draw up the directive on hygiene conditions in the handling of fresh meat. I would be the last person to want to cut anything out here, but we discussed HACCP when we worked on the current version of the food hygiene directive. It is perfectly clear to us that this is not acceptable everywhere, and that we have to use other methods as well in order to make products safer for consumers. That is what this procedure is there for. The only acceptable approach is for the Commission to draw up the positive list very quickly, and, moreover, not in the form it has now proposed. The real need is for change in the situation in the European Union. We cannot afford to keep on being weighed down by this ideological ballast. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
