<p class="contents">I assume that the unusually small number of Members present is due to some event or other, probably some kind of meeting of political groups, because the Presidency must express its surprise that there appears to be unusual unanimity amongst all the groups to ensure that there should be so few people at this sitting for such an important debate. I can only regret this and wonder at the reason for it. If these blatant absences were amongst one particular group, there could perhaps be a good reason for it, but since it involves all the groups at the same time, it begs the question why.</p>

It may be that the adoption of my report by a two-thirds majority of the temporary committee has made a similar result appear likely in tomorrow’s vote, and this has possibly taken some of the heat out of the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">When, on 15 September, the decision was taken to appoint it, the temporary committee was given a mandate to determine Parliament’s negotiating position on the political challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged European Union. After working on this for seven months, we present to you today our proposal on the negotiating position of the European Parliament. The fact that the temporary committee was able to adopt the report by a two-thirds majority in spite of all the opposing views that exist on specific points was due entirely to the close cooperation and mutual trust with which its members fulfilled their mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason I should like to thank you first of all, Mr President, in your capacity as chairman of the temporary committee, and to express my special thanks to the coordinators and the highly dedicated Members who were responsible for drafting the opinions of their respective committees. I thank all of you sincerely for our close and fruitful cooperation over these past months. I should also like to add a special word of thanks to the staff of the Secretariat, every one of whom did fantastic work for us all.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Following our deliberations on 22 working papers, our discussions with 17 committees, which have given their opinions, and also our hearings with delegations from the national parliaments, to which I attach great importance, this report can make good our claim, as an institution, to have analysed and assessed the Commission’s proposals most carefully and most intensively. This means that the result we present to you today represents a robust, coherent and comprehensive solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Without Parliament’s consent, there will be no Financial Perspective. We want a solution, but we are not prepared to sell our soul for it. We have endorsed the parts of the Commission’s proposals that we considered to be right and proper, particularly with regard to the aims of more growth and employment as proclaimed in the Lisbon Strategy. We have made cuts where appropriate without endangering the integration process. We have set our own political priorities, and we do not intend to confine our discussion to mere number-crunching but to make the absolutely essential improvements to the basic conditions for annual budgeting by simplifying the programmes. We have tried to walk the tightrope between synergy and subsidiarity without ever losing sight of our obligation to exercise budgetary discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also, for the sake of democratic legitimacy, advocated synchronisation of the term of the Financial Perspective with Parliament’s legislative term and the Commission’s term of office. We want to see a binding obligation to simplify programmes as well as reform of the Financial Regulation, and we insist that the new legislation on multiannual programmes must preserve the rights of Parliament in full and as a matter of course in every single area of activity, including areas such as foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">A solution on the expenditure side will only be feasible if it is accompanied by short-term and long-term solutions on the Union’s own resources, corrective mechanisms designed to improve the internal balance of the budget. If we nail our colours to the mast by calling for more research and development and for lifelong learning, the public will expect us to deliver these things. If, at the same time, we proclaim our support for cohesion in full awareness of the current state of the debate within the Council, and if we are also compelled to acknowledge that the present debates in the Council on citizenship of the Union – on the protection of our citizens against internal dangers and on the protection of our external borders – and on the role of the EU as a global partner manifestly confront us with a problem of chronic underfunding of strategic policy areas, it becomes clear that this will be a subject on which we shall have to engage in some tough negotiating with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the prospect of this difficult debate and in the light of our experience with Agenda 2000, we believe that a new instrument to provide reserves and flexibility on the basis of existing agreements is an absolutely essential agenda item for the forthcoming negotiations. At the end of the day, we arrived at figures that boil down to 1.18% in commitment appropriations and 1.07% in payment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask all of you to approve this report tomorrow in the form in which the temporary committee commends it to you. This will strengthen our negotiating position. It would also give the Commission more scope to shape the difficult process of European integration. The Financial Perspective should serve – if not entirely, at least to some extent – as an important demonstration of commitment to a more people-centred and forward-looking Europe.</p>

In accordance with the budgetary powers devolved on Parliament by the Treaty, the Luxembourg Presidency gives top priority to maintaining an open and unreserved dialogue with Parliament in this field. This is one of the most important questions facing the European Union at this present time. It also comes at a time when the European Union simply must not fail.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to express our gratitude for the work done by the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means of the Union, which you chaired, Mr President. I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work. Your contribution to this complex and, to say the least, politically sensitive debate has been important in two respects. Firstly, Parliament has shown realism and taken a consistent approach. Secondly, with this report and this resolution you set as it were the main parameters for the negotiations that will follow those in the Council and which, in the end, will be just as decisive for the Financial Perspectives as those that take place in the European Council next week. In any case, as the Presidency takes every opportunity to point out, this first round of negotiations in the Council is only a first round, and Parliament’s agreement is also required if we are to have Financial Perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the state of negotiations in the Council? Let me explain to you how we see the situation in the Council and how we intend preparing for the debates on this matter, especially at the European Council that will be held next week. First of all, I would like to stress that the Presidency remains determined to reach an agreement at next week’s European Council. Nothing should be allowed to distract us from the important task of giving the European Union the resources it needs to accomplish the tasks that lie before it in the years ahead. The conclusion of an agreement in June is the best way of sending a positive signal and the only way of determining the scale of those resources early enough so that the various instruments and legislative programmes can be adopted and implemented at the right time. Today more than ever, the Union must show that it is still fully able to take decisions, that it is still capable of reaching compromises in a matter as crucial for its smooth operation as the Financial Perspectives and, hence, the budgetary policy for the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">You are familiar with the negotiating framework method that was successfully used during the last negotiations under the German Presidency and which enabled agreement to be reached in Berlin. That framework allowed us to whittle down the number of possible solutions and to reach a final agreement. The most recent version of this negotiating framework dates from the end of last week and will be examined by the foreign affairs ministers at the conclave to be held next Sunday evening. At the same time, the European Council President is holding bilateral meetings with his opposite numbers at which they are examining each other’s difficulties and trying to lay the foundations for a compromise that will be acceptable to all.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to a number of aspects of this latest version of the negotiating framework. I will also comment on a number of points made in your report and in the motion for a resolution on the Financial Perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, even before the debates in April’s General Affairs Council we clearly said that a number of cuts, which some find unfortunate and others inevitable, would be necessary in all fields if we were to strike a balance between highly divergent points of view as to the final overall level of expenditure. That is incidentally not entirely at odds with the thinking in your Committee. The latest version of the negotiating framework includes for the first time figures for each heading. Overall, the total of EUR 870 billion at which we have arrived, that is around 1.06% of the European Union’s gross national income, is close to the figures that have been discussed. Although this total is less than the Commission’s initial proposal, the figures for each heading nevertheless represent on average increases of between 5% and 18% annually compared to 2006. No one can therefore doubt our determination to continue providing the resources necessary to move forward with the Union’s policies. It is also true that the very weak growth in national budgets, which must not be overlooked, inevitably has consequences for the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the debates in Council have been concerned chiefly with heading 1 B, that is cohesion policy. Contrary to what some people are saying, this heading has not been particularly targeted by the cuts. We have not made this heading the adjustment variable of a minimalist budget package. In fact, the Presidency agrees with Parliament that cohesion policy is the expression of the Union’s internal solidarity. The Presidency is therefore doing all it can to keep cuts in this field to a minimum. Overall, the expenditure for this heading in the latest version of the negotiating framework represents 0.37% of the European Union’s gross national income.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has, however, proposed a number of changes to the mechanisms for allocating cohesion policy funds. It has done so following discussions that generally revealed – and not without difficulty, I have to say – a desire to give priority to funding the least prosperous regions and Member States. The Presidency has therefore adopted an approach based on the principle of solidarity, ensuring that resources are directed to those most in need. To do that, a slightly higher percentage of the ‘cohesion’ heading’s funds had to be allocated to convergence and the ceilings adjusted so that funds go where they are needed most. I know that some countries and regions are not happy with this approach. The Presidency is continuing to listen to them. However, while adjustments are still possible – and we are working on them day by day – our constraints are such that there is relatively little room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Presidency is aware that the March European Council set ambitious targets for relaunching the Lisbon Strategy. Those targets will require additional financial resources. We are all committed to the objectives of competitiveness and employment. We all want to develop research more in the Union. We know, too, that the Union has to accompany the social and economic reforms we are obliged to undertake. Employment remains a major priority for us all, as do education and vocational training. It is true that the Presidency has cut the amounts proposed by the Commission, but the rate of growth by comparison with the present period remains considerable: 8% growth per year in real terms. Hardly any national budget – and I do not know of one – makes such an additional effort.</p>
<p class="contents">The same is true of Heading 3 A, freedom, security and justice. This objective is also a priority because it comes in response to the public’s concerns in the matter. In our latest proposal, it receives an annual real-terms increase of 18% compared to 2006, a rise of nearly 200% over seven years. The rates of growth for external relations, especially for achieving the Union’s global partnership objective, are still 5% in real terms and we have not included the EDF budget like you have.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the latest version of the negotiating framework goes into the question of resources in slightly more detail. There is no doubt that the European Council’s success will depend on agreement being reached on both expenditure and resources. In its quest for a solution, the Presidency has taken as its starting point the Fontainebleau conclusions of 1984 – I will not say Fontainebluff like Mr Juncker did. So far as resources are concerned, negotiations will only succeed if a satisfactory solution is found to the United Kingdom rebate. In this connection, the Presidency is proposing that in 2007 the amount of that country’s rebate should be equal to its nominal average over the seven-year period immediately preceding the last enlargement and that it should then decline with effect from the following year. I believe this is a fair proposal because we are all committed to the effort of solidarity that our Union’s enlargement represents.</p>
<p class="contents">Also in line with the Fontainebleau conclusions, which raise the question of budgetary imbalances for other countries, the Presidency has further proposed that specific measures be introduced for three countries, namely Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, for the period 2007-2013. These measures would consist of a reduction in the VAT call-up rate, which the Presidency has more generally proposed freezing at 0.3%. It is clear that before a solution is reached on resources a number of other details still need to be examined, details which are not always minor and are often sensitive. Nevertheless, the Presidency is convinced that this approach is the most realistic basis for an ultimate agreement, provided everyone has the will to succeed and shows sufficient political will.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the main elements of the latest proposal, which has been distributed to the Member States and will be examined in Luxembourg on Sunday. It is the basis for an agreement in the Council. It will then be up to the Council and Parliament to translate it into Financial Perspectives in an interinstitutional agreement.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin my remarks by congratulating the Temporary Committee, its chairman and its rapporteur on their outstanding work.</p>
<p class="contents">The accuracy and quality of analysis, coupled with the high quality of debate in the Temporary Committee are indicative of Parliament’s desire to make a positive contribution to this extremely important debate on the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that Parliament’s commitment is crucial, because Europe’s political project is at stake. The task now is to translate our political will into financial commitment and I am delighted to see Parliament’s determination and resolve in assessing the resources the Union needs to accomplish its project.</p>
<p class="contents">I am similarly pleased to note that the resolution before Parliament has demonstrated that there is a great deal of convergence between the views of the Commission and Parliament. The fact that the Commission and Parliament find themselves on the same wavelength does not come as any surprise to me. We have opted to use the same method – that of defining our political project and our priority actions, then deciding on the resources and the appropriate budgetary instrument for these decisions to be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I still believe that this is the most appropriate means of convincing European taxpayers that their money is being used properly. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, I share Parliament’s conviction that we must all work in the spirit of the interinstitutional agreement that embodies the Financial Perspectives. As the Presidency representative, whom I greet, has just pointed out, the agreement on the Financial Perspectives is not an agreement between the Member States in the European Council. It is an agreement between our three institutions, which share responsibility for it and each of which has a crucial part in drawing it up. This interinstitutional agreement is the expression of a partnership between the Council, Parliament and the Commission. I believe the adoption of Parliament’s position today and the institutional trilogue next Wednesday are key steps along the way to reaching an agreement. And I believe it is very important that an agreement is reached soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if there are a number of differences, our respective thinking has brought our two institutions to conclusions that are in reality very close. I recognise that the resolution Parliament is examining today is full and balanced. I very much enjoyed discussing these issues with the Temporary Committee and I also appreciated the frequent contacts I had, even informally, with the President of Parliament. I am pleased to find that these conclusions have met with a very broad consensus within the political and parliamentary groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend responding in detail. I would simply like to underline one major political point at this stage. Obviously, we share a common vision of the Union and of its financial resources as a means of action. It will be crucial for us, the institutions, to maintain our alliance on the project until negotiations are concluded. Given the divergent positions of the Member States, the negotiations which have begun will be very difficult, even if we have every confidence in the Luxembourg Presidency’s ability. However, despite the major obstacles I still believe it is both necessary and possible to conclude an agreement in the next few weeks. It is necessary because the absence of an agreement would delay the implementation of policies and deprive the citizens of the policies they are waiting for. Of course, the political atmosphere today is not necessarily favourable. Uncertainty often undermines the willingness to compromise. An agreement would, however, demonstrate to our fellow citizens that despite the serious difficulties we are experiencing today, Europe is capable of acting, that it has a project for the future and that it is capable of putting it into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, we must avoid prolonging a debate that reveals things that could divide us and concentrate on the things that bring us together. We must also respond with action to those who think Europe could grind to a halt and fall into paralysis. It may seem paradoxical, but I believe the difficulties we are experiencing are also an opportunity to restate our ambition for Europe collectively. That is why I am saying that it is even more necessary now that we find a compromise in the next few weeks. I am therefore convinced that this agreement is within our reach and that we must seize this opportunity to put Europe back on the rails. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, while Parliament is agreeing its position the negotiations in Council continue. Today we have a meeting of Ecofin. On Sunday we have another ministerial conclave, in which I will be taking part.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words on the latest proposals from the Luxembourg presidency. I would like to begin by thanking the presidency for its energy and for the determination it has shown and brought to this matter. It is fair to say that many dismissed any chance that this negotiation could make much progress, but the presidency has proved them wrong. In this respect, I would like to stress the very good cooperation between the Commission and the presidency in the handling of this matter since January.</p>
<p class="contents">For me the crucial test must remain the ability of the proposals to deliver the political goals we have set. We cannot fall into the trap of once again letting the gap widen between our political promises and the reality that follows. In some areas the presidency has found a way forward. On cohesion policy, for example, substantial savings are proposed, but the overall balance remains – a balance between the compelling imperative to commit new resources in the wake of enlargement and the need to respect the fact that the mission of the cohesion policy is to work across the whole Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On own resources, the presidency has shown its well-known pragmatism. The proposal made includes the freezing and phased reduction of the UK rebate, and some compensation for Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, to take account of their excessive budgetary burdens. For the sake of transparency and fairness, let me tell you that this is certainly not the ideal solution. As you know, the Commission had proposed a different solution. However, the conditions needed to make it viable have not been met and the solution envisaged by the presidency has the merit of preventing this issue from spiralling into real crisis in the coming years. That is where we are.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that we can afford to hold the Union’s policies to ransom while we chase the illusion of a better arrangement. We must accept that the presidency has found a balanced solution.</p>
<p class="contents">In other areas, however, I must say that, compared with the Commission’s proposals, those put forward by the presidency are disappointing, and sometimes truly problematic. If you look at the newer areas of policy – supporting competitiveness for growth and employment, making freedom security and justice more concrete, giving a new impetus to our external policies – these proposals will require the Union to make very real sacrifices.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not about numbers on the page. It is about concrete actions which the Union has agreed to take forward and which it will be enabled to realise.</p>
<p class="contents">To take the area of competitiveness for growth first, Heading 1A, we all know that this is mainly about investing in knowledge. This effort will be diluted if not backed up by investment. Of course, in the context of the overall picture, the increase proposed by the presidency – some 37% on average compared to 2006 – is not insignificant. It would still allow investment in our future. But let us be honest with ourselves: it would not allow us to meet all of the goals that we have set.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to other new policy areas, again the increase for freedom, security and justice looks generous on paper, with a proposal to double the 2006 levels. However, judged against the policy needs set out in the aid action plan approved by the European Council, the shortfall suddenly looks to be a real problem. Hard choices would have to be made if this proposal were accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">As for our external policies, there is a strong consensus that Europe needs to be a more effective and vigorous actor on the world stage. But under these proposals we would have to scale down our ambitions drastically. Do we cut back on pre-accession, on stabilisation in the Balkans, on neighbourhood policy, on humanitarian aid? At a time when ministers are making a fresh commitment to increase official development aid by EUR 20 billion a year by 2010, frankly I find that troubling. So, in those areas we run the risk of failing to fully deliver on our promises and previous commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I take comfort in the position of Parliament as laid down in the draft resolution today. I do not believe that it is impossible to maintain the balance proposed by the Commission, to respect the legacy of the foundation policies while giving a new reality to new policies. I look forward to working closely with Parliament in the coming days and weeks with this goal in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that you will agree with me that, if we succeed in reaching an agreement in the European Council next week and in concluding an interinstitutional agreement, we must face up to the consequences. It may prove impossible to reach an agreement without trimming our ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear, once again. We want a consensus for the next European Council. We need it. But at the same time we have to say no to a cut-price agreement that will mean a cut-down Europe and a cut-down project for the Europe of ambition and solidarity that we want. We all need to keep that in mind at a time when we are so keen to try to find a new impetus for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As we approach the final stages of the financial perspective negotiations, as we prepare for an agreement that would show how committed we are to making Europe work, strong and positive collaboration between the European Parliament and the Commission is needed now more than ever. Together we can make a difference for the benefit of the citizens of Europe.</p>

Why these thanks? The first reason is a selfish one, because the proposals on Heading 4, which I am defending as the draftsman for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, recommend an increase of EUR four billion. In fact, I scarcely dare to say that, because the said amount is actually in line with our vision of a strong foreign policy for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My second reason to be grateful is the report’s proposal that the initiative on democracy and human rights be invested with a clear specific programme to which non-governmental organisations would be able to subscribe independently of the governments of their home countries, and which would be under the exclusive control of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">My third, and by no means least, vote of thanks is for bringing the overall budget proposal to 1.18% for commitments and 1.7% for payments, which is close to the Prodi Commission’s proposal. We shall achieve neither a unified nor an enlarged Europe without allocating a certain volume of resources. The recent elections and referenda are proof of this. I am rarely in agreement with Mr Barroso, but I am on this occasion when I simply say to the Council that we have achieved an extraordinary feat of parliamentary democracy in overcoming our national differences, and I urge the Council to bear that in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this resolution, we are indicating that a solution must be found – and soon – to our unfair and unequal position. We want a proportionate contribution for every country, not just for the Netherlands. The Dutch ‘no’ to the Constitution illustrates that things should be different in Europe: not less, but different. This goes hand in hand with the budgetary restraint proposed by Mr Böge, which we very much appreciate for that reason.</p>
<p class="contents">This also means that we consider the alternative proposed by the Group of the Greens as too expensive and too supra-European, but nor do I regard the 1% proposed by the six as a justifiable starting point. It is not crucial whether the percentage is 1% or 1.07%; what matters is what the money is spent on and what the benefit is of regulating this at European level. We do not want a more expensive Europe with more of the same, we want a different Europe, a shared and social Europe. Currently, too many European funds are still being channelled to the relatively rich regions, agricultural subsidies account for nearly 45% of the budget, and – as I am sure you are familiar with our position in this respect – we waste EUR 200 million a day on meetings in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">We must free up more funds for a safer and more social Europe, more cofinancing of agricultural policy by the old Member States and the abolition of agricultural export subsides with immediate effect. All of this can generate more funds for a safer and more social Europe. There are currently insufficient funds available for many regions, educational exchanges, including for senior secondary vocational training, knowledge and employment, promotion funds for national plans to create new jobs in regions threatened with delocalisation, vital rural and nature management, border control, security in Europe and the fight against global poverty, which brings me to development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has suggested lumping development aid, external policy and economic cooperation together, an idea to which Parliament is unanimously opposed; the report demands these to be split up. We also demand that the Millennium objectives be given a central place explicitly at the heart of development policy. Today, one in five people have no access to basic education and health care. We want this to become a central concern in the policy. The minimum amounts in the proposals are minimum amounts, 35% of which must be spent on basic education and basic health care. If we made those choices, Europe would help make the world a safer place, and Europe could make the difference in terms of this social dimension, both in the EU and elsewhere. That is what this House as a whole wants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me say, on behalf of the committee, that we cannot but thank the rapporteur for the quality of his work and for the manner in which the deliberations were conducted within the Temporary Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Committee on International Trade formulated a number of recommendations, which are, I would say, fiscally prudent and therefore all the more acceptable to our Committee. I believe that one of the features of our resolution was its emphasis on the importance, in the framework of the WTO negotiations, of ensuring that the Union, through its budget, can render assistance to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries in particular with a view to laying good foundations for these negotiations. I do not suppose that this is one of the main points of the present discussion, but we nevertheless wish to underline it.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, as one of the speakers from my group – Mrs Buitenweg, our coordinator, will speak on behalf of the group later – I should like to say two things. Firstly, the reason why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled an alternative resolution is that we felt that, in this game for three players or institutional triangle, the message conveyed by Parliament ought to reinforce that of the Commission and support the Commission’s proposals and that, on some budget items, we should even signal a desire to go beyond the Commission’s proposals while remaining within the limits authorised by the Treaties. That is why – and we shall return to this point – we sought to accentuate a number of priorities, especially in the field of rural development and also in the domains of education and culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should also like to address a few words to the Council Presidency. It is obviously inappropriate to bombard the Presidency, because we know the Presidency, and we know it is doing its level best, as they say. The real targets for criticism are those countries – the members of the one-per-cent club – which want to have their cake and eat it, to put it colloquially. From this point of view, we need an agreement, but an agreement at all costs is no solution. In spite of everything, the Commission’s proposal and that of the Council still differ by EUR 150 billion over the seven-year period.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Böge’s report is a good report; it is balanced and in keeping with the Prodi Commission’s proposal. It maintains an appropriate level of resources for the Union, ensures that regions lagging behind in development will continue to enjoy the support of the Union, aims to penalise no one on the grounds of enlargement, and relies on cohesion but also on competitiveness, by prioritising research and technological innovation. Those are the arguments presented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which Mr Böge has taken into consideration in his report, and for which I thank him. Aside from the improvements that can be made, however, it is important to consider the tangible and symbolic value of Parliament’s approval of this text.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive signals are two-fold: reaching an agreement within the time limits set and, in particular, rejecting the drastic cut in resources demonstrate the will to not give in to the temptation of renationalisation. This vote must resonate as a call to next week’s European Council, in order that it reaches an agreement that is as close as possible to our position. We do not believe that the Council’s latest proposal is, however, heading in the right direction. That is why, as President Barroso states – and I value his statement – a revival is needed, and that, Mr President, is the first crucial decision for such a revival of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is the spirit in which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety drafted its opinion, and the rapporteur, in his usual courteous and cooperative manner, has incorporated our thoughts. For that I am grateful to him. These thoughts include not only the observation that European environmental policy has proved to be an effective means of preserving or even improving the environment, public health and people’s quality of life. That is the conservationist side of our approach. Our thoughts also comprise the realisation and recognition that our environmental policy is also making a significant contribution to the achievement of the Lisbon goals, to job creation. That is the innovative side of our approach, and its importance should not be underestimated. For this reason, I very much hope that all Members of this House will join us in our present and future pursuit of this strategic path.</p>

The directly elected representatives of the European people should certainly play a leading role in such negotiations, which should be conducted with the public good in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, let me stress that the Commission and the Council have set themselves the objective of implementing the Lisbon Strategy, the goals of which are growth and employment. Growth means an increase in net incomes for everyone, whether students, employees or pensioners. Growth means an increase in take-home pay at the end of the month. How can we achieve that? By creating more jobs, because more employment means, in turn, that more revenue will be available for redistribution. This is what makes the Barroso Commission so very socially responsible, and Parliament is one hundred per cent behind its social aims. I am therefore curious to discover whether the Council will be prepared, and will be bold enough, to increase the allocation of resources to the Lisbon Strategy, whether we shall see not only a doubling of the research budget but also signs of serious intent to implement it, efforts at making additional resources available as part of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, and efforts in the fields of telecommunications, infrastructure and other areas to ensure that higher net incomes are credited to people’s accounts at the end of the month.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also ensure that savings are made. I thank the Council for setting a new standard in the European Union through the Statute for Members of the European Parliament. We should also aim to ensure that the average civil servant’s pay is based on the basic remuneration of MEPs. There should also be consistency here between the Council and Parliament and, last but not least, between them and the Members of Parliament. There should not be excessively wide disparities. Yes, savings have to be made, but on the basis of clear objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A smoothly functioning European infrastructure is one of the vital pillars of the Lisbon strategy and an important prerequisite for European economic, geographic and social cohesion. Last year, 30 projects were selected – including the Marco Polo and Galileo programmes – that are to be given high priority and corresponding financial support by the Community. These 30 priority investment programmes create a network encompassing and linking the fifteen old and ten new Member States; they put an end to bottlenecks, replace missing sections of infrastructure and pay special attention to trans-border sections, in other words, they make the system of European transport networks virtually complete.</p>
<p class="contents">In our experience, projects failed to get under way, or got under way only very slowly in past decades, due among other things to the reluctance of the Community to assist with funding. Does the new Financial Perspective change this? Indeed it does. The proposed allocations in the framework of the new Financial Perspective enable average Community funding of 15% and, in addition, other innovative forms of financing have been formulated. This will enable a new type of financing system to evolve, that is more effective than earlier systems and requires smaller contributions from Member States, for the first time in the history of TENs funding. In fact, Community funding will act as a catalyst. It is the unanimous view of the temporary committee that the funds allocated should be regarded as the minimum required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, the European regional and cohesion policy is the European Union’s most successful policy by far and the one with the most immediate public visibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the manifest public detachment from European politics at this present time, we should focus on the continued pursuit of this successful policy through the seven-year multiannual programmes and support it with appropriate funding.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly welcome the proposal made by the rapporteur, Mr Böge, that 0.41% of gross national income be guaranteed for the cohesion policy, and also that the 4% cap should remain in force.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support measures to deal with the special problem of regions subject to the statistical effect and border regions. The entire House, of course, is well aware that we are operating with tax revenue. This is why the Committee on Regional Development firmly supports the strict application of the N+2 rule and advocates its extension to the Cohesion Fund. European tax revenue must be spent efficiently and not poured down black holes somewhere or other. I might add that the Council should take note of the benefits that application of the N+2 rule brings.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, though, I should like to say to all those Members who are calling for more money, that the financial pressure on some Member States is extremely heavy. This is another area where we need to set reasonable limits. This is why the great majority of our committee supports the rapporteur’s view that in some areas the allocation of resources should be cut back or new scope be created for negotiation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite quite a few obstacles right across the agricultural sector, it is a very even-handed document. It is European agriculture that makes the multi-annual budget possible, because it is the only sector that is dramatically tightening its belt. We will be cutting our budget from 36% to 26%. That appears to me to be a huge step forward for all other sectors in order for them to adopt European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Two obstacles remain. We have an agreement from Brussels that prescribes the permitted level of growth in that budget. At the same time, I notice that no funds have been set aside for Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession. Now that European agriculture is cutting back so drastically, I cannot imagine how under the Brussels agreement, Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession can also be funded with those 26%.</p>
<p class="contents">In an extreme situation, it could mean that, since that agreement and the relevant cuts have to be borne by the 15 old Member States, a situation could arise in 2012 where farmers in the 15 old Member States receive 15% less premiums than the farmers in the new Member States. Surely that cannot be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">By using partial cofinancing as a solution to this problem, Mr Böge provides the option of fighting fire with fire, although this has been greeted by huge protests in Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture, for, first of all, the very tricky question remains of whether it is legally enforceable. Secondly, we greatly value the common market and want to preserve it. Whatever happens, cofinancing in compulsory expenditure must not lead to the renationalisation of agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one observation left to make with regard to the Council. There is a great deal of talk about net payments. Could I advise the Council to deduct the Member States’ own resources from their net payments? That would amount to half of the net payments in my country, and that might well prove the answer to the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor has he limited himself to sounding off on the subject, for he has added almost a billion euros to this draft Budget for the great educational programmes Erasmus and Leonardo and for youth exchanges.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Mr Böge also put the case for an increase for culture, the amount of this falls lamentably short of the amount that is desirable as a matter of urgency. Regrettable though this is in view of the frequent invocation of the soul of Europe, I would like, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, to ask the House to back these proposals tomorrow with a large majority. Now that the Council has, in the referenda, been sent a clear signal from the public, I call upon it to get its priorities right by accepting what Parliament has proposed through its rapporteur and, in the European Budget, taking public participation particularly seriously, as well as education and culture. Before the referenda, 72% of the public described themselves as inadequately or not at all informed. It is for that reason that the Council must learn its lesson where the financial situation is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I note with satisfaction that the Böge report proposes – as I had requested, incidentally – that this area of activity be ‘ringfenced’, as it were, within Heading 3 by the creation of a separate subheading that would guarantee the funding required for its development.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased to see that the report proposes an appreciable increase in the relevant budgetary appropriations, which will serve to intensify the fight against organised crime and against terrorism, to improve the system of controls at the EU’s external borders and to ensure that the common immigration and asylum policies are pursued effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly – and this is a purely personal point, Mr President, which I make as a Member elected in Wallonia – I wish to say very clearly, in words addressed to the Prime Minister of the Walloon region, Jean-Claude Van Cauwenberghe, that I wholeheartedly support the call made in paragraph 58 of the report for protection of the legitimate interests of the regions that have been subject to the statistical effect of enlargement.

<p class="contents">This is a drastic reduction that might scupper completely the very basis of defending natural sea resources. We must not lose sight of the fact that in this area of the sea we now have to finance external fisheries agreements and to comply with the OSPAR Convention, to which the EU is a signatory, which designates new areas of protection in the ocean.</p>
<p class="contents">There are new proposals to set up satellite mechanisms to monitor fisheries, and these are extremely costly; there are proposals to convert large sections of the fisheries sector; and there is also the enlargement. With all of this to contend with, this proposal strikes the Committee on Fisheries as a meagre one that falls well short of meeting what we see as genuine needs. We also note that there is a great danger that the Council will decide to cut this proposal altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">This is something that worries us greatly and I should like to implore the Council to take our genuine needs on board. I should also like to urge you, Mr Barroso, to maintain the position that you have held thus far of doggedly defending your Commission proposal, because this is what will defend Europe, defend our interests and defend the sea ...</p>

Thanks to him, Parliament’s position will be ready on schedule. The strong message that emerges from this report is that the Union cannot be enlarged and enhanced without increasing its budget. President Barroso has reminded us of that fact.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the first key requirement is to fund the policies covered by the Lisbon agenda: the trans-European networks, research, university exchanges and the knowledge-based economy. Another key requirement is solidarity: the scrupulous practice of solidarity with our new partners and solidarity throughout Europe with all those who are victims of industrial restructuring or of difficulties arising from geographical factors. As far as the funding of the common agricultural policy is concerned, the commitments made to farmers for the period up to 2013 must be honoured. If it emerged, however, that needs outweighed these resources, they would have to be topped up by the Member States. With or without the Constitutional Treaty, the Council and Parliament have forcibly expressed their common desire to see the economic union transform itself gradually into a genuine political union. Our priorities in this context are the war on terrorism and serious crime and the new neighbourhood policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are well aware that the overall needs identified by our Temporary Committee fall short of the ambitions of our Parliament. Sadly, it is not possible to go any further today without radically reforming the own-resources system. It is the wish of our Committee on Budgets to work on this objective in close liaison with the national parliaments. We firmly believe that it will be possible to find together the consensus solutions without which the Union will remain permanently unable to finance its political ambitions.</p>

<p class="contents">In this capacity, we sought to formulate proposals designed to bring about economic recovery and intensify European solidarity while preserving the essential building blocks that are already part of the European edifice. Conscious of the difficulties experienced by some Member States, we had to produce a transitional Financial Perspective. Our negotiations culminated in a very reasonable draft which still contains crucial growth elements. Our duty, in fact, is to maximise the value added to national budgets by European intervention and to give Europe the means it requires to implement a project designed to bring progress in which all Member States can share.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that, in the long run, expenditure at European level is a source of savings for national governments, particularly because European expenditure permits economies of scale and often enables Member States to make innovations and pursue policies that they could not have done independently. With a budget corresponding to 1.07% of GDP in payment appropriations, we shall have the resources to ensure that policies can be implemented in future. There has also been a need to break certain taboos. I am thinking here of the funding of the common agricultural policy, which will have to be reviewed if necessary in order to establish a fairer expenditure structure. I am also thinking of the British rebate, which must be challenged if we are to have a fairer own resources mechanism. I am thinking of the Cohesion Fund too, where we must create a transitional mechanism to avoid penalising those Member States that would no longer be eligible for support. In addition, all the institutions are called upon to intensify their efforts to achieve economy and efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point on the payment appropriations is that the two elements of the present proposal are inseparable, namely the 1.7% in payment appropriations and the 24.2 billion for the flexibility instruments that are imperative if we are to develop the policies essential to growth and solidarity in the Union and the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise two aspects of the present situation. The first concerns our disappointment at having been unable to finance Natura 2000 entirely outside the budget for rural development, to which we attached such great importance. The second concerns the demand we Socialists made for the <span class="italic">ad hoc </span>allocation of resources to the European Development Fund, which is an indispensable instrument for the improvement of decentralised cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to conclude by saying that Europe is experiencing difficulties at the present time, which I shall not spell out in detail. It has emerged clearly from these recent events that our citizens want a real Europe, a Europe that relates to them and communicates with them. This is precisely why it is very important to avail ourselves of this new heading. We are undoubtedly struggling today to find a political programme for Europe. We have objectives but not enough major projects and too few resources. It is essential to respond to people’s expectations, and I address these words directly to the Council. It is high time the Council was able to fulfil the hopes of the European peoples. There is an urgent need for it to face up to its responsibilities. We all need this budgetary framework in order to breathe fresh life into the economy and to regain public trust. We must overcome national self-interest and rediscover a mature approach to the European political project. There is nothing excessive about our demand, and that is why we are asking the Council to advance towards our position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Jensen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I too must greatly commend and warmly thank our rapporteur, Mr Böge, for his thorough and proficient efforts, firstly in analysing the Commission’s proposal and then in formulating Parliament’s position on the financial perspectives. My group supports this report. This proposed basis for the negotiations with the Council is economically responsible. We have found ways of reprioritising under the Commission’s proposal and of making savings in relation to the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are particularly pleased that the proposal concentrates on research, training and investments in transport and energy. It is, of course, precisely in these areas that we must invest significantly more of the EU’s budgetary means. It is in such efforts that the future lies, and they can give the EU a position of strength. That is why it is all the sadder that it is specifically in these areas that the EU’s Heads of State or Government are considering wielding the axe in order to make cuts. They want ruthlessly to cut back on our ambitious research efforts, and this is quite incomprehensible and out of step with the many fine statements from the Council about common research. It is precisely from these areas, where common efforts really could strengthen the EU’s competitiveness, that they are withdrawing and are saving amounts that, seen in a larger context, are exceedingly modest. As Commissioner Barroso did of course tell us, such savings will genuinely affect ambitions in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us in the ALDE Group are particularly pleased about the greater resources Parliament is setting aside for asylum and legal policy and for the common foreign policy. Legal policy is a rapidly growing area, and it is important for a large enough framework to be set aside for us to be able to respond to new needs over the next eight years. A lot can happen in eight years. Foreign policy too is an area in which new needs constantly arise. This is shown by experiences in recent years, when we suddenly had to find money for Kosovo, Afghanistan, Serbia and Iraq and, most recently, for the victims of the tsunami. The financial framework will have to take account of such sudden needs so that we do not go and cut back on aid to other poor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We have attached particular importance to there being adequate resources for supporting the enlarged EU’s new neighbours. The developments in Ukraine are, of course, the latest example of the EU being able to support democratic developments in countries that are its close neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">Agricultural policy and support for poor regions in the old Member States will continue to account for a lot of the budget. It is therefore necessary for the overall framework to be set high enough for it to be possible to finance new needs too. The EU budget still amounts to only approximately one per cent of gross national income, and it cannot be claimed that the amounts we are now debating are going to be the source of a budget crisis in any Member State. I wish, therefore, earnestly to call upon the European Council to find a reasonable solution at the forthcoming summit, to break the deadlock and to show that results can be delivered. I agree with Mr Böge when he says that we also want Parliament to provide a solution, but not at any price. I want to say, however, that Parliament has come up with a constructive and realistic proposal. We are obliged to find a solution so that the structural fund programmes designed to develop the economies of the new Member States can be got under way on 1 January 2007. Not to achieve a result and not to display a willingness to negotiate would simply be contemptible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If year in, year out, the only thing a country gets to hear about Europe is that it costs too much, and that it is a disgrace how much the Netherlands is paying to Brussels, then you can hardly expect people to jump up for joy, shout ‘yes!’, and resolve to accept this Europe with open arms.</p>
<p class="contents">Dutch accountants have sown the euro scepticism that was reaped on 1 June. What has the Dutch Government made of it all? It claims that the Dutch ‘no’ is a ‘no’ to our being a net contributor. Well, that is, of course, turning the facts upside down. To my great horror, this has now suddenly become the position of the Dutch Social Democrats as well, and that is depressing but, of course, a very easy option. My group has interpreted the ‘no’ in a very different way. Many people did not vote against Europe, but want a better Europe, not a Europe of multinationals, but one of people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Greens has therefore tabled an alternative resolution, because we want to invest heavily in education, in poverty-reduction projects and in exchange programmes, also for students. We want more development cooperation; we want to invest in the Millennium objectives. We also want to protect our vulnerable environment by actually freeing up funds; everyone in this Chamber is agreed that these should be made available, but they are not. We do not want this reality to prejudice the rural economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to spend the money more effectively, not on prestigious but inefficient national showpieces, such as the bridge over the Straits of Messina Street, but, for example, on the railway connection that links up Berlin with Warsaw, Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn or Vienna or Venice with Ljubljana, Bratislava, Prague and Budapest. With empty promises alone and no money to back them up, you will only alienate the voter even more. You will need to make it clear in what way you want to make your dreams come true. That is why we have tabled a resolution.</p>

It is not his fault that our group will not adopt this report by a provisional committee, but has allied itself to the minority opinion and is, instead, proposing its own resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s power relations are such that the committee’s report does not correspond to our group’s opinion of future economic frameworks. We would have liked there to be greater focus on economic, social and environmental issues, the prevention of unemployment and the fight against poverty, and solidarity with the developing countries. We would have liked to see less neoliberalism, less militarisation of the EU, and less harmonisation of laws.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand it is justifiable to have the decision on future economic guidelines fit in with the Commission’s and Parliament’s terms of office. On the other hand, structural and cohesion funds and agricultural programmes should not be subordinated to mere budgetary frameworks and procedures. While, moreover, the notion of temporal coordination was justified with the provisions of the draft EU constitution, there are no longer any grounds for it. The French and Dutch nations have rendered that neoliberalist and Euro-nationalist project comatose, and now we only need to switch off the life-support machine.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament had no inclination to reach a consensus on how future budgets should be financed. Our group endorses the system of national contributions, and, above all, contributions based on GNP, and we have no sympathy for euro taxation. We want contributions to be charged fairly. That is not how things are at present. Others pay almost EUR 5 billion to cover the United Kingdom’s contributions, and that country’s rebate is unjustified.</p>
<p class="contents">The grand total for future expenditure is crucial. On the one side there is the 1% proposed in the letter drafted by six Member States, and, on the other, Member States worried about structural and cohesion funds are demanding that Union’s internal cohesion and convergence are safeguarded. Our group does not share the committee’s view that the grand total for expenditure should be the Commission’s original proposal of something between 1% and 1.14%. We consider the Commission’s proposal to be the bare minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot of sympathy in our group for those countries that decry the deflationary pressures of the Stability and Growth Pact. Many members of our group are furthermore worried about the impact EU enlargement will have on the budget. It is feared that enlargement will be paid for by the old cohesion countries. Regarding agriculture, not everyone understands why we should be making room in the EU budget for other expenditure with joint financing of agricultural expenditure.</p>

This House should reject the draft Financial Perspective, in so doing proving that it understands and shares the views of the majority of EU citizens. It would also prove that it respects democratic principles, and that as a mouthpiece for the public, it represents and protects the interests of the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">What is wrong with the draft Financial Perspective? It provides for the use of inauspicious economic indicators and mechanisms, and, in particular, it restricts Member States’ contributions to around 1%. Secondly, it stipulates that a high percentage of the budget will be spent on agriculture. Thirdly, it provides for modest increases in expenditure on the Structural and Cohesion Funds. Fourthly, around 75% of funding for research and development is set aside for highly-developed countries. Fifthly, administrative costs have risen sharply and, sixthly, it does not go far enough in liberalising the market in services.</p>
<p class="contents">What will happen if such inadequate solutions are adopted? Firstly, economic problems will multiply rather than being solved, growth will not be boosted or competitiveness increased, and the development gap between Member States will widen instead of narrowing. Secondly, social problems will be exacerbated due to the lack of pro-family policies, since the latter boost employment and earnings, and hence promote natural growth. There is also a lack of approximation, or rather a growing disparity between the incomes of a small number of rich people and a larger number of poor people. Thirdly, the draft Financial Perspective heightens political tensions within the EU rather than lessening them, because it fails to earmark enough funding for new transport and communications infrastructure. Fourthly, not enough money has been set aside for external policies and for aid to countries such as Ukraine and Belarus. At the same time, we will be unable to deliver on the binding promises made to Turkey regarding EU accession, and this will further complicate our relations with the Islamic world.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we would be acting at odds with the economic and social objectives proclaimed by the EU if we were to adopt the draft Financial Perspective. By doing so, we would merely confirm that the EU is run by bureaucrats and technocrats, and we would make no progress towards our goal of global competitiveness. The members of the Independence and Democracy Group will vote against this draft. It is high time that a debate was held on the need for a new strategy for economic cooperation between the EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are currently in an extremely difficult situation. Not only has the Council been unable to reach a common position on the ceiling for commitments and payments, but a majority of voters in France and the Netherlands have rejected the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The moment of truth has therefore arrived for the incomprehensible Treaty, which fails to make a distinction between legislation and what are sometimes foolish hopes and dreams. A variety of grudges against the EU have been heard from certain quarters. According to some of the old Member States, the EU is not doing enough to protect their jobs. Others say that it is depriving them of their sovereignty and giving them nothing back in return. Certain Member States believe that the EU is over-regulating the economy and that it costs too much. Others do not wish to give up the privileges they were granted earlier. It is the proverbial Polish plumber, whose work is reliable and cheap, who is blamed for the failure of these various approaches. Instead of making serious attempts to carry out economic reforms, certain people prefer to use the Polish plumber as a bogeyman to scare children and young people looking for work.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, what is happening is that some net contributors to the EU budget are applying the old utopian principle of ‘give what you can and take what you need’. The result is that there is never enough EU money to go round. We are thus debating the Financial Perspective without knowing whether the Council will reach an agreement or whether the largest Member States will take up even less flexible positions. Be that as it may, we still have to take some kind of decision.</p>
<p class="contents">We are proposing to vote in favour of the Böge report, albeit in a slightly amended version. Firstly, we are opposed to any link between the level of payments and the reform of the own resources system, as the latter shows every sign of turning into an attempt to move even further away from a correlation of Member States’ payments with their revenue. Secondly, we do not agree that agriculture should be cofinanced, as this would be the first step along the path towards renationalising agricultural policy. Thirdly, it is our belief that it would be more reasonable to continue with current plans for a Financial Perspective covering the period from 2007 to 2013, as this tallies better with the multiannual programmes and the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has functioned and will continue to function without the thousands of Byzantine provisions in the late Constitution. In a large number of countries, the public is losing faith in the EU. We must ask ourselves whether this does not stem from the fact that the political elite has ignored the very illusions it created. After all, is it not an illusion to repeat endlessly the catchphrase of subsidiarity while the welfare state, which is often unnecessarily over-bloated, is close to bankruptcy? Is it not absurd that the very countries that wish to integrate rapidly are attempting to reduce their contributions to the EU? Is the Lisbon strategy not an illusion, and one that is currently being eclipsed by a rabble-rousing war against the free market? Should the blame be placed on the peoples of those countries that have carried out the necessary reforms and, as a result, begun to develop more rapidly and become more competitive?</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament will do its duty by voting in favour of the Böge report. It is now the Council’s turn to adopt a more constructive stance.</p>

It is these challenges that I should like to focus on. I am sure that you are aware that the financial outlook for the coming years depends, among other factors, on whether the European Constitution is approved or not. The citizens of two Member States recently rejected the Constitution; other countries have postponed ratification. We should now be taking this message on board, rather than making plans for the years to come. What the citizens have said to us, loudly and clearly, is that they see the European Union completely differently to what some politicians dreamt up at the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">From the perspective of the financial calculations, Mr Böge’s report is a sensible compromise. It clearly expresses the fact that there cannot be more Europe for less money. We must, however, respect above all the will of the citizens. It is not now a matter of what seems to us here in the Chamber to be reasonable; it is a matter of what is truly democratic. I believe that the rejections of the Constitution cannot be arrogantly ignored. I therefore consider that the greatest political challenge is for politicians to have the courage to step forward humbly before the citizens and openly admit that a general consensus on the level of political integration within the European Union simply does not exist at present. Accordingly, I ask whether we now even have the right to vote on a report that seeks to create a framework for the political and economic life of the European Union for several years to come, and my answer is a definite ‘no’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And this is despite the fact that the proposed distribution of the costs of enlargement is neither fair nor balanced, as demonstrated during the parliamentary debate, and that is why we have presented an amendment that I hope will be supported by a majority of the House tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">While I applaud the efforts being made by the Luxembourg Presidency, I must express my concern about the direction of some of its proposals, which tend to please the Member States whose attitude is the least flexible to the detriment of others. The Council would do well to take account of the clear signals being sent by the European Parliament, particularly with regard to cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We want sufficient funds, we want the reuse of funds left over from the convergence objective by the countries with the greatest capacity for absorption, and I hope that tomorrow we will approve an amendment calling for political compensation for those countries and regions suffering a sudden loss of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schmit’s fine words, for which we are certainly grateful, must be translated into a clear commitment to cohesion. Thinking realistically, I believe that we all agree that the Union currently lacks political leadership, but what will be put to the test on the 17th is the ability of the Heads of State or Government to do their duty. And it would be profoundly irresponsible on the part of the Council not to reach an agreement at this time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall firstly make a few general comments. The financial perspectives that the report refers to unquestionably come within an adverse context, from political, economic and social points of view, in several Member States, and I can only lament the fact that this context has –– if you will allow me to use the expression –– poisoned the debate in committee from the outset, focusing this debate on trying to find an agreement on percentages between the Commission and the Council. At times there have been squabbles over percentages, net contributors and net incomes. I believe that this is a false debate, from an economic point of view, because it is partial; and politically it is even more partial, because there is much more to the European Union than simply its budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens want much more than a mere accounting exercise, because the Union should be a complete political project, a vision for its citizens and a future for twenty-five countries, which means more than merely being contributors.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that the current political situation has not allowed Parliament to be more audacious, and this is the first time that Parliament’s proposal has aimed lower than the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, having said that, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will support the Böge report, since, in the majority of cases, its fundamental demands are taken up. Firstly, it confirms the cohesion policy as an indispensable instrument for promoting territorial, economic and social cohesion and reducing the disparities between the regions of the Union — a policy of solidarity par excellence — and sees a proper funding of 0.41% of GDP as <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>condition.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it makes the political and social agenda a priority and recognises that sufficient funding of it is crucial, and consequently it calls for an increase of EUR 200 million in order to achieve its objectives. Thirdly, it insists on the need for a sufficient level of funding for external measures, with a view to making the Union a genuine global interlocutor. And finally, it takes up the European Parliament's long-standing demand that the European Development Fund be integrated into the general budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports this balanced and realistic resolution, because we are aware that a unified majority position puts Parliament in a strong position when dealing with the Council. The ball is in the Council’s court, and it must also bear in mind that the Socialist Group sees the report as a <span class="italic">minimum minorum</span> to guarantee sufficient resources for European policies for the Europe of twenty-five. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also believe it is fair to say, Mr Böge, that many other Members of this House have shown responsibility and diligence in arriving at the two-thirds majority to which you referred before.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore invite you, ladies and gentlemen of the Council and the Commission, to listen very carefully to this appeal from our Parliament, because it contains positions that are judicious in two main respects. Firstly, they are financially judicious, because, as has been partially explained in the course of this debate, they reflect an entirely satisfactory compromise on both the expenditure and the revenue side. On the expenditure side, we have managed to make proposals with the potential to curb expenditure in a number of areas, while on the resources side, as a previous speaker indicated – I think it was a Council representative – there will be increases ranging from about 8 to 15% in the final analysis, depending on the items, if I recall the figure that was quoted a short time ago. These, I repeat, are financially judicious positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, our positions are politically judicious too, on the one hand because the wishes expressed in this Financial Perspective are consistent with the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives and on the other hand because those of our fellow citizens who want to take the trouble to fathom out the content of this Financial Perspective will find in it, I believe, a manifestation of our will to enhance our regions while improving our ability to master the challenges of the future. This is why I am pleased with the positions adopted by Parliament on the Böge report and why I call on the Commission and the Council to take heed of it.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is my fervent wish that we should be listened to by the Council on 17 and 18 June and that our views receive a favourable hearing. It is absolutely essential that the Council’s conclusion on this matter should not be seen as a patched-up decision but rather as a giant step forward towards our vision of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the time for debate, in this House at least, is almost over. It is the duty of this House to unite around this compromise so ably drafted by our rapporteur, because within the Council, where the real debate is taking place, the ‘one per cent club’, so ably led by the United Kingdom Government, continues to hold the whip hand. It is not the perfect compromise – what compromise is? However, we must send it to the Council with as strong a voice as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I echo Mrs Krehl, my colleague on the Committee on Regional Development, when she says that regional policy is the most successful and most visible aspect of the Union’s work to the citizens in whose name we carry out all our activities. The view of the Temporary Committee protects regional policy, and a strong European regional policy which must be promoted and protected. It grieves me that the United Kingdom shows every sign of continuing its mean-spirited, shortsighted stance within the Council. It is incumbent upon us in this House to send a clear message to the ‘one per cent club’ today that we will not tolerate anything less than this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard high hopes from the Council that a deal remains hoped for. I myself would not put any money on it any time soon. It is for us to unite around the best deal possible.</p>

Although the report contains many good individual measures, I am unable to vote in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why my group has tabled its own motion for a resolution is that we wanted to take a different political course in the period from 2007 to 2013. The principal reason for my negative response to the Böge report is that the European Union is not equal to the enormous challenges it must face with the next Financial Perspective. If we are to consider what needs to be done in society, the economy and the environment – particularly dealing with the demands made by regional cohesion, the high unemployment figures, poverty and income inequality – then we need to do so in a macro-economic context. There is no trace of that in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, we do not think that the upper limits proposed by the Commission for the Budget go far enough. Its plan for giving the European Union more and more powers and responsibilities without, at the same time, allocating to it the financial resources it will need to realise them is quite simply not workable. We regard the prioritisation of competitiveness, security and defence at the expense of cohesion, of the social and environmental dimension and of cooperation with developing countries as unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">This Financial Perspective reflects the attempt at implementing the Lisbon strategy, and we expressed our opposition to the present form of the latter when it was debated. It is full employment and sustainable economic development that should instead be the strategic goals, and that means allocating additional financial resources to innovation, social needs and education in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">A reduced contribution of 0.41% of Europe’s gross domestic product will not make a strong European regional policy happen. I hope that the Council will now not delay in reaching a decision, for, if it fails to do so, we can already reckon with the impossibility of proper allocation of new assistance funds at the beginning of 2007, and this would be politically irresponsible.</p>

The argument is that the EU is growing and so must cost more. The EU is growing both in terms of its number of Members and due to the fact that different tasks are constantly being taken over from the Member States. Is this a sensible development? The obvious answer is no.</p>
<p class="contents">The European countries that fulfil the membership requirements must of course be welcomed. There are, however, neither rational reasons nor popular support for moving further political tasks from the Member States to Brussels. On the contrary, the principle of subsidiarity, to which general homage is paid but which is never respected, requires a great many powers to be moved back from the EU institutions to the national parliaments. The fact that this is the will of our peoples is evident from the referenda in France and the Netherlands and from what we know about public opinion in many other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now, we are seeing the end of an era in the EU’s history, the end of the era in which the political elite could move further ahead with its ambitions and plans without concerning itself with the will of the people. That this was previously possible has to do with the fact that the structure of the parties in Western Europe reflects the issues of political controversy in the 20th century, arranged on a scale from right to left. With few exceptions, the established parties are entirely in favour of a continuous shift of political power from the parliaments of the Member States to Brussels. Thus, people cannot, in general elections to their parliaments, state that they are opposed to this development. In referenda on EU issues and sometimes in elections to the European Parliament, the opportunity arises for the peoples of Europe explicitly to adopt positions on the role the EU should play. They then take the opportunity to say no to the shift in power.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for us to bear this in mind now that we are debating the EU budget for 2007-2013. There is no popular support for increased expenditure in an EU in which just over 70% of the budget goes on agricultural policy and the regional funds. We register a reservation against the temporary committee’s proposal for the financial perspectives, amounting to 1.07% of gross domestic income in payment appropriations and 1.18% in commitments. We believe that, in accordance with the G6 countries’ proposal, the total payment appropriations should fall within one per cent of the EU countries’ total gross domestic income. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first two advocate keeping the commitment appropriations at the current level or slightly less (1.18% and 1.24%). In contrast, the Council defends the prerogatives of the Member States, which are worried – and are even more so after the votes of France and the Netherlands on the Constitution – about the unrest gripping the Union like a vice; they delude themselves that, by reducing the funds, they can protect their respective positions, which are exposed to the dangers represented by China, India, the United States, global revolution, competitiveness and innovation.</p>

The European Union, for its part, has already had four budgetary plans: the Delors I and Delors II packages, the Santer plan and now the Barroso plan for the period from 2007 to 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">The Soviet plans, however, were designed to build up the economy, whereas the European budgetary plans are balancing mechanisms in which flies’ eggs are weighed on spiders’ webs. Our debate illustrates this: the 311-page Böge report is essentially all about whether 450 million Europeans will commit appropriations amounting to 1.24%, 1.06% or 1.7% of GDP, in other words whether we shall spend EUR 1 024 billion, 870 billion or 825 billion over the next seven years while the United States spends USD 20 000 billion, some 20 times as much as the EU, over the same period. To put it another way, our divergences of some EUR 60 billion between Juncker and Barroso or between Chirac and Böge are equivalent to 0.3% of the US public expenditure estimates for the same period.</p>
<p class="contents">When we have more than 20 million unemployed and 50 million people living in poverty, it is obvious, and has been common knowledge since the time of Pericles, that the big issue is that of large loans for major investments, such as investments in our railways. If Brussels had actually been building railway stations, for example, instead of constitutional castles in the air, the European Union would not have been shunted into the sidings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The latter had nothing in common with the old Soviet five-year plans, as their guiding principle was that we should have a growing budget to meet our growing needs. One could be forgiven for expecting the same to apply today, given that relatively poor countries have joined the EU. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of farmers eligible for direct payments, even though such payments were not their idea. Finally, our tasks have multiplied, which also has a measurable impact on the budget. If this principle were indeed expected to apply again, it would undoubtedly act as another driving force behind the far-reaching political reforms currently under way in Central and Eastern Europe. I am quite sure that the political classes of the ‘old’ EU Member States would be hard pushed to carry out even some of these reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, we must face the facts, which are as follows. The proposed compromise bequeathed to us by the Prodi Commission is indefensible. Mr Böge has put an enormous amount of effort and good will into a proposal amending this compromise, and the relative weight it accords to the various budget headings is appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">No one would dispute the fact that we should use public funds to promote research and development and a knowledge-based economy, but there is not yet any evidence that this is an effective way of spending money. It follows that such funding should not be provided at the expense of regional and cohesion policy, which is both visible and of proven benefit, and which does not pit the old and the new cohesion countries against each other. This House must make it abundantly clear tomorrow that we are expecting agreement to be reached at government level.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs evidence that it still functions. The European summit will be an opportunity to furnish such evidence in the form of a sensible compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has managed to reflect the position of the committee faithfully. Not everyone will agree with the full contents of the report, but overall it is very good and he is to be congratulated.</p>
<p class="contents">Different views are represented in this House, whether it be on agriculture, structural funds or whatever. You cannot please all of the people all of the time, but that is not such a bad thing. You have not pleased us, because, as you would expect, the main point of departure for the British Labour delegation is the implied reference to the United Kingdom rebate.</p>
<p class="contents">In this part of the debate I seem to be a voice in the wilderness, but I will carry on. I refer to recital N, which I totally disagree with, and also to paragraph 8 and the fifth indent of paragraph 51. I have always made it clear in the temporary committee that own resources and the Financial Perspective are two separate issues, and never before has there been an attempt to link them under any of the previous IIAs. That is why the British Labour delegation is hesitant about supporting the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The report will certainly give Parliament a good starting point for negotiations with the Council, which I welcome. Of course, until we know Council's agreed position, if there is one, it is difficult to say how those negotiations will go. I suppose it is still possible in theory that the Council will agree with Parliament's figures, or even go higher. Some of us live in hope.</p>
<p class="contents">However, from the beginning when Members raised the issue of linking the Financial Perspective with a new system of own resources, I have used the phrase "get real" on at least three occasions. We have to ‘get real’ about what the Council will do. This is not going to happen. In the remaining three weeks of the Luxembourg presidency, for all its skilful diplomacy I would be surprised if this were to be part of any package, if indeed the Council has a position. I personally believe that the present own resources system is opaque and we need something more transparent, so that taxpayers can understand how the EU is financed. That discussion and decision will take place in a different House at a different time. I know that will not please colleagues in my Group, but we have to live in the real world and recognise the limits of our competencies.</p>
<p class="contents">If the British delegation abstains on this report, it is for the reason that I have outlined. As for the future, I wish you well when you start the conciliation negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, this is a splendid phrase. It serves as a common ground for Parliament and the Commission, and highlights the distance between these two institutions and the Council, which at present is incapable of transcending national interests and finding the answer that Europe needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The European project is currently at crisis point. The only response to this crisis has to be the good news that Europe is capable of looking to the future with hope, and that Europe itself can be the source of such hope. The Böge report indicates, and rightly so, that there is no contradiction between the European Union’s policies of cohesion and solidarity and Europe’s economic competitiveness. This is an important point, and I believe that it is equally important for the Financial Perspective to be a driving force behind European integration, rather than a factor widening the gap between the new and the old Member States, or between Eastern and Western Europe. The countries that have rejoined Europe are particularly vulnerable, and this is something people need to understand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we have already heard praise from many quarters for the balance of the work he has done, we – and I – take the view that the failure to put sufficient emphasis on some areas is precisely the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pick up right now on what Mr Geremek said. Is the policy that we are now engaged in devising really sufficiently focussed on the future? What are we in fact doing for the European public, and what can they then do for Europe? I feel at a deep level that, after the two failed referenda, we have to consider how, as a matter of policy, we can communicate better with the people of Europe. I believe that our educational programmes, despite the boost that they have already given us, have not taken us as far as we have to go in terms of the Lisbon strategy; over the coming years, by means of the Financial Perspective, we must do everything possible to ensure that every schoolboy, every schoolgirl and every student can gain an education and study in another European country. They will relate emotionally to Europe, to its diversity and to its opportunities, in a quite different way, and it is thus that we develop convinced Europeans from the ground upwards. Those are the sort of networks we need.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is exactly the same as regards cultural policy. We are so proud of the fact that the Wall is no longer there and that we are a continent of diverse cultures. The Budget estimate still falls short of what we spend on subsidising tobacco. We need to be visibly proactive here, enabling town-twinning schemes to flourish, enabling artists to meet each other and enabling people to have a real experience of Europe’s cultural riches. That is why the estimates contained in Mr Böge’s proposal do not go far enough. Let us, together, be bold in trying to get the message across to people, not only to their minds, but also to their hearts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both proposals, at their core, are tantamount to surrendering to the strategy pursued by the wealthy countries, such as Germany, which seeks to reduce the Community budget as far as possible. This, let me stress, did not happen in the case of previous enlargements.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals neither protect nor safeguard the interests of cohesion countries such as Portugal, which may once again be penalised by the Financial Perspective 2007-2013, despite warnings that it would be the country that stood to suffer the most from the enlargement. Given that what we actually need to do is to strengthen economic and social cohesion, we have tabled practical proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals include complete compensation for regions, such as the Algarve, affected by the so-called statistical effect, a specific programme targeted at Portugal and Greece to adjust their economies in light of the impact of the enlargement, an end to the pegging of the cohesion fund to the Stability and Growth Pact, the rejection of renationalising the costs of cofinancing the common agricultural policy, the promotion of a fairer model for distributing agricultural aid, the guarantee of a seven-year financial framework and the creation of a Community programme for the textiles and clothing sector, especially for the least-favoured regions that depend on that sector.

They said ‘yes’. At that time, we agreed to humiliating conditions attached to accession, in which our highly efficient farming sector was granted only a quarter of the subsidies compared with our competitors in the old European Union countries, as well as conditions conflicting with the founding principles of the European Union – protection regulations preventing the free employment of our citizens in many of the old countries of the Union. We also find that services may not be directly provided in the old Member States, and we recently discovered how tricky it will be for businesses that logically wish to relocate – still within the EU – to our country with its highly qualified and industrious workforce, which works 40 hours per week rather than 35 and which does not demand exorbitant wages.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, it has only taken a year for us to be disabused of many naïve ideas. We want to believe at least in the basic promises that led our citizens to say ‘yes’ in the accession referendum. The promises were about financial resources, which, they said, would provide funds for the development of the Czech Republic as they had done before in Portugal, Ireland and elsewhere. It is therefore logical that we support the Commission’s proposal to maintain the 1.24%. Let me make clear that we are not against cuts. We are, alas, well aware that the cuts will only come at the expense of funds. Nevertheless, the administration of the Union will not become any cheaper: on the contrary, the dream of a European foreign minister, the dream of embassies, the more than 3000 opaque regulatory and advisory bodies, and the all-penetrating regulations set out in twenty languages will make operating the Union more expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know where there are huge amounts of money from which savings can be made. The common agricultural policy, for example, pointlessly fritters away more than 40% of the budget, but is well known to be a politically untouchable entity, which Parliament, absurdly, is not even allowed to discuss. Only the funds remain to be cut. During the year, we have already learnt that the most frequently used magic word is ‘sustainable’, which is used without thinking to label all concepts.

<p class="contents">In the case of Italy alone, which is a net contributor to the European Union, that means an annual cut of around EUR 8 billion, reducing the funds allocated to employment and justice to the bare bones, and cancelling almost half of the funds for research, innovation and trans-European networks, not to mention the Lisbon Strategy. There are too many cuts and too many contradictions. The so-called UK rebate also needs to be reviewed. In actual fact, this exception, the privilege that sees Great Britain obtain a rebate of a substantial proportion of the contributions it makes, must be scrapped. It is a provision sought by Mrs Thatcher – in 1984, if I am not mistaken – that was unfortunately, and inexplicably, reconfirmed during Mr Prodi’s presidency: a rebate that is mostly paid for by France and by Italy.</p>

I greatly appreciate it and I do not believe that anyone else would have done a better job and produced such an excellent and impartial report.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow Parliament must send a strong and positive message to the citizens of Europe. We need to have as large a majority as possible back this report. If Parliament stands united on this issue, we will also be sending a strong message to the Council. Unity in the matter of financial frameworks is still achievable during Luxembourg’s presidential term, if there is the political will and leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise two matters which I think are important: the future of agriculture, and the Baltic Sea. Agricultural policy has inevitably got to the stage where agricultural subsidies to the old 15 Member States will be reduced with future enlargements. We have to prepare ourselves properly for this. I support the amendment tabled by my group which proposes that, if the Council decides to reduce overall funding of compulsory expenditure, the 2002 Brussels agreement notwithstanding, the Member States will have to compensate for this reduction financially. In this connection it nevertheless needs to be said that switching to joint financing of agriculture will be a realistic move, if not for this financial perspective, then at least for those to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to turn your attention to the amendment that concerns the Baltic Sea strategy. At present, the Union has a Mediterranean Sea strategy, and in parallel with that we want now to establish a Baltic Sea strategy. This strategy will be especially important for nature conservation. Today the Baltic Sea has immense problems. When conditions are at their worst you cannot bathe or fish in the sea, and we need effective measures to restore the Baltic to its natural state. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are major tasks ahead of us. We want to ensure that enlargement is successfully completed, to lay the foundations for rapid growth and job creation and to achieve the new goals established during the debates held while the European Constitution was being drafted. The Financial Perspective must meet these expectations. We all want more Europe, because we believe that the creation of a common Europe is the right answer to the challenges we face today.</p>
<p class="contents">Two opposing approaches and ways of thinking emerged during work on the Financial Perspective. The first, advocated by the Commission, provides for an ambitious but balanced increase in expenditure, which would keep pace with growing expectations. The second, backed by a group of Member States, consists in cuts to the budget as a percentage of GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fully aware that although the EU’s remit has expanded, it must deliver on this remit at a time of severe budgetary restrictions and weak economic growth. Under no circumstances, however, should these restrictions make us blind to the unquestionable benefits that may be gained from measures funded from the common EU budget. It follows that a compromise is necessary, and an eminently sensible one is set out in Parliament’s proposal. If I may, I should like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Böge for the effort he has put into drafting this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the unsuccessful referenda in France and the Netherlands mean Europe now needs clear confirmation that integration is and will continue to be our common future. I would therefore call on the Council to reach a compromise, to abandon selfish and conservative attitudes and to go beyond the narrow confines of purely national interests. The reason I call for a compromise is that the European Union is in urgent need of a clear vision of the future and the financial capacity to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">We should work together to demonstrate that Europe is capable of acting in a spirit of solidarity, and that its political leaders are able to rise above short-term political interests and reach agreements for the common good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are a few key points I should like to mention. I am in favour of cofinancing agricultural expenses for the reasons mentioned in the report. I am opposed to renationalisation. We must have the same rules across Europe, but Mr Böge’s proposals are acceptable. Flexibility is also a useful tool in the budget, not only in the items themselves but also with regard to cofinancing percentages of structural aid. It may well be the case that richer countries have a higher cofinancing percentage than poor countries. The role of the European Investment Bank should be enhanced in structural expenses and so should that of the European Investment Fund. We can draw on good examples from the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is one more point I should like to make about common foreign and security policy. I take the view that those expenses should also fall completely within Parliament’s competence. It should not be simply up to the Council; Parliament must approve them as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When introducing this report, he pointed out that the Budget leaves certain areas of policy and the economy chronically underfunded. Rural development is threatening to become one of them. In consequence of a Council decision, funding is tied up until 2013 in the first pillar, where, however, resources are inadequate for funding Romania and Bulgaria. It is for this reason that the report proposes the introduction of cofinancing in the first pillar. While our group wishes to support this cofinancing, our aim in doing so is to achieve better funding for matters covered by the second pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">The funds from Natura 2000 must be mobilised. In the second pillar, rural development must be funded on an equal basis, that is to say with 75% from the European Union, and the proper economic development of rural areas must be guaranteed.

<p class="contents">The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left rejects the philosophy of an agreement 'at any cost' which also permeates the Böge report, because it results in less Europe and greater inequalities and has as its victims the weaker countries and the weaker social groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe and the Council should, at long last, understand that there cannot be more and a bigger European Union with less money. The European United Left considers the Commission proposal to be a totally inadequate starting point for financing the objectives of cohesion and the social agenda following enlargement. Any thought, therefore, of further reduction is incomprehensible as far as we are concerned. In the name of the European United Left, I call for a fair division of the costs of enlargement. Not for the poorer countries and regions to pay most. For the unacceptable scandal of the British exemption to end. We are all equal. For the injustice against the 16 regions which are victim of the so-called statistical effect to be addressed fully and positively and for stronger support to be safeguarded during the transitional period of the regions which have not yet completed the convergence process themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We spend a lot of time in this House talking about a strong EU that would compete with the USA or Asia, yet a strong EU with a small budget is inconceivable, not to say absurd.</p>
<p class="contents">It needs to be stated in plain terms that the Temporary Committee’s proposal would leave us worse off than that put forward by the Barroso Commission. It is, however, a vast improvement on the Luxembourg Presidency’s so-called compromise, which was doomed to failure. If the richest EU Member States insist on imposing their opinion on everyone else, the end result will be that the vision of a common Europe, based on solidarity, is shattered. If our aim is to build a Europe of selfish and personal interests, we should go ahead and support a small EU budget. The other possibility, of course, is that the real proposal being put to the new EU Member States is for the enlarged EU to be a Europe of solidarity only in terms of duties. The opposite would apply as far as privileges are concerned, especially those of the financial variety.</p>

They are in essence about the tasks that we have to perform at European level. When the Commission’s proposal is along the lines of doing what it does already, and then some new things on top, then it is making matters too easy for itself. What our rapporteur deserves a great deal of credit for is the way he has gone into the details, taking a look at the tasks – including those connected with the Budget – that we in the EU will have to get to grips with in the 21st century, at where more resources are needed – in foreign and security policy – and at where the Commission’s proposals are excessive and we can make cutbacks. What we have here, as a result, is an excellent proposal, and one that will serve as a basis for very serious negotiations with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">A European Union that defines itself solely in terms of the redistribution of as much money as possible is not the European Union I want to see; there are other tasks that we have to perform together. If we require the Member States to consolidate their budgets in order to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact, we cannot at the same time go around dispensing largesse the length and breadth of Europe. This is a task we have to face up to together.</p>
<p class="contents">If you say – as Mrs Trüpel, being a Green, does – that 70 cents for culture cannot be excessive if you set it against the expenditure on the Millennium Goals and all the other goals, then your payments end up amounting to 1.19%. What the Greens are proposing, then, is to commit 1.29%. If that is what you want, then I suggest that you tell the people that there is no money left at the national level, but Europe is spending more, and see where that gets you. Our credibility depends on our concentrating not only on the political tasks in hand – and that is how we respond to the referenda – but also on the Budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to consider how we are going to deal with what we face in the years to come, and the public are watching us closely as we do so. What do our actions do for our credibility?</p>
<p class="contents">We know that there are tasks awaiting us that will call for courage and a pro-active approach, that will require that we spell out the fact that this European Union is an economic community with an interest in success. While the consequence of this is that we have to invest in the future by stepping up research and improving education and training, we also have to take care that, in this economic community geared to economic success, people and regions are not left behind, and so there is also a need for assistance for those who may, in the course of these changes and developments, have got into difficulties or are already living under problematic circumstances. It is there in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is because the report that Mr Böge has presented specifically aims to set out guidelines for this and to make available the resources that we need that we are prepared to support it, but the public also expect their representatives – for such is what we are – to think not only about how to spend money where necessary, but also about the supply side; in other words, they want to know where the money is going to come from. It is, after all, the public who have to foot the bill for all this. It must therefore be acceptable to ask at European level whether the burden of these tasks is equally shared. It is quite clear that nothing now justifies the British rebate.</p>
<p class="contents">We all have to go out and show the people of Europe, in all our countries, that we are ready and willing to make the necessary funding available. At the same time, we are ready and able to ensure that the resulting burdens are shared out fairly and in a spirit of solidarity. Solidarity means not just joining together in sharing out resources; it also means making sure that individuals are not overburdened while others stand aside and bid them manage as best they can. We want to ensure together that Europe changes for the better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Particular areas of focus this time are regional, structural and cohesion policy and improved levels of employment and competitiveness. The intention is to increase structural policy financing and rural development funds, to guarantee that there is balanced development. The needs of the new Member States are understood and accepted, but the report quite rightly points out that the more susceptible regions of the old Member States should not be made to pay for the new cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">To improve employment levels and boost economic growth, the purpose within the financial frameworks is to invest particularly in research and development, and education and training. This money would be increased to three times the sum in seven years. The priority is absolutely the right one. Economising on these is economising on our own future, and this I wish to warn others against, especially the country holding the presidency.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission has come up with a proposal, and Parliament – by means of the Böge report and of tomorrow’s decision – has shown itself capable of acting and negotiating. At present, the Council – lacking any agreement whatever on a basis for negotiation – is capable of doing neither of those things.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal is a compromise. I call upon the Heads of State or Government, along with their ministers of finance, to read it through for themselves and to see whether it might make it possible to broker an agreement in the Council without our weakening the European Union. I am addressing the Members of the Council when I say that the proposal they have already put on the table amounts to 40% less for the EU’s competitiveness, 10% less for cohesion and growth and employment, 6% less for rural development and agriculture, 50% less for internal policies and 40% less for the European Union’s role as a global partner. You may thereby get agreement in the Council, but you will not get any agreement from us, not least for the second reason, which is that you are making cuts across the board. If we stick to the status quo, without setting any new priorities, we will need EUR 890 billion. Your proposal envisages EUR 871 billion. If we do not come to an agreement, we will have EUR 931 billion. Your Budget is tighter than the one we have already and more limited than a lack of agreement would make it, and that is why you have to understand that our offer is made with negotiations in mind.

Only the opportunity to facilitate a quick, balanced and fair agreement, which clears up any doubts and anxieties at this time, could justify this. That is how we wish to interpret the Commission's conciliatory words and we would urge the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I am not pleased that Parliament should be demonstrating a minimalist tendency which began with the last Agenda 2000 and which has not helped to increase confidence amongst the European citizens. I am referring to the risk of the budget returning to a renationalising tendency and of basing the Union’s objectives upon insufficient resources. We regret the pressure represented by the initial proposal of six Member States, some of which were perfectly understandable given the current situation, but others are guilty of not sufficiently explaining the added value of each euro spent and the high economic and commercial return resulting from the Union's development.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret that the 1% has replaced the ideas by percentage, but, on the other hand, it has also relaunched the debate on the urgency of fundamentally reviewing the system of own resources. What we do not agree with is the fact that the rapporteur applies it exclusively to the funding of the CAP, which is still trying to digest the last Brussels reform; let us not throw our farmers out with the bathwater.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the effort to maintain the share for the cohesion policy, and also the strengthening of the Union's social policies, growth and employment policies and also justice and foreign policies. We would call on the rapporteur to extend the logical phasing out mechanism, which already acknowledges the regions affected by the amplifying effect of enlargement, and to apply it to the Cohesion Fund. The European Parliament defended it in Agenda 2000 and we do not understand why, when the Presidency-in-Office of the Council is applying it, Parliament is not now doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on the rapporteur to accept Amendment 1, which combats the discrimination that would result from applying the competition and excellence policy in an exclusive manner.</p>

I do regret that we take no pleasure in that. Finding a decision concerning the Community funds that would be acceptable and apprehensible for all was a very complicated task; however, this successful decision proves that the enlarged European Union is viable and has a long-term vision of economic development. Naturally, we could have come to that decision sooner and better had there been no attempts to oppose national and co-European interests, had there been no deviations in the technical particulars. At times I got the impression that we had convened as a group of accountants instead of society’s leaders. We have to understand that we need to develop a common European vision prior to commencing any financial planning, and this common European vision is being missed by both the citizens and the representatives of the society. Therefore, any discussions about financial plans, annual plans that will specify this perspective, should commence with a discussion about that economic vision, which we all have to develop; only thereafter should we define the spheres, the type of financing and the means required. That is what I miss in the work of the European Commission, and I do regret that today’s speech by the Commission President has been a complaint of a very tired person to Parliament about the problems of negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, my thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Böge, whose task was a difficult one and who managed to accommodate Members’ demands.</p>
<p class="contents">To come to the Financial Perspective, it continues to give a great deal of cause for concern and is unacceptable in some points. Following the events of these past few weeks, there is a need to be able to respond to public expectations and not to let a chasm open up between political promises and the action that would serve to achieve the objectives of competitiveness, full employment, research and training and, above all, solidarity. Yes, we are in favour of cohesion policy, provided it does not rule out support to the regions of the old 15-member Union that remain disadvantaged.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to explain my concern with regard to the Council. The Member States must not be timid about Europe. What can I say about the proposals regarding the common agricultural policy, the CAP, which is poised to become a national agricultural policy or NAP, an appropriate name, with the Council closing its eyes to the needs of farmers as renationalisation looms and a political symbol of Europe is set to disappear? The same concern surrounds regional policy, which our regions need so much, and our major trans-European projects. We shall also be very vigilant with regard to the funding of Natura 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to finance our priorities, there will surely be a need to review the rules governing the calculation of the Union’s resources and to renegotiate the benefits granted during the last century, particularly the British rebate. Mr Barroso has told us that he can count on the European Parliament. Together, we shall perhaps succeed in persuading the Council that it really must make an effort to ensure that the EU budget is not the shoestring budget I dread. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was the first time we have been able to participate in the committee debate, which proved to be remarkably informative, thought-provoking and, although not entirely free from tensions, certainly pointed the way forward and I congratulate Mr Reimer Böge on his chairmanship of this debate and on the balanced outcome that was achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also aware that our participation not only creates opportunities, but brings with it responsibility too. Because of this sense of responsibility, we tried to avoid pushing too hard on issues that cannot realistically be dealt with, given the current situation of the Union, although they are important in terms of our catching up and thus for the progress of the European Union as a whole. Instead, we concentrated on those details, and in some cases matters of a technical nature, that are vitally important for our catching up process in practical terms, but also in terms of their theoretical and political significance. Thus, we think the most important thing at present is to ensure that the structural funds and cohesion funds aimed at promoting catching up are made available to us at an appropriate level, without any tightening of the technical regulations that might cause transitional difficulties for new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the Böge report’s affirmation that 0.41% of the Union’s GNI should be allocated for this purpose, with new Member States being able to use this up to a level representing 4% of their gross national income and that the N+2 rule should not be applied to the cohesion funds. In our judgment, this means that even though the new EU budget is of necessity tighter, it will still provide appropriate assistance to foster the catch-up of the new Member States. This, in addition to demonstrating solidarity, will also help to enhance Europe’s competitiveness, boost growth and create jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the same basis, net contributors like Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, should also have a rebate. But over the next few years the British rebate will increase markedly in size and the poorest Member States will have to contribute towards it. That is not defensible.</p>
<p class="contents">My government says that the rebate is non-negotiable. This is nonsense. The European Union is a giant machine for negotiating agreements between 25 countries and everything relevant should be considered negotiable if positive benefits can be secured in return.</p>
<p class="contents">The rebate was introduced because of imbalances in the workings of the common agricultural policy. The price that Britain should demand for negotiating the rebate is the reopening of the agreement on agricultural spending, an agreement to which it acquiesced.</p>
<p class="contents">We should support rural development; we should compensate farmers to ensure that environmental concerns are addressed. However, we should no more subsidise the very existence of farms than we should subsidise factories, quarries or coal mines. The CAP discriminates against farmers in developing nations and penalises our own consumers. A phased but significant programme of cuts in Pillar 1 expenditure should be introduced. That is the price Britain should demand. But to continue arguing that the rebate is simply non-negotiable is neither good for Europe nor best for Britain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, they must not, of course, be taken at the cost of the prospects of the European Union itself. The decisions need to be taken at a satisfactory level for all the Member States. In saying this, I cannot but add that I am sorry that the proposals by the Luxembourg Presidency operate, unfortunately, to a very large degree to the detriment of cohesion policies with the proposed reduction from 0.41% of Community GDP to 0.37%. In all events, I should like to say that it is important that the Presidency at least try to limit the adverse repercussions of its proposals. How? Firstly, with compensation mechanisms for the countries and regions which are disproportionately affected by the mechanism for distributing appropriations proposed by the Commission. Secondly, by reallocating the appropriations lost due to the Ν+2 rule.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I should like to say that we are, of course, opposed to the renationalisation and cofinancing of the common agricultural policy and, finally, to add, as there is talk on many sides of the savings which need to be made and of the fact that we cannot hand out additional appropriations, that the European Union budget corresponds in total to 2.5% of public spending in all the Member States.

The fact is that the Presidency’s proposals, although they do break the 1% barrier, remain timid. That the Union should only be allowed to spend another EUR 40 billion in absolute terms over a seven-year period is disappointing.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us imagine for a moment that all of this money were to be invested in research. At the present time, the Americans spend one hundred billion euros more than Europeans on research every year. An amount of 40 billion, spread over seven years, would not even correspond to half of the present annual shortfall, although much of this gap will obviously have to be filled by the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has run aground. The political gnomes who govern us are allowing demagogues from the extreme Right and Left, including National Socialists and other separatists, to demolish the European dream. Our Union needs more solidarity and therefore more of its own resources in order to overthrow the niggardly accounting system based on net balances and rebates.</p>
<p class="contents">I have proposed a European levy of one cent on every litre of petrol, diesel and kerosene sold in the Union. No consumer or economic operator would buckle under the weight of such a tax, which would net more than EUR 40 billion over seven years. Let us dare to break the mould of national self-interest; let us dare to adopt a more European approach. It is impossible to identify precisely where benefits accrue and costs are incurred within a single market. The countries with the most developed economies evidently benefit most from any additional common growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It enables the plans of the Union to be put into effect, but without placing an intolerable burden on the contributors. It boldly proposes new solutions for new situations. One such solution, that is often mentioned, is national top-ups, which, incidentally, has already been tried out on us, the new Member States. It is in the interests of Hungary and of all the cohesion countries, that 0.41% of EU income is channelled into supporting convergence. With this, we will be able to develop research and a knowledge-based society and promote road-network construction and job creation. All of this will help to breathe life into the Lisbon dream.</p>
<p class="contents">But will anything actually come of it at all? The question for the moment is not so much how to reach agreement on concrete figures with the Council, but whether there will be a Council position at all, in other words, whether the European Council will reach agreement with itself? If the Heads of Government spend their time next week merely bemoaning the outcome of the referenda on the Constitution and fail to decide on the basic principles of the financial framework aimed at serving the interests of the citizens of Europe, then, to the delight of the eurosceptics, the Union really will face a crisis. Reaching a common position geared towards the interests of the new Europe of 450 million citizens will be a good thing for every Member State. Aloofness and selfishness never lead anywhere. The solution is not to turn away from the Union, but to embrace Europe even more. Following the failure of the referenda, can we allow matters to be made worse by the failure of the financial plans for the period after 2007? Fellow Members of this House, let us support the Böge report, let there be at least one piece of solid ground in this situation in which collapse seems imminent and let the citizens of Europe see which institution represents their real interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are well aware that Europe is not only useful, but also necessary. In order for Europe to be useful, unified and competitive, however, and therefore perceived as necessary by the people, it must be able to develop its policies and be endowed with the resources to do so. Within this syllogism, which may seem obvious, lies the full significance of the battle that Parliament is waging on the financial perspectives. Therein lies the significance of everything that this House’s rapporteur, Reiner Böge, has been able to instil in a text that I consider satisfactory and pragmatic, without being defeatist.</p>
<p class="contents">Without doubt, the question that we are all asking is: ‘Will we succeed in reaching an agreement with the Council?’ A lot depends on the scale of our vote, ladies and gentlemen, and even more on the ability of Heads of Government to resist becoming overwhelmed by the logic of money and their devotion to their own national interests. This afternoon Mr Barroso delivered a clear and determined address, which we welcome. Mr Juncker should apply his remarkable negotiating skills to the pursuit of a dignified agreement and avoid being dragged into a never-ending bilateral mediation which, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, risks unjustly and unjustifiably penalising certain parties.

Confidence, prospects and momentum: these are what the public needs today in order to avoid falling victim to scepticism and resignation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would above all, therefore, like to give credit to Mr Böge for having, with great wisdom and balance, produced a sensitive report that required complex analysis and has resulted in effective political proposals. It is an even more worthy outcome considering the difficult climate, due particularly to narrow-minded, intransigent pressure groups, in which his work began and has continued up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution points out the priorities for the revival of Europe: the untouchable status of the cohesion policy, the importance of promoting the competitiveness and development of the Union, the need for an increasingly effective common policy in the area of justice and home affairs, the need to give impetus to external relations and to the dynamics of integration of the single market, in addition to enhancing the concept of flexibility in order to make the European financial framework agile and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot hide the fact, however, that from the way in which it is outlined in Mr Böge’s report, the European Parliament’s position differs significantly from the working document presented by the Luxembourg Presidency on 2 June. We fear that the European Council may approve a compromise with extremely disappointing political and financial content. In the knowledge that we will be faced with a compromise, which will be the outcome of painful mediation, we will never let our readiness to find balanced solutions dwindle. We will do everything possible to avert the possibility of an institutional battle. It must be clear, however, that the Council will not be able to call on our sense of responsibility, in order to involve the European Parliament in an exercise that has the effect of killing off the integration process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Faced with the social effects of globalisation, the moral crisis linked to unemployment and inequality is adding to the democratic crisis, not to mention the budgetary crisis. The final decision on the financial perspectives will be crucial to the credibility and legitimacy of the EU and of its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Two political events are much anticipated. The first is the success of enlargement. It is our duty to reach this stage, in the interests of equality between our countries and our citizens. The contribution recommended by our rapporteur for territorial and social cohesion is necessary, though not adequate: specifically, it lacks increased funding for transport networks. I also support the creation of the growth adjustment fund to help us achieve this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The second event is the future: our old industrial continent is in the process of changing and we must level out the territorial, economic and cultural inequalities. It will only be possible to create new products and new services to combine productivity and solidarity if research and innovation are adequately funded. The doubling of the research budget and the objective of 3% of the EU’s GNI by 2010 absolutely must be respected. On these two political conditions, and on the assumption that our ambitions will be funded by their own new resources, I am supporting the reasonable choice of our rapporteur, so that our Parliament can exercise its full authority in the coming negotiations and bring the Council round to its way of thinking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Cohesion policy has been a very positive instrument and has had considerable success in fostering this sense of belonging. Consequently, the weakening of cohesion policy has led to financial difficulties or to some projects being postponed. Worse still, by moving in this direction, the Union’s sense of belonging will fade and weaken, and may suffer irreversible damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Reducing the financial resources of cohesion policy is tantamount to dealing a hammer blow to the European spirit. The winner is selfish interest and the loser is solidarity, and without the latter there cannot be a sense of belonging and a notion of a European entity.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the cohesion policy, it would appear to make perfect sense to discuss an aspect that, being fresh in our minds, should help to formulate a cohesion policy that matches our new reality. This new element concerns the need to assess the impact, in the different areas of European territory, of the phenomenon of the invasion of Asian products. In discussions on the Financial Perspective in recent months, attempts have been made to discover who is and who is not a net contributor, by examining the budget with a fine-tooth comb. This kind of negotiation is unpleasant for all involved. I believe that the main reason why this happens is that the EU’s current funding model has been exhausted.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore address my last words to the Council. I feel it is clear that the reform of EU financing cannot be put off, and failure to heed such advice is evidence of political blinkeredness.</p>

This need appears to be all the more urgent following the recent results for the European Constitution in France and the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">I truly wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Böge, for his work, but I believe that it is disappointing for 1.07% in payment appropriations, compared with the 1.14% initially proposed by the European Commission, to be proposed as the position of the European Parliament. This limited financial framework lays down from the outset a European political programme of low expectations, which certainly does not respond to the new and major requirements of our times and of the peoples of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the specific issues, I do not believe that the philosophy of cofinancing the common agricultural policy is acceptable. Any such development would lead to farmers running at different speeds, to greater inequalities between the regions, and would have serious consequences on the financial aspect of the cohesion countries. Similarly, I agree with everyone who said that the adequacy of resources for the Structural Funds and for the Cohesion Fund needs to be safeguarded. Certainly the new countries need to be supported but, at the same time, the regions in the old cohesion countries, which are suffering the consequences of enlargement due to the statistical effect, must be given fundamental support.</p>
<p class="contents">If European integration is to reacquire momentum and win the trust of the citizens, it cannot be encaged in administrative and accounting perceptions. Unfortunately, the proposal by the Luxembourg Presidency moves in this restricted direction at a huge cost for the cohesion policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Council next week, the Heads of State or Government will have to rise to the occasion and take bold decisions about European priority policies and the need to finance them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is where a decision about the multi-annual plan will be an important credibility test, and hence the great significance of us in this House being able to take a stand tomorrow, which we are in a position to do probably thanks to the remarkable work of our rapporteur, in respect of which we have given the necessary means to be able to realise the enlargement but also – and we owe this again to the rapporteur’s proposals – make the new policy in the Union possible. We hope that, under Luxembourg leadership and with the help of the Commission, the Council will then work out a proposal which forms a real basis of negotiation with Parliament in order to reach agreement. I would like to emphasise today that it is already apparent that, with a view to the future, it will be impossible to work with the EU’s means as they are defined today.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to get the European Union to function properly, 1% is too little and so, in all likelihood, is 1.7%. The British rebate mortgages all of our own resources, but the fundamental decision must be that if the European Union cannot have its genuine own resources at its disposal, the EU will, sooner or later, run aground. The Union must be able to define its own policy with its genuine own means. Only then will we be able to realise our ambitions. Discussions on this at the next multi-annual plan must also form part of the agreement we will be concluding with the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will be one of the most important and significant votes in this session of Parliament. The European Parliament has basically supported the European Commission’s proposal, but has changed the structure of the Financial Perspective a little. The European Development Fund has been removed from the framework of the Financial Perspective and a reserve of 24 billion euros has been created. As a result, the amount of expenditure proposed by the European Parliament is apparently smaller – 1.07% of European Union gross national income – but, if the European Development Fund and the reserve are included, we would be close to the European Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Parliament’s proposal the main decrease in expenditure relates to sub-programme 1.a, ‘Competitiveness for growth and employment’, and also to administrative expenditure by the EU institutions, channelling extra resources towards the European Parliament’s traditional priorities. The European Parliament has acknowledged that the amount of expenditure allocated in the Commission’s proposal to sub-programme 1.b, ‘Cohesion for growth and employment’, is justified. The total amount of resources channelled into the EU funds is 0.41% of European Union GNI.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only is the amount of resources channelled into the EU funds important, but also the principles for the distribution of these resources. Various important questions are dealt with in the European Parliament’s position. The first relates to the Commission’s proposal to set a ceiling of 4% of a Member State’s GNI on the amount of resources which may be received from European Union funds. The European Parliament considers that the setting of a 4% ceiling is based on the experience of the past and that a flexible approach to the setting of ceilings is now needed. It should be remembered that a set of small and economically relatively less developed states have joined the EU. Secondly, the European Parliament considers that there should be a differentiation in the level of cofinancing from EU funds, depending on a Member State’s level of economic development. This means that a higher percentage of cofinancing from EU funds could be allocated to less developed EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Being concerned with regional policy, I am at one with the rapporteur – whom I congratulate on this excellent report – in believing that the EU’s ability to cope with the past and forthcoming enlargements and to reduce regional disparities is absolutely dependent on a strong and well-funded European regional policy being in place. On the other hand, though, EU structural policy must be equipped with sufficient resources to make it possible, in future, for adequate support to be offered to less developed regions and to those with particular socio-economic problems, including those in the old EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is of course the Commission proposal that best complies with the guidelines for the EU’s regional policy in the forthcoming planning period, which aim at the reduction of disparities between one region and another, we regard Mr Böge’s proposal as an acceptable compromise in comparison with both it and the quite unacceptable demand made by the six net contributors. Under no circumstances must cuts in the Budget fall hardest upon regional policy. The allocation proposed in the Commission’s draft regulations for cohesion funds for the individual targets is acceptable only if there is an increase of 1.14% in total resources. If cuts are made along the lines envisaged by the Böge report or, indeed, the Council regulation, resources must be more concentrated on resolving the grave problems in the regions most deserving of support. There must be no across-the-board cuts, that is to say cuts made without affecting the relative allocations, for these would unilaterally impose burdens on the convergence regions in the EU’s old Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has done an excellent job in very difficult circumstances. I would also like to align myself with Mr Wynn’s rather than Mr Davies’ remarks about the British rebate, hardly surprisingly. As one speaker has said, we are all equal but some are more equal than others. But the idea in paragraph 51, indent 5 might give a sensible idea of how to proceed, bringing in national parliaments to make our own resources system more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to raise one specific point which is of great importance. The European Union is going through turbulent times. We have no idea what our policies are going to be by 2013. We have no idea now what our external policies will be, particularly in relation to enlargement. We need a pause for reflection on the length of our commitment to this financial perspective. It is best to go for a five-year period, which is the same as the mandates of the Commission and of the European Parliament, because looking too far in the future would be an abuse of the democratic process. Of course, legislative proposals can be for a longer period, but five years would allow us to sort out our policies on expenditure and own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we need to go for an agreement. I agree with Mr Dehaene that we should give the presidencies as much as encouragement as possible to find one. But this Parliament should not sign up to any agreement at all. As we heard very clearly from our rapporteur, we need one that will be in our interests and the interests of our electorate and that is what we hope will come out of the Council in a few days’ time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">How much money are we prepared to spend on the European project? What financial effort are we prepared to dedicate to the process of European integration at a time when Europe is facing difficulties, when it is at a crossroads?</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur proposes less than the Commission, but more than the Council has proposed this afternoon. The President-in-Office of the Council says that we must create balances. I would stress what Mr Elles has said: balances are required, but we should remind the Council that with less money we will not create more Europe, we will create less Europe at a time when we need to re-affirm this project.</p>
<p class="contents">The referenda that have been held in recent days, as many speakers have mentioned, have reminded us of the need to focus on the real needs of our citizens, and they want us to grow more quickly. In order to do that, we must create more jobs, we must be more productive, we must spend more money on investment, research and development. In short, we must implement the Lisbon reforms. And in order to do that, we need money.</p>
<p class="contents">Our citizens have also reminded us that they believe in a social model in which both cohesion and the efficiency of the market are priorities. Without a policy of correcting territorial imbalances, the economic project represented by the European Union could probably survive. What would not survive would be the political project that is at stake here.</p>
<p class="contents">We must convince our citizens that together we can deal with our future challenges: the challenges of globalisation, of competition from emerging countries, of relocation of companies and the ageing of the population. And in order to do that we need more money.</p>
<p class="contents">As an additional and final point, I would like to express my strong opposition to the beginning of co-funding of the agricultural policy, since that will also mean breaking the social cohesion rules on which the model we believe in has been based. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is necessary to be able not only to prioritise what is important but also to give lower priority to what is less important. In setting priorities, we must also be able to distinguish between the common, and most important, tasks of the EU and the important tasks of the Member States. We have not reached the point of doing that in this work on the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission’s proposal had been implemented, it would have meant an increase of almost a third in the Swedish membership contribution. It would have reduced the scope for the investments in growth and new jobs that must be made in Sweden, and it would have created major budget problems.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want Europe to become the world’s most competitive knowledge-based economy, it does not make sense for us to give priority to the rich Member States’ contributions at the expense of developing a common infrastructure in our weakest regions. Not enough priority has yet been given to this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is it sensible of us to give priority to marketing efforts in the developing countries on behalf of European agriculture, at the same time as reducing our most important investments in Europe’s knowledge and research community. If, in your negotiations, you – the Council and the Commission – do not manage to ensure that we are able to achieve the objective of devoting 3% of the European economy to aiding knowledge and research so that European research can take the lead in Europe’s knowledge-based society, then you will fail in setting one of the most important priorities needed by Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has done a fantastic job, involving clear priorities. The Commission did not, and the Council now appears to be reducing the investment that should be made in research. I urge it not to do this. Europe needs aid for research. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are, however, one or two areas where I have difficulty with his conclusions. First of all, I think it obviously is crucial that EU spending be kept under tight control and that expenditure should be used as efficiently as possible. No national government, I would suggest, could contemplate some of the spending increases that have been suggested for the 2007-2013 period. Taxpayers across the EU have a right to expect politicians to spend wisely and given the recent referendum results, it is clear that many in Europe and not just in Britain share concerns that vast quantities of their money are being spent on major projects of which they do not seem to know enough.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the overall budget, I can support the current position of the British Government, as well as a number of other governments, and believe that it should be capped at 1% of the total national income of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the United Kingdom rebate, I believe that it is justified and certainly I am going to look carefully at the position taken up by our Prime Minister, Mr Blair, at the European Council next week. My one plea, without going back over old ground, is that I hope that the issue of the United Kingdom rebate does not find itself becoming part of a separate set of negotiations about the future of Europe following the results of the referenda in France and the Netherlands this week. It is a serious matter and it needs to be dealt with in a serious way and I am sure there are views on both sides on this, but to tie it into a general set of negotiations and discussions, when critical issues have to be decided for the future of our continent, would seem to me totally inappropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolas Schmit,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, you have had a rich, constructive, but at times contradictory debate on an excellent report that will certainly help us to reach a compromise. However, as your debate – which was certainly not lacking in contradictions – has shown, the Presidency has to manage these contradictions, which sometimes become even greater when they are presented by the Heads of Government or by the ministers of the various governments. From the starting point of these contradictions, we must try to reach a balance between all these elements so that we can finally resolve the matter and reach a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">You will therefore understand that this task is not a particularly easy one. Similarly, your rapporteur’s task was not an easy one at all. I note that, on certain points, it has been said that action must be taken on the UK’s rebate. The Presidency completely agrees with this; it has put forward proposals in this vein. Others say the opposite, and bring agricultural issues into the equation. Does this mean that we must reduce the EU’s agricultural policy, with all the consequences that would entail? Do we want the countryside of Europe to become a desert? That is a specific and precise question that needs to be answered. I think that, in any case, Europe needs to have priorities and must have a clearer idea of where it wants to go.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency, or rather Luxembourg, could have signed the Commission’s proposals very happily. It has problems, however, with the wording of these proposals. Having said that, I certainly do not dispute that they form a very solid base from which to prepare for the future of Europe. Unfortunately, on the basis of these proposals alone, we will not reach a compromise next week. We therefore need to look again for this compromise, to see how and to what extent we can reduce the figures proposed without, in future, depriving the Community budget of its impact, its influence and its ability to guide policy. Certain speakers say that we have cut 40% here, 30% there. Nevertheless, I myself have noted that there is real growth under all the headings. In some cases, this growth may be inadequate, but in others it is quite significant and takes account of the priorities that you as MEPs regard as particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder where we would end up if there were no agreement, if we stuck with a sort of status quo? According to my information, we would probably end up with a budget or financial perspectives of about EUR 835 billion from 2006. The Presidency proposes more. It is more ambitious; it may not be ambitious enough, but it is more so than the Member States, or at least than a number of Member States are prepared to be.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the idea that Europe needs to find new momentum. We need to fight, first of all, against demagoguery, against those who claim that too much European money is being squandered. I think that we must not under any circumstances tolerate these claims, which damage not only the effectiveness of Europe, but also, ultimately, our entire project. I think that those debates must not take place; they must be thwarted.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs solidarity. I completely agree with the idea that it needs greater solidarity. The Europe of 25, the Europe of 27, but also the Europe of 15. But we must strike the right balance in this approach based on solidarity, and that is what we have tried to do; we need to distinguish between rich regions, poor regions in rich countries, and poor regions in poor countries, because they are not quite the same thing. That is why I think it is important to find the right balance that will enable everyone to find his or her way.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must also spend its money more effectively. That is a message that we must convey. Perhaps we should define better the added value of European policies, work more to improve the quality of Community expenditure, concentrate our expenditure more, improve coordination between Community expenditure, European expenditure and national expenditure. All of this will certainly enable Lisbon to progress further. I would, in all sincerity, ask the following question: with regard, for example, to life-long learning, do we really need to pass funds via Brussels to support projects in our Member States? Would it not perhaps be preferable to create a framework, to set out rules and to improve cooperation in defining policies?</p>
<p class="contents">It is sometimes necessary to be selective, in order to focus our resources where they can really produce the best results. We all agree with the idea that we need to increase investment in research. We also know that the Community budget cannot, on its own, achieve the objectives we have set ourselves. We need better coordination between Community expenditure, national expenditure and contributions, private funding. I think that this may be a field in which the US could provide an example, if we observe how they succeed in managing their spending better, not only quantitatively, but maybe qualitatively too.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot promise you that the Presidency will reach a compromise. I cannot guarantee that this compromise will be as ambitious as you would like. But I can say one thing: if we do not reach a compromise, the situation could not be worse. It will be worse in the sense that we will not be able to define programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the whole of Europe, everyone who is waiting for something from Europe, everyone who is waiting for money to finance programmes that aim to improve competitivity and cohesion, will all be left hanging, and that is not something that will improve the image of Europe just at a time when it needs to be improved and to be strengthened in the eyes of our citizens.</p>

I am struck by how similar your priorities are to those of the Commission, in particular boosting economic growth, job creation, solidarity with the poorest people, those who most need true solidarity in our approach, and also meeting commitments we have made, in other words bringing our commitments, and our finances, into line with our political priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In this debate, you have demonstrated the usefulness of the European budget; you have shown that, very often, spending at European level enables savings at national level and that there is an added value to such spending. Spending at European level very often makes it possible to realise projects that would not otherwise have been achieved. On these two points, the priorities and the usefulness of the budgetary instrument for our Europe, for Europe’s ambitions and for solidarity within Europe, there is therefore considerable convergence between the points of view of the Commission and of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now reached – as we are all aware – a crucial moment, and I think that we could summarise the spirit of today’s debate by saying that we – or in any case most of us, I think – really do want an agreement, and we want a good agreement. We want an ambitious agreement, an ambition for Europe, a Europe that is not a Europe of rebates, and, at the same time, we want a Europe that shows solidarity. That is the conclusion that I, at least, take from this debate. To reach such an agreement, however, we must be prepared to make compromises and, on this subject, I would like to address the Presidency. I am well aware that the Presidency is making extraordinary efforts. I am constantly aware of it. I am in constant contact with the President of the Council, Mr Juncker, and I think that we need to express our gratitude to him, to the Luxembourg Government and to Luxembourg’s diplomats. It is true that the Presidency mainly works with the Member States, but I remember what Mr Schmit has just said. He said that he, personally, could certainly subscribe to the Commission’s initial proposal. I think the same thing with regard to the Böge report, which, I hope, will be voted for tomorrow. Pass your resolution!</p>
<p class="contents">I would now call on the Presidency to introduce into this crucial phase of negotiations the message that Parliament will send tomorrow. It is true that contradictions and different points of view have been expressed in this House, but I think that our vote tomorrow will nevertheless express Parliament’s will. As we all agreed during these negotiations, they are not limited to just the Member States – even though their role is decisive, the negotiations are taking place between the Council, Parliament and the Commission. As a result, what we now ask the Presidency – whilst congratulating it on its determination and whilst telling it that we want a compromise and that we are here to help it reach that compromise – is to reach a compromise that is closer to what Parliament will, I hope, vote for tomorrow, and also closer to the Commission’s proposal than to that from certain Member States, even though we recognise that they do have real difficulties that we must not underestimate.</p>
<p class="contents">That is my appeal. That is my appeal to the Presidency. It is also my appeal to all MEPs so that we can look forward to this final phase – I hope it is the final one – of negotiations in a spirit of compromise and so that the message that comes out of the next European Council is again a positive one. Once again, Europe will surprise its enemies by showing that, in difficult situations, and particularly in difficult situations, we are capable not only of finding a solution, but of finding a credible solution, in other words a solution that brings together our ambitions and the instruments that we give to the European institutions to achieve those ambitions.</p>

There is one point on which I am in complete agreement with the Council Presidency, and that is that no headway will be made, either in the Council or in Parliament, if there are those who see their role as being to speak up for special interests, while others see themselves as responsible for brokering compromises. It is for that reason that what this House needs to do tomorrow is to set out a quite definite negotiating position, and to do so by as large a majority as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing, though – and this I have to say to Mr Schmit – that one thing I too do not accept is the celebrated chaos theory, according to which all is lost if there is no mutual understanding. Following the vote in plenary tomorrow, we will need to employ the time left to us before the European Council meets in talks and negotiations. Whilst I recognise that the problem lies perhaps in the Council itself rather than in the Presidency, the Council must not get the idea that everything will be sorted out once it reaches a compromise. It is far more important that we should first define our negotiating position, that the Council should set out its position in relation to that, and that Parliament should eventually have to agree.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters, then, is that we use the next 10 days in working very hard to hammer out a workable compromise.</p>
