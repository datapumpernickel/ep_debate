First, I should like to than the rapporteur, Mr de Roo, for his report on the Commission's marine fuels sulphur proposal. I know that he only took over as rapporteur late in March, so I should like to commend his efficiency and indeed urge the Council to follow his example.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Commission's proposal is to reduce ship emissions of sulphur dioxide and particulate matter. These are directly related to the sulphur content of marine fuels, which is currently 2.7% on average, or 27 000 parts per million (ppm) compared with road fuel, which has a new sulphur limit of 10 ppm. We therefore propose two new marine fuels sulphur limits: a 1.5% limit for all ships in the Baltic Sea, North Sea and English Channel, which is the internationally agreed sulphur emission control area; the same 1.5% limit for passenger vessels going to or from ports anywhere in the European Union; and a 0.2% limit for ships at berth in EU ports.</p>
<p class="contents">These limits will achieve significant emissions reductions, which are targeted at reducing acidification in northern Europe and improving local air quality in ports and coastal areas. The human health benefits include 2 000 life-years saved annually as a result of better air quality.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is cost-effective, with benefits outweighing costs by over 2 to 1. It is also practical and enforceable, designed to allow ships to obtain compliant fuel and use it safely, and to allow effective enforcement in ports. Importantly, given that shipping is a global industry, the main element of the proposal is aligned with internationally-agreed rules set out in the International Maritime Organisation's Air Pollution Convention, that is, MARPOL, Annex VI.</p>
<p class="contents">In preparing this proposal, the Commission worked closely with the industry and NGO stakeholders to make sure the result was environmentally ambitious as well as politically and practically feasible. We will consider Parliament's amendments with the same objective in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We worked well together.</p>
<p class="contents">The topic of sulphur in marine fuel may sound technical and dull, but it is very important in terms of both acidification and of public health. In 2010, the amount of sulphur originating from sea-going ships will be nearly as high as that originating from all other land resources combined. This is because we have already done a great deal on land. The large chimney stacks of factories and power stations, but also cars spring to mind. In a few years' time, we will be heading towards 10 ppm, compared to 27 000 ppm accounted for by sea-going vessels. This is nearly 3 000 times higher than for cars.</p>
<p class="contents">Acidification is still a major problem. In my own country, the Netherlands, for example, only 10% of the environment is protected against acidification, which leaves 90% that is not. Heathland is still changing into grassland, and sensitive ecosystems are still facing destruction. This is why I am extremely pleased to have struck a compromise with all the political groups, which goes much further than what the European Commission proposes. Indeed, we suggest introducing a 0.5% limit in two steps. Only then will we tackle the problem of acidification in all seriousness.</p>
<p class="contents">The other reason why we want to go so far is public health. Sea-going ships emit black carcinogenic particles, which the wind carries for 50, 100, even hundreds of kilometres – an aspect that the Commission has overlooked. This is why we feel that the proposal to reduce sulphur content levels down to 1.5% is too modest. I should urge Commissioner Wallström to immerse herself in this issue and to adopt the European Parliament's proposal. We will then clean up those sea-going vessels in one fell swoop and not take any half measures.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we arrive at this 0.5% threshold? This is indeed ambitious. A reduction in the sulphur content from 3% to 1.5% is possible for oil refineries without too many extreme costs. Reducing it even further to 0.5% is technically feasible, but will certainly cost three times as much, and ship owners will ultimately need to carry these extra costs. As the Commissioner stated a moment ago, the shipping industry is a very competitive business. This is why it is particularly pleasing that a company such as P&amp;O has already fitted one of its large ferries with a scrubber, which only cost a bargain EUR 1.5 million. It will reduce sulphur by 95%, carcinogenic particles by 80% and the emission of NOx by 10 to 20%. The device is called an <span class="italic">eco-silencer</span>, as it also greatly reduces the noise level.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, this scrubbing technique works very well. As long ago as in 1988, there was a ship in Norway that was equipped with this installation, the first of its kind. We have, however, added a clause to the Parliament amendments that a trial should be done first to make sure that the system works really well. Once this is successful, we would like to give the go-ahead, also to a system of emissions trading, so that it becomes possible for companies to equip their ships with a new system of this kind one after the other rather than all at once. If they all needed to be fitted simultaneously, or if we all went down to 0.5% in terms of bunker fuel oil, it would be a much more expensive operation. Such a system of emissions trading is cheaper. In short, ecology and economy go hand in hand. This is why, Commissioner Wallström, I would urge you to have another look and join the Parliament in reducing the level to 0.5%.</p>
<p class="contents">A final reason why it is important to do something about these particles is that according to many climate scientists, these particles also adversely affect the climate. All sea-going ships together account for 20% of these particles. This aspect should also be taken into consideration. This is a third reason why we should go beyond 1.5% and go for 0.5%.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here too, we started by considering the real impact of such a reduction. We can visualise this in very practical terms. If you visit any port in the European Union – let's take Hamburg as an example – and sit down on the quayside, you have buses on one side which comply with the Euro 4 limit and now produce virtually no particulate emissions, and on the other side you have ships – service barges, perhaps – where you can actually see the particulate matter being released. There is clearly something wrong here, technically speaking. It is therefore appropriate to step up the measures adopted in respect of shipping. In Hamburg, for example, 80% of sulphur dioxide emissions and around 20% of particulate emissions now come from shipping, even though there are of course far fewer ships on the sea than private vehicles and lorries on the roads.</p>
<p class="contents">If we consider that ships are replaced relatively infrequently and engines are long-life products, it is difficult to achieve very much with exhaust gas technology for diesel engines in the short term. We are therefore focussing on the technology to reduce the sulphur content of marine fuels. That has a direct impact, and Mr de Roo has already given us the figures: such fuels typically contain 2.7% of sulphur, compared to 0.0001% for automotive fuels. There is clearly a great deal of potential here.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to agree on the level of reduction we must achieve. The aim is to introduce a 0.5% sulphur limit on marine fuels in order to attain a real reduction in sulphur dioxide and particulate emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">We spent a long time discussing how we can sensibly achieve this target, and finally opted for this two-step approach, which offers scope for development. I too would ask you, Commissioner, to go along with this two-step approach so that we can finally achieve the 0.5% limit. It is supported – as you see – by a large majority in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it would be better if we could proceed on the basis of an international consensus here, because naturally, the ships are not only refuelled in the European Union. However, MARPOL is itself a cumbersome vessel, as the Commissioner knows, which offers little room for manoeuvre. In my view – and the negotiations on the other issues of relevance to the environment and safety bear this out – if the European Union is the driving force here, MARPOL will start to move as well. In other words, if we take this step towards a 0.5% limit, I believe that this will offer us the prospect of achieving more robust agreements on this limit at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">From our perspective, the task is not just to decide on a specific technology. If it is possible to reduce sulphur dioxide and particulate emissions in another way than by reducing the sulphur content, that is naturally to be welcomed. The aim is to reduce emissions. It is not our job to decide how this should be done. To that extent, I am also in favour of examining alternative technologies and, if this review produces the right outcomes, to implement them as well. We have therefore opened the way for alternative technologies here as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The cost issue was naturally a major consideration in the Committee on Industry. Low-sulphur fuel is of course more expensive. However, as experience in the Baltic bears out, low-sulphur fuel oil has the advantage of resulting in less maintenance work and better fuel efficiency, so the additional cost of using low-sulphur fuel oil is to some extent compensated by cost savings. I therefore believe that in the interests of the environment, but also in the interests of the economy, the 0.5% limit should be the target. I believe this is the right route, so let us follow it together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the same time we have the problem of what to do with the residue from the oil refineries, because we are taking the sulphur out of the fuel used in road vehicles, fuel which is 26 000 parts per million sulphur. So of course we export to the third world. The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> tanker was carrying high-sulphur heavy oil from Estonia to Singapore, but a lot of the rest is used in shipping, causing pollution at sea which we prevented on land.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an international agreement under MARPOL Annex VI to reduce the sulphur content in sensitive sea areas to 1.5% in the Channel, the North Sea and the Baltic. Even this small step forward will cost one billion euros per year, a cost which will be ultimately borne by the consumers buying the goods which are delivered by ship.</p>
<p class="contents">The easy bit is to achieve this, using low-sulphur crude or blending. Stage two as proposed by Mr de Roo will be more expensive and it needs to be carefully costed before we go forward with that. There is of course another approach, and that is not to just look at the fuel, as in cars, but to use abatement technology, so called 'sea-water scrubbers', and I am pleased that the compromise includes provision for trials of this new technology.</p>
<p class="contents">As we speak two ferries owned by P&amp;O operating on the Dover/Calais route, an important connection between old and new Europe, are undergoing major refits in Germany. One of them, the <span class="italic">Pride of Kent</span> is being fitted with the converter, the Eco-Silencer, and its sister ship the <span class="italic">Pride of Canterbury</span> is not being fitted, although it has been adapted for fitting at a later date. I am confident these trials will show that the benefits of using this technology go over and above the directive in terms of delivering a 95% reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions, as against a 40% reduction which we can achieve through using the fuel. It is a big improvement over MARPOL Annex VI, with the additional benefit of reducing particulates by 80% and a substantial reduction in nitrogen oxide pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">The environmental concerns that Mrs Thors expressed need to be addressed, particularly the effects of putting this dilute sulphuric acid into the sea in certain port areas and also how we dispose of the sludge on store in an environmentally sensitive way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr de Roo and of course Mrs Hautala, who started this report, and the other rapporteurs for the constructive way in which we have managed to negotiate an agreement within Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have worked openly and constructively.</p>
<p class="contents">I have proceeded on the basis that we in actual fact want to improve the environmental situation in the coastal states. When, today, we look at the Commission’s proposal and at the MARPOL Convention’s Annex VI, we see that, according to information I have received, it should quite soon come into force because 47.57% of world tonnage is affiliated to it. I must, however, say what a shame it is that a great many EU countries, including the country I know best, have not ratified it. I think, however, that the example involving MARPOL shows that the Commission’s proposal was not perhaps as ambitious as we had wished and that we must make further progress.</p>
<p class="contents">When we get together to take a measure within the maritime sphere, we can now, as Mr Lange also said, achieve a very great deal internationally. Together, the EU countries and the candidate countries have such a large fleet that we often have our rules put into effect in the IMO. I therefore also view the directive and the improvements we are making in the light of this. That is how we must work together.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been talking a very great deal about the new reduction methods, an area Mr Goodwill said I had been anxious about. In actual fact, I want the Commission to take an honest and broadly based look at the subsequent environmental effects. It may well be that the methods are better for one area of the environment but worse for another. We need broadly based follow-up systems in different eco-systems in different types of water. The overall effects need to be looked at.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that our group will request a separate vote on Amendments Nos 20 and 21 in order to clarify anything that may be obscure. Our group will also vote against them because we do not think it is possible to implement them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall say, first of all, that, according to data from the European Environment Agency, in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions we must focus on maritime transport. This focus on maritime transport in order to resolve the problem of climate change must not be developed, however, at the cost of acidification by sulphur dioxide emissions. I therefore consider it unacceptable that the efforts made on land to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions have not been matched at sea and I consequently welcome the Commission’s excellent initiative, although I feel it should be more ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the upper limits for sulphur content should be lower, and so I fully support the figure of 0.5%; secondly, zones should be extended with the aim of reducing sulphur dioxide emissions into other zones to below the levels laid down in the MARPOL Convention – it is therefore crucial that the Commission fights within the MARPOL Convention to extend these emissions reductions to the Mediterranean, the Northeast Atlantic and the Black Sea; thirdly, I believe it is important that our action in the field of climate change to reduce the economic costs of complying with the Kyoto Protocol can also be applied to the problem of acidification. If we are going to achieve a EUR 1.3 billion reduction in the cost of complying with the Kyoto Protocol in Europe, we should also apply an identical system for sulphur dioxide emissions trading so that we can lower even further the cost of achieving these aims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. Mr President, the Commission has carefully considered the proposed amendments. We are able to accept three-quarters of them fully, in part, or in principle. Most offer helpful clarification and improve the quality of the proposal, as has been expressed by speakers here tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">Those amendments that we cannot accept or accept only in part relate to three main issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The first and biggest issue is the proposal for tighter marine fuel sulphur limits extended to a wider sea area. The report proposes a phased approach, starting with the 1.5% set out in the Commission proposal, with a tighter 0.5% limit in a second phase. Later phases also extend the area where ships have to comply with these limits in all exclusive economic zones and territorial seas throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 20 contradicts this and goes further still, proposing that the 0.2% sulphur limit for ships at berth should be extended throughout the 12-mile territorial seas of all EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that these new and extended limits are premature. I do not doubt that there may be environmental benefits. These have not been quantified; nor have the costs, which could be significant. Contrary to the normal rules of economics, the more low-sulphur fuel is required, the more expensive it gets. That is because refineries have to invest more and more in de-sulphurisation technology to increase capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed new phases also go beyond the internationally agreed 1.5% sulphur emission control area in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel, but it is open to Member States to propose the designation of new sulphur emission control areas at the International Maritime Organisation and to negotiate tighter fuel limits for these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Shipping is a global industry. Given that this international policy mechanism exists, we believe that it should be used as a first resort. However, if tighter limits prove necessary and an international solution cannot be reached, the review clause in the proposal gives the Commission the right to take action at EU level at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue concerns emissions offsetting, or trading. The concept of emissions trading for conventional air pollutants is not currently well developed at EU level, even for land-based stationary emission sources. For sea-going mobile emission sources – ships – we also believe that the idea is somewhat premature.</p>
<p class="contents">Trading is not permitted under MARPOL Annex VI. Another concern is that ship emissions of air pollutants have regional or local impacts that trading schemes might not be sensitive enough to address.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite difficult to see how and by whom any scheme would be administered and enforced. That said, we are actively considering emissions trading and other economic instruments as possible complements to regulation in future.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason we can accept Amendment No 44 in principle, which requires the Commission to consider a range of economic instruments and report back to Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The last issue relates to requirements on the Commission. Amendment Nos 32 and 44 propose to bring forward the date of the Commission's 2010 report on the implementation of the directive. They also require the Commission to present new proposals, with a report, to revise fuel sulphur limits or to introduce economic instruments. The Commission believes that it would be too early to report on the implementation of the directive in 2007 or 2008, given that some of the proposed fuel sulphur limits would not enter into force until 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that it is premature to prescribe the content of the report and require it to be accompanied by legislative proposals. While we can accept Amendment Nos 30 and 34 in principle, we believe these are also too prescriptive about the Commission's activities. You know how sensitive we are to these things. In each case we would propose an alternative wording.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, just a few words about the possibilities offered by exhaust-gas cleaning. The tighter fuel sulphur limits proposed in today's report are linked to the possible use of exhaust-gas cleaning technology or scrubbing, as an alternative means of compliance. This is allowed under MARPOL and, provided it does not emit harmful effluent into enclosed waters, the Commission proposal already includes a review clause to allow scrubbing in future. The technology appears to offer potential benefits, reducing sulphur dioxide emissions, nitrogen oxides and particles. It may also cost less than switching fuels for ships which frequently travel on EU seas. On the other hand it is very important to prove that the technology has no adverse impact on the marine environment, so that we do not simply replace one environmental problem with another, as you have also pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">Subject to successful sea trials we believe that scrubbing can indeed be considered as an alternative to low-sulphur fuels and not just for the proposed second-phase limit of 0.5%. So, we welcome Parliament's proposals for a new text on scrubbing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to hand in a list in writing summarising the Commission's position on all the amendments tabled<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.
