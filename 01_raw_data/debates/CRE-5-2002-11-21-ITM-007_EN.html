<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">.</span></span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate ought never to have been necessary. Sadly, the Commission has today been proved right. The Commission proposed the speedy withdrawal of old-fashioned single-hull tankers some time ago. Unfortunately the Council did not follow our advice. It failed to act with the necessary urgency and adopt the Commission’s proposals following discussion with Parliament. Had it done so, the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> would have been banned since 1 September 2002. It would therefore never have broken up and sunk off the coast of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There are lessons to be learnt from all this. Those were my very words when the <span class="italic">Erika</span> sank off the coast of Brittany. I must reiterate them today, as we discuss the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> which sunk off Spain, off the coast of Galicia to be precise. There are lessons to be learnt and measures to be taken. The first lesson is crystal clear. Speed is of the essence, and so are determination and decisive action. These situations need to be dealt with once and for all, to ensure no further similar tragedies happen.</p>
<p class="contents">The immediate action required is obvious. The authorities must compensate those affected and they must undertake the clean-up operation required to return the coast to its previous condition. I will remind the House that this is a particularly rich coast, both in terms of fish and shellfish production and from an environmental point of view. Almost all of it is covered by Natura 2002. So, the affected areas need to be cleaned and restored. The chain of events leading to the disaster must also be traced. It should be borne in mind that back in 1997 a number of oil companies rejected this vessel, on the grounds that it was dangerous and unsafe. It appears that the last time the vessel underwent an inspection as required in the European Union under the Paris Memorandum was in 1999. Furthermore, the vessel had put into two European ports before this summer. Regrettably, in neither of these was it inspected as required.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to study all the links in the chain and establish what exactly happened and where responsibility lies. The lessons to be learnt to prevent a repeat of such situations should then become clear. The present situation involves a vessel with a Greek owner, flying the flag of the Bahamas, inspected by a United States classification society and managed by a Swiss company. It has links with other countries too, all of which offer substantial tax advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">We are called on to take all the urgent action in our power to prevent a further tragedy of this kind. That involves the immediate application and implementation of agreements and directives adopted by European Union Ministers. Application of the Erika I package cannot wait until June of next year, nor can the Erika II package be left until February of 2004. They must be put into practice now. They must be made effective, which means meeting the target of inspection of 25% of vessels entering a port by the port authorities, 25% of the most dangerous vessels, those posing the greatest risk. The standards specified in existing provisions must be applied. Single-hull tankers must be replaced by double-hull ones as a matter of urgency. The Community system for following up information on maritime traffic in all areas must be set up at the earliest opportunity. Steps should also be taken to facilitate emergency intervention, by designating protection areas, mooring areas and areas for emergency shelter. The European Maritime Safety Agency should start operations too. It is tasked with ensuring that the correct procedures are followed in all European ports, and also with providing technical support to the various countries and to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions with the COPE Fund ought to be pursued. This fund was set up for the specific purpose of covering compensation and the cost of restoring and cleaning the environment. This is over and above standard compensation. It complements the FIPOL Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, at the next Council of Ministers meeting on 6 December, as an urgent measure, I shall propose the adoption of an administrative decision by all Member States of the Union to ensure that heavy fuel oil is only transported in double-hull tankers during the transitional period until single-hull tankers are phased out as already planned. Heavy fuel oil is after all the most polluting of all these products. Each of the vessels involved in the latest three accidents, namely the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, the <span class="italic">Baltic</span> and the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, was an old-fashioned single-hull tanker carrying heavy fuel oil. Heavy fuel oil is the most dangerous product. Consequently, stricter safety measures are needed. This could easily be achieved through an administrative decision by the governments of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to go further. That means working to increase the FIPOL and COPE Funds. It also means persevering with the Commission’s work on future criminal sanctions in the European area. Going further also means that port authorities should improve the application of the directive on inspection. It has been shown that there are ports where hardly any inspection takes place. These could almost be termed ports of convenience. This amounts to taking fraudulent advantage of the present situation and has to be stopped. In addition, going further means reconsidering the basis of international maritime law at global level within the framework of the International Maritime Organisation. International maritime law is based on Nineteenth Century principles, yet here we are in the Twentieth Century, when our seas are criss-crossed daily by hundreds of thousands of vessels loaded with cargoes that are highly dangerous because of their volume or content. A century and a half ago this just did not happen. Going further also means strengthening the rights of coastal states in the 200-mile zone, and in straits. In particular, these rights need to be strengthened so that they can be defended against the risks of those particularly dangerous cargoes.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, going further should also mean talking to our neighbours. I have in mind those who share with us a common interest in certain enormously fragile seas. For example, the Baltic which we share with Russia, the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea. We should cooperate with Russia and with other states in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster need never have happened. As a Commission, we did everything in our power to prevent it. We were unsuccessful, but we must ensure no second <span class="italic">Erika</span> or second <span class="italic">Prestige</span> founders off our coasts. We must also strive to ensure that such incidents do not occur along the coasts of other seas, off other continents. We should remember that the seas are a common heritage, and that our concern has to extend to their farthest reaches.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, as a native of Galicia I feel devastated. I am quite overcome by the spectacle unfolding before us. As a politician, I am keenly aware of the heavy responsibility we bear as Members of this House. We are charged with defending the interests of our constituents and we must succeed in so doing. Vague statements and half-truths simply will not do any longer. As the Commissioner said, this has to be the last tragedy at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">I should indeed like to begin by commending Commissioner de Palacio on her work. To all intents and purposes, before she was appointed there was no such thing as a European policy on maritime safety. We now have a substantial package of measures on the table, namely Erika I and Erika II.</p>
<p class="contents">The question as to whether these measures are adequate and whether they are being applied correctly has already been raised in the House. Clearly, the answer is no. The European Parliament must unite and throw its political weight behind the European Commission. It has to send out a clear signal. We need to work together to speed up implementation of these measures. They must come into force.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner referred to double hulls. The latter are compulsory in the United States, and had that been the case here, this accident probably would not have happened. The Commissioner also mentioned inspections at ports within the European Community, which is where we should start, and at all other ports in Europe and across the world. All ports should actually be monitored, be they colonies, tax havens or ports of convenience as some have been described. The Maritime Safety Agency has to start operating as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, as a native of Galicia I am all too aware of the unfortunate record held by that part of Spain. Eight such accidents have taken place there over the last thirty years. Six of these accidents happened in the last twenty years. In Galicia the Atlantic coast of the Cape Finisterre area is known as the Coast of Death. The European Agency should be located in an area affected by maritime accidents. It should be in one that has experienced their consequences. Perhaps others could offer more than my region. Locating the Agency in Galicia could however go some way towards compensating the area. I know this falls outside the competence of both Parliament and the Commission, but I feel moved to express my thoughts aloud.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the resolution calls for the establishment of special maritime fishing areas. Undoubtedly, Galicia does fall into that category because of its rich shellfish and fishing resources mentioned earlier, and also because of its diversity and marine ecosystem. We are eager to move what could be termed the lanes of death further away from where they now are. We want to prevent our sea from becoming a sewer. We want to prevent vessels that are no better than rusting hulks from sailing on it. The sea is Galicia’s life. Galicia’s economy is based on it and I could go so far as to say that its distinctive culture is too. Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, that sea is now poisoned.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures must be strictly implemented as from tomorrow. We must insist that Member States do so. Mr President, I really feel the time has come for European solidarity to make itself felt. I would recall that we have ourselves shown solidarity to other Member States in the past. We now call on them to respond in kind. Any assistance offered to Galicia will be welcome. I would like to refer in particular to the Solidarity Fund. I studied Article 2 and it certainly does apply in this instance, especially if the reports approved by the House are borne in mind. It should also be taken into account that Galicia is an Objective 1 region whose fish and shellfish resources represent more than 10% of its gross domestic product. Given that these are in danger of being totally wiped out for an unspecified period, Galicia does indeed meet the conditions for benefiting from the Solidarity Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to assure the Commissioner that she can count on support from the Group of the European People’s Party. Indeed I am sure the whole House will support her in her efforts. We need to be able to start doing what is required as of tomorrow. Then we shall never again have to regret accidents of this kind. Thank you in advance, ladies and gentlemen, for the support I am confident you will offer us.</p>

It is evidence of the great interest I know she has in this issue which is causing such concern to us all.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> was carrying twice as much crude oil in its tanks as the <span class="italic">Erika</span>. The oil slick it caused is already an economic, social and environmental disaster for Europe, especially for my home region. It represents a mayor problem for Europe and its consequences will be felt for many long years.</p>
<p class="contents">More than 300 km of coastline have been polluted. Three further spills have been detected and the strong wind from the south-west is bringing them closer to the coast. Shellfish production, inshore fishing, aquaculture, tourism and the very image of Galicia have all been seriously affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Galicia is known to be an area prone to oil spills, yet it remains unprotected, despite the fact that 70% of Europe’s crude oil goes past its coastline. No effective lessons seem to have been learnt, even after enduring five oil spills. Sadly, it also has to be said that lack of equipment is currently hampering the efforts of many citizens eager to help.</p>
<p class="contents">Pictures of hundreds of fishermen sewing together an enormous net four kilometres long to create an amateur device for holding back the oil speak volumes. So do pictures of people on beaches armed with buckets and spades. They show twenty-first century citizens coping with a nineteenth century disaster using Stone Age tools. Information has failed too. Spanish public opinion believes attempts were made to play down the gravity of the situation. This is in stark contrast to the grave concern expressed by European governments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner rightly said that the disaster could have been prevented if European regulations had been applied. In addition, she stated that the Erika package will come into force in 2003. She went on to say, however, that despite Parliament’s express wish to the contrary, vessels without protective ballast tanks will be able to ply the seas until 2012. Those that do have such protection will be permitted up to 2026. Furthermore, the requirement for double hulls does not apply to small tankers, so they will still be able to sail also. That is why I am delighted with the Commissioner’s swift response. I welcome it and urge Member States in the Council to accept her proposals as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, further action is needed. For example, tankers carrying dangerous goods should be required to set routes along the furthermost part of the shipping lane, and the Finisterre lane should be relocated away from the coast. It is certainly true that this issue calls for legislation at world level, but the European Union has to press ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group calls for a policy on transport and sustainable development based on the principle of maximum safety and prevention. Such a policy must reinforce cooperation within the Community, along with the means of inspection and safety standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We reiterate the call for Community funds to be channelled to this disaster. Community aid must retain its credibility, however. You will recall that Galicia was recently let down when no Community agreement was reached with Morocco. The victims’ interests must come first. We therefore believe that the European Solidarity Fund set up recently is the most appropriate instrument in this case, as it is flexible, immediate, and was devised as a Community instrument. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was clearly not the case here. I have to say, I am shocked and I should like to ask my fellow MEPs from that region to extend the sympathy of our group to everyone involved. As a legislator, I am furious, but also a little despondent because this is the second time that we have faced the same problem in less than three years. We do not yet have all the facts by a long way, but we have a few. The question I am asking is whether the Erika package is sufficient. The Erika package is clearly valuable and should enter into force at the earliest opportunity, but is it sufficient?</p>
<p class="contents">I have a question concerning airports. I mentioned airports and safe berthing places in one of my previous reports. I do not think that this legislation is completely incontrovertible. I should like to know, once we have all the facts, what we can do to improve the situation, so that a ship in distress is not turned down, which, I assume, exacerbated the situation, but can berth somewhere so that the disaster is kept down to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reason why we should improve the situation is so that we can also mention compensation – something that was unmentionable in my report – for a port which suffers damage in this case. No provision has been made for this. We should do this. In fact, a start is only just being made.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as you have already stated, Commissioner, we are very weak internationally speaking. Would it not at long last be possible within the IMO and if necessary just for our own sake to work with a black list of states that allow their flags to be misused and in that way enhance the power of the port state? Should we not reconsider all our options and use our influence to enhance the IMO's role in the process? This is also a task for the Council; we cannot do this on our own. We therefore need to improve our rules. This applies to the Commission, the European Parliament, all the groups – party politics should not come into this – but also and, above all, the Council and Member States. However, we should, first and foremost, help the people involved and alleviate the despair in that region. I believe this to be the duty of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of those sayings, which my mother and my grandmothers would use when some irreversible domestic accident happened, was 'why cry over spilt milk?'.</p>
<p class="contents">This saying is relevant here because we are once again having to express our regret at something we should have prevented through stricter control measures and by bringing forward the date for the disappearance of single-hull ships – and please note, Commissioner, that I wrote this before hearing you speak and I am therefore in agreement with what you said at the beginning. We must demand compliance with the laws we adopt, but also revise those which are not sufficiently rigorous.</p>
<p class="contents">The wrecking of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> once again damages an area which has suffered three serious accidents of this type over recent years: in 1976, the <span class="italic">Urquiola</span>, the <span class="italic">Mar Egeo</span> in 1992 and the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> this year. I have not yet been to Galicia – I am going tomorrow – but I am sure that one really needs to talk to the fishermen and shellfishermen in order to understand exactly the extent of the tragedy they are facing and their need for help, help which our Group is fully in favour of providing. But we must prevent anything like this from happening again, because, as well as the social and economic disaster it represents, it is an ecological disaster which affects areas belonging to the Natura 2000 network, biodiversity and the wealth of a region such as Galicia.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, when it comes to voting in this Parliament, we must remember this catastrophe, because in the coming months we are going to discuss a very important directive, which relates to responsibility for environmental damage, and all of us here will remember what it is we are voting for. Because there are times when stricter measures are required and there is much resistance – on the part of the lobbies present in this very House – to voting for these stricter, more serious and more rigorous measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few seconds remaining to me, Mr President, I would like to say – on behalf of my colleague, Ilda Figueiredo, who has had to leave – that she also would like to express her solidarity with the victims of the oil slick, that she demands more rigorous control measures in order to prevent it happening again, that she considers it important to establish a list of sensitive maritime areas and that they must be subject to special protection in Galicia, Brittany and, as she points out, Portugal as well – which is close by – and she insists that the Erika I and II packages must be applied, and their dates brought forward, and she requests effective measures against flags of convenience and the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund for the repair of environmental damage and compensation for the victims.</p>

Today Galicia, and also the whole of Europe, is suffering from the ‘black shadow’ caused by political irresponsibility and the contemptible interests of the mafias that control maritime traffic and flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster is now the fourth to have occurred off the coast of Galicia in recent years. The names <span class="italic">‘Urquiola’</span>, <span class="italic">‘Aegean Sea’</span> and <span class="italic">‘Casou’</span> are, together with that of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, part of our consciousness and of our collective misfortunes. On the Coast of Death and in the Rias Baixas and the Rias Altas, these misfortunes are remembered even more sharply. Therefore, in these emergency situations, we, the men and women of Galicia wonder: what good to us is the Spanish State – the authority whose main task and responsibility at this historic time is to protect our people, our nature, the marvellous Galician nature, and our economy, the persistent and long-suffering Galician economy? What good to us is the head of the State government who was absent from Galicia at a tragic time, whilst the inhabitants of the Coast of Death and the Rias were under attack from the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, and who, to universal scorn, was in Prague with NATO, dining out and sycophantically applauding President Bush and his unilateral and ‘preventive’ strikes?</p>
<p class="contents">As a Galician and a supporter of European integration, I wonder, what major action have the Galician and EU authorities taken in this tragic situation? It is precisely in this Parliament that reactionary positions by Members contributed – and in this context I must agree with the Commissioner – to changing the legislation contained in the ‘Erika’ package, which would have prevented this accursed ship from continuing to move around our seas.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not be under any illusion: this disaster has consequences identical to those of a natural disaster, but it is really a political disaster and we know who the guilty parties are. Mr President, the location of the European Safe Seas Agency has still not been decided on, in contravention of the ‘Erika’ legislation. Once again, the governments of the Member States have not been equal to the circumstances. Following what has happened in Galicia, can any doubt remain that the Agency should be based in a region in which there is the greatest concentration of intercontinental traffic and where there is the greatest risk of accident?</p>

This was a disaster waiting to happen because we know how enormously vulnerable our coasts are, particularly in Brittany, Galicia and in Portugal’s seas, both in continental Portugal and in the seas around Madeira and the Azores, which are all busy maritime passages and crossroads. It was also bound to happen because of the appalling conditions in which many ships still sail, carrying dangerous and highly polluting cargoes, whilst we are hesitant and slow at European and world level about adopting rigorous and mandatory measures for prevention and guidance, confiscation and destruction. The disaster was bound to happen, lastly, because it could be seen that the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> would break up and sink, leaving questions as to whether the measures adopted at the time the emergency was declared one week ago and thereafter were correct and adequate.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a time-bomb sitting at the bottom of the sea; nobody really knows what it is going to do and at the same time the ecological, social and economic effects of the spilt fuel are already terrible for hundreds of kilometres of coastline and the threat hanging over the coast, the river estuaries and the immediate future of hundreds of thousands of people who are directly and indirectly affected, both our Galician brethren and those in the north of Portugal, who are praying for the danger to recede, is enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">We must provide three types of response: to the present, to the future and to the past. We must respond to the present in four ways: we must mobilise all available means to monitor and minimise the polluting effects, rigorously investigate the risks arising from the sunken ship with 60 000 tonnes of oil in its tanks and keep them under strict control, we must make those responsible pay, provide sympathetic help for the frightened and worried populations by giving them all the help they need and by assisting the recovery of the local economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, we must respond to the future: we must get the European Safe Seas Agency up and running – I personally would like it to be based in Portugal – and increase resources for port and coastal inspection. Above all, however, we must go along with the positions of Commissioner de Palacio. Commissioner, do not hesitate: go right ahead. Parliament and the Council must prove themselves able to provide what these communities are calling for.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must respond to the past: preventing future disasters of this scale and more effectively limiting the damage caused require all the facts and the reactions to such disasters to be verified and established objectively and rigorously, enabling us to make a technical assessment of whether the reactions were right or wrong. We must assure ourselves that in the face of any similar emergency in future, all the competent authorities will be able to respond rapidly and courageously in the way that most effectively anticipates real environmental damage and risks and consequently is most able to limit and control these. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We voted on two blocks of measures. Many of them are good. However, nothing has changed, and while Parliament is talking, every day vessels set out into the Ouessant lane ready to pour out their oil onto the coasts of the Vendée or Galicia if by chance there is a storm.</p>
<p class="contents">As a lawyer, before joining Parliament, I spent hundreds of hours with the victims of the Erika, professionals and local groups. Tomorrow, will I have to go back and say to them: 'we are moved, very moved, but we cannot be effective in less than three years because of codecision'? Commissioner, you were just saying: 'I want it <span class="italic">hic et nunc</span>', but the system replies: <span class="italic">'non possumus'</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">So while the Americans protected themselves in a few months, with immediate measures, we take years to adopt measures with a delayed effect, the content of which will ultimately be inadequate. Inadequate for two reasons. First of all, because the Treaties do not allow the countries that are threatened, such as France and Spain or Portugal, to protect themselves unilaterally and rapidly when circumstances require it, and equally because those countries have to admit defeat with countries for whom maritime safety is not a priority. Also, because we will not have done anything until we have forced the oil companies to take prime responsibility for transporting their goods, so that security is ensured by rich companies that are well-known and laying their reputation on the line, and not by ship owners with no identity or nationality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Be that as it may, I think it is up to all of us here to investigate what happened and why it happened as quickly as possible and of course it is not easy to draw any conclusions when you have a ship flying under the flag of the Bahamas, a country which, I may remind you, is not on the black list, it is hardly even on the grey list of the so-called Paris ΜΟU, a ship operated by a Liberian company, owned by a Greek and registered with an American shipping register, in fact one of the best shipping registers in the world, a ship which was built in China, comes from Latvia and Russia, was fitted out in Gibraltar and so on and so forth. So we need to find out who of all these was or was not to blame and we must, of necessity, be level-headed and persistent. I think that we will get to the bottom of this in the end and the European Commission will be a great help here.</p>
<p class="contents">So what do we need to do next? We obviously need a set of measures. I have been talking with a number of Members over recent days who are all in favour of double hulls. Others want port controls, others are talking about the responsibility of the shipping registers and flags of convenience, others still point to the lack of ports of refuge. I think that those of us who happen to deal with these issues on a daily basis know that there is no universal panacea. There is no panacea, ladies and gentlemen, we need a set of measures, we need to proceed on all these fronts at once.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to do something about this, I think that, first, the European Commission needs to be strict in applying the Community legislation which is already in place. Countries which do not comply with Community legislation should be hauled before the Court of Justice and I think Mrs Palacio will do so. Secondly, we really must speed up the application of the Erika I and Erika II packages. We adopted 5 directives almost unanimously here in Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, and they obviously need to be applied, together with a previous directive on dumping waste at sea which – theoretically – is being applied. Now all that remains is to see if it is being applied in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to push ahead with the European Commission's other proposal on a European Solidarity Fund. May I remind you that the European Parliament approved these proposals by the European Commission and that the proposal has stuck with the Council. So pressure needs to be brought to bear on the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I totally agree with a ban on the carriage of heavy petroleum products by single-hull tankers. May I remind you that, as rapporteur, I personally proposed this when we were discussing withdrawing single-hull vessels. Unfortunately, it is recorded in the Minutes of the European Parliament but was not accepted because certain know-it-alls popped up left, right and centre and said that the proposal was not feasible. I believed it was feasible then and I believe it is feasible now and that you should move in this direction, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">What Mr Sterckx said about environmentally sensitive areas is also right. We need to mark out corridors for tankers so as to ensure that these areas are not polluted.</p>
<p class="contents">Most importantly at this stage the European Union needs to show its solidarity with the people of Galicia. We need to help these people. We have the Structural Funds, we have the Solidarity Fund and we need to do our very best to help Galicia get back to normal as quickly as possible.</p>

We must show solidarity here, and – as our Portuguese and Spanish colleagues should know – it must be tangible rather than abstract. That is why the region and the people there need assistance from Europe quickly. I do not think that anyone would question this.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be aware, however, that this disaster could be repeated any day, Commissioner, because for years it has been the same old story. The combination of an ancient tanker that is only fit for the scrap heap and a flag of convenience – this time of the Bahamas – is usually the cause. Flags of convenience are synonymous with poor quality, a poor vessel, poor technology and a poor crew. Usually the story ends with a coordinated reluctance to claim responsibility so that no one knows any more who is actually to blame for what.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Commissioner, is the reason for Paragraph 3 of our motion. As soon as all of the information is on the table, we will expect to receive a report from you stating who was responsible for this disaster, when, how and why. I think that a few words will also have to be reserved for the Spanish authorities in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been surprised at some of the statements made by ministers of transport over the last few days and at the demands that they are now making. Clearly these transport ministers have forgotten that, for example, the regulation on compensation in cases of liability for oil pollution, which the Commission and Parliament have passed, has been lying on the table in the Council for over a year without any action being taken. Commissioner, you have Parliament's full support if you want to put a bomb under these gentlemen in the Council so that we finally get legislation soon. Where incidents of this kind are concerned, we have to call to account the oil companies, the shipowners, the cargo owners and the classification societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The system of flags of convenience cannot continue in its present form, Commissioner. I appeal to you to consider making a proposal on this. We need European shipping; we need good European vessels with good European crews. Flags of convenience are a blight on the system. Help to eradicate them by making a good Commission proposal. Parliament will give it speedy consideration.</p>

This is yet another disaster, although we said after the last one that it was too late to lock the stable door after the horse had bolted. The stable door had clearly not been locked. The facts had not been sufficiently spelled out, something for which the politicians are at fault.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mrs de Palacio when she states that the Council has failed to assume its responsibility. It has done a disservice to the people who live along the Spanish coast, a disservice to the fishing industry, a disservice to the environment and, above all, a disservice to transport by water, a topic to which we want to devote so much attention. It is particularly unfortunate that we need another disaster to put this topic on the agenda. I also think that we should adopt this resolution and that we all need to ensure that it is accepted across the political spectrum so as to avoid another repeat.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, citizens are not concerned with which political body is responsible for this. They are left to pick up the pieces, so they need help. I think it is our joint duty to keep a very close eye on this and also to monitor the implementation of the solution of the problem which we are now facing.</p>
<p class="contents">I see that the first towed hopper dredges are now at work. However, according to the weather forecast, the winds will pick up this evening and then we are back to square one tomorrow. In short, I hope that, given this thick crude oil, you will also ensure that oil can possibly be drained from the actual tanker. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I should like to put on record my and our solidarity with the people in Galicia.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a social tragedy for those who live by the sea and tourism. The true scale of this economic and ecological disaster is starting to dawn ever more clearly. A true catastrophe is unfolding before our eyes. Galicia's green coast is gradually turning black. The indignation is growing by the hour. Everyone is asking how this is possible after all those previous disasters. The disaster involving the <span class="italic">Erika</span> is still fresh in our memories and the wreck of the <span class="italic">Amoco Cadiz</span> in 1978 awakened an environmental awareness in many of my generation. Every time a disaster strikes, we are faced with the disastrous consequences of negligence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a disgrace that the agency for maritime safety is not to be launched until some time next year. It is a disgrace that port control should only be scant and, in many cases, implemented in a questionable manner. It is a disgrace that single-hulled wrecks should still be bobbing their way around the oceans and that they should take their course past vulnerable regions. There is something fundamentally wrong with our transport sector. I would quote Mr Rijnigerd, a former director of the Rotterdam-based recovery firm Smit, who stated that ‘trying to transport an oil shipment as cheaply as possible from Latvia to Gibraltar in an obsolete and poorly maintained tanker is asking for trouble’.</p>
<p class="contents">There are therefore bad apples that need to be removed. They are sharks that slip through the net. However, we should admit that the net that is supposed to catch them is yet to be put in place. We as Greens support more transport by water, but those highways at sea should not be accessible to cowboys and environmental criminals. We would argue in favour of less transport, less use of fossil fuels and more involvement by a greater, fully-fledged, ecological European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On these occasions, we must focus on what is most urgent: the need to mobilise technical and financial resources in order to minimise environmental damage, to regenerate ecosystems and to support the economic activities that have been affected by this accident.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, a debate which, although not quite as urgent, is nonetheless of the utmost importance: that of responsibility. In this matter, the ‘polluter pays’ rule must be enforced, by investigating, prosecuting and punishing those responsible. We must, however, go beyond looking for someone to blame. We must determine the responsibility, firstly of those who should have inspected but did not and of those who did inspect but did not act. Secondly, we must determine the responsibility of those who managed the crisis, in particular, we must clarify the reason why the EU as a whole was not involved in managing the risk from the very outset, given that it was known that the consequences of the accident would easily move beyond the confines of one country and would affect the entire natural heritage of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the future, I hope that the Member States will heed the well-drafted call and the leadership of Commissioner de Palacio, with a view to immediately implementing the ‘Erika I’ and ‘Erika II’ packages and give a boost to the creation of the European Safe Seas Agency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that the situation that we are in is extremely dangerous, as the public has good reason, as these disasters keep reoccurring, for wondering, doubting, becoming impatient and even rising up against the impotence of the public authorities. However, Commissioner, you are right in saying that the European Union has done a great deal, that it has done its duty in a quite remarkable timescale in terms of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">So where is the problem? I think that it was stated by Mr Varaut. The problem is that we are in a field in which there is urgency, in which the task of the public authorities to ensure security is highly desired by the people and in which, in reality, joint sovereignty creates considerable problems. My government, in recent days, was upset that measures had not yet entered into force; France is lagging behind in terms of checks in ports.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we will only overcome this situation if one day, as soon as possible, we manage to create an independent European area of maritime safety, with independent legislation, which would use regulations rather than directives – as the directives are still not practically transposed in any Member State – with independent checks and penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this should be our ambition, or we will fail and will condemn our people to the sad spectacle of a ping-pong match between the Commission and the European Union, on the one hand, and the Member States, on the other hand, each of them trying to beat the other in dramatic circumstances that the people do not understand.</p>

What has happened off the Galician coasts with this peculiar oil tanker, originating from a tax haven, with a flag of convenience and furthermore, in unfair competition and trading oil in a very strange way, cannot and must not happen again in any of the seas of the planet. It is clear that we must be increasingly demanding in terms of safety in transport, especially in the transport of dangerous goods and at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">In our case, we must adopt appropriate measures so that there is no repetition of disasters such as the one that has taken place with this dreadful oil slick, the significant ecological impact of which should oblige us Members of this Parliament to reflect.</p>

Has account been taken of the negative impact of this ecological disaster on fishing, on nature, on tourism, on the society in this Galicia Finisterre? Until when? It depends on us, but we must speed up and review the measures adopted in the Erika case – as the Commissioner has just rightly pointed out.</p>

Anger at its tragic consequences, and also anger because we have had enough of Europe being accused. If we had followed the Commission, if we had followed the European Parliament, we would not be in this position. We have had enough of being accused for no reason when we have adequate legislation and there is no further need to legislate. The legislation needs to be applied and that is the problem. After the sinking of the Erika, France, which then held the presidency of the European Union, and the Socialist government at the time, had made maritime safety an absolute priority. If the situation was not so tragic, one could laugh at it.</p>
<p class="contents">You know the result! France was criticised by the European Commission for not respecting the directive on checks in ports. That is enough! We have had enough of the failings of the Member States and the Council. Indeed, the President of the French Republic, Jacques Chirac, has just asked for maritime safety to be a priority on the agenda of the next European Council meeting. I hope that no coastal Member State will fail to answer that call.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the legislation, which is adequate, with the 'Erika II' package. It needs to be applied. We need to increase checks, ensure the integrity of those who carry out those checks and define which ports should be able to receive vessels in distress. We should also express our complete solidarity with the people of Galicia, who are going to suffer terribly in terms of fishing and tourism. Having said that, the environmental tragedy is even worse, as it cannot be repaired by just giving subsidies. Brittany is suffering and will continue to suffer for a long time in terms of its biodiversity and ecological balance, which are essential for maintaining fish resources and preserving species. What is the use of 'Natura 2000' and our protection directives if we do nothing about maritime security?</p>
<p class="contents">Today the Council is responsible for having blocked the legislation that we adopted. Today, it is the people of the coastal States, European citizens, who are asking you, Commissioner, to be uncompromising.</p>

<p class="contents">Despite the fact that history repeats itself, it is still difficult to establish data on the origin and destination of the cargo, as well as its exact characteristics. Old ships are still operating, using flags of convenience of countries which are less demanding in terms of safety, with crews which in most cases do not have the necessary professional qualifications and knowledge for this type of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that a problem that is repeated so often and which has such serious consequences for the economy of a region and for its marine and coastal ecosystems must be dealt with rigorously and quickly by means of joint measures in all the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures such as the extension of sea corridors should not be made to wait, so that ships transporting dangerous goods are further from the coast, especially when they are sailing through areas of high ecological sensitivity such as the Galician coasts.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also urgently consider bringing forward the obligatory demand for double hulls and intensify and improve the quality of inspections. This has been said very clearly by Commissioner de Palacio. Furthermore, all the Community legislation must enter into force as soon as possible: the Erika I and Erika II packages. But above all it is essential that the existing rules are applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither must we forget the human face of this disaster and the importance of the aid reaching its destination as soon as possible.

There is considerable indignation, but this indignation must be followed up with emergency measures; we must not simply wait for these long deadlines for the ‘Erika I’ and ‘Erika II’ packages to be met.

There must now be effective solidarity, particularly with the communities of northern Portugal, which will be the first to suffer the consequences of this accident, of this shipwreck, the likes of which must never happen again on our coasts; unless we adopt such measures, the people themselves will make their scepticism about Europe and European governments clear.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to say that I fully agree with the Commissioner’s words and support those measures which offer a clear line of action. We also share her desire for their application to be speeded up. This is what is needed, and what we do not need is any more political demagoguery such as that expressed in some speeches we have heard here.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps these are the thoughts of a Galician countryman, whose future and family situation is looking grim following what has been described as the worst ecological, economic and social disaster in the history of Galicia. We understand that the people of Galicia are today sad and angry, and that sadness and anger has known and identifiable faces: each and every one of the people directly affected by the oil slick caused by the oil tanker disaster, and each and every one of the Galicians who, in Galicia and throughout the world, love their homeland and all of those of us who feel solidarity with them.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other side are the people responsible, whose faces are obscured behind flags of convenience and legal procedures distorted to this end, and with a view to fraudulently avoiding the rules of the internal market, without caring about possible ecological damage – which is now real – and social and economic harm, and, without wanting to be alarmist, the damage which may also be in store for other coastal areas as the result of a domino effect. I believe that enough has been said and that we must look forward, learning from the lessons of the immediate past.</p>

But situations such as this cannot and must not happen again, and we must repair and prevent the effects which may yet extend to other areas of Galicia or Portugal, because the risk remains there.</p>

<p class="contents">The European Union and its Member States must therefore spare no effort to help to minimise the scale of the effects of the disaster and compensate the main victims as far as possible for the damage caused. We must take the opportunity of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> oil tanker disaster to make a few observations. The first is that this accident must be subject to a rigorous inquiry, not only with regard to the EU’s safety rules covering this type of transport but also into the reason for the course taken by the ship, which having moved away to the west, suddenly headed southwards, and sank only thirty miles outside Portuguese waters. My second observation is that we must understand that this disaster could also seriously affect the northern coast of Portugal, if not now, then later, and the European Union also needs to consider aid for Portugal to improve its resources for mobilisation, monitoring and prevention. The fisheries sector, as a matter of fact, has already begun to be affected. Lastly, despite the fact that the tragedy’s effects will clearly be felt in many sectors of the economy, there is no doubt that the most badly affected sector is that of fisheries and aquiculture.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel it is crucial that, in the framework of the aid that is to be mobilised, thought is given to the need for a specific emergency plan for these sectors. I do not think that the EUR 117.7 million Commissioner Fischler announced for Spain and the EUR 15 million for Portugal will resolve the problems, not only because of the overall amount, which is limited, but also because, where Portugal is concerned, the option must be left open for this amount to be increased if the situation on its coasts grows worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we will have to bear in mind that compensation for the prolonged suspension of fishing alone will not suffice. What is needed, perhaps, is to think about another, more fundamental type of measure to provide alternative employment for these fishermen, for example, fishing in other waters in the medium term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Member States have committed to the practice whereby loading ports are obliged to assess the condition of vessels and, if necessary, stop the ship from leaving without repairs being done if the risk is considered to be too great.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this practice still does not apply to the applicant countries, and this ship had picked up its cargo at a port in the Baltic Sea. The risk is especially great in the Baltic, where there is heavy regular traffic and consignments often consist of materials and substances that the Baltic ecology simply would not be able to withstand if harmed by them.</p>
<p class="contents">As someone who lives on the Baltic coast I now wish to express my deep sorrow for the residents of Galicia and all those whose livelihood is now in great peril.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, making ports responsible for the condition of vessels to be loaded is not enough. The owners of freight must also be made accountable, as they also have an interest in ensuring that their consignments are organised responsibly and safely. Secondly, the practices of insurance companies and the terms and conditions they offer will have to be changed if necessary by means of Community legislation so that the cheapest option for a shipowner is not sinking his ship when it is in distress. Insurance law must be based on the notion that rescuing the ship must be possible and the cheapest option for the policyholder.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to switch to these practices swiftly and without making any exceptions. It is regrettable that the legislators should become wise and energetic only after an accident has happened. When, however, the accident has faded in people’s memories no wise or urgent measures are taken to avoid accidents in the future. On the contrary, everyone frantically starts looking after their own interests and the struggle to lengthen the periods of transition commences, as people want to dodge the regulations in the hope of getting off lightly. We need a <span class="italic">Prestige </span>package as an extension to the <span class="italic">Erika </span>package, which the Commission should start drafting right away with a view to producing something quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to reply to Mr Miller, because I believe he has the wrong information.</p>
<p class="contents">I have here for your perusal the precise movements of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> during 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, provided by the maritime authority of the Bahamas.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, it reached the port of Rotterdam and that is when for the last time it had an in-depth inspection in accordance with the Paris Memorandum in a European port. Then, before the summer, it reached the port of Kalamata, in Greece, and I have contacted the port and authorities there to ask what the state of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> was in Greece and it was not inspected in accordance with the Paris Memorandum. It then reached the port of Gibraltar and I have also approached the British authorities to ask why they did not carry out the control.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that I have not just asked them about the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. I have asked the Greek and British authorities about the application of the current legislation, of the Directive which demands control by port authorities, in accordance with the commitments relating in practice to the Paris Memorandum. I have asked about controls and the application in these ports – Kalamata and Gibraltar – of the Directive currently in force.</p>
<p class="contents">I must tell the honourable Member that I have some statistics. I can say that in Gibraltar, in 1999, five ships have been inspected. In 2000, six. In 2001, two. In 2002, twelve. Those are the statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am saying the legislation must be reviewed in order to guarantee that these controls by port authorities are carried out in all the ports of the European Union. Because controls by port authorities have a deterrent effect, they have the effect of keeping away substandard ships, and this must happen in all ports. Because if we leave gaps in our network, in our system, the whole thing is automatically weakened. That is what I am saying. This is not a criticism of any particular port. In this case, these two are involved: Kalamata and Gibraltar. And I have asked for information.</p>
<p class="contents">But the problem is not with any particular port. The problem, ladies and gentlemen, is that there has been an ecological disaster, a catastrophe which we should have prevented, and which we could have prevented if the Commission’s proposals had entered into force. And I would like to extend all the gratitude and acknowledgement expressed here today to all the members of the Directorate-General for Transport who have worked like Trojans, that is, extraordinarily hard, without watching the clock, so that, when the <span class="italic">Erika </span>disaster happened, within just three months, we could present an entire coherent and global package to this House and the Council of Ministers so that these problems would not happen again. That is what I am talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">And I am talking about the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that only 23 months have passed. And precisely because only 23 months have passed and because there was a lack of ambition – as we all know – there has been another disaster. How many more? Well, that is my point. Is it not possible that between now and June 2003 or February 2004 there will be a disaster in the Baltic, in the Mediterranean, in the Atlantic or off any other European Union coast, because the measures already adopted have not been implemented?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, what we have to demand – and this is what I have done in a letter to the Ministers – is that they be applied now. The problem is that the Governments are behaving incoherently. The Heads of State and Government said in Nice that the implementation of these measures had to be brought forward and then they do not apply them...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Infringement procedures have been opened against some of them for lack of application, not of the new rules, but of those currently in force, which are much less strict and much easier to comply with.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal meant that single-hull oil tankers, of category 1, that is, the largest ones, would have a maximum life of 23 years. Because there is clearly a problem with structures associated with the stress on metals caused by blows at sea, which arise after twenty or so years. And what I regret is that this proposal of ours should not be accepted and that it be raised from 23 to 27 years. And that is what the current problems stem from.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid, ladies and gentlemen. We are working on this. There will be the aid provided by the Spanish authorities. What we clearly have are the FIPOL funds. And I would point out that there is an expert from the Directorate-General for Transport, in Spain, cooperating with the Spanish authorities, just as it cooperated with the French authorities to facilitate the payment of all that aid and of that compensation for the various people affected.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also looking at issues relating to fishing to see what possibilities there may be for support in terms of the FIFG funds. We are looking at the possibility of applying the Solidarity Fund, but I believe it will not be possible – I say this clearly. The thresholds for the use of the Solidarity Fund are so high that I hope that the damage does not reach that level, because then it would really be an horrendous tragedy. We would be talking about more than EUR 3 000 million, ladies and gentlemen. Let us hope that it does not go that far.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore also looking at the support that can be provided if, despite everything, that EUR 3 000 million is not reached but there is a significant effect on the region of Galicia, in which case support could also be provided by means of this Solidarity Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Portugal can be spared from this tragedy. I hope that the winds will not allow the oil slick to reach their coast. I would like the Spanish coasts not be to be affected any further, but let us hope, at least, that the Portuguese coasts stay clean. In any event, if Portuguese coasts were also affected, the funds would be available to them as well, in the same form and the same way that they are available to the Spanish authorities and the Spanish people affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, what has been adopted must be put into practice. There is a whole range of measures which form a coherent global whole, with a Maritime Safety Agency to guarantee, together with the Commission, the appropriate application of the rules. We are going to set up this Maritime Safety Agency provisionally in Brussels, while they are deciding or not deciding on where the headquarters will be. I am very sorry, but I am not going to wait for them to come to an agreement. I hope it will be set up before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue. Amongst the aspects which correspond to the countries – the strengthening of port control, strengthening the demands on classification societies – we are of course going to hold a full investigation into what has happened – as I said before – of the whole chain, and I will present the results of our investigations to you: the whole chain of events which has led us to the final result, in relation to the classification societies as well. We will also demand that the States of the Union designate ports and refuge areas in order to deal with situations such as that of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, which was also one of the controversial elements, or that of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Strictness in application. In the application and the demand for compliance with the regulations. We are talking about going further. I have made this very clear: International Maritime Organisation, corridors for dangerous products, sea room distances, special control in passes and straits, greater capacities for coastal States. All of this within the context of the International Maritime Organisation, genuinely adapting maritime law to the demands and new circumstances of the 21st Century. Meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, we also have to deal in more depth with the issue of responsibility, we must present the issue of the COPE Funds once again to the Council of Ministers, as a complement to the FIPOL Fund; we must present the issue of criminal responsibility once again to the Council of Ministers and we must demand of the Ministers that, in all the Member States – and I believe this is possible in all of them by means of an administrative regulation – double hulls be required for the transportation of the most dangerous and polluting products, such as heavy fuel oil.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Savary spoke of an autonomous European area of maritime safety. The truth is that this is an issue which, of course, could be considered in the discussions within the Convention and the next Intergovernmental Conference. I am sure you can imagine that it will not be I who disagrees with these ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying to Mrs Grossetête that, in fact, all I feel, with everything that has happened over recent days, is a great sense of anger and rage, knowing that we could have prevented it and did not do so.</p>
