<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wijkman (PPE-DE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, the Commission’s proposal for an Action Plan to increase energy efficiency is welcome. As the rapporteur, I can, at the same time, see that the plan has many shortcomings in its original form. I hope that the proposals in Parliament’s resolution will be valuable in the way they complement the plan and that, as the Commissioner responsible, Mrs de Palacio will make our proposals her own.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of discussing the Action Plan, it has become very clear how neglected energy saving is as a policy area and in society generally. Many people are doubtless aware that we have to change the direction of energy policy and reduce our considerable dependency on fossil fuels. If, however, you ask them how we are to do this, they do not as a rule come up with many answers. Some people propose renewable energy sources. Extremely few would state that it is especially through more efficient energy use that the change should be brought about. The reason, of course, is the lack of knowledge about what can be done. What is more, there are not enough economic incentives to facilitate investment in more efficient energy use.</p>
<p class="contents">One major problem is that energy savings are invisible. When we invest in a wind park, it is obvious to everyone what the money has been used for. If we put a corresponding amount of money into the rational use of energy, the investment is seen as being significantly more diffuse. I therefore hope that the proposal to turn all the EU’s institutions, that is to say the buildings we work in, into symbols of the rational use of energy will be adopted. We can, of course, begin with this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There is very great potential within the EU for saving energy and using it in rational ways. In my view, the Commission is too cautious in its assessments. At least 30% of the energy used today could be saved through rational behaviour. If, moreover, the environmental costs of energy production and consumption were built into prices, the potential would be even greater. The report’s demands that environmental costs should be internalised and that the problem should be overcome by means of different types of tax, especially a kilometre/tonne charge on heavy vehicles and a tax on bunker fuels, must be seen against this background. In the same way, it is important to use the tax system to promote energy-efficient vehicles and buildings, or equipment which contributes to the more rational use of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot to be done in this area to increase the incentives for the rational use of energy. A general overhaul of tax policy is needed in order to promote what is good and positive from an environmental point of view rather than what is anything but good and positive. That is additionally important in the current situation in which electricity markets are being deregulated. Deregulation is excellent, but it has led to such low prices that, for example, problems involving counter-pressure have arisen.</p>
<p class="contents">The report demands a series of new directives aimed at stimulating energy efficiency in different areas: the building sector, combined power and heating, electronic equipment of different kinds and the transport sector. Another important proposal is that of linking the intelligent use of energy to what is being called the Lisbon process. The Lisbon Summit set the goal of making the EU into the world’s most competitive and productive economy. Such a programme would be significantly impaired if the environmental aspects were not covered. These could be covered by a demand for energy efficiency within the European Union to increase annually by, for example, 2.5%. Even if no account were taken of the environmental aspects, there is a lot to be said for putting energy efficiency on the agenda set by the Lisbon process. The more efficient use of natural and energy resources would be an excellent contribution to the European Union’s competitiveness and productivity.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor must we forget countries in the vicinity of the EU. If these aspects are important to ourselves, it is also important that they should be emphasised in the negotiations with the candidate countries in the context of the enlargement process. That also applies, of course, in connection with the aid we supply. In the course of the work done on the report, it has become clear to me how important it is that systematic, long-term work should be done on these issues. Together with three other MEPs – Mrs McNally, Mr Turmes and Mrs van der Laan – I have therefore prepared an initiative called Energy Intelligent Europe, which has already been supported by many representatives of different political groups and Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention is, in various ways, to stimulate the debate about the rational use of energy and to propose initiatives that should be taken by the EU and the Member States in order to make our energy use more intelligent. There is therefore every good reason to return to these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An energy saving of 18% is equivalent to a drop in energy consumption of 1 900 terawatt/hours. That represents a saving of EUR 124 billion, which could be used to enhance the economic potential of the regions within the European Union. If we extrapolate from these figures, we find that consistent implementation of this programme could create about a million jobs in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the protection of resources. We must be aware that 90% of the oil that is extracted today was found more than 20 years ago; in other words, it comes from sources that are more than 20 years old. Only 10% of the oil that is being extracted today was discovered in the last 20 years. Once again, I cannot fail to mention here that the procurement of oil is inextricably linked with the use of military power. We see that in the Middle East, we see it in the Caucasus, and we see it in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important things in this context are to create awareness and to develop intelligent models for the use of combined heat and power, judiciously funded contracting models. If we are serious about this, it is essential that the aims which are formulated here be given binding force. Otherwise our work will merely have been a statistical exercise and an inefficient use of our own energy. It is imperative that we remove the fiscal, bureaucratic and financial barriers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason we wish to aim for a reduction in energy intensity. The political objective for us at the present time is a 2.5% reduction. It goes without saying that the widely divergent starting points of the 15 Member States must be taken into account when such targets are set. That is precisely why we believe that this target must be binding, and the process should begin in that country where the level of energy efficiency is highest, the country most capable of effecting such an improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that the share of combined heat and power generation in the energy market could be increased to 18% by 2010 and 25% by 2015, because that would also put electricity supply on a secure basis. Cogeneration, of course, can be achieved with fossil fuels as well as with renewable forms of energy. We are backing renewable energy in particular, and there are encouraging examples in this domain, such as pellet-fuelled heating, with which heat and power can be cogenerated very efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that the European Commission steps up its coordination effort in this area. Coordinating European initiatives is a highly demanding task, if we think of programmes such as SAVE, Altener or the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Energy. Many programmes are available, but the important thing is to ensure that they are carefully targeted.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns public tendering and centralised procurement. Special consideration should be given in these contexts to small and medium-sized companies; to that end, the cost of new appliances and systems should be calculated on the basis of their entire life expectancy, including the price of total energy consumption over that period in addition to the purchase price. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That consensus is leading to the joint initiative he mentioned, which we shall be announcing tomorrow. This is unusually good working together. Thank you, too, to the Commissioner, who works within the limits of a very inadequate Treaty. There is no energy chapter in the Treaty. This is a big gap and we must continue to put pressure on Member States if we want a coherent policy. That is what disappoints me about this action plan. It does not seem to be part of a coherent energy policy with short-term, medium-term and long-term strategies. It is a piecemeal approach in which the emphasis varies according to the publication.</p>
<p class="contents">The case for energy efficiency is clear and unanswerable. It meets all three requisites of an energy policy: environmental impact, security of supply and competitiveness. All are helped by energy efficiency. So if this is so self-evident, the obvious question is why do we need an action plan? Why is this not happening automatically? We know what the barriers are to accepting such a common sense solution. Ignorance of the facts, particularly at household and small firm level. Lack of incentive – energy in the European Union is artificially cheap because of the subsidies for the conventional forms of energy, which are often denied but certainly there, and the failure to take on board the external costs. In many Member States, there is no requirement to even look at demand site management. Commissioner, what has happened to the rational planning directive? Please bring it forward again. It has not finished its journey through the legislative process. Transport is, of course, a particularly difficult area and action is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">This action plan of the Commission's is unambitious. A 1% per annum improvement would be very easy to achieve. We need at least 2.5%; that is attainable. We want to give serious consideration to the setting up of an energy programme agency with the task of producing the coherent energy strategy I mentioned. We can look at energy appliances. However, I am dubious about voluntary agreements. The Sixth Framework Programme gives us an opportunity to look at research and I hope that tomorrow, Commissioner, you will join with us in looking forward to a more intelligent use of energy in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Beysen (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact that in the European Union, across all sectors of the economy, and also in the world of the private consumer, there is great potential for boosting energy efficiency levels. It is therefore essential that an effective strategy be developed. It is the task of the European Commission to formulate proposals to improve building regulations, to promote the energy efficiency of electrical appliances, for which, among other things, standards must be laid down with regard to the standby function, and, last but not least, proposals for measures to adopt a Community policy for a sustainable transport system. In my opinion, the European Parliament also has to act as a model. Why, for example, can we not install solar panels in the European Parliament buildings, both here and in Brussels? After all, the energy generated would supply sufficient energy to operate the hundreds of computers in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Energy efficiency is not just about installing more efficient technology. It is, above all, a matter of behaviour patterns. Where the Member States are concerned, instead of getting bogged down with levy increases or the introduction of a CO2 levy, they should just focus on creating incentives for investments in energy efficiency, for example by reducing VAT rates on energy-saving appliances and services, or by reducing property tax for buildings which meet high energy-efficiency standards, and on granting special tax benefits for cogeneration, in particular. Such measures constitute a considerable encouragement to promote energy efficiency, and I believe that we must urge everyone to actually make this happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all agree that it is a good thing. But, rather like Saint Augustine, who prayed to God to make him good but not just yet, we tend to put off doing something about it. I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his determined effort to put this right, both in his report and the initiative that my colleague has referred to for an energy-intelligent Europe – although I confess that I would describe efficiency and conservation more as common sense than intelligence.</p>
<p class="contents">Everywhere one looks in the energy-rich world we inhabit in Europe, and the USA in particular, one can see examples of energy extravagance, even profligacy. The challenge lies in persuading members of the public of the need to change their ways. The rapporteur lists many sectors where improvements can be made: by public authorities, industry, business and individual consumers. However, I do not believe it is necessary to have an energy chapter in the Treaty, nor to impose punitive taxation in order to impose an improved efficiency. It is better to proceed with a combination of setting higher standards and offering fiscal incentives, coupled with a campaign to persuade people to change. Above all, we must change attitudes and encourage people to look at the world in a different way. That is the way forward to achieve energy efficiency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I should also like to thank the rapporteur for substantially improving and enriching the original ideas. The ideas themselves, in fact, are not new. We have been talking about them for the last ten or fifteen years. There have been reports and studies – we already know everything we really want to know. The question is how we can implement it all. How can the technology, which is already available, be combined with the money, which is also available? And here I wonder whether the European Investment Bank could play a bigger part.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem I should like to address concerns administrative matters. Let me cite one small example in the federal State from which I come. Our State has a number of universities, but let us just take one of them as an example. Some of the university buildings were to be better insulated and have better energy systems installed. It took many years before the buildings were refurbished. Why? Because the buildings belonged to the Ministry of Finance, but the Ministry of Science was their user. In other words, one ministry would have had to invest, but another would have benefited from the investment. Because each of them has its own separate accounting system, they did not sit down together. It took many years until they were able to agree – and it took an EU study to bring them together, incidentally. Absurd it may seem, but that is how things are!</p>
<p class="contents">By the way, in my home town, cars with extremely high petrol consumption are going for a song at the moment, whereas dealers are finding it difficult to sell cars with low fuel consumption. This is a third problem, a question of consumer behaviour. Consumers bear responsibility too, not only legislators. If administrators, consumers and legislators get their act together, we can achieve something, and I eagerly await the Commission’s proposals. I can assure you, Commissioner, that we shall support you in these efforts, and we shall also present initiatives of our own to that end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very important issue: we are not only speaking about the protection of the environment but safeguarding the supply of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Any Member State that wishes to steer its emissions in a cleaner direction by means of taxation must be considered jointly responsible to the Union as a whole and our common environment. We, for our part, must ensure that we do not support the distortion of competition in the name of free competition at the cost of caring for the environment. A Member State that manages its carbon dioxide emissions responsibly, for example, must not be allowed to get into a situation in which countries that produce their energy with a proportionately greater quantity of polluting fuels have a competitive edge over it. It is on this basis that harmonised environmental taxes are justified.</p>
<p class="contents">This example of mine is a clear depiction of the distortion of competition. This scenario could eventually lead to a situation where environmental considerations are not predominant when deciding energy policy. There is a danger that, with the liberalisation of the electricity market, Member States that attend to their obligations with regard to emissions may lose their electricity markets to countries that ignore their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Combined heat and power production is important for energy efficiency. The special conditions that prevail in small and remote countries are also relevant here. The special climatic features of Member States have to be taken into account at Community level. I hope that Mr Rübig’s amendment will gain support among my colleagues on this basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Green Paper put forward by the Commissioner is an important instrument for energy policy in the European Union and clarifies some of the priorities in this field. Amongst other things, it proposes decisive action in connection with energy demand. If energy efficiency can be improved by 2.5% or 1% as the Commission proposes, we shall have succeeded in adding one more grain of sand towards achieving the objectives of the energy policy, which are to respect the environment, achieve a competitive market and improve the security of our energy supply.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I have to congratulate the Commission on its proposals for encouraging renewable energies, energy efficiency, security of supply and biofuels, and the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman, on his references to future directives on building construction and cogeneration of heat and electricity, and I trust that the Council will give a much-needed boost to all these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">GDP in the European Union is growing by an average of 3%, and we citizens of Europe are enjoying increased well-being. We do not want to forgo this well-being, but we can make it more sustainable, especially in the construction and transport sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think this is the moment to reopen the debate on the CO2 emissions tax, given the differences in tax rates imposed by the Member States and their effect on inflation. In addition, it has no effect on energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither should we separate this question from other additional measures to ensure that the internal electricity market works properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it must be made quite clear that improved energy efficiency does not cut CO2 emissions but simply optimises them, since they will only come down through a reduction in the use of fossil fuels. It is important that at the same time as we debate this issue we should think about promoting other forms of energy and carrying out consistent policies in other fields. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we all know, energy efficiency is a question that has figured prominently while we have been drawing up our energy policy. As Mrs Ayuso was just saying, we have to look at it in a consistent way. Energy efficiency is one of the elements in a consistent, rational energy policy. But I have to say that it is one of the elements that can help us meet the Kyoto targets, help make this a lasting development, and also help enhance the long-term security of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">As indicated in the Green Paper on the security of supply and the Kyoto commitments, issued by the Commission in December, energy efficiency and energy savings contribute to energy policy, since every kilowatt saved is the equivalent of needing to produce one kilowatt less.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of how difficult Mr Wijkman’s report was to prepare and the effort he had to put in to present such a clear and concise document as he has presented today. I want to tell Mr Wijkman and everybody else here that in general I fully agree with what his report contains.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope of the report and the constructive opinions it contains will help us push forward and consolidate the implementation of the energy efficiency action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that for some of you it seems rather unambitious to set ourselves an objective of a 1% increase in energy efficiency to be sustained over the next ten years. You must, ladies and gentlemen, realise how much effort it will take over the next ten years to maintain this 1% increase in energy efficiency. Of the approximately 18% margin that we have calculated could be obtained in energy efficiency we should be able to achieve two thirds by 2010, that is an improvement of about 12% in energy efficiency. One per cent sustained: this is not 1% for just one year but an effort that will have to be kept up for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Mr Wijkman concludes in his report that we can continue uncoupling economic growth from energy consumption. That is, we can grow more and at the same time still contain growth in the demand for energy.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with Mr Wijkman’s demands for improving efficiency in construction. A draft directive has already been circulated in the Commission to regulate efficiency and the construction standards within the European Union that ensure energy efficiency in buildings, especially public ones.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission may present this directive soon, and I look forward to your contribution to it.</p>
<p class="contents">We also intend to put forward a framework directive on electrical equipment in buildings. Up to now there have only been industry regulations or rules for particular types of electrical appliances – Mrs McNally has also brought up these matters – and what we intend to do is make a global regulation covering all electrical appliances that go into buildings of all kinds, whether domestic, industrial or commercial.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to tell you that the proposals included in the White Paper on transport policy, which I hope to present soon, are entirely compatible with what we have been talking about here today and with what the Green Paper says. Therefore I hope to be able to count once again on your backing and support for all these initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea put forward by Mr Wijkman that the Commission and the Member States should turn major public buildings into symbolic demonstrations I think is highly appropriate, and this is something I have emphasised in the past. On the subject of the directive on the energy performance of buildings I hope to be able to make some progress in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also say that I fully agree with Mr Wijkman on the importance of the SAVE programme. In order to guarantee the future of that programme and to determine its guidelines and scope, we shall soon be beginning to draft a new decision on the execution of the programme from 2003 onwards, and Mr Wijkman’s opinions and those given in the report we are discussing will obviously be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the European Energy Programme Agency, this issue is likely to be more complicated, as you well know, but in any case the important thing is not so much which body or administrative division will carry out these activities but rather that the activities should be carried out. On that we are in complete agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by stressing that the requests and observations made in the Wijkman report, together with all your contributions, will be taken into consideration – some of them very soon, like the buildings directive, for instance – and I think they are wholly consistent with the general energy policy that the Commission is putting forward. You already have concrete evidence of this: the directive on electricity from renewable energy sources, the communications – like this one – on energy saving, the Green Paper, and soon the directive on energy efficiency in the construction industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s case, we are approving something that is not to do with energy saving but with the effectiveness of the whole system: the liberalisation of the gas and electricity sector. This is in no way at odds with the existence of additional measures encouraging us to save energy or use it better.</p>
<p class="contents">Human behaviour is essential. As some of you have said – Mr Chichester and Mr Beysen, amongst others – the key is education and making people aware of how we must be really careful in using energy, because even though we may be able to pay for it there are certain costs beyond the price of the energy itself that we must never lose sight of. We must not squander it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
