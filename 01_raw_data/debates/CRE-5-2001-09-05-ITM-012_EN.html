<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Jonathan (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, of all the issues debated this week there is none that can have a greater impact on the economic wealth of Europe than the reform of competition policy. Fair and open competition is the bedrock on which the single European market is built and on which the growth of European economies depends. That is why we must maintain our determination to root out monopolists and those who engage in shady anti-competitive price fixing or market sharing deals. These actions not only undermine the interests of commercial competitors, they rip off consumers and undermine the dynamic competitive economy on which our future economic interests rely.</p>
<p class="contents">But we must also recognise that Commissioner Monti’s weapons for tackling such abuses are sadly out of date. The Commission’s White Paper on competition policy reform highlighted the difficulties. The 40 year old procedure under Regulation 17 had become a bureaucratic paper-pushing exercise. The Commission wants radical change, devolving the application of EU competition law to national authorities in order to refocus its efforts in rooting out cartels and the abuse of market power.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament agreed with these objectives. But we strongly spelt out our concern on important issues like the need for legal certainty. We also pointed to the possible danger of the reform leading to inconsistent application or even the renationalisation of competition policy, thereby destroying the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">These were real concerns voiced by many Members of the House as well as significant sectors of the business community throughout Europe. I recognised and shared those worries and some colleagues and representatives of European business still share them today. Nevertheless I believe that Commissioner Monti has genuinely taken account of our concerns and the Commission’s proposal reflects this.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all I want to draw attention to Article 3 of the regulation, which unambiguously states that in cases affecting trade between Member States it is European competition law that takes precedence. This is a core requirement of the single market and strongly supported by all sides in our committee debates.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, the preservation of Article 3 is an essential part of this reform. We recognise that there may well be some Member States that will try to dilute its impact. We consider that Article 3 is such a central element of the reform that we will wish to be consulted again if the Council obliges the Commission to make any significant change to this article.</p>
<p class="contents">We have proposed a number of amendments in order to improve the operation of this radical reform. We found, for instance, little support outside the Bundeskartellamt for the new registration scheme under Article 4, which we consider to be time-wasting and valueless. We want it scrapped.</p>
<p class="contents">We have proposed a range of amendments to improve legal certainty for business, including the widening of Article 10 – changes which have received widespread business support. We have urged proper safeguards on Commission powers in relation to the application of structural remedies. We have suggested that penalties imposed under EU law by national authorities should be those provided for in EU law. We have also proposed changes in the transitional arrangements and in undertaking a timely review.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also wrestled with the issue of the appropriate treatment of communications from in-house legal advisers. I am deeply indebted to my colleague, Mr Rovsing, for the attention that he has given to this issue. There are different rules in operation in different parts of the European Union. We have tried to ensure that the professional status of in-house lawyers is acknowledged, whilst not impeding the Commission in the thorough investigation of possible infringements.</p>
<p class="contents">In the committee vote I indicated that this situation could possibly be resolved by a Commission declaration clarifying the treatment of such evidence in the application of Commission penalties. Mr Rovsing and I now understand that Commissioner Monti may have it in mind to make some such declaration, in which event our group will no longer consider it appropriate to retain Amendment No 10.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate has also highlighted other important but wider issues of competition policy reform. We welcome the dynamism which Commissioner Monti has brought to his brief. “Supermario”, as he has been labelled in the media, has taken the lead and not only in pressing for radical reform in Europe. He has been at the centre of moves towards the worldwide coordination of competition policy and enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are sure that in an increasingly global economy such radical reform will be necessary. But we also believe in checks and balances and we want the Commission’s actions to be fully reviewable by the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee thanks Commissioner Monti for his commitment to real and meaningful dialogue. But we reiterate our objective of Parliament moving towards full codecision in respect of these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The interest of my parliamentary colleagues in competition policy issues is not just some academic exercise for commercial lawyers. In an increasingly global world we recognise that effective competition is the essential motor for the growth of European economies and the welfare of the people we have been sent here to represent depends on fair and open competition in order to drive that growth forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not want to go into details on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. We think that Mr Evans has produced a good, well-rounded report, and congratulate him on doing so. The amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and adopted by the committee responsible are intended to enhance the rapporteur’s report. Let me give you an example. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has called for the new text to state that decisions <span class="underline">must</span> be made public, not ‘may be published’, as the old text might imply, although confidential information is obviously excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to draw attention to one point which the rapporteur has also just mentioned, and highlight it to the Commissioner and the qualified minority of expert colleagues who are still assembled here. I am referring to Amendment No 10 proposed by the committee responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Member States provide for confidentiality, i.e. legal privilege, between client and counsel. This is part of established legal reality in the majority of Member States. Whenever an individual wants to bare his soul completely, he needs a confidant; this may be a doctor, a solicitor or, in a religious situation, a priest.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 10 safeguards this traditional relationship between legal counsel and client and extends it to in-house lawyers as well. The Commissioner may assure us that disclosures from the documents held by such legal counsel will not result in stiffer sentences. However, it is not very helpful, in my view, to set an upper limit on sentencing and say: Even your legal counsel told you not to do this. Since you chose to do it anyway, your sentence will be increased. This is sensible, but I would point out that such a declaration would not be sufficient, for the disclosures to legal counsel would, of course, almost certainly constitute significant evidence of guilt. This violates professional independence and the principle of confidentiality between client and counsel. In my view, we have to decide one way or the other. “A bit pregnant” cannot exist here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the competition rules go back to 1957, that Regulation 17 dates back to 1962, and that virtually all the framework conditions have changed since then. On the one hand, we are confronted with globalisation; on the other hand, the European Union, originally a Community of six, will expand to a Community of 25 in future, and I personally think it is a good thing that the centralised system which reserved the right of application of Articles 81 and 82 exclusively to the Commission is now being restructured as a decentralised system. However, this must not lead to the renationalisation of competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, this is prevented by the fact that European law takes precedence over national law, and I anticipate that the current proposal will create fair competition and equal competition conditions. It will also ensure legal certainty for all enterprises and the uniform application of competition policy, and will simplify procedures in line with the one-stop-shop principle. It will coordinate the activities of the national – in my view, independent – competition authorities and enable the national authorities and courts to cooperate closely with the Commission. It will establish a clear division of responsibilities between the national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and cartel law, and ensure that the Commission continues to be the guardian of the treaties and thus has more time to devote to real problems, i.e. controlling mergers and cartels.</p>
<p class="contents">Many congratulations on having the courage to take these initiatives. I wish we could see more of this in other areas too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any event, I will not use it up.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Mr Evans – whom I congratulate on his report – was absolutely right when he said that this is a very important issue, although it is also true that questions relating to the reform procedure in the field of competition do not inspire interest amongst the citizens, despite their importance for the economic world.</p>
<p class="contents">However, personally, I must confess that, for me, to participate in the reform of the rules on the procedure in the field of competition gives me particular personal satisfaction. Because to participate, although in a very modest way, in the process of repealing Regulation 17 of 1962, against which I have fought a long-standing battle and on which I have written repeatedly in a very critical manner, is, I must confess, hugely gratifying.</p>
<p class="contents">But at the burial of this regulation, and may it be well buried, which I have always seen as wretched, perhaps at this time, with due respect for the dead, we should a pay slightly fairer tribute by recognising what has been good about it historically.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation 17 made some sense at the time it was approved, that is, in 1962, when the application of Community competition law was being born, which could justify a centralisation of the powers of the Commission, in a Community of seven countries with less than 200 million inhabitants. But the problem with Regulation 17 was not its creation or the rules it established at the time of its creation. The problem has been its maintenance for almost forty years, during which conditions had changed radically. Anybody who had contact with the Commission’s procedures in the field of competition was aware of the dissatisfaction caused by its application.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and fortunately – the Commission has opted to yield to the evidence and promote the derogation of this Regulation, replacing it with a more up-to-date regulation, in line with the views of the White Paper on the modernisation of the Community rules in the field of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report produced on the White Paper, this Parliament had the opportunity to express its favourable opinion, although with some fine-tuning in certain cases. This fine-tuning was perhaps related to the reticence of certain members of certain countries which had had a decisive influence on the creation of their national system and a fundamental influence on the Regulation of the procedure. Of course, I did not feel this reticence. I believe that the new approaches in the field of Community competition law not only constitute an enormous effort to modernise that Community law but also an effort in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are being presented with a legislative text which, to a large extent, responds to what had been anticipated in the White Paper. And it also, to a certain extent, takes up some of the observations made at the time by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the case that in some respects the proposed regulation has surprised us with extremes which had not been laid out in the White Paper. I am referring specifically to the provision of Article 7 on the possibility of adopting structural measures as a result of a decision on a case of prohibited conduct. This consists, no more and no less, of adopting measures such as the splitting up of companies, particularly of those which have abused their dominant position. As you know, these measures are normal in United States law. Hence the Microsoft case and the famous case of the seven sisters, the splitting up of the Rockefeller oil company, possibilities which are enormously innovative within European law.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally support this measure unreservedly; and the fine-tuning which has been introduced by means of amendments in this Parliament are simply a demonstration of a desire that this power be used prudently, as I am sure the Commission is going to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps it is the case that in other respects the Commission’s proposal is not fully in line with what was approved at the time by the European Parliament. Specifically, at the time this Parliament favoured a genuine procedural regulation which would regulate the logical principles of any judicial regulation, even if it was simply by incorporating the customs which the Directorate-General for Competition had introduced over almost forty years. In this regard, the Commission’s proposal has been more timid than in other respects, but, in any event, if the amendments contained in the Evans report are adopted, or those still maintained by this parliamentary Group, this shortcoming may be corrected.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other points on which perhaps our satisfaction is not complete. It is true that there is no single standard in the field of the guarantees of process or rights to defence. But those of us who come from a country where the same principles are applied to administrative penalty procedures, with a constitutional guarantee, as to the criminal procedure, and the same rights are granted to physical persons as to legal persons, would have liked this standard, this level of guarantees, to have been raised in accordance with the amendments approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which have not been incorporated into the text. However, at the end of the day, in my country we say that ‘the best is the enemy of the good’ and there is absolutely no doubt that this is a good regulation which we are supporting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been a great pleasure to cooperate with you. The continuation of sound competition policy is the main aim of the review being undertaken by legislation in the area of competition. In Denmark this very summer, we have seen the importance of effective competition policy. In that connection, I should like to commend and thank you, Commissioner Monti, for your active contribution regarding the great SAS/Maersk aviation issue which has enlivened our summer recess and which involved the discovery of an illegal cartel and the imposition of a large fine. Without your and the Commission’s efforts, such progress would never have been made on this issue and consumers would never have received help. I am therefore satisfied with Article 3 of the Commission’s proposal, which clearly states that it is the Community’s and not the Member States’ competition law that is applied when it comes to transnational issues of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, it is vital that there be no renationalisation of the EU’s competition policy. It is, of course, no secret that there are many of us who are concerned that the Commission’s proposal might lead to renationalisation and thus to an undermining of the internal market, something which would hit small and medium-sized companies hardest and be to the disadvantage of consumers. You must therefore promise us, Commissioner, to keep a very careful eye on the national competition authorities, and I can assure you that I shall keep an eye on <span class="italic">you</span> and make sure you live up to our expectations, something which you have, of course, done so far. I should therefore also like to strike a blow for the Commission’s competition authority being given more resources so that we do not run the risk of competition policy being watered down and taken over by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as is rumoured, the Council rejects Article 3, I would strongly urge you, Mr Monti, to withdraw your entire proposal and start afresh. Without Article 3, the proposal is unacceptable to the ELDR Group. The Council’s hesitation concerning Article 3 makes it abundantly clear how crucial it is for Parliament to be given the right of codecision making on competition policy. This is something that Parliament has demanded for many years now and, with the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, the time must now be ripe for action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome decentralisation. The present centralised method, which means that there is a backlog of cases, is inevitably somewhat arbitrary. It cannot guarantee legal certainty. However, I believe that reform will inevitably lead to an extremely interesting raising of the stakes as regards the clarification and development of the rules. And it is on that point that I differ somewhat.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 3 is clearly vital. It establishes the principle that Community law overrides national law in cases where practices are likely to affect trade between Member States. But this principle is not acceptable without some clarification. For example, in the case of services of general interest or other services that are essential for the Member States and the regions, I am convinced that there is a need for derogating provisions. At the very least, the Commission should, as proposed by the Economic and Social Committee, present an interpretative communication on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 10 is another important article. It rightly provides that the Commission can make observations to the Member States for reasons of Community public interest. Some clarification is essential here too. Jonathan Evans highlights the example of major investments. Services of general interest also need to be mentioned in this particular respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Two final remarks. The rapporteur is right to stress that it is contradictory to replace prior notification by a register. I think that we should do away with the register. He is right to call for convergence in national law. That is the heart of the problem. It supposes that other countries’ cultures are respected and that a certain balance is achieved between competition, social and environmental standards, including standards for general interest services. So take a look at the Langen report and other reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the measures we are discussing represent a serious attempt to face up to an unavoidable problem – the risk that the Commission will end up overwhelmed by notifications – and I think it was both right and courageous to choose to base this reform on decentralisation to national authorities and courts.</p>
<p class="contents">The alternative would have been to create a mammoth, over-bureaucratised structure in its directorate general, all the more so, of course, with the prospect of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, only experience will tell us if we are heading into an incomprehensible mosaic or a situation that guarantees legal certainty and, I might say, unity of law within the single European market. I believe, however, that the attempt should be sustained, just as I believe there will be a very warm welcome for the abolition of mandatory notification and authorisation and the introduction of the exception rule, which seems to me a rather more liberal principle, especially in a sector – that of regulating authorities and competition – which is always running the risk of being a different, new instrument for state interference in market dynamics.</p>
<p class="contents">This is certainly not the case of the Commission, but a number of authorities – I am thinking of certain central banks, for instance, which in fact preserve anti-trust powers over the credit market – run this risk in my opinion, and sometimes go even further.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe, however, that strengthening the sanctioning and investigative powers of the Commission, which are in fact contained in the provision, Commissioner, requires suitable procedural and legal guarantees – this point is raised in Mr Evans’s justification – especially in a situation like Europe’s, in which the Commission accumulates the functions of both the investigator, one might say, and the judge, since we are not in a system in which the judge is a third party. Of course, there are appeals, decisions can be appealed against, but I believe that in this, in the guarantees for the parties involved in the proceedings, the greatest guarantees must be assured. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Titford (EDD).</span></span>   – Mr President, yesterday I was in this House addressing the issue of the European Aviation Safety Agency when I noted that the means by which it was being achieved was through the gradual integration of the national systems. Naturally, as you would expect from me as a leader of a party that puts national sovereignty above the integrationalist tendencies of the EU, I strongly object to this process of gradual integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, under the different heading of reform of competition policy I find that I am confronted with exactly the same thing – yet another attempt by the Commission to achieve the gradual integration of national systems. But what makes this attempt particularly sinister is that it is being sold under the beguiling and wholly misleading claim that the reform is – I quote from the session’s news briefing – “to free hard-pressed Commission staff in the Competition Policy Department from routine matters to enable them to concentrate on major cases of non-competitive behaviour”.</p>
<p class="contents">Although giving Commission officials an easier life might be one effect of this proposal, the way this is being done is to give national competition authorities limited powers to enforce the competition rules hitherto the monopoly of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">But these authorities are neither independent, as it is claimed, nor free to act. They are being granted licenses to act for the Commission in accordance with Community rules, under the supervision of the Commission and responsible to it. The Commission wants the competition authorities to form a network at the centre of which is the Commission. In other words, the Commission wants civil servants in the different Member States, paid salaries by the Member States, in government buildings paid for by the Member States, using facilities provided by and paid for by Member State governments, to work not for the Member States which finance them, but for the Commission implementing Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Amazingly – and it is a reflection of how superficial is the view and understanding of so many commentators – this is seen and presented as subsidiarity and decentralisation. It is anything but decentralisation. It is the opposite, absorbing the civil servants of many countries into one vast centralised nexus. That is what the network is: everyone working for the one central authority – the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As for subsidiarity, this is not a matter of Member States being able to make their own decisions and run their own affairs at local level. This is the Commission running Member States’ affairs, using the resources and the facilities of those Member States as if they were its own.</p>
<p class="contents">That state of affairs, it seems, also applies to the courts which will hear the cases in Member States. Although they may nominally be the courts of the Member States and their running costs are paid for by the Member States, they are – as the draftsman so clearly reminded us – courts of Community law underlying the whole Community judicial system. In other words, not only are Member States’ civil servants being absorbed into the maw of the Community, but the courts are too.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is being done in the name of efficiency. It should be remembered that the most efficient form of government is the centralised dictatorship. The least efficient is the democracy. In important ways, therefore, efficiency is the enemy of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I fear that in the supposed interests of efficiency we are surrendering something much more valuable – the very democracy at the heart of all our nations – to the centralised technocracy which is the Commission. This is not so much integration as assimilation. It will all end in tears. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regulation 1017 has been applied with only little modification since the 1960s. It is therefore understandable that the continued application of this regulation in its current form is no longer consistent with effective supervision of competition. We have to serve our consumers and our companies better with up-to-date rules of application.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, in a period of 30 years of implementation, EC competition law has reached a level where decentralising is not only possible, but almost necessary. We are all aware of the workload of the DG for competition and we understand that we have to do something to reduce it, or drastically increase the resources in Brussels. At the same time, we hear our voters reminding us how we should respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and that we should avoid centralising all decision making to Brussels bureaucrats. In that question, I totally disagree with Mr Titford.</p>
<p class="contents">With the reform at hand we are able to achieve many of our objectives. Ending the current system of prior notification should benefit business and make more resources available to the Commission to concentrate on more serious infringements. Ex ante notification should not be replaced with a burdensome registration system. However, the shift to the new regime will not be an easy task. It is of the utmost importance to ensure that competition issues within the EU are treated similarly in all Member States. There are many detailed situations where legal certainty might be a danger. Personally I, and many of my colleagues from smaller Member States, are worried about the definitions of dominant position in the market. Companies from Member States – especially from the smaller Member States – should have equal possibilities to grow in the single market and to achieve a strategic position to compete with the global rivals. The Commission decision to say no to the Volvo/Scania merger was an example of the situation where the relevant market definition was maybe too narrow. The Commission should not declare that the market is national or regional if there is clear evidence that is not the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been thoroughly debated on television and radio, and it has led to debates within the population and in the Danish parliament. That is something for which I would thank the Commissioner, and I have observed that there has been support in all quarters for what the Commissioner has done. We can therefore say that competition law has been accorded an important place in the Danish consciousness. That is something for which I would thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with Amendment No 10, there have been discussions between the Commissioner and his employees and, especially, between myself and my own employees. We have observed the need for the Commission to be given access to all papers if the Commission is effectively to be able to make use of its powers and go after those cartels which do not comply with the laws. I agree that that is necessary, but company managements and boards need their experts to be able to give them proper, independent advice without those experts having to fear that, if something subsequently goes wrong because either board or management acts against their advice, this will entail an increased penalty. I have understood from Commissioner Monti and his colleagues that this is a view he shares and, as Mr Evans has said, the Group of the European People’s Party will therefore vote against Amendment No 10 if the Commissioner submits such an opinion. I would thank the Commissioner for his sound cooperation and for the fine work which he can be relied upon to carry out and which is of enormous importance, especially for small countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Mr Evans personally for his consideration for the Commission, his commitment in dealing with this issue and the high quality of his report. Next I would like to thank the European Parliament as a whole and all those who have spoken this evening for the support and encouragement Parliament has given the Commission during the debates on the White Paper and ever since. I must say our proposal for a regulation has greatly benefited from the comments, criticism and encouragement emanating from the committees and from this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The central purpose of the reform is to create a more effective system of implementation, to the benefit of consumers, businesses and the European economy in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Abolishing the current system of notification and authorisation and the exclusive power of the Commission under Article 81(3) means the Commission and the national competition authorities will be able to concentrate their efforts on combating the worst infringements.</p>
<p class="contents">The establishment of a network of authorities for the protection of competition will allow us to coordinate our efforts and use our respective resources to best effect. The essential premise for the success of such cooperation is for all the competition authorities to apply the Community rules more widely, otherwise the planned network would just be an empty framework. This is essential if we want to create uniform competitive conditions for common market businesses and prevent renationalisation of Community competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I keenly appreciate, therefore, the fact that Mr Evans fully and firmly supports the Commission’s proposal contained in Article 3, aimed at making Community competition law the only set of rules to be applied in cases where trade between Member States might be prejudiced.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal has very wide implications and is meeting with resistance on the part of various Member States within the Council’s working group. However, I remain convinced of the solid logical foundation of the proposal and I can assure you that the Commission is determined to establish uniform conditions for agreements that might prejudice trade between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would now like to touch on some of the specific issues that have emerged, starting with professional secrecy. Effective implementation of the rules on competition is closely linked to the capacity of the Commission to obtain evidence on infringements. Our powers are closely linked to documentary evidence. We base a great deal of our work on on-site inspections, looking for documents which demonstrate the existence of cartels. Any change likely to reduce the effectiveness of our inspections would therefore have grave consequences on the possibility of implementing the rules on competition and on their effectiveness. That makes me extremely worried about the amendment to extend duty of secrecy to in-house lawyers.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to avoid any misunderstanding on one point, however: the Commission is perfectly aware of the positive role that in-house lawyers can play by counselling companies about observing the rules on competition. That role will assume greater importance under the new system, where companies will have to carry out more systematic self-assessment of their agreements in particular to establish compliance with the exemption conditions laid down by Article 81(3).</p>
<p class="contents">However, the question of duty of secrecy for in-house lawyers essentially arises in the context of inspections attempting to establish the existence of serious restrictions which fail to comply with the provisions of Article 81(3). In this context, the reform proposed by the Commission does not change the current situation at all. We have to recognise that, unlike external lawyers, in-house lawyers are employees of the company and take their orders from it. They are in a position of occupational dependence and may face a conflict of interest between loyalty towards their employers and respect for ethical standards. Furthermore, internal communications between a company lawyer and his employer are so numerous and indistinguishable from purely company advice – which differs from legal advice – that duty of secrecy for in-house lawyers could create conditions ripe for concealing documentary evidence. If the communications between in-house lawyers and other employees became confidential, the Commission’s powers to apply the standards would be seriously compromised.</p>
<p class="contents">On this specific problem I have taken note of the information Mr Evans and Mr Rovsing gave just now, designed to promote a compromise solution. For my part, I can assure you that if Amendment No 10 is rejected, the Commission will cease to regard evidence contained in such documents as an aggravating circumstance in determining financial sanctions. In that eventuality, I can give an assurance to propose the following form of words to the Commission: ‘in determining what financial sanction to impose on a company in future cases, the Commission will not regard as an aggravating circumstance, under the guidelines for calculating fines imposed in implementation of Article 15(2) of Regulation 17 and Article 65(5) of the ECSC Treaty, the existence of texts demonstrating that the company’s in-house lawyers have alerted the directors to the unlawfulness of conduct covered by the Commission’s decision’.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this assurance can represent common ground between the Commission and those seeking to extend the duty of secrecy to in-house lawyers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Evans report rightly stresses the importance of legal certainty for companies. The rules and their scope must be sufficiently predictable.</p>
<p class="contents">A wider application of Community competition rules by the relevant authorities in the context of a network of close cooperation will, in itself, represent a great step forward in ensuring predictability as compared with the present situation, in which sixteen competition authorities apply different rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recognises that under certain circumstances there may be a legitimate requirement for clarification in relation to an individual case, and that the guidelines, guiding principles and existing case law do not always provide answers. However, it is essential to avoid any rules that might lead to the reintroduction of the notification system.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment proposed to Article 10 raises concerns in this respect. By way of supplement and clarification, it states that the Commission can decide that there is no violation of Articles 81 and 82, in particular whenever the agreements involve financial risk or considerable investment of capital. This amendment would only be acceptable if the Commission was not in practice compelled to decide that there was no violation in all cases involving substantial investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes the best way to ensure predictability in individual cases is to introduce a new instrument: the adoption of opinions. The Commission has already undertaken to introduce such a system, whereby it can issue reasoned written opinions in cases where there are gaps in the existing rules and decision-making procedures. The level of investment will also be one of the relevant criteria in deciding whether to issue an opinion or not. My impression is that the proposed system for formulating opinions would be favourably received by the business world.</p>
<p class="contents">On harmonisation of the procedures and sanctions, the Commission’s proposal is based on the traditional approach, which leaves the Member States able to determine the procedures and sanctions for implementing Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Evans report that it is desirable to have common procedures and sanctions but, like Rome, the Community was not built in a day. Our approach is to introduce a substantial framework first, leaving the possible introduction of common procedures and sanctions to a later stage. Once experience of operating the system has been acquired, it will be easier to identify the areas that give rise to practical problems and draw up rules to deal with them effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I want to mention, Mr President, relates to the national courts. I am persuaded that they will be fully capable of applying Community competition rules in their entirety, because they already play a fundamental role in implementing Community law. Nor should we forget that, to guarantee consistent implementation of the rules, the proposal provides, in particular, for the Commission, together with the national competition authorities, to be entitled to comment as <span class="italic">amicus curiae</span> on proceedings pending before the courts. The proposed powers will allow the Commission to protect the public interest in the effective and consistent implementation of the rules, by drawing the attention of the courts to important points relating to their interpretation and implementation. As regards the independence of the courts, of course they will not be bound by the comments of the <span class="italic">amicus curiae</span> and they will, in any case, be free to submit preliminary questions to the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of the fact that the proposed reform may mean the courts have to acquire new powers. The implementation of the competition rules can indeed be a complex matter. I therefore agree entirely with Mr Evans that the question of training judges requires careful consideration. The Commission can contribute in substance, providing material and human resources. We are also looking at the possibility of cooperating with the national authorities in this matter and providing finance from existing training programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude, Mr President, by expressing sincere and heartfelt thanks to the European Parliament for travelling a common road with us through this very complicated terrain, which is, however, as various speakers this evening have sought to highlight, of such vital interest to the economy and indeed to our individual citizens whom you represent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
