<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Miranda de Lage </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, Mr Vice‐President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the debate I am opening on the now famous global agreement with Mexico ends a five‐year cycle during which Parliament has worked actively with the European Commission to renew and strengthen relations with the Latin American countries, including Mexico.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s communication on Mexico provided the opportunity for us to draw up a first report in 1995. The conclusions reflected Parliament"s priorities and, as a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for adopting a future agreement with that country, the conditionality or human rights clause, political dialogue and parliamentary dialogue were priorities, as well as regional development, social development, assistance to women at risk and a long list of other points. Of course, in addition to the objective of liberalising trade, we also wanted the agreement to include guarantees for environmental protection and respect for the basic labour standards of the International Labour Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament"s demands have been adequately reflected in the articles. The agreement includes the trade objectives of the interim agreement, but also incorporates a social philosophy, a range of possibilities for cooperation in areas such as professional training, regional development or support for cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Recital 7 relates to the social and environmental issues. I am highlighting this because I want to express my appreciation for the constructive position of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions on this agreement. As a result, I would suggest that we look for some formula which makes it possible to incorporate recital 7 into the bilateral political dialogue, giving a clear signal that any requirements, including the basic standards of the ILO, commit the 15 Member States and Mexico equally, and not just Mexico alone.</p>
<p class="contents">A calm and impartial analysis of the text leads to the conclusion that Parliament"s influence has been considerable. But I must point out that this influence was possible thanks to the excellent attitude of the Commission, and I am grateful for its collaboration throughout this process.</p>
<p class="contents">In other respects, everything is not rosy, and I have to come down hard on the Mexican Government. It should take careful note that the Committee on External Economic Relations categorically rejects the tariff increase announced by Mexico on 1 January this year. That decision was inappropriate and arbitrary as well as being discriminatory because it does not apply <span class="italic">erga omnes</span> . I must adamantly insist that this measure be abolished as soon as possible. The decision is unfortunate because it accelerates the increasingly evident deterioration in trade flows. These have been affected for five years by the dynamism of NAFTA, and thus our share of the Mexican market has fallen from 11 % to a modest 6 % over that period. The Committee on External Economic Relations had already drawn attention to this deterioration in Mr De Vries"s report in 1990. NAFTA"s arrival has had negative consequences on our interests and I must stress that point.</p>
<p class="contents">Approval of the report we are debating will strengthen our political position and allow us to use this instrument to follow up the negotiations on political, social and economic issues, including, most particularly, the paragraph on democracy and human rights. We need to talk about those issues. The legal provisions to improve them and defend them have substantially increased in Mexico, and it is only fair to recognise that.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinions by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation stress the need to broaden and improve the conditions for development. The Committee on External Economic Relations shares this view and emphasises it in a paragraph in this report. We are offering faithful cooperation and we also support the search for a permanent solution to the Chiapas conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Mexico is a developed, dynamic country, and a member of the OECD, playing an increasingly active role in relations within North and South America and with Europe. Our association with Mexico is more than a market, and more than a facility for getting access to NAFTA. It is a political commitment of profound significance. The adoption of this recommendation will send a good signal to the Americas at a time when doubts are growing about our will to increase European efforts in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union faces a number of challenges: its peace obligations and commitments and the dilemma of enlargement. Now is the time to send a positive signal to the upcoming first summit of Heads of State and Government, that is, the 15 plus 33. The philosophy of this agreement includes important development policies. Like any compromise, it may be unsatisfactory in some areas, but nobody can deny that it opens the door to wide and meaningful possibilities for collaboration. And nobody can deny that, precisely because of its content, it has generated a considerable level of debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this may be my last speech in this Parliament, and I want to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Marín very sincerely for the hard work he has done on cooperation with Latin America. I also want to thank everyone who has cooperated in this endeavour throughout the years and – obviously – all the members of the secretariat of the Committee on External Economic Relations who have worked towards these objectives, as well as all those who have believed in the advantages of cooperation with Latin America. Finally, in view of the late hour, I would also like to thank the interpreters for their patience.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, all the parliamentary committees involved, the Committee on External Economic Relations, the Committee on Development and Cooperation and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, have clearly requested it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the main political forces and the leading political groups in Mexico have also requested it, and it has been called for and approved by all the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is not legitimate that the course of the interim agreement, to which Parliament gave its assent at the time, should be confused with and affected by the course of the global agreement</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, I feel that it is perfectly true that when defending human rights – which certainly leave much to be desired in Mexico – it is much better to defend them with an agreement which includes a clause on democracy – as this global agreement does – than with the existing agreement which does not contain such a clause.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take advantage of this debate to make two points which I consider important. First, I want to reiterate Mrs Miranda de Lage"s comment that the Mexican Government must promise to withdraw the unilateral increase in tariffs before the end of this financial year. Secondly, the European Commission must undertake to keep Parliament informed on the outcome of the trade negotiations before they are concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, for all the reasons I have mentioned, my group urges the European Parliament to give its assent as decisively and firmly as we condemned the human rights violations that had occurred in that country at a stage.</p>

<p class="contents">In actual fact, there are many reasons to start saying that Mexico does not have the proper reference point, the proper democratic credentials, and so on. But I think Mexico, democracy and the agreement with the European Union will be best served by giving our assent. Insisting on perfection often means that all we do is stand in the way of progress. And there is so much that is positive about this agreement, so in this case the best thing we can do is support it. We know that Mexico has a democratic deficit, but the best thing we can do to help Mexico establish a democratic structure is approve this agreement with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight some points within the agreement which, as I understand it, are rather original, such as the inclusion of the democracy clause as an essential element of the agreement. This will promote respect for human rights in this Latin American country and it will produce better results in this field than possibly delaying the vote, which would make political and social cooperation difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been mentioned, we also hope that the new agreement will serve to revitalise trade between both partners – the European Union and Mexico. Only 9 % of all Mexican exports to the European Union are agricultural and there is considerable complementarity in the trade flow. This should facilitate the rapid negotiation and entry into force of this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I want to reiterate what the previous speakers have said and I feel that this agreement is extremely positive for Mexico, the European Union and, as a result, the progress of democracy in the Western world.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Newens </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I wish to speak in favour of the Mexico partnership agreement and to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and thank Mr Marín for his contribution. I most certainly am not a supporter of neo‐liberal policies but the removal of trade barriers is a fact of life and the coming into force of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement has increased Mexican dependence on trade with the United States of America. The EU‐Mexico agreement is therefore urgently needed to help restore the balance and to foster political and cultural, as well as economic, links between Mexico and Europe in the interests of both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">I have long been deeply critical of human rights abuses in Mexico and have been associated with urgency motions passed by this Parliament and other manifestations of our profound concern. I believe, however, that the conclusion of this agreement will facilitate the continuing dialogue on these issues which will give the European Parliament far more leverage than if the agreement did not go ahead. I am, however, most deeply anxious that the Commission should monitor the situation and we should not hesitate to speak out. I am disturbed that there is concern in Mexico that full information has not been provided, that civil society is being excluded and that multinationals and private capital interests have carried too much sway. These are matters on which Mexican representatives have every right to raise their voices and I, for one, would hope that they would meet with a sympathetic response in Europe. However, the postponement of the decision on this accord at this point at the end of this Parliament would not, in my view, be in the long‐term interest of the Mexicans or of Europeans. Many of us have fought hard to build links and create solidarity between Europe and Latin America as a whole and the casual postponement of this accord could be very damaging.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should all vote for this agreement to go ahead because, among other things, it will help to achieve a better human rights and democratic rights record in Mexico over the course of future years.</p>

It is a pity that Mexico"s trade with the United States is increasing so much, under a trade agreement which does not actually contain a democracy clause or other clauses that are included in this one, and that its trade with Europe is decreasing.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made it clear that we do want an agreement with Mexico, we cannot ignore the many questions raised by quite a number of significant non‐governmental organisations, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International League for Human Rights and <span class="italic">Intermón</span> . In other words, many groups have expressed their concern to us and we share their concerns. First, the negotiations are not over yet. Secondly, there has been a lack of transparency, a lack of participation and a lack of information. And lastly, there is no mechanism for monitoring the environmental and social clauses or the democracy clause. There is no clear monitoring mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to end by saying that we are a pluralist group and we will perhaps be voting in different ways. I proposed abstention, active abstention, and my good friend Ludivina García Arias, who has a great affection for Mexico, asked me what active abstention meant. Mr President, active abstention means no more and no less than that we are not washing our hands of the agreement with Mexico, that we want an agreement, but we want a good one. That is why we are suggesting active abstention, and we are going to work for an agreement which, in the end, will satisfy both Mexicans and Europeans.</p>

It finally gives the European Parliament more rights with which to carry out one of the most important duties of a parliament, namely involvement in decision‐making and controlling the other institutions. It was precisely this which justified our decision a year ago to agree to just the Interim Agreement with Mexico, and to give our assent to the Global Agreement only once negotiations on all parts of the Treaty had come to a close.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not want to give the Commission <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> . Incidentally, these were the words used by our rapporteur, Mrs Miranda de Lage, to justify the decision. The Mexican Parliament also only approved the agreement on the condition that it will be consulted again once the negotiations have come to a close. It is therefore not fair to claim that the Mexicans accepted the agreement a long time ago. There has been no change in the situation since. There has been no new Commission paper on which we could make a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations will last for a long time yet, and civil society in Mexico is extremely dissatisfied with this. Various parties, such as the PRD, which has also written to us, and the Greens in the Mexican Parliament do not agree with the way the negotiations are taking place. They insist on the need for a fundamental change in direction and strongly urge us not to give our assent yet. In my view, it would therefore be completely irresponsible towards European citizens, but also towards our Mexican partners, to hand over control now.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we agreeing now to something that does not yet exist in its entirety? It makes no difference whatsoever for the Commission to be able to continue negotiations. But I am standing up for the rights of a parliament to take a vote on something which must in principle exist as a whole. How could we justify to the public the fact that we are campaigning for more rights for Parliament, although we are saying that we do not want to make any decisions, and instead want simply to give <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> ? It is precisely this which I do not understand.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say one more thing on this matter; it is after all the last round of speeches this evening. Obviously I am in favour of an agreement with Mexico, and this applies to the entire Green Group. I hold my colleague, Mrs Miranda de Lage, in high esteem and I also have the highest regard for her work. However, this problem of how a parliament makes a decision is of fundamental importance for me. It is just about this and nothing else.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement submitted today for ratification by Parliament represents an essential stage in the ambitious voyage we set out on four years ago to establish a new relationship with Mexico that would fulfill our hopes.</p>
<p class="contents">The revitalised situation in Mexico led Europe to seek a framework of strategic relationships with that country based on reciprocity and partnership and built on mutual interests. We were motivated by the importance of helping to build an international community based on democratic principles, the rule of law and full respect for human rights. We were also motivated by the importance of reaffirming, within the international debate, that it is possible to conclude bilateral trade agreements that are compatible with the World Trade Organisation. Finally, we were motivated by the importance of giving a boost to our economies, thus promoting the growth of world trade, and by the importance of consolidating our respective presence in interdependent geographical areas.</p>
<p class="contents">That is how Parliament saw it back in 1995, when Mrs Miranda"s report provided the political impetus needed to move towards more ambitious objectives. And that is how Parliament saw it in May 1998, when it gave its assent to the interim agreement. And I would like to take this opportunity – as I have mentioned Mrs Miranda – to thank her and her predecessor, Mr Newens, for their hard work, together with others who have been involved in this area and participated in the process, such as Mr Salafranca, Mrs González Álvarez and, in general, even those who have always been critical or have opted for a much more critical approach to our relations with Latin America as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Today you have before you the global agreement that establishes the legal framework for our future long‐term relationship. Like the interim agreement, this new agreement puts special emphasis on what has been one of the main demands of the European Parliament, to which the Commission and the Council have given maximum priority: the clause on respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, an essential element and foundation of this relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three main elements to the agreement. The first is to institutionalise political dialogue at the highest level. The second is to extend and deepen our cooperation, and here, for the first time, there is explicit provision for cooperation on human rights and democracy, and important areas such as social development, the fight against poverty, environmental protection and consumer protection are included. I can confirm what most of you have said: if we want to make progress on the issues I have just mentioned, political dialogue makes much better progress with an agreement than without an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, the third element, the economic element, is very important too, establishing a free trade area between the European Union and Mexico covering both goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let me tell you about the progress achieved to date in the trade negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Four rounds of negotiations have now been completed, and there have been substantial advances on the main goods and services issues, with excellent progress on investment, public contracts, competition and intellectual property. While there are still certainly some points of disagreement, that is more an indication of the high and intense level at which the negotiations have taken place than of fundamental obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the great concern expressed by Parliament about the tariff increases imposed by Mexico and we will inform the Mexican authorities of it. We hope that Mexico will respond by eliminating these increases as rapidly as it can.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust that we will be able to achieve substantial results for the Rio summit in June so that this exercise can be concluded in the second half of the year. Obviously, Parliament"s assent to the agreement will contribute significantly to providing important political impetus to allow us to conclude the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to assure you that the Commission formally undertakes to keep Parliament informed at all times – as is already the case – on the progress of these negotiations as well as the final outcome, before submitting the agreement to the whole Council. And, of course, the Commission will consult Parliament on that outcome, in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Treaty. So I cannot see that the Commission is being given a blank cheque. That is impossible, because Parliament will always have the last word when the negotiations are concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission hopes that Parliament will see fit to give its assent so that the agreement can enter into force, and we thank you again for the great support we have always received from this Parliament, not only with regard to strengthening relations with Mexico, but also with regard to establishing a real alliance between Europe and Latin America, which is gradually being forged.</p>

I also want to express our satisfaction because, in my opinion, as draftsman, the explanations and clarifications Mr Marín has given tonight entirely meet the Committee on Foreign Affairs" demand that Parliament should be informed of the development of the negotiations before their conclusion. So many thanks, Mr Vice‐President of the Commission, for the information you have given and for your response to Parliament"s proposals.</p>

<p class="contents">It has fallen to me to preside over many debates in which he has taken part, and I have always been struck by the attention he has paid to the views of Parliament and by his willingness to cooperate fully.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening has unfortunately turned into a marathon session. I have been in the Chair for more than three and a half hours. It has been a very tiring day, but we had to complete our examination of all these issues because we have no time left, even though there are very few Members remaining – which is only natural at this late hour.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, there are no reporters anywhere to observe just how much work goes on in this Parliament. They arrive at midday simply to write about scandals, but beyond that they do not pay much attention to what goes on and do not see some people at least working very late and very hard.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I bring this evening to a close, I would like to personally thank all Members of all political affiliations for their work and cooperation during this parliamentary term. You all know that it is not in my nature to solicit applause, but I very much appreciate the respect and the positive attitude I believe I have had from all Members, and I thank you all very much.</p>
