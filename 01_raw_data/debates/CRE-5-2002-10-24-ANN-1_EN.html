<p>(DA) Since the collapse of the Taliban regime and the establishment of new political institutions in Afghanistan, preparations have been under way, both in the Member States concerned and at EU level, for the repatriation of Afghans illegally resident in EU Member States. Some Member States have already adopted programmes such as this; where appropriate, in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
<p>As regards EU action in this field, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the conclusions from the Seville European Council urged the Council to adopt a repatriation programme based on the Commission Green Paper on repatriation by the end of the year. This programme shall also aim to provide ‘the best possible facilities for early return to Afghanistan’, as stated in point No 30 of the conclusions.</p>
<p>In order to implement the conclusions from Seville, the Danish Presidency has presented a draft plan specifically dealing with repatriation to Afghanistan. This draft was discussed at the meeting of the Council of ministers with responsibility for asylum and immigration last week, where it met with widespread approval. The Presidency anticipates that the plan will be adopted at the next Council meeting involving this group, which is on 28 and 29 November. Subsequently, it is anticipated that the plan can be implemented as swiftly as possible in 2003.</p>
<p>The plan envisages voluntary repatriation as its preferred model, but also presupposes that, after a reasonable period of time, expulsion can be resorted to if the persons concerned will not return of their own volition.</p>
<p>The Presidency is of course familiar with the Amnesty International report from July of this year to which the questioner refers, and its recommendations. We also agree wholeheartedly with Amnesty that returning to Afghanistan at the present time is not without problems. This is one of the reasons why the plan also contains provisions on counselling of returnees. Furthermore, the plan envisages the establishment of a coordination group under the auspices of the Commission, one of whose tasks will be to ensure the smooth implementation of the plan, taking into account such factors as reception conditions and capability in Afghanistan. Lastly, the plan also envisages the involvement of relevant organisations such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration, and of course the Afghan authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Council is currently discussing two Commission proposals that are relevant to Sweden’s salmonella guarantees.</p>
<p>The first proposal is for a Regulation on the control of salmonella and other zoonoses. Its aim is to reduce the prevalence of salmonella within the Community, particularly in primary production. It would not result in any reduction of the guarantees that Finland and Sweden currently enjoy with respect to live animals. The provision of the Commission’s proposal concerning salmonella guarantees has not given rise to controversy during the discussions within the Council.</p>
<p>The second proposal concerns the hygiene of food of animal origin. The Commission’s proposal would have preserved Finland and Sweden’s current salmonella guarantees, but would have permitted their modification through comitology. The European Parliament has endorsed the maintenance of the status quo for Finland and Sweden, but proposed that it not be possible to modify the guarantees other than through the co-decision procedure. The Council has yet to conclude its discussions on this point.</p>
<p>On the occasion of its meeting on October 15, the Council held a policy debate on food safety and zoonoses and it agreed to instruct its preparatory instances to pursue the in-depth examination of the dossier in order to report back to the Council at its forthcoming session with a view to reaching a possible political agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0671"></a>

<p>(DA) Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty stipulates that it is up to the European Parliament to lay down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the duties of its Members, after seeking an opinion from the Commission and with the approval of the Council acting unanimously.</p>
<p>As the result of the Irish referendum on 19 October 2002 was positive, the Treaty of Nice will enter into force very soon. In accordance with this Treaty, the Council shall take decisions regarding approval on the basis of a qualified majority vote instead of unanimously, except where provisions in connection with the tax scheme are concerned.</p>
<p>It is true that the European Parliament adopted a draft Statute on 3 December 1998; that is to say, before the Treaty of Amsterdam – which established the required legal basis – entered into force on 1 May 1999. It is also true that Parliament formalised the draft on 5 May 1999 and subsequently confirmed this with a vote on 27 October 1999, following the elections in the same year. Since then, however, new ideas have come to the fore in Parliament, which have been discussed, in particular, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the basis of, among other things, the conclusions reached by the High Level Group.</p>
<p>The Council would draw attention to the fact that a dialogue has been taking place the whole time between the various Presidencies and the representatives nominated by Parliament, in contact groups, for example.</p>
<p>For its part, the Council, on 4 December 2000, stated its position on some of the main elements of the Statute that Parliament had proposed, by endorsing a letter from the President of the Council, Mr Moscovici, to Mrs Fontaine.</p>
<p>With regard to the tax scheme, the Council reached unanimity on 29 October 2001.</p>
<p>Lastly, the President of the Council, Mr Piqué, sent a letter to Mr Cox on 8 May of this year, reminding him that the Council is prepared to work closely with Parliament to bring about a compromise which is acceptable to both institutions and which can be adopted well in advance of the next European Parliament elections, in 2004.</p>
<p>The Council is of the opinion that a common statute will undoubtedly contribute to conferring greater dignity on the office of Member of the European Parliament by generating greater openness in the general conditions for the exercise of this office.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0676"></a>

It is therefore up to the Commission and not to the Council to scrutinise and assess detectability and to suggest appropriate solutions.<br />With regard to genetically modified DNA or protein in products produced from genetically modified organisms, it is a well known fact that there are cases where products produced from GMOs cannot be analytically distinguished from conventional products.</p>
<p>In cases where analytical methods cannot be used to distinguish conventional products from GMO-derived products, the Council is determined to ensure a high degree of consumer protection by providing for the necessary rules in the relevant legislation. The Council and the European Parliament currently discuss a regulation concerning traceability and labelling of products consisting of or containing GMOs and traceability of food and feed products produced from GMOs and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (2001/0180/COD)). This proposal contains, as you will well be aware of, the following elements:</p>
<p>Systems and procedures to identify to whom and from whom products are made available, at all stages of placing on the market;</p>
<p>The transmission by operators of information concerning the identity of a product, i.e. that the product "is produced from GMO's" in case of GMO-derived products;</p>
<p>The retention by operators of specified information for a period of at least five years, to be made available to competent authorities upon request.</p>
<p>This envisaged so-called paper trail system has proven to be practicable and safe in similar situations, e.g. for the documentation of products from organic farming. Likewise, it is an essential advantage of the chosen procedure that consumers are offered, by the appropriate labelling as foreseen in the parallel proposal for a regulation on genetically modified food and feed, a choice regarding the production method they wish to support by their purchase.</p>
<p>In parallel to the proposal on traceability and labelling of GMOs, the Council currently discusses a proposal for a regulation on genetically modified food and feed, equally covering derived products ("produced from GMOs").</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) At the European Council in Seville it was decided to reduce the number of Council formations. And it was decided to integrate all matters related to the Union's external actions through the creation of a new General Affairs and External Relations Council covering inter alia the development cooperation policy. This conclusion was reflected by the relevant amendments to the Council's Rules of Procedure on 22 July 2002. The aim of the reform of the Council is to improve the functioning of the Council in the run-up to enlargement and to enhance the coherence between the components of the Union's external policies.</p>
<p>The Council attaches great importance to the full implementation of these new rules. In order to accomplish the above mentioned objectives of efficiency and coherence, while at the same time avoiding the risk of breaking up policy domains such as development cooperation, the Danish Presidency is proposing carefully balanced agendas for the meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council.</p>
<p>Following the recent international conferences and the World Summit on Sustainable Development in particular, development-related issues are at the forefront of the EU agenda. The Danish Presidency emphasised the importance it attaches to development issues when it included a public and broadcasted debate on the key issue of Trade and Development on the agenda of the meeting of the new General Affairs and External Relations Council on 30 September 2002.</p>
<p>For reasons of consistency and in order to facilitate the participation of the Ministers for development cooperation, the Danish Presidency is aiming to deal with a number of development related items in one session at the Council meeting on 18-19 November 2002. The development issues will inter alia include Trade and Development, Reform and Efficiency of the Community’s Development Policy and Follow-up on international conferences.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the participation of the Ministers for development cooperation, the Presidency will try -insofar as possible- to place the development-related issues together on the agenda of one of the days of the Council meeting. This is done without prejudicing the organisational proceedings to be decided upon by the future Presidencies.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that the Seville conclusions do not contradict the rule established by the Treaty (article 203) which stipulates that Member States are competent to define the person who will represent them within the Council, being assumed that this person should be entitled to engage the Member State Government.</p>
<p>Discussions on the practical implementation and the long-term implications of the Conclusions from the European Council in Seville are still ongoing. The Council is ready to review and if necessary adjust the organisation of the proceedings of the Council on a continuous basis in order to ensure that all aspects of EU’s external relations incl. development cooperation is dealt with in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, the Council confirms that development remains a priority for the Council's agenda and that the organisational proceedings decided by the European Council do not detract from its importance. On the contrary, they are intended to enhance the development dimension of EU related policies and to meet the overarching objective of promoting comprehensive EU external action.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0684"></a>

In their contacts with the Mexican authorities, the EU and Member States' representatives have frequently raised questions concerning human rights protection and expressed their concerns on different aspects of this issue.</p>
<p>It is recalled that at the latest EU-Mexico political dialogue meeting at senior officials' level, which took place in Puebla (Mexico) on 3 October 2002, the human rights situation in Mexico was thoroughly examined. At that occasion, the EU representatives expressed their concerns on some specific cases of violations of human rights in Mexico. Particular reference was made to the harassment, death threats and assaults directed against persons and organisations working in the defence of human rights in Mexico, which - we understand - covers situations like the one mentioned by the Honourable MEP. On the same occasion, the EU recalled its availability to further co-operate with the Mexican authorities on this matter. At the EU-Mexico Joint Committee, which took place on the same day, both parties agreed to strengthen their co-operation in the specific area of human rights and democracy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0685"></a>

<p>In order to import goods into an EU country, an import authorisation is required. On 1 November, EU bureaucracy will further increase with the introduction of a requirement for a ‘certificate of inspection’. Such a certificate must accompany every consignment of organic products imported from countries outside the EU.</p>
<p>Organic foodstuffs afford poor countries an opportunity to break into the world market. However, the complicated paperwork involved will create a less advantageous situation for growers. This will hamper and perhaps even prevent exports of organic food to the EU.</p>
<p>At the UN Environment Conference in Johannesburg, participants agreed that exports from the Third World should increase. Organic products were particularly singled out in this context.</p>

<p>(EN) The Council is fully aware that organic foodstuffs provide an opportunity for poor countries to break into the world market. This is why, at the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, the EU backed the text in the Plan of Implementation on supporting voluntary WTO compatible market-based initiatives for the creation and expansion of domestic and international markets for environmentally friendly goods and services, including organic products.</p>
<p>The Council, in many of the decisions it takes, has to balance competing constraints and ensure coherence of its policies. This is at the heart of the public debate it held on trade and development on 30 September. The issue raised falls within this context: balancing the protection of consumers and the requirements of food safety with the opportunity that the EU market provides to developing countries.</p>
<p>Helping developing countries to meet EU requirements, such as for organic food and sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures, is part of the measures the Commission has put forward in its proposed action plan set out in its Communication on trade and development as compliance with such standards has emerged as one of the major constraints on the increase of exports by developing countries to industrialised markets. The Council is currently examining this Communication and will take a position on trade and development in the conclusions it plans to adopt on this subject at its session on 18-19 November.</p>
<p>The Council would reiterate that the inspection certificate mentioned by the honourable Member is part of the legislative provisions introduced by the Commission in accordance with Council Regulation No 2092/91 on organic farming. Its aim is to safeguard the equivalence of production standards for organic products available to the European consumer, regardless of their origin.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0687"></a>

<p>(EN) In its resolution of 21 May 2002 on the future of European tourism<a href="#defann_11_1" name="refann_11_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Council invites the Commission, the Member States and the other stakeholders in the tourism sector 'to make best possible use of the information and communication technologies for the implementation' of the initiatives referred to in the resolution.</p>
<p>This invitation is a direct continuation of several other texts, viz. :</p>
<p>- firstly, the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Lisbon on 23-24 March 2000. The summit set the European Union the goal of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion;</p>
<p>- secondly, the European Charter for Small Enterprises, the adoption of which in the Council on 13 June 2000 was welcomed by the European Council meeting in Santa Maria da Feira on 19-20 June 2000. Even though this Charter is primarily horizontal in nature as it is designed in general to take account of the special needs of small businesses, it naturally also applies to the tourism sector as such;</p>
<p>- and thirdly, the Council's decision of 20 December 2000 on a multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship, and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (2001-2005)<a href="#defann_11_2" name="refann_11_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The aim of this programme is to foster measures which 'develop the use of new information and communications technologies' and 'encourage innovative practices'.</p>
<p>The Council is therefore in agreement with the Honourable Member that the development of e-tourism cannot be seen as anything other than positive and fully in keeping with the invitation to the European tourist industry and the other stakeholders in the tourism sector contained in the above mentioned resolution of 21 May 2002 ' to participate actively in and support the efforts undertaken by the European Community and the Member States to improve the accessibility, the competitiveness and the quality of European tourism'.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council would also point out that any fresh initiative at Community level in this area first requires the Commission to submit a proposal to the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In relation to upholding human rights, there are many areas which are of great concern to the EU, and which will continue to be so in 2003. Amongst these are the following:</p>
<p>Securing the abolition of the death penalty: In countries that retain the death penalty, the EU aims at the progressive restriction of its scope and urges respect for the minimum standards set out in international human rights instruments and other documents, notably the “EU Guidelines towards third countries on the death penalty”, adopted by the European Council in June 1998.</p>
<p>As regards action for 2003, the EU is conscious that initiatives to raise the issue of death penalty in its political and economic dialogue with third countries should be intensified and that attention should be focused on the reasons put forward by countries for maintaining capital punishment, including those relating to ethnicity and religion.</p>
<p>Equally, the eradication of torture wherever it occurs is a priority concern of the European Union. The "EU Guidelines on Torture" adopted on April 9th 2001 offer a basis for EU intervention either in bilateral contacts with third countries (political dialogue, demarches and actions on individual cases), or in multilateral fora on human rights. They also underline the EU's support for relevant international and regional mechanisms. The EU intends to make use of all the tools at its disposal in furtherance of these guidelines in 2003.</p>
<p>Inclusion of human rights issues in dialogues with third countries: The EU seeks to ensure that the issue of human rights, democracy and the rule of law will be included in meetings and discussions with third countries and at all levels.</p>
<p>Human rights and terrorism: This issue will no doubt continue to be high on the agenda in 2003. The EU has already stated (at the Extraordinary European Council, held on the 21 September 2001) that in stepping up its actions against terrorism, it will ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and pointed out (at the Laeken, Barcelona and Seville European Councils) that respect for human rights and the rule of law is a central aspect for all effective strategies to eradicate terrorism. In combating terrorism States must adhere to international human rights norms and to their obligations under international human rights and refugee law.</p>
<p>Fighting poverty in the developing countries is one of the main targets of the EC development cooperation policy, which should be complementary to the policies pursued by the Member States. In this context, it should be recalled that the EC is the world's largest contributor in the field of development cooperation and that it plays a major role in eradicating poverty through the commitments and objectives set in the context of the United Nations and other international organisations.</p>
<p>In its conclusions on the assessment, priorities and follow-up of the WSSD of 30 September 2002, the Council reiterated the commitment of the EU to ensure coherence between its internal and external policies, including its development assistance programmes, in order to achieve the goal of eradicating poverty and agreed to promote food security and rural development in the spirit of the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later in Rome.</p>
<p>In practical terms, all initiatives in the field of development cooperation, and especially those that constitute the follow-up to the Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg International Conferences, should have a positive impact on the reduction of poverty in global terms.</p>
<p>The Council is currently working on a series of items that might require a conclusion and/or a follow-up under the forthcoming Greek and Italian Presidencies. These are:</p>
<p>Trade and development,</p>
<p>Regulations on poverty diseases and reproductive health,</p>
<p>Regulation on aid to Asia and Latin America,</p>
<p>Fighting rural poverty</p>
<p>Among the future items on the agenda of 2003 that might be tackled by the Greek and Italian Presidencies -provided that the Commission delivers on time the relevant proposals or communications-, the following should have a positive impact on reducing poverty:</p>
<p>EC support to develop the business sector in developing countries,</p>
<p>Forest development cooperation,</p>
<p>Privatisation of state-owned companies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0699"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council would draw the Honourable Member's attention to the fact that it was the Commission, in cooperation with the Netherlands' Ministry of Finance, which organised the seminar to which he refers, in the spring of 2001 in Noordwijk. It is therefore for those organisers to arrange for the publication and follow-up of the results of the seminar. The Commission has apparently recently published the outcome of the talks as well as a guide entitled 'Helping businesses overcome financial difficulties'. The Council would ask the Honourable Member to contact the Commission directly for further information in this regard.</p>
<p>With regard to the subject as such, the Council would recall that it adopted the European Charter on Small Enterprises at the meeting of 13 June 2000 and that this was welcomed by the European Council meeting in Santa Maria da Feira on 19-20 June 2000. The Charter is also reproduced as Annex III to the Presidency conclusions. On that occasion, the European Council stressed the great importance of small and medium-sized businesses for growth, competitiveness and employment in the EU and requested full implementation of the Charter as part of the comprehensive framework for enterprise policy. In the principles of the Charter, it is stated that some failure is concomitant with responsible initiative and risk-taking and must be mainly envisaged as a learning opportunity. The Charter also contains some 'lines for action' which although laying emphasis on the training of entrepreneurs and relevant qualifications, also stress the need for an assessment of Member States' bankruptcy laws in the light of good practice so that learning from benchmarking exercises can lead to the improvement of current practices in the EU.</p>
<p>This approach was confirmed at the European Council meeting in Barcelona on 15-16 March 2002. The aim was to create a more favourable climate for entrepreneurship and competitiveness by using the regulatory framework to encourage entrepreneurial activity. As regards social and labour market policy, the European Council also urged both sides of industry to find ways of managing corporate restructuring better through dialogue and a preventive approach.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission and an ad hoc group of experts consisting of Member States' representatives is currently undertaking a benchmarking comparison between the Member States' bankruptcy laws and the stigma associated with failure, which is part of a BEST project entitled 'Restructuring of bankruptcy and a fresh start'. The final report is expected to be available during the first half of 2003. Bankruptcy and attitude to risk and failure are also expected to be taken up by the Commission in its forthcoming green paper on entrepreneurship.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0703"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council is well aware of the major problems and challenges posed by the rapid ageing of the European population, and entirely shares the concerns raised by the Honourable Member of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Until now, the Council has not regarded it as necessary that Community competence in this area should be increased, conscious also of the fact that the question of competences is being considered in a comprehensive manner by the European Convention. Nevertheless, the ageing of the population has from the outset been a major consideration in the activities undertaken with a view to the improvement and modernisation of social protection in the framework of the open method of coordination, as initiated by the Lisbon European Council in 2000.</p>
<p>The question of the sustainability and viability of the pension systems has been a particular priority area. The Council and the Commission submitted a joint report on objectives and working methods in this area to the Laeken European Council in December 2001. A second joint report assessing national pensions strategies and identifying good practices is being prepared for the 2003 Spring European Council.</p>
<p>These activities are mainly prepared and coordinated by the Social Protection Committee. In addition, the Economic Policy Committee has set up a separate Working Group on Ageing.</p>
<p>The Council also notes that the Member States participated actively and in a coordinated manner in the Second World Assembly on Ageing in Madrid on 8 - 12 April 2002, organised by the United Nations. Likewise, they will take part in the regional follow-up activities on the European level organised by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, thus covering the whole European region. This process has already started with the holding of the UNECE Ministerial Conference on Ageing in Berlin on 11 - 13 September 2002, which adopted a Regional Implementation Strategy, and a Ministerial Declaration "A Society for all Ages in the UNECE Region". In its official statement on this occasion on behalf of the European Union, the Presidency underlined inter alia the importance of mainstreaming ageing in all policy fields, and of participation and non-discrimination as well as the health and well-being of the elderly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0711"></a>

Despite these alarming statistics, which are apparently being neglected for the purposes of policy formulation, at its last meeting in Luxembourg, the Council of Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs has been proposing a further reduction in wages and salaries, accompanied by more flexible manning policies, proposals which, far from alleviating the problem are likely to have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>What view does the Council take of this and what measures will it formulate with a view to alleviating poverty in the European Union, which is regarded as one of the three major world economic powers, bearing in mind that far from becoming less widespread, flexible manning policies are actually on the increase, threatening finally to push those affected to the brink of mendicity?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Council of Ministers of economic and financial affairs is aware of the statistics referred to in the question. The Council has adopted a long term strategy in Lisbon in 2000 to achieve, among others, full employment and to increase the rate of employment. Employment is probably the main factor for improving social integration and poverty reduction. In view of this long term strategy the ECOFIN Council examined in Luxemburg, earlier this month, a report on the European Employment Strategy. The Council endorsed the priorities identified in the report such as the need to improve the functioning of the labour market, job creation and the quality of jobs. The ECOFIN Council did not propose a reduction of wages and salaries. Moreover, the Council has no competence for setting wages.</p>
<p>In fact, the Council is devoting considerable effort to the fight against poverty and social exclusion, bearing in mind the absence of any explicit Community competence. The activities are already being pursued in the framework of the open method of coordination, and the preparatory work mainly takes place within the Social Protection Committee. In December 2001, a first joint Council and Commission Report on Social Inclusion, based on the National Action Plans of the Member States, was submitted to the Laeken European Council. A second similar Report is scheduled for the Rome European Council in December 2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0713"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU remains very concerned about the lack of progress in the human rights situation in Iran. In particular, the EU's longstanding and firm position against the use of the death penalty and particularly cruel forms of execution such as stoning is well known to the Iranian Government.</p>
<p>An EU exploratory experts' mission in Troika format visited Teheran on 30 September and 1 October 2002 for talks on the possibility of establishing a formal human rights dialogue with Iran. The aim of such a dialogue would be to voice concerns, obtain information, and help bring about concrete improvements in the human rights situation in the country. In the margins of meetings with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the EU expert delegation raised the question of executions in Teheran with the head of the Iranian delegation, who confirmed that a number of executions had taken place and that they had been public. The EU delegation took that opportunity to reiterate to the Iranian MFA the European Union's condemnation of the death penalty in general, and of public executions in particular.</p>
<p>The fact that the EU lost the vote on its draft resolution on the human rights situation in Iran at the UN Commission on Human Rights (CHR) in spring this year did have the effect that the mandate of the UN Special Representative for that country came to an end. However, it should be noted that the Iranian Government had in any event never extended an invitation to the UN Special Representative to visit (this was one of the matters on which the EU had intended to express concern through its draft resolution).</p>
<p>As regards the "absence of any EU resolution" at the Third Committee of the 57<span class="sup">th</span> UN General Assembly, where the discussion on human rights issues will not get fully underway until November, that statement is in fact premature. The EU is still in the process of deciding whether or not to table a resolution on the human rights situation in Iran in the Third Committee. A draft resolution has already been prepared and was discussed at a joint meeting on 9 October 2002 of the Working Groups on Human Rights and on the Middle East/Gulf region.</p>
<p>On 21 October 2002, the Council reaffirmed its position of principle whereby the establishment of a dialogue is without prejudice to the tabling of a resolution at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights or at the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. It agreed that at the 57th UN General Assembly, the EU will convey its deep concern at the serious violations of human rights in Iran and the lack of progress in a number of areas.</p>
<p>As regards trying to prevent, in so far as possible, the imposition and carrying out of death sentences in Iran, it should be remembered that a resolution in a UN forum is only one of the tools available to the EU in its endeavour to bring about an improvement in the human rights situation in any given country. Another tool is that of a démarche directly to the government concerned. The EU has already carried out a number of démarches to the Iranian government this year. Furthermore, human rights issues are discussed twice a year during the so-called Comprehensive Political Dialogue between the EU and Iran among a number of other political issues. Yet another possibility is that of a human rights dialogue established in accordance with the EU's guidelines.</p>
<p>As already mentioned on a previous answer, I can inform the Honourable Parliamentarian that the EU discussed an initiative to establish a formal human rights dialogue with Iran on the basis of the guidelines on human rights dialogues with third countries, which were approved by the Council in December last. Exploratory meetings between European and Iranian human rights experts took place in Teheran at the beginning of this month. May I also add that human rights is one among 4 issues of concern on which the Council said it wanted to see progress, as the EU and Iran develop closer commercial links. On 21 October 2002 the Council stressed the importance it attaches to the opportunity presented by a human rights dialogue to bring about concrete improvements in the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran. It therefore agreed to enter into such a dialogue on the basis of the modalities, timing, interlocutors, subjects and benchmarks discussed during the EU exploratory mission to Iran. It also agreed that the first meeting under the dialogue would take place in Teheran before the end of 2002.</p>

<p>(EN) The financial statement of the Communication on Consumer Strategy provides for a budget of € 20 million spread over 2002-2003 for actions planned under objective 3 of the strategy, which aims at achieving a « Proper involvement of consumer organisations in EU policies ». This amount is dedicated to several Consumer Policy actions which are of benefit to consumer organisations including the direct support to European consumer organisations. In 2002, these Consumer Policy actions notably include grants to specific projects, the development of a training programme for consumer professionals, the creation of a new website for consumer affairs, the annual Young Consumer Competition, as well as support for consumer information centres.

The Commission is now finalising its evaluation report covering the past three years of activities under this general framework. It should be adopted in November by the Commission and transmitted to the Parliament and Council. Taking this report into account, the Commission is preparing a proposal for a new financial instrument for the years ahead, which should be presented at the end of 2002.</p>
<p>The Commission provides financial support for the activities of European consumer organisations, of which national consumer organisations are members. Article 5 of Decision 283/1999 provides that financial support may be granted to European consumer organisations which:</p>
<p>“Are non-governmental, non-profit-making organisations whose main objectives are to promote and protect the interests and health of consumers, and</p>
<p>Have been mandated to represent the interests of consumers at European level by national organisations of at least the half the Member States of the Community that are representative, in accordance with national rules or practice, of consumers and are active at national or regional level.”</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of public concern in Greece over recent price rises. Recently, Greek consumer organisations organised a "consumption strike" to voice their dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>While it must remain the responsibility of the Greek authorities to monitor the development of the market in Greece, especially with regard to ensuring competition, the Community does have a role to play in the supply of public services.</p>
<p>In relation to these ‘services of general interest’, it is Community policy to promote high quality services to which European citizens and consumers can have access at an affordable price. The three aspects of quality, access and affordability define the concept of Universal service for which legal provisions exist in telecommunications, in postal services and are proposed for electricity. The Member States are responsible for monitoring the implementation of these universal service provisions.</p>
<p>Last December, the Commission published a first horizontal assessment of the market performance of network industries supplying services of general interest. The report showed that telecommunications and electricity supply were more affordable in Greece, at least in 2001, compared to 1996, for low-income consumers as well as for average income consumers.</p>
<p>In relation to the transposition by Greece of Directive 98/27 on injunctions for the protection of consumers’ interests and Directive 1999/44 on certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees, the Commission can confirm that it has begun the infringement proceedings.

<p>(FR) The Commission was fully aware at the time of the initiative of the United States’ authorities (and not of European port authorities, as the honourable Member suggests) to send American customs officers to certain Union ports.</p>
<p>This American initiative is part of a more global approach to the security of maritime transport on a world level, which only concerns the Member States mentioned. To this end, it favours the use of customs procedures applicable to exports in order that they may be subject to appropriate controls. The Community’s response must therefore satisfy two essential criteria: it must be global so that it can be integrated into a worldwide approach and it must satisfy the requirements of our internal market in particular by guaranteeing equal treatment for all our exporters.</p>
<p>The selection of only certain ports also runs counter to the Union’s objective of better geographical distribution of transport flows in order to relieve a transport network which is already saturated. The Commission still believes that such an uncoordinated approach and failing to organise a global approach to the problem is not the best response to the issue of security.</p>
<p>While proposing close coordination with the United States authorities in question in order ultimately to reach mutual recognition agreements for the implementation of genuine security rules, in a few months the Commission will present a proposal on the implementation and control of all the appropriate security measures in all the Union’s international commercial ports, based on the approved rules of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).</p>
<p>Recent talks between the Commission and the American authorities have been encouraging and we therefore hope that, in the medium term, we will be able to give better guarantees of security on both sides of the Atlantic.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0607"></a>

<p>The agreement is consistent with the fisheries development strategy formulated and implemented by the partner country, and financial compensation is paid and used in accordance with sound budgetary management practice;</p>

The fisheries sector has been selected as a priority in the Regional Indicative Programme for the "Pacific Region" and for the "Region of Eastern and Southern Africa and the Indian Ocean". The West Africa Regional Programme takes also into account fisheries within the first area of concentration devoted to economic integration (assistance for the formulation and implementation of regional fisheries policies) and within the “non-concentration area” (possibility to finance systems for surveillance and control of fishing activities). The Central Africa Regional Programme reserves financial means in order to assess possible interventions in the fisheries sector. It must be noted that National Indicative Programmes contain other priorities which can support the fisheries sector; priority for infrastructure allows interventions for harbours equipment, priority for good governance allows interventions aiming at strengthening developing countries capacities to better define and implement fisheries sector policies. Last but not least the European Development Policy is involved in an important "all-African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP) Fish Sanitary control programme”; The overall objective of this intervention is the optimal use of ACP states' fishery resources. The specific purpose of this programme is to improve the access of ACP fisheries products to the world market, by strengthening the capacity for sustainable export health controls and improving production conditions.</p>
<p>These interventions must contribute to an equitable distribution of the added value created by a sustainable use of fishery resources. They show that fisheries can have an important role in term of poverty reduction which is the main objective of our European Development Policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0609"></a>

<p>Does the Commission not believe that the Spanish Government has overstepped the mark in sending a substantial military force to occupy this tiny island, which Morocco considered to be an act of war, and that the best thing for the European Union to do would be to advocate that the International Court of Justice in the Hague should settle the issue of the sovereignty of Perejil?

<p>(EN) The Commission can assure the Honourable Member that it is extremely concerned that all corporate restructuring be undertaken having full regard to its social consequences. This is why, in January 2002, it launched a first stage consultation of the social partners on the social aspects of corporate restructuring. The intention would be to establish, at European level, a set of principles to be followed in restructuring situations.</p>
<p>Two of the issues highlighted in the consultation document would appear to be relevant to the circumstances described by the Honourable Member: The need to fully involve employees in the restructuring process through proper information and consultation procedures and the need to have regard to the local consequences of any restructuring proposals. The Commission has already moved to introduce Union-wide legislative provisions on information and consultation of employees through its proposal for a directive on the issue. The directive as agreed by Parliament and the Council was finally adopted in March 2002<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>However, even in advance of the coming into force of this directive, there are existing Community provisions which apply. Under the terms of Council Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies<a href="#defann_26_2" name="refann_26_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> (which consolidates two earlier directives on the issue), an employer contemplating collective redundancies is obliged to begin consultations with the workers' representatives in good time. Such consultations should cover ways of avoiding or reducing the number of workers affected and mitigating the consequences. Any alleged breach of the national legislation implementing the collective redundancies directive would, however, have to be pursued at national level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is actively addressing the growth in counterfeit activity which threatens employment in the Community and the safety of the citizen.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member refers to the increased seizures made under the Community customs regulations, and in particular Council Regulation (EC) No. 3295/94, these figures reflect both increased production capacity but also substantially improved enforcement by customs. This increase results from better targeted customs controls, based on information exchanged between Member States and better co-operation with rightholders. Operational seminars, funded under the Community Customs 2002 programme, have played an important role in bringing customs experts from the Community and candidate countries together with rightholders. Such seminars have resulted in improved working methods with specific emphasis being placed on products dangerous to the consumer.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue with these practical actions to help enforcement agencies increase their expertise in this sensitive area. To help combat the problem of counterfeiting and piracy at the Community level, the Commission is also examining the possibility of making a proposal for a directive which would harmonise Member States’ legislation on the means of enforcing intellectual and industrial property rights and establishing a general framework for the exchange of information and administrative co-operation among national authorities and between them and the Commission.</p>
<p>As far as the Candidate Countries are concerned, the Commission is convinced that the efforts made by them, with Community support, to implement the stringent standards of intellectual property (IP) protection in place in the Community will lead to a significant improvement in their enforcement actions.</p>
<p>In the case of other third countries, which are World Trade Organization (WTO) members, the Commission pursues a very close monitoring of their commitments to create or amend their legal framework in order to comply with the minimum standards imposed by the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPs). In the Community's bilateral free-trade and association agreements with third countries there is a substantial chapter that typically requires from our Partners that they adopt and implement the highest international standards of IP protection. These provisions usually also involve commitments to provide technical assistance to help them improve their Intellectual Property Reports (IPR) enforcement.</p>
<p>The Commission is also willing to work with countries individually or via multilateral contacts, notably in the WTO and World Intellectual Property rights organisation (WIPO), to further strengthen the enforcement of IP rights.</p>
<p>The Commission is also organising a meeting of the Forum on the Prevention of Organised Crime with relevant public and private sector stakeholders, scheduled for December 2002. One aim would be to have increased protection for the citizen and business, as well as helping candidate countries to introduce adequate levels of control.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0617"></a>

<p>(EN) The specific agricultural measures taken by the Commission in August and September in response to the unprecedented flooding which has occurred especially in central Europe, include the following:</p>
<p>A derogation for the flood-affected regions of Germany and Austria as well as parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom allowing land set-aside under the arable crops scheme to be used for animal grazing as from 9 August 2002, provided that at least 33% of the forage area of the holding has been flooded;</p>
<p>The payment before 16 October 2002 of a 50% advance on the direct payments for arable aid in the affected regions of Germany;</p>
<p>The sale to Austrian livestock producers of 30 600 tonnes of intervention stocks of cereals at 50 €/tonne or about half the normal price;</p>
<p>The announcement by the Commission that it is ready to adopt a flexible approach where the Member States concerned seek to adapt their rural development programmes in order to deal with the consequences of the floods;</p>
<p>For candidate countries affected by the floods, such as the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the presentation of a proposal to amend the Sapard Regulation in order to increase the aid intensity from 50% to 75% for beneficiaries in areas affected by exceptional natural disasters and to increase the Community contribution from 75% to 85% of total public expenditure in these areas.</p>
<p>As far as this year’s budget is concerned, the decision on advance payments of arable aid in Germany has the effect of bringing forward from 2003 to 2002 an expenditure of about EUR 560 million whilst the decision on reduced price sales of cereals in Austria involves a cost of nearly EUR 2 million.</p>
<p>Given that a decision was also taken in August to authorise advance payments in 2002 of arable aid in Southern Italy for an amount of about EUR 330 million, the measures taken in relation to the exceptional weather conditions of this summer involve a total cost of nearly EUR 900 million and have the effect of sharply reducing the size of the underspend of agricultural appropriations on the 2002 budget.</p>
<p>More recently, the Commission has taken further action which will help to alleviate the cash-flow difficulties of livestock producers affected by the floods, notably by authorising Member States to pay an advance on the beef premiums of 80% instead of 60%, as from 16 October 2002. However, given that the financing period of the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) Guarantee for 2002 ended on 15 October, these advances will remain booked to the 2003 financial year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0620"></a>

Moreover, through the initial review stage, EMAS will look into other areas of activities where significant environmental impact can be ascertained. The findings stemming from the initial review will set the baseline from which performance improvement can subsequently be measured.</p>
<p>EMAS in the Commission started in September 2002. Over the next few months EMAS will undertake actions related to the internal awareness raising strategy and the initial review of the environmental impacts. If this pilot phase proves to be successful, the Commission may decide to seek EMAS registration for all of its services.</p>
<p>Independent accredited verifiers will systematically audit the performance of EMAS in the Commission. An environmental statement will be released to provide relevant environmental information to the public and other interested parties. The expected results will benefit the overall environmental performance of the Commission and set a good example to others in the Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Authorisation procedure provided for in the White Paper on Chemicals Policy aims at controlling substances of very high concern. These are substances which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or substances toxic to reproduction (CMR substances categories 1 and 2), and substances with the characteristics of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The White Paper also provides that criteria for the identification of persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic substances (PBTs), and very persistent and very bio-accumulative substances (VPVBs) should be developed, before deciding on how to treat such substances. The criteria have reached a mature state of development, and their inclusion under the Authorisation procedure is currently under consideration. Also the possible inclusion of endocrine disrupters and respiratory sensitisers is subject to debate.</p>
<p>It is important to make the Authorisation procedure a workable system that delivers. The Commission is therefore exploring every avenue to keep it as practical as possible, while maintaining the goal of a high level of protection from the substances of very high concern.</p>
<p>The Commission has considered a range of substance and product related provisions in Community legislation and their possible link to the future chemicals legislation. However, since the future legislation is still under development, it is not possible to provide a detailed view on the provisions that may require amendment.</p>
<p>Safety data sheets will continue to provide important information on chemical substances also under the new system. However, this information would not be sufficient for Registration, because Registration will also require a risk assessment. The Commission has taken note of the exposure category system proposed in a project set up by the German Chemical Industry Association under the guidance of Öko-Institut Freiburg and is considering it in its drafting of the future chemicals legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0622"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of reports that on the night of 3<span class="sup">rd</span> September a number of masked men in camouflage forced their way into the home of Doctor Ali Khanbiev in the village of Benoy in Chechnya and took him away with them. The Russian non-governmental organisation “Memorial”, which has solid credentials regarding violations of Human Rights in Chechnya, has requested further information on the case from the Chechnya’s prosecutor’s office. So far no information has been provided.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the concern regarding the situation of Mr. Khanbiev as well as regarding the wider issue of the unusually high number of missing people in Chechnya, which has raised concern among Human Rights activists and the media community in Russia, as well as internationally.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the EU-Russia political dialogue, the EU regularly raises its concerns regarding reports of widespread violations of Human Rights in Chechnya. The EU has specifically raised the problem of missing people in Chechnya in the past. The Commission agrees that the Union should continue to raise these and other related issues with Russian authorities as appropriate.</p>
<p>The second paragraph of the Joint Statement of the last EU-Russia Summit in Moscow (29 May 2002), states that it is a common goal to strengthen a society based on respect for democratic principles and human rights. In this regard, the Commission will continue to press the message that the effective partnership that the EU and Russia are trying to establish will necessarily have to be based on a series of fundamental core values, including full respect for Human Rights. In parallel, these issues will continue to be a priority for our actions in Russia in the framework of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0636"></a>

<p>The Commission supports the efforts of the United Kingdom to strengthen regulatory control in the way described in these documents. The proposed decision lowers the discharge limits for the majority of radionuclides concerned, while preserving them as they are for the rest.

<p>As regards the Sellafield facility, the proposed new limits will not reduce the amount of radioactivity released to the Irish Sea in the short term.

<p>(EN) The Commission is satisfied by the 30 August decision of the World Trade Organization (WTO) arbitrators which authorises the Union to impose sanctions at the level of US $ 4 billion on United States (US) products. This decision fully vindicates Union’s approach. The arbitrators have given us an amount of potential countermeasures which will create a major incentive for the United States to eliminate this huge illegal export subsidy.</p>
<p>On Sanctions</p>
<p>Concerning sanctions, on 13 September the Commission published a Notice in the Official Journal containing a list of products proposed to be covered by any retaliatory measures with a view to consult Union industry on the effect of these measures. In line with WTO practice (also followed by the US) the list is set at a higher level than the amount set by the arbitrator (US $ 4 billion) in order to allow for exclusion of products following a 60-day consultation procedure.</p>
<p>Obviously, the aim of the consultation is to minimise the negative consequences that any eventual sanctions could create to Union industry but also to transatlantic trade; in that respect, the Commission has included in the list products on which the US import share is low. After consultation of Union industry and of Member States the Commission intends to present the final list to the WTO and launch the internal legislative procedure.</p>
<p>On US compliance</p>
<p>The US Administration has made clear its intention to comply (eg see President Bush statement during the last EU-US Summit, US Trade Representative and Treasury statements during the recent Senate Finance Committee hearing). However, we are still waiting for details on the compliance programme.</p>
<p>The Commission is getting encouraging signs that this time the Congress (notably Chairman Thomas) are making serious efforts to present a draft Bill to comply with the WTO rulings. Furthermore, a bipartisan and bicameral hearing (with the participation of the US administration) is expected to take place on this issue. The Commission, therefore, very much expects to see serious progress on compliance within the current session of Congress.</p>
<p>Decisions on sanctions will be made depending on US progress towards compliance. The Commission will carefully evaluate progress made in terms of implementation by the US before any decisions are taken.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0643"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission would question the existence of significant prices rises relating to the introduction of the euro. According to the analysis carried out by Eurostat and published last July, consumer prices in the euro zone, measured by the Harmonised Consumer Price Index (HCPI), increased by 1.4% during the first six months of 2002 and the last six months of 2001. 1.2 per cent of the increase can be explained by historic inflation trends and by specific factors not relating directly to the introduction of the euro (climate conditions, indirect taxes ...). The inflationary impact relating to the introduction of euro notes and coins is therefore limited (maximum 0.2%), although it is slightly higher than previous estimates (maximum 0.16%). In the majority of Member States, national statistical bodies or central banks have made similar estimates, which also indicate generally limited effects. Nevertheless, in certain sectors unusual price rises have been observed (restaurants and cafés, health services, small shops etc.). These increases combined with the unfavourable rounding up of prices on certain common consumer items may have contributed to giving the public the impression of a more significant inflationary effect than that indicated by the official indices encompassing all goods and services consumed. Globally, however, inflation has decreased since the beginning of the year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0644"></a>

<p>With the forthcoming enlargement of the EU, the support system will also be extended to economically less robust countries.

While Austria will probably lose a good deal of its support in 2006, its neighbouring countries will become an even more attractive prospect with the Commission's subsidies in addition to low wage levels. This situation increases the risk of companies in the Austrian border regions relocating. Moreover, Austria has the longest common border with applicant countries of all the Member States.</p>

<p>(EN) State aid can be granted to companies for regional purposes taking into account the specific conditions of economic development that apply in the region concerned. Such aid, whether from Community or national sources, is conditioned by the rules governing state aid and by the regulations concerning the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Commission has laid down, in the guidelines on national regional aid<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, provisions which oblige the beneficiaries of national aid, just as for structural aid, to maintain any investment or employment created for a five-year period. Secondly, and in the same vein, the Structural Funds regulations stipulate that the contribution from the funds in productive activities is only provided on the condition that the location of these activities does not change in the five years following the decision on contribution<a href="#defann_43_2" name="refann_43_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Therefore, aid granted to investments that do not remain in the assisted region for at least five years must be reimbursed. The rules on national aid are already in force in the candidate countries, whilst those relating to Structural Funds will apply to candidate countries as soon as they join the Union.</p>
<p>Austria is supported by European regional policy financed under the Structural funds. For the period 2000-2006, EUR 889 million have been dedicated to the six Austrian Bundesländer bordering candidate countries (Burgenland, Steiermark, Oberösterreich, Niederösterreich, Kärnten and Vienna) in the framework of the Objective 1 and 2 programmes. In addition, under the Austrian Interreg IIIA programmes with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia, approximately € 110 million has been allocated for the period 2000-2006 for programmes of co-operation.</p>
<p>In July 2001, the Commission has also adopted an action plan<a href="#defann_43_3" name="refann_43_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> for regions bordering applicant countries to strengthen economic competitiveness. The total funding for this action plan, from which Austrian border regions will also benefit, amounts to € 305 million.

<p>The elimination of gender disparity in primary and secondary education is a shared objective for the Community and the Member States. The Commission is taking a proactive role in policy dialogue, reinforcing coordination with other donors, working on specific outcome indicators for gender equality in primary and secondary education and financing sector programmes in education in countries that have the most clear-cut commitments to the "Education For All" framework for action, without abandoning countries that are making little progress.</p>
<p>Moreover, in Monterrey this year at the United Nations Conference on Financing for Development, the Member States agreed to collectively commit themselves to increasing their overall Official Development Assistance (ODA) volume in the next four years. A substantial share of that ODA increase should go to support for social development, with special emphasis on improving health and education outcomes. In the education sector, this should translate into additional support for the Millenium Development Goal of Universal Primary Completion, for boys and girls alike, by 2015.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission notes that the establishment of the Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) under the Habitats Directive<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> has given rise to some concerns on the part of farmers and other landowners in the west of Ireland. The Irish authorities stressed to the Commission that the process of nominating SACs has been proceeded with detailed consultation with landowners and contacts with farmers representatives, with a view to explaining the objectives of the directive and allaying unfounded fears about its implications for future land use.</p>
<p>Some of these concerns may be linked to measures to tackle the widespread problem of overgrazing by sheep on commonage land in parts of the west of Ireland, as is recognised by the recent judgement of the Court of Justice<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This highlighted the need to establish corrective measures to avoid serious long-term damage to vegetation and soil erosion in the affected areas. Countering these adverse phenomena is, in the Commission’s view, prudent and necessary. This is not only from the perspective of nature conservation but also from that of long term sustainable agriculture and other land based economic activities such as tourism.</p>
<p>It should be noted that farmers in Ireland whose land is within proposed SACs are eligible for payments under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) additional to the standard payments for the delivery of agri-environmental services within the overall context of the REPS under Ireland’s Rural Development Programme. While there are no plans to formally review the Habitats Directive the Commission is examining, in partnership with the Member States and different interest groups, the issue of future financing of the Natura 2000 network, including the possibilities that may exist under different Community funds. The intention is to produce a Communication to Parliament and Council on this subject in 2003. The Commission also encourages Member States to develop approaches to implement the directive, in partnership with different stakeholders, which will have the effect of maximising its workability and effectiveness.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is not supporting population programmes for which funding has been withdrawn by the United States, and is not supporting programmes that make abortion an instrument of population policy.</p>
<p>However, the Commission is concerned about the gap created in funding for the United Nations’ Population Fund and the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) by the current United States administration. In this context, the Commission has developed a €22 million reproductive health programme under the 8<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund (EDF), in collaboration with the United Nations and the IPPF. This recently approved programme is aimed at improving the capacities of 22 of the poorest African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP) to deliver basic reproductive health services to vulnerable and under-served communities. It is not intended to fill the gap created in the core budget of United Nations’ Population Fund by the withdrawal of United States support. The Commission has full confidence in both United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) and IPPF, and both are longstanding partners.</p>
<p>The Union’s policy on abortion is based on the set of principles that has been adopted through a series of major development conferences over recent years. The ability of men and women to make a free and informed choice about the number and spacing of their children, access to good family planning and sexual health services, access to skilled care during birth, are all fundamental rights that the Commission supports.</p>
<p>Support for reproductive health programmes will prevent the need for abortion. However, the Commission recognises that abortion is a reality and causes the unnecessary deaths of many women each year. The Commission will continue to uphold the principle agreed at the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development, Cairo 1994, which states that where abortion is not against the law it should be made safe and women should have equal access to quality services.

<p>Following the exposure of administrative irregularities, approximately 1500 members of the Ilia Industrial Tomato Growers Association have not received subsidies for the 2001 harvest, an amount totalling some 43 million euro. Furthermore, there is a risk that they may not receive the subsidy for the current 2002 production. The Community and national authorities may, after carrying out checks, impose the prescribed penalties on those responsible for the irregularities and simultaneously release the amounts in question for payment to those members of the association who are entitled to them and bear no responsibility for the irregularities.</p>
<p>What steps will the Commission take to enable those farmers who are entitled to subsidies to obtain them?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The subsidies referred to by the honourable Member in his question are laid down in Council Regulation 2201/96 of 28 October 1996<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, establishing a system of Community subsidies for producers’ organisations that give up the processing, amongst other products, of tomatoes harvested within the Community. This system of subsidies is based on contracts binding, on the one hand, producers organised into producers’ organisations (PO) recognised in accordance with Regulation 2200/96<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and, on the other, processors approved by the competent authorities. The aid is granted to producers’ organisations who in turn award it to their members.</p>
<p>The recognition of a producer’s organisation is the responsibility of the Member States, who, in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations and the Commission’s implementing provisions, lay down a series of criteria to be met by the producers’ organisation so that they can benefit from Community assistance. The Member State is also responsible for carrying out controls relating to that system of subsidies, and for applying effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions where necessary.</p>
<p>It is therefore clear that the legislator has not provided for a scenario where the individual producer may be eligible for aid, regardless of the existence or behaviour of the producers’ organisation. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the statute of a PO, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 2200/96, must include rules guaranteeing that the associated producers have democratic control of their organisation and of their decisions, as well as penalties for violation of either statutory obligations or rules established by the producers’ organisation.</p>
<p>With regard to the case in question, according to the information available to the Commission, the honourable Member’s question appears to relate to the producers’ organisation ‘C.A. de Gastouni’. The services of the Commission have already expressed their opinion on this case by means of a letter dated 25 May 2002 addressed to the Greek authorities and they have initiated a procedure within the framework of the auditing of accounts. According to the Greek authorities, this group of producers, recognised as a producers’ organisation in 1997, has never met the recognition criteria set by the Community legislation. The Community budget cannot under any circumstances take responsibility for non-eligible expenditure, in other words, expenditure with regard to which the criteria established by Community law are not met. Therefore, the expenditure relating to aid for the processing of tomatoes by ‘C.A. de Gastouni’ is not eligible for co-funding by the Community as from the date on which the recognition conditions ceased to be met.</p>
<p>A different problem of eligibility for Community co-funding arises if the PO ‘C.A. de Gastouni’ is authorised to receive aid for the processing of tomatoes, provided that the Greek authorities have recognised it and that that recognition has not been withdrawn. This issue is to be decided by those authorities on the basis of national law. It should be pointed out that this possible ‘national’ payment should be judged in accordance with its conformity to the Community rules relating to State subsidies.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore regrets to have to tell the honourable Member that it will not be able to take any action in support of the farmers mentioned in the question.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has approved state aid and loan guarantees totalling 6.5 billion to a large pulp mill in Stendal, Germany. How is it possible for the Commission to authorise aid which actually threatens to drive companies in other countries out of business? This is hardly consistent with the Commission's duty under Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to ensure that there is no distortion of competition at EU level. The consequences of this decision will be that companies in this industry in other countries will not be competing on a level playing field. Södra, a company in Sweden, has independently financed acquisitions and plant at a cost of some SEK 7 billion. Naturally, the Commission's decision to approve state aid and loan guarantees in Germany is viewed as a severe blow to that Swedish company. A similar case has also arisen.

The project of Stendal has been approved on basis of the Multisectoral Framework on regional aid for large investment projects.

<p>(FR) The common organisation of the market in raw tobacco comprises a series of measures each of which should be considered according to its own merit.</p>
<p>The buy-back programmes are intended to help tobacco producers who wish, on a voluntary basis, to convert their production.</p>
<p>Within this framework, the Council has given the Commission the mandate to set quota buy-back prices which must not encourage an excessive exodus of producers from the sector. Furthermore, it is the Commission’s responsibility to monitor the efficiency and good operation of the measures adopted by the Council.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that previous buy-back prices have not produced the expected effects.</p>
<p>It seemed essential for the Commission to set the prices at a level more favourable to producers in the sector bearing in mind the need to maintain a balance between the variety groups and the difficulties relating to certain of them.</p>
<p>Following consultation with professionals and a broad debate with the Member States, the Commission presented a final proposal to the Management Committee for Tobacco on 16 October 2002. This proposal, which relates to the setting of quota buy-back prices for the 2002 and 2003 harvests, essentially provides for an increase in the level of these prices for all variety groups in comparison with the prices set in 2001 with a greater rise for variety groups III and V which are experiencing problems accessing the market. Furthermore, the buy-back prices are also modulated in accordance with the size of production quotas. Finally, the period for the granting of these buy-back payments is extended from three to five years.</p>
<p>The draft regulation has received the favourable opinion of the large majority of Member States. Its approach responds to the main objective of this measure and it should not disturb the Community’s tobacco industry.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission would like to point out to the honourable Member that this measure cannot be directly linked to the quality of production. The common organisation of the market in raw tobacco also lays down specific measures aimed at improving this quality.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the concerns of the Honourable Member and has continuously expressed its concern at the rate of return of Afghans to Afghanistan - both organised and spontaneous - that has been more rapid and massive than expected. The Commission has therefore from the beginning made this concern the main rationale behind its support to Afghan refugees, focusing on the sustainability of the return in order to ensure that this summer’s returnees don’t become next winter’s refugees.</p>
<p>The cumulative total of those who have returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan since March under the repatriation programme is 1.5 million, many of them flooding into Kabul and Jalalabad, although the pace of returns from Pakistan has begun to reduce. The United Nations estimates that up to 400,000 refugees have entered Kabul over the past four months under destitute conditions. A further 116,000 have returned from Iran. Some 800,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) remain in Afghanistan, largely due to prolonged drought and the prevailing security situation in parts of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In order to support the sustainable reintegration of those who have returned or been internally displaced, the Commission has so far provided over 3 million man days of work this year under its rural recovery and urban rehabilitation programme in the framework of its Initial Recovery programme. 450 primary schools and over 200 clinics and hospitals have also been rehabilitated with the same aim of providing a sustainable environment for reintegration and recovery. Another € 15 million will be made available for social sectors under its Second Recovery Programme. All this comes on top of humanitarian relief that amounts thus far to € 60 million most of which is directed at refugees, IDPs and returnees (the remainder being assistance to victims of the Narhim earth quake). The Commission has also co-funded massive mine clearing operations, another crucial element assisting the sustainable recovery of the rural economy.</p>
<p>Regarding the ongoing discussions of a common repatriation policy, the Commission, starting in February this year, has organised a series of meetings with experts of Members States and International organisations with a view to deepening the understanding of the migration issues as they are presently evolving in Afghanistan, its neighbouring region and in Europe.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the European Council meeting in Seville discussed the issue and adopted the following conclusion: “…adoption by the end of the year, of the components of a repatriation programme based on the Commission Green Paper; those components should include the best possible facilities for early return to Afghanistan”. This remit has been discussed at the informal Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) ministerial in Copenhagen, 13 September 2002 in the presence of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. On that occasion the member of the Commission in charge of external relations underlined the large support the Community was extending to Afghanistan in order to facilitate returns. At the Strategy Committee Immigration Frontiers and Asylum (SCIFA) meeting 25-26 September 2002, the Danish presidency presented a note containing an outline of an Union plan for repatriation to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The following are central to the Commission's approach as regard the return of refugees to Afghanistan:</p>
<p>Migration issues will be incorporated into our global strategy on Afghanistan. A new Country Strategy Paper is due this autumn;</p>
<p>It is clear from discussions with Member States that the implementation of any return programme can not be envisaged before spring 2003 at the earliest. The Commission is of the opinion that forced returns at this point in time would be counter-productive;</p>
<p>The above-mentioned expert meetings have been able to create a useful platform for the sharing of information both between Member States and the Commission as well as international organisations. The Commission will continue to play its role concerning this forum. First of all these meetings will aim at fulfilling the expressed needs of the Member States for close monitoring and assessment of the situation on the ground. Relevant international organisations and Non governmental organisations (NGOs) including Amnesty International will be invited to these meetings;</p>
<p>The Commission will discuss with Member States the need for co-ordination at the European level;</p>
<p>Member States will, naturally, keep full responsibility for setting up their national agenda concerning return, but it is essential that this should take place in a co-ordinated framework.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The term ‘reproductive health’ was defined by the United Nations (UN) in 1994 at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of ‘reproductive health’ to that given in the Programme of Action, which makes no reference to abortion.</p>
<p>The concept has since been expanded to ‘reproductive health and sexual health and rights’, which embrace certain rights that are already recognised in international human rights documents. They include the rights of couples and individuals to: decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children, to have the information and means to do so, and to attain the highest level of sexual and reproductive health.</p>
<p>The issue of paedophilia has never been the subject of discussion in international fora on reproductive health and sexual health and rights. However, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which all Member States are parties, clearly states that all children have the right to be protected from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal for a Regulation on aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries will provide the legal basis for the funding of activities that are aimed at reducing the very high death rates of women in developing countries during pregnancy and childbirth. The text of the Regulation is still under discussion. However, that in line with present policies, it will not provide incentives to encourage sterilisation or abortion in developing countries. Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given the highest priority.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0672"></a>

Furthermore, Greece has not yet developed a comprehensive statistical monitoring system. Therefore, it is difficult to proceed with reliable statistics on OAED performance indicators in terms of monitoring the flows into and out of unemployment using the existing structures of the OAED.</p>
<p>In the framework of the European Employment Strategy (EES), the Council, acting on a recommendation from the Commission, has addressed to Greece recommendations with regard to speeding up the implementation of the OAED reform and upgrading the statistical system to better monitor labour flows into and out of unemployment.</p>
<p>Greek authorities indicated their commitment to proceed with the restructuring of the OAED and the development of a modern and comprehensive statistical monitoring system. Community funding is made available through the Community Support Framework (CSF) for Greece for the period 2000-2006 in support of these goals.</p>
<p>According to the timetable agreed under the CSF, the implementation of the main part of the reform will be completed before the end of 2003. Complementary measures will continue to be implemented until the end of 2005.</p>
<p>Given the importance of this operation for the effective functioning of the labour market in Greece, the Commission will continue to follow up closely the implementation of this action in the framework of both the European Employment Strategy and the Community Support Framework for Greece.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0682"></a>

<p>(EN) The real human suffering facing coffee producers is one part, albeit the most pressing, of the broader problem of the commodity dependence of the world’s poorest countries. Over the long term diversification is the solution, requiring a comprehensive approach to trade and development. This approach is set out in the Commission Communication on trade and development<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, and is at the heart of the Doha Development Agenda which has development as the guiding principle of the multilateral trade negotiations, in order to build a multilateral trading system which takes full account of the economic, social and environmental constraints of developing countries. The Union has already taken a significant step with the Everything But Arms Initiative which grants duty free access for all products originating from less developed countries (LDCs). The Economic Partnership Agreements between the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP) and the Union will also deepen the link between trade and development, by integrating further the different dimensions of the Cotonou agreement, notably programming and implementation of aid on one side, and trade and economic co-operation on the other.</p>
<p>The Commission also sees a role for fair trade in helping poor producers gain a greater share of the international market. It financed already activities which aim to raise European citizen's awareness of development problems and of Fair Trade. It also supports projects designed to develop codes of conduct and social labelling and backs the private-led efforts to rationalise the use of Fair Trade Labels.</p>

According to the results, the Union may examine possible ways of contribution.</p>
<p>What further measures are to be supported by the Commission in the immediate future is being considered by an inter service working group in consultation with non governmental organisations (NGOs), including Oxfam, and large coffee roasters.

<p>(EN) The Commission Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001 establishes at Community level, the model for the certificate of inspection for imported 'organic' goods. This model shall apply from 1 November 2002. The draft Regulation was notified to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in accordance with the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) procedure in due time. Apart from a reaction from the United States authorities no comments were received.</p>
<p>This Commission Regulation lays down detailed rules implementing the general import conditions of the basic Regulation on organic farming. The basic Regulation namely, Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on 'organic farming', foresees amongst others a certificate of inspection for imported 'organic' goods. In the actual situation import certificates are already, and have been, requested for several years for 'organic' produce imported in the framework of equivalency recognised at Community level.</p>
<p>The effect of Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001 is to extend the requirement of the certificate to imports of 'organic' produce authorised by the Member States on a case by case basis. As most developing countries exporting 'organic' goods to the Community use this latter procedure, this extension is of particular importance to them. However, even the Codex Alimentarius guidelines on 'Organically produced Foods', recommend requiring a certificate for imports.</p>
<p>The Commission has taken care that Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001 will not impose complicated, bureaucratic procedures considering that:</p>
<p>The authority or body in the third country issuing the certificate only has to declare that the products comply with the agreed equivalent requirements. In other words that the 'organic' products described in the certificate have been obtained in accordance with rules of production and inspection agreed to be equivalent to those foreseen in Community legislation. The principles laid down in the Community legislation apply in an equivalent manner both to goods produced or prepared inside the Community and to those imported from third countries. In this regard, any possible amendment of the Community legislation in the future will certainly not differ from that principle.</p>
<p>The competent authorities in the Member States already have an obligation to certify imports where they have granted such an import authorisation. This check is essential in order to guarantee the integrity of organic products.</p>
<p>The certificate has to accompany the consignment from the moment the latter enters the Community. Member States have defined the relevant Member States' authorities (in most cases customs authorities) who shall verify the consignments of 'organic produce and endorse the certificate. For all animal produce and plant products from regions subject to phytosanitary restrictions, similar procedures are already in place.</p>
<p>The implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001 will contribute to ensure consumer confidence in 'organic' produce. This is essential for ensuring a sustained demand and therefore the future of the 'organic' production method. This will subsequently have a positive effect on the marketing opportunities for developing countries. In fact, if consumers maintain their confidence in 'organic' farming, developing countries will continue to have access to a steady market for 'organic' products. This concerns in many cases products which, for climatic reasons, cannot be produced within the Community.</p>
<p>The implementation of such a certificate is not contrary to the commitment of the Community at the recent World Summit of Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg. The agreement at the WSSD was to "support voluntary WTO compatible market-based initiatives for the creation and expansion of domestic and international markets for environmentally friendly goods and services, including organic products, which maximise environmental and developmental benefits through, inter alia, capacity building and technical assistance to developing countries". A vital part of creating and maintaining markets in the Community for the organic products of developing countries is providing consumers with the assurance that such products meet Community standards. This is the object of our legislation.</p>
<p>In addition, and in accordance with the commitments taken by the Community in Doha, the Commission is working on the possibilities offered by various financial instruments to support developing countries’ efforts to participate in the elaboration of and to comply with international trade regulations. In particular, the Community is in the process of reviewing the on-going activities in this field and to identify additional requirements to make sure that these countries will be in a position to trade their goods of animal and/or horticultural origin on regional, inter-regional or international markets. These supports could include supporting the national Competent Authorities to carry out the necessary controls to deliver the appropriate certificates required by importing countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In 2003 Croatia will again be judged on the basis of progress achieved towards meeting the recommendations of the SAP Report.</p>
<p>The Union participates in the Stability Pact's Regional Return Initiative. This works to remove obstacles to cross-border return and looks for new ways of financing return (loans instead of grants, private investment, etc).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0692"></a>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member asks why the Commission would view data retention as a necessary response to the terrorist attacks in the United States.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that data retention is one tool – among others - available to Member States when necessary to safeguard certain public interests, such as national security or the investigation and prosecution of crime, as illustrated in Article 15 (1) of the new Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications<a href="#defann_68_1" name="refann_68_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (the current Directive 97/66/EC will be repealed by 31 October 2003). This reference is however neither a requirement to adopt data retention measures, nor a blank check for Member States that would wish to introduce such measures.</p>
<p>Community law imposes certain legal constraints on Member States with regard to any national measures requiring operators to store traffic data for law enforcement purposes beyond the provision of the service and the billing of that service. In accordance with the new Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications, such national measures may only be adopted if they are necessary, appropriate and proportionate within a democratic society, and they may only require data to be retained for a limited period. Whether these conditions have been met, can only be analysed case-by-case, on the basis of the justification provided by Member States that such measures are necessary for the protection of the public interests invoked.</p>
<p>The Commission is now trying to clarify as much as possible how national measures can be best reconciled with the legal requirements stemming from Community law, from the European Convention on Human Rights and from the Charter of Fundamental Rights, bearing in mind the respective limits of the Commission’s powers under the first and third pillars. These discussions have not yet been completed and the Commission therefore considers premature to draw any conclusions on whether there is a need for any legislative action at Union level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Over the last 18 months, the Danish competition authority, Konkurrencestyrelsen, has been investigating possible illegal methods of setting prices and price agreements among petrol companies. The authority believes it has such a clear case that the investigation has been extended to include all petrol companies operating in Denmark. Similar cases are under investigation in the Netherlands and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The petrol companies' activities may be regarded as cross-border for a number of reasons. Firstly, cross-border trade between Denmark and Germany and between Denmark and Sweden is quite considerable, including the purchase of petrol. Secondly, the petrol market is controlled by multinational corporations whose pricing policy is not necessarily determined in one particular country but rather at headquarters some distance removed from the individual national market. The national competition authorities therefore have problems getting to the bottom of cases of this nature.</p>
<p>Has the Commission been in touch with the Danish competition authority or any other national competition authorities concerning these possible illegal practices and what was the outcome thereof?

<p>(EN) The Commission has discussed competition policy in the motor fuel sector with the National Competition Authorities in recent years. This included specific meetings with all National Competition Authorities in September and November 2000<a href="#defann_69_1" name="refann_69_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. It emerged in the course of these meetings that agreements regarding prices in the motor fuel sector, when they exist, are currently more likely to be organised at national than at Community level. It was therefore agreed that national competition authorities would make it their priority to detect and prosecute such anti-competitive behaviour, unless cross-border aspects emerge. It should also be noted that, in the context of the Commission’s new policy on vertical restraints, national competition authorities have received the power to deal with anticompetitive vertical restraints and withdraw the block exemption for vertical agreements – previously an exclusive Commission power<a href="#defann_69_2" name="refann_69_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. National authorities are thus fully empowered to take action against restrictions caused by agreements the effects of which are felt mainly in their territory in accordance with the principles for case allocation between the Commission and the national competition authorities<a href="#defann_69_3" name="refann_69_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. This general policy was expressly restated as regards national motor fuel markets in the joint meetings held with the National Competition Authorities to discuss competition policy in this sector. This explains why the Danish or the Dutch competition authorities are dealing with such cases.</p>
<p>In these meetings, it was also noted that where independent operators have a significant presence (for example France, United Kingdom and Germany) motor fuel markets are more competitive than retail markets where vertically-integrated suppliers have a strong presence. The Commission agreed with National Competition Authorities that it will focus on addressing any State or private barriers in the wholesale market for non-vertically-integrated independent companies. The findings of the subsequent Commission investigation were presented to the National Competition Authorities in a meeting in November 2001. These findings have already proved to be useful. For example, in a recent proposal for a Directive adopted on 11 September 2002, the Commission proposes to modify the security stockholding requirements, in particular, but not only, with regard to small operators, so as to facilitate cross-border trade<a href="#defann_69_4" name="refann_69_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.

<p>(FR) The Commission was not aware of the scientific study carried out by the National Institute of Technology in Athens which is mentioned in the honourable Member’s question. The Commission has therefore asked the Greek authorities to provide it with information relating to a possible increase in levels of radioactivity in the region of Valtetsion in Arkadia. Those authorities have informed us that the study in question relates to the problem of pollution originating from the lignite power station in Megalopoli.</p>
<p>The monitoring of radioactivity levels in the environment within the territory of the Member States falls within the legal obligations of those States in accordance with Articles 35 and 36 of the Euratom Treaty. The Greek authorities regularly communicate to the Commission information relating to the controls of these levels of radioactivity. Furthermore, professional activities carried out in the presence of natural sources of radiation which involve a considerable increase in the exposure of workers and members of the public are covered by the provisions of Title VII of Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996 laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation<span class="sup"> <a href="#defann_70_1" name="refann_70_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p>The Greek authorities have indicated that they have a continuous monitoring site for external radiation within the power station and that they take systematic measurements of aerosols and storage sites on the land close to the power station. They have pointed out that the results of the measurements taken at these sites do not show any abnormal rise in levels of radioactivity and are comparable to the levels measured in other parts of the territory.</p>
<p>In view of the information communicated to the Commission by the Greek authorities, the data mentioned in the study in question do not appear to be very reliable and complementary measures to protect workers, members of the public and the environment do not appear to be justified.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The World Summit for Sustainable Development can be considered a success in the area of water and sanitation, with the adoption of the sanitation target, the launch of the Community Water Initiative and the signature of the EU-Africa partnership on water and sanitation.</p>
<p>The goal is now to focus Union development co-operation programmes in this sector on the achievement of the targets agreed at the Summit, in a co-ordinated manner, promoting sector support approaches, in line with the Union character of the Initiative, and increased partnership with the private sector and civil society. Working with the African Ministerial Council on Water, the Union needs to ensure that national and regional strategies and programmes include the objectives and principles agreed in the EU-Africa partnership. At regional level, this will mean in particular tackling the issue of transboundary river basin management as a factor in regional integration and conflict prevention. The Union is in the process of identifying five river basins in Africa on which it would focus.</p>
<p>Engagement at country level, involving donors and key stakeholders active in the sector, governments and civil society in general, is a key for early delivery of results. Special attention will therefore be paid in a first phase to countries and regions where water is a focal area of the Community cooperation programme by integrating the principles and priorities of the Water Initiative.</p>
<p>The Multi-Stakeholder expert forum will continue to be the main body to develop the programmes of action, seeking synergies and complementarity between the Community and Member States and other partners.</p>
<p>The design phase of the initiative will continue in parallel to complete the definition of the building blocks in a series of working groups and consolidate partnerships, and to prepare a co-ordinated action programme, as well as to establish a monitoring and reporting mechanism in order to measure progress in implementation and guide further action.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0698"></a>

<p>(EN) As a follow-up to the 2001 Green Paper: Promoting a European framework for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR),<a href="#defann_72_1" name="refann_72_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Commission adopted a new strategy on CSR on 2 July 2002<a href="#defann_72_2" name="refann_72_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, which set out specific actions to increase knowledge on CSR, promote exchange of best practices, foster CSR among Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), facilitate convergence and transparency of CSR practices and instruments, launch a Multi-stakeholder Forum on CSR at Community level and integrate CSR into Communty policies.</p>
<p>The Commission launched the European Multi-Stakeholder Forum on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR EMS Forum) on 16 October 2002 in the presence of the Members of the Commission responsible for Employment and Social Affairs, and Enterprise and the Information Society. About 20 major European representative organisations of employers, business networks, trade unions and civil society met at the high level meeting to adopt a document setting out the objectives, composition and operational aspects of the Forum and to have a first exchange of views. The Parliament, other Union institutions and further United Nations organisations were present as observers.</p>
<p>The Forum's objectives are to promote innovation, transparency and convergence of CSR through improving knowledge on CSR and exploring the appropriateness of establishing common guiding principles for CSR policies and instruments. The Forum will present a report to the Commission detailing the results of its work before summer 2004.</p>
<p>For many European SMEs, responsible entrepreneurship forms an integral part of their values. The challenge is, therefore, to build on SME's existing social commitment without creating additional administrative burdens. More SMEs can be involved through awareness-raising campaigns, the provision of information and tools by their trusted intermediaries (i.e. chambers of commerce). The European Multi-stakeholder Forum will provide a useful platform for the exchange of information on these efforts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In June the Commission adopted the Better Regulation Action Plan. A key action of this plan is the introduction of a new integrated procedure for impact assessment of all major proposals listed in the Commission’s Annual Policy Strategy and Legislative and Work Programme. The new system integrates, streamlines and replaces all existing sectoral impact assessment mechanisms. The new procedure therefore replaces existing requirements for business impact assessment, environmental assessment, gender assessment etc. The Commission services will apply the principle of proportionate analysis in order to ensure that the level of analysis of Commission proposals is adapted to the significance of the likely impacts. The new procedure will also ensure that proposals are assessed at the onset of the policy design process.</p>
<p>To the extent that Commission proposals are likely to have an impact on businesses, and especially on Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), these will be proportionately assessed within the new impact assessment procedure. In doing so, the recommendations of the final report of the Business Impact Assessment pilot project, which was published in March this year, will be taken into account. They include the quantification of impacts where relevant and possible.</p>
<p>The system will be introduced gradually starting in 2003 with a first selection of proposals. The new system will be fully operational from the adoption of the Annual Policy Strategy for 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0702"></a>

<p>(EN) With regard to the extent of the trade in the products of illegal logging, no official estimates exist of the quantities marketed in breach of the exporting country's legislation. The commercial significance of the phenomenon needs to be viewed in proportion: 80% of all trade in forestry products is between developed countries, which are only marginally affected by illegal logging, and only 10-20% of the quantities logged are actually marketed.</p>
<p>The only estimates available on illegal logging are those provided by NGOs or international experts. They range from 10% to 50% of the total quantity logged in certain countries. However, even if we cannot be sure of the exact scope of the phenomenon, it is clear that it represents a fairly significant proportion of the forestry products of certain tropical countries and, in particular, certain transition states. The International Timber Organisation (ITTO) is carrying out a study to cross-check statistics on official imports and exports of certain timber-consuming and producing countries in order to determine discrepancies in these figures. Such discrepancies could give an indication of the magnitude of the problem.</p>
<p>As things stand, no means exist of officially identifying illegally logged timber or products manufactured using such timber. It is for the countries concerned to monitor the legality of forestry activities within their territory and ensure compliance with national law. Neither consumers nor EU Member States can act in place of the governments of the countries of origin to ensure such identification. Certain voluntary forest certification schemes include in their principles for granting of a 'label' conformity with national laws, so by implication such labelled produce would be certified to be legal. Also, trade in wood and wood products from species listed in Appendixes II and III of the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) can only be conducted on the basis of certificates which testify, inter alia, that the products have been produced in accordance with national legislation. However, the volume of trade with developing countries carried out under forest certification schemes is modest and, under CITES, very limited.</p>
<p>With regard to action to end this trade, the Commission is currently preparing an action plan, following the recent Commission Communication to the Council and the Parliament<a href="#defann_74_1" name="refann_74_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which provided that the European Union would 'develop a European Union action plan by end 2002 on forest law enforcement, governance and trade (FLEGT) to combat illegal logging and associated illegal trade and to strengthen international cooperation to address violations of forest law, and forest crime'. The objectives of this plan are to develop technical assistance measures and to define actions aimed at reinforcing global and national governance in respect of the exporter countries concerned, thus making it easier to identify the products of illegal logging and to contribute to the fight against such practices. Most of these measures will be instituted in close cooperation with the exporter countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission has supported the development of e-commerce in general in the Community for example through the adoption of a series of Directives that are aimed at ensuring an Internal Market for Information Society Services. These include the Directives on electronic commerce (2000/31/EC) and electronic signatures (1999/93/EC).</p>
<p>As well as facilitating direct contact between producers and customers in a conventional way e-commerce has also given rise to new forms of business model, such as online auctioning and electronic marketplaces. As costs of using the Internet fall, notably as a result of competition and the Community’s policy in the field of electronic communications, e-commerce can provide relatively easy access for small producers to a global market. Such decisions should of course be left to the market players themselves.</p>
<p>A publication entitled "An overview of developments and prospects for e-commerce in the agricultural sector" can be found on http://europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/markets/e-commerce/index_en.htm. In this publication it is outlined that concerning the potential benefits of "agriculture online", e-commerce may offer solutions by integrating individual actors to improved organisational structures. This has the potential to improve market access through online transactions, by reducing geographical obstacles to market reach, such as time and distance, although it is clear that in principle the physical operation involved in delivering products of an acceptable standard remains. Furthermore e-commerce may encourage transport and logistical developments and further integration may even lead to a decline in auction markets. This may lead to minimising risks to animal welfare by reducing transport activities to a minimum and to animal health by avoiding contacts between animals of different origin. An overview about existing applications is given in the annex to the above-mentioned publication.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0708"></a>

<p>(EN) Working to eradicate poverty and social exclusion is a key policy priority of the Union. The ongoing process, launched at the Lisbon European Council in March 2000, aims to make a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty and social exclusion by 2010. It encourages Member States to take a strategic and comprehensive approach to all aspects of poverty and social exclusion. It emphasises the need for a multi-dimensional approach which takes account of the complex and varied aspects of the problem. Within this an adequate income is a key element. This is reflected in the Common Objectives, adopted at the Nice European Council in December 2000, which in particular emphasise the need "to facilitate participation in employment" and "to organise social protection systems in such a way that they help, in particular, to: guarantee that everyone has the resources necessary to live in accordance with human dignity; overcome obstacles to employment by ensuring the take-up of employment results in increased income and by promoting employability."</p>
<p>The Joint Report on Social Inclusion, which was prepared by the Commission and Council and endorsed at the European Council in Laeken in December 2001, identifies eight core challenges for Member States in the struggle against poverty and social exlcusion. The second of these challenges is concerned with "guaranteeing an adequate income and resources to live in human dignity". Responsibility for particular policies in this area is primarily a matter for Member States. However, in its support for the Open Method of Coordination, the Commission will be encouraging Member States to take the issue of income adequacy fully into account. In particular the Commission will be encouraging Member States to address this issue in their next two year National Action Plans against poverty and social exclusion which are due in mid 2003. The Commission will also ensure that the Community action programme on social exclusion will enhance the collection and monitoring of data on income adequacy and will promote the exchange of learning and best practice between Member States on policies to address poverty.</p>
<p>In addition, the issue of poverty and exclusion is addressed through other processes such as the European employment strategy and in particular the national action plans on employment and through the contribution of the Structural Funds to tackling social exclusion.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0710"></a>

<p>At present, people aged 60 or older constitute 20% of the population of Europe. By 2050, it is anticipated that this proportion will double. This rapid growth shows that ageing will be one of the major challenges to be faced. The impact of this phenomenon on the economic and social development of the EU calls for coordinated action at European level with regard to various aspects (pensions, mobility, culture, education, inclusion, etc.) in order to ensure consistent and sustainable management, distinguishing those people who are merely elderly, who are still active and wholly or partially self-sufficient, from those defined as ‘old elderly’, who are not self-sufficient and require total assistance to maintain human dignity.</p>

<p>(EN) As stated by the Commission in its contribution to the April 2002 United Nations World Assembly on Ageing in Madrid<a href="#defann_77_1" name="refann_77_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, over the past few years, Member States have committed themselves to collaboration on ageing issues in the context of sound public finances, employment, social protection and health and long term care while maintaining these as national policies and taking into account the diversity of ageing situations.</p>
<p>Ageing is not a separate issue to be tackled in isolation from other ones. The Union's response to ageing is therefore developed as part of the overall strategy of mutually reinforcing policies launched at the European Council meeting at Lisbon and elaborated at subsequent European Council meetings in Nice, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Laeken and Barcelona. As set out in the Economic Policy Coordination and the European Social Agenda it encompasses the economic, employment and social implications of ageing. The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, which are the key instrument for economic policy co-ordination and provide the framework for policy recommendations and for monitoring the implementation of these recommendations, call for Member States to develop comprehensive strategies for addressing the economic challenge posed by ageing populations. The Social Policy Agenda, which lists Community policy priorities in employment and social affairs, outlines how Member States through mutually reinforcing employment, social protection and economic policies can deal with the wider social and work life related implications of ageing.</p>
<p>The Union approach to ageing aims at mobilising the full potential of people of all ages. the basic assumption is that adequate responses to ageing must go beyond attention to the presently old. Adjusting well to population ageing is an issue for people of all ages and a life course approach can help the development of adequate policy responses taking account of the related age and gender specific issues.</p>
<p>This results in an orientation towards active ageing policies and practices. Core active ageing practices include life long learning, working longer, retiring later and more gradually, being active after retirement and engaging in capacity enhancing and health sustaining activities. Such practices aim to raise the average quality of individual lives and at the same time, at societal level, contribute to larger growth, lower dependency burdens and substantial cost savings in pensions and health. They therefore represent win-win strategies for people of all ages.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
