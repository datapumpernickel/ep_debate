<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Palacio Vallelersundi </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I was just thinking that this is the last report I shall give as rapporteur in this parliamentary term. I was also thinking that few parliamentarians can have been lucky enough to cut their political teeth on the directive on voting rights for citizens of the Union resident in a Member State other than their own, and to draw their career to a close with this report on the implications of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam for legislative proposals pending. Indeed, the start of my parliamentary career was also the first time I appeared in an institutionalised political forum.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, and with a certain nostalgia for the other reports I have presented and the many times I have spoken in the House over the years, I shall move on to the issue we are concerned with today. Commissioner, I must first say on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs that we have taken note of the document you have presented to us. I hope Parliament will confirm this tomorrow but we accept, share and understand its content, despite the pressures of time imposed by the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. It is an excellent working document and I naturally agree with the philosophy behind it, which is clear and which specifies the essential details.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament can go no further. It will be for the incoming Parliament to consider the validity of the legal bases in each case, pursuant to our Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">This report goes beyond merely listing the changes the Commission has noted and which it suggests other institutions consider, though these should be borne in mind. Procedural changes affecting more than a hundred acts are noted. Eighty of these involve transfers from the cooperation procedure to the codecision procedure in areas such as transport, the environment and social affairs. Changes in the legal bases are also recorded, notably concerning matters covered under the old Article 43 – agriculture – and which now come under the title covering public health. Finally, there are very significant changes concerning the policy, content, aim, inspiration and underlying political principles behind issues moving from the third to the first pillar in the area of justice and home affairs. The integration of the social protocol into the Treaty itself constitutes another important change.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with what is undoubtedly a complex situation, one thing is clear: there is no transitional law, there are no transitional provisions within the Treaty of Amsterdam. We are therefore called upon to come up with an integrated and constructive interpretation based on the principles underlying the Treaty. As far as Parliament is concerned, this interpretation is based on three points. We must exercise our responsibility towards the people preserving the powers granted to Parliament under the Treaty, and we must guard these powers, just as we should when they are granted to other institutions. The new consultations relating to the Committee of the Regions or the Economic and Social Committee are good examples of this.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, Parliament will not bow to any other institution"s interpretation of procedural matters. Such matters must be considered – as the Commission"s report rightly points out – on the basis that the act adopted will be adopted in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam, and that this is the procedure that must be followed. Moving on from here, we are bound by another important principle which is also related to the responsibility we have to the people and which I mentioned earlier. I am referring to the principle of preserving the acts, the principle of being as effective as possible and of providing the best and fastest response to the people. Therefore, whenever possible, we shall confirm and ratify procedural arrangements to ensure that each act is adopted and comes into effect at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, as a general principle, Mr President, we should be unyielding on general principles but as flexible as possible on specific applications.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, what we are confronted with is a change that summarises Parliament"s philosophy very well indeed. As Commissioner Oreja is on record as saying, this is a change which from 1 May will equip the European Union with a more efficient instrument, one which is more open to dialogue with the people, more democratic and more outward‐looking. I believe that this report responds to these ideas.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must congratulate Mrs Ana de Palacio. She herself referred to her first and last speeches, but I would like to emphasise that between them Mrs Palacio has applied herself to her work intelligently, competently and with great energy. All of us as individuals and all the institutions have most certainly benefited from her contribution over the last five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the report before us today, the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam did of course mean that we had to resolve a number of procedural issues concerning legislative proceedings pending. Matters have not been helped by the fact that the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam coincided with the final part‐session of this Parliament. Nevertheless, we are convinced that the loyal cooperation between the institutions will enable us to find a solution to any problems which may arise.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are all aware, on 1 May the Commission forwarded to Parliament and the Council a communication detailing the consequences of the entry into force of the Treaty for all proposals already submitted and not yet adopted. Eighty proposals previously subject to the cooperation procedure will now have to be considered and adopted under the codecision procedure. For some 20 proposals, Parliament"s involvement changes from a simple ruling to codecision. Further, the legal bases of 27 proposals have been modified.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has already made its views on a number of these proposals clear, and the Commission has incorporated some or all of these into its amended proposals. We believe it is very important to ensure that the people of Europe do not feel that the Community"s decision‐making powers have been constrained as a result of the entry into force of the Treaty or because of the parliamentary elections. It is therefore essential to carry on with the legislative work as usual.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Palacio"s report suggests a procedure confirming the one that was chosen by the European Parliament after Maastricht. It involves Parliament"s confirmation of the legislative procedures already under way whose legal bases or procedures have been amended pursuant to the Treaty of Amsterdam. It is worth mentioning that some cases call for swift action, particularly the three concerning approval of the conclusions of the negotiations on Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly appreciate the goodwill Parliament has shown in dealing with all urgent pending matters – especially those relating to Agenda 2000 – at this part‐session despite the pressures of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to refer to the proposals pending concerning justice and home affairs and affected by the fact that under the Treaty of Amsterdam such matters have now become a responsibility of the Community. In these cases, the Commission will formally table new proposals. The content of these will naturally be retained, but the most appropriate legal instrument will be used, be it a regulation or a directive. As for the two agreements on the forwarding of acts and the recognition of decisions in marital matters and parental responsibility, these will be forwarded to the Council and to Parliament immediately. They are due to be adopted by the Commission tomorrow in accordance with the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that in view of the institutional calendar and the political circumstances which have resulted in the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam coinciding with the advent of a new Parliament and a new Commission, it will be for the incoming members of both these institutions to pursue dialogue on this issue with the Council. Thank you very much and congratulations once again, Mrs Palacio.</p>
