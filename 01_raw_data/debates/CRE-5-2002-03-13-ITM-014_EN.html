<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carnero González (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, at this late hour, anyone can make a mistake. If a market research institute were to ask people if they thought the European Union had its own personality, I think that the majority would say yes. They would most certainly be mistaken, but this error would demonstrate at least three things: firstly, the current lack of transparency in the European Union’s institutional architecture; secondly, the lack of information for citizens from their governments in areas such as those we are dealing with and, without a doubt, the most important thing, that reality is way ahead of the decisions taken at Intergovernmental Conferences to date. The citizens believe that the European Union has its own personality, yet the governments in these Conferences have had no desire to provide it with one.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has existed since the Treaty of Maastricht, which is some time ago now, but neither at that time nor since has it wanted to expressly take on a legal personality; the latest example of this was the Treaty of Nice. The issue is on the table. Why have governments refused to act?</p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, the EU continues to act like a child living under the legal authority of its parents: the European Communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The question I would like to ask is the following: can we really uphold this contradictory and barely understandable situation for much longer? The answer to this question is becoming more and more clear – “no” – because the current situation causes legal confusion, political confusion, international and internal confusion, institutional confusion and, above all, as I said at the beginning of my speech, confusion amongst the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to give you three examples of this in an international setting. We could go to a country such as Equatorial Guinea and see that the Commission delegation there is the Commission of the European Communities and not that of the European Union; we can listen to our representative in the United Nations and notice that he or she is from the European Communities and not the European Union, or, we see that a commitment made by a united Europe to very speedily endorse the Kyoto Protocol is not in fact endorsed by the European Union but the European Communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this report has been produced at the same time as the start of the Convention on the future of Europe, which this Parliament hopes will produce a constitution. This will therefore be our first contribution to the Convention after it has been set up. It is logical that this issue should also be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the Convention and subsequently the Intergovernmental Conference, taking on board the issues that came to light at Laeken, will tackle the issue of giving the European Union a legal personality, which will have advantages that cannot be denied: firstly, legal clarity; secondly, the improvement of the Union's image and its capacity to take action on the international stage; thirdly, it will be a key element in establishing a system for the protection of fundamental rights at Union level; fourthly, to give Union policy a higher profile and make it easier for citizens to identify with the Union and, fifthly, to help remedy the dysfunctions caused by the pillar system.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think that a legal personality is needed to bring the process of political union to a conclusion and that the process of the constitutionalisation of the Union will also require it to have its own legal personality. In fact, this is a necessary prerequisite to achieving these objectives in a coherent way.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is not the final outcome, what will be the objective of the future constitutional text? Which body will take on the leading role in the European Constitution? The Union, the Communities, one of which is due to expire next Summer? For this reason we ask that legal personality be given to the European Union in the future European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask for this in the report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, for which I am honoured to be the rapporteur, in agreement with the opinions of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which I think are very positive contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this request for the Union to be given a legal personality was also apparent in the last Presidencies-in-Office of the Council, a desire expressed by both the Belgian and Spanish Presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">This, Madam President, is not an issue for legal experts, but a point that can be easily understood by any citizen: to know that he or she is a citizen of a European Union with its own personality, which can and should govern democratically and transparently, and they demand it fulfils its responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This subject is particularly problematic when it comes to foreign policy. For example, in international organisations, in the FAO, we have full membership for one of the Communities, and a seat and a vote on United Nations bodies, but this does not apply across the entire foreign policy spectrum. Let us consider in particular the changes that have taken place on the international scene over the last three years, with Mr Solana taking office in 1999, which represented a political step change in European foreign policy, the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 and the objective of a common foreign and security policy by 2003. These are ambitious targets which, however, are no longer rooted in the legal basis provided by the treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Articles 24 and 38 provide a legal basis for concluding agreements, but they make one of the Communities or the Member States as such responsible. And this House also needs to be aware that agreements are entered into at present without Parliament having a chance to approve them beforehand. Budgetary commitments are made in international agreements which then have to be honoured by Parliament at a later stage because of our particular role. That is why I believe that this issue of the legal personality of the EU needs to be put on the agenda of the Convention again. We need this legal personality in order for the European Union to make a stronger contribution to the United Nations, for example, especially following the events of 11 September. This is in addition to the role of the Member States and is no substitute for individual Member States' membership of the United Nations, but it would give our foreign policy a higher profile, it would increase our scope for action and above all be more transparent to the public. That is the goal that we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would like to see included in the discussions of the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Carnero González report stresses that the attribution of its legal personality is an essential step towards the constitutionalisation of the Treaties and improves the coherence of the various European policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Opponents of the Union speak of a superstate, a Europe that has fallen into the hands of a stateless bureaucracy. In reality, Europe is not a threat to national identities, and national identities are not a threat to Europe. Political unity is the only way to prevent the individual countries from being overwhelmed by untamed globalisation or to prevent difficulties from making the ghosts of nationalism re-emerge. Anyway, we are not starting from scratch. In the past the Treaty has attributed legal personality to the European Communities, but with the birth of the Union there is a legal void to fill. The Council has addressed this several times, without, however, reaching clear conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Public opinion and all countries that have relations with Europe are convinced that their relations are with an autonomous and unitary system. Moreover, in the sphere of foreign policy, defence and security, the European Council can deliberate on procedures that represent the beginnings of a legal personality. One has to recognise the benefits for European citizens and for the Union’s international image.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not true that we are trying to build our common house from the roof down. Construction by pillars reveals a problem, which Mr Carnero’s proposal remedies by taking up a 1997 Parliamentary resolution on international law, Community law and the constitutions of the individual Member States. This resolution made express reference back then to the need to give the Union a legal personality.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, of course, pre-empt the Convention, but this resolution gives a great boost to a constitutional process to which, in our opinion, the future of a democratic Europe is bound. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is easy to say what the issue is: the European Union needs at last to be given a face, a clear profile. Look, quite recently we were told to be careful: the building of Europe has progressed under wraps, without revealing its features and its intentions, playing on calculated ambiguities to disarm resistance and dodge the stiffest opposition. Thus for decades there was a succession of partial achievements and de facto solidarity, to borrow an expression dear to Jean Monnet and enshrined in the Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950. Things went forward like that, without too much definition of the political and institutional individual that was growing up, without too much pretence at coherence in the building of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, we reply, the time has come for clarity, the time has come to explicitly characterise the supranational body that has gradually been taking shape until now we have a single currency. The Convention must say who we are and what we want. The fact that the European Community may have been an original construction, without historical precedent or pre-established models, cannot mean that it should remain inexpressible or indefinable, and certainly not that it should remain incomplete.</p>
<p class="contents">We must respond to the citizens’ legitimate questions and present ourselves as a union that has its own plan, that equips itself with clear institutional checks and balances, that recognises itself through a Constitution, that wants to play a strong international role, and therefore endows itself with a legal personality. Hence the coherent, convincing argument of Mr Carnero González’s report, which the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has fully endorsed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Duff (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, most people would now say that they want the European Union to play a stronger role in world affairs, but they appear sometimes to be uncertain as to the ways and means. This evening, in the splendid Carnero González report, we have part of the answer. The acquisition of an international legal personality would be a powerful instrument for the Union. First, it will raise its international profile. Second, by giving the Union more respectability, it should encourage us to act more responsibly. It will open the door for a more proactive part for the Union inside the United Nations, the IMF and the World Bank. It will consolidate our role and the functions of the Commission in the field of trade and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">But international legal personality cannot simply be asserted unilaterally. It must be earned if it is to win recognition under international law. What will assist us in winning this acceptance is for the Union itself to become a contracting party to the Council of Europe's Convention – a move that will complement the development of our own fundamental rights regime funded on the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">This report prepares those of us in the Convention to take the lead. We are grateful to the rapporteur for his sterling work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order for it to radically change the institutions, it would need to be combined, as Mr Carnero González suggests several times in his report, with several other much more significant reforms: merging the pillars, the power to conclude treaties on its own behalf, generally incorporating decision-making into the Community sphere and adopting a supra-national constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the report is right, in a sense, in saying that this reform would not in itself imply transfers of powers to the Union. It is true that a simple association of States making unanimous decisions could have legal personality. However, it is wrong to say that this alone could bring about the characteristics of coherence, unity of representation and visibility that the report ascribes to it. In other words, this reform is nothing, or if it is to be something, it has to be accompanied by a merging of the pillars, an incorporation into the Community sphere and a constitutional process, which whatever we choose to call it, would be the distinctive signs of a superstate or of something that would strongly resemble one.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I have drawn up a minority opinion, which is included with the report. And that is why I am proposing a deal to Mr Carnero González. I am happy to accept the legal personality of the Union if, in exchange, Mr Carnero González agrees to say that, if a European constitution came into being, it should first and foremost acknowledge the superiority of the national constitutions, the freedom of choice of the Member States on the world stage and unanimous decision-making or variable geometry in the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">If you agree to say all of that, Mr Carnero González, I would perhaps vote for your report, but you will not say this because your report is in fact hiding something other than what it claims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within the delegation there is deep disagreement. Some believe that what is proposed is a step in the direction of a European superstate. Some, after considerable reflection, really do not know; and some believe this is a proposal that will create an entrenched bulwark against a superstate, and so are in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">These views are individually deeply and honestly held, as indeed are my personal and private ones. In these circumstances, trying to compel one's colleagues to vote against their views on this kind of topic, in these kind of circumstances, is not only unlikely to work, it will not change their views either. All it does is cause trouble.</p>
<p class="contents">While the subject matter of many of the non-legislative resolutions of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is very important, Parliament's resolutions themselves are, in the world of real politics, some of the less important items we vote on; it is therefore folly, it seems to me, and shows lack of judgement, to engage in civil war about things which do not matter all that much. Hence we are approaching this and other similar topics here within the framework of a broad church, which has the overriding advantage of being sensible, which I am not sure can be said about any other course of action open to us in the circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one understands the difference between the European Community and the European Union. It is complicated and confusing and also has many drawbacks.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berthu is quite right in saying that this request forms part of the major overall reform that we want. Merging the three pillars and streamlining the decision-making structures are all things that we have already approved in the Leinen-Méndez de Vigo report and in various other reports. The question of legal personality is a cornerstone that is needed to bring the whole thing together. This cornerstone was missing and we are providing it now with Mr Carnero's report.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much support this. The Convention is an excellent opportunity to do this work. We need Europe to have a single voice in the world. Mr Laschet and others have already mentioned examples of this absurdity: in some cases the Community is represented, but not the Union. It really is very complicated. But it is also important for justice and home affairs policy. I just asked him to say that we have agreed to make EUR 5 million available for Europol. That is a good thing, because we want Europol to function, but the funding cannot be accepted, because Europol cannot accept money from the Community budget, but only from the Member States. This demonstrates the absurdity of this situation, and I hope that our representatives and others involved in the Convention will take a step forward as regards legal personality and that the rights of our citizens will finally become binding, so that they can take the Union to court. On that note, I wish this proposal every success and say thank you to Mr Carnero. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That deserves our full attention, given the hour.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully supports the terms of the proposed resolution. It comes at the right time because the Convention to prepare the next IGC has just started its work. It is very important that those who will be taking a position in the Convention and during the next IGC should be aware of the importance of this question for the effectiveness and the credibility of the Union and of the need to find an appropriate solution.</p>
<p class="contents">We know the weaknesses of the current system and how difficult it is for outsiders to understand – just like the other solutions resisted by the Commission in the past, such as the addition of yet another legal personality to the current set-up. We have to convince people that it is essential to accord a single, full and complete personality to the Union. For this, it is obviously essential to have the active support of the European Parliament, together with the measure of agreement now seen in several parliamentary reports such as the Carnero González and Lamassoure reports, and in the opinions of the various parliamentary subcommittees consulted.</p>
