<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Atrocities against national minorities in Voivodina, Serbia and Montenegro</span></p>
<p class="contents">In recent months, there has been a growing tendency towards ethnic violence in the Voivodina province of Serbia and Montenegro. The violence has been directed against national minorities living in the region, such as Albanians, Croats and Hungarians, and include defamation of national symbols, destruction of property and cultural heritage as well as the infliction of serious personal injuries. Despite repeated complaints by individuals and political groups, the central and local authorities are unwilling to take substantive measures to address the situation and bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council aware of the serious circumstances in Voivodina? Is it planning to take adequate steps to persuade the Government of Serbia and Montenegro to restore public order and to guarantee the fundamental human rights of ethnic and national minorities? Since the inactivity of the authorities in Serbia and Montenegro constitutes a serious violation of the Copenhagen criteria, might this affect relations between the European Union and Serbia, including any future partnership? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU’s heads of mission in Belgrade have been asked to draw up a report on the situation in the province with a general overview of the inter-ethnic relations and more information about recent incidents. The report by the heads of mission, published on 15 September, states that although it appears that inter-ethnic intolerance has increased, the incidents – however disquieting – have generally been on a small scale and there does not seem to be a clear trend. In the report, it is recommended that after the local elections taking place between 19 September and 3 October, a follow-up report be drawn up in due course, in the light of which the competent Council bodies will re-assess the situation. In its conclusions about the Western Balkans of 11 October 2004, the General Affairs and External Relations Council is satisfied with the undertaking given by the Serbian Government on 8 September that it will step up the dialogue with all ethnic communities, and the Council was looking forward to this undertaking being honoured.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will continue to follow the developments in this area. Respect for human rights and for the rights of minorities forms part of the EU’s fundamental values and is one of the objectives of the Union’s foreign and security policy. At present, Serbia and Montenegro have no contractual relationship with the European Union. In the coming months, the Commission will be drafting a feasibility report to find out whether it can advise the Council to open negotiations about a stabilisation and association agreement with Serbia and Montenegro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Opening of negotiations with Serbia and Montenegro for a stabilisation and association agreement</span></p>
<p class="contents">At the informal meeting of the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the European Union held in September 2004, an important decision was taken to adopt a twin-track approach in the Commission's feasibility study on Serbia and Montenegro with a view to opening negotiations for the conclusion of a European stabilisation and association agreement in accordance with the strategy adopted at the Thessaloniki European Council (June 2003).</p>
<p class="contents">However, setting the precondition of cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia creates the risk not only of a break-up of the federation but also the isolation of Serbia from the European Union despite the country's progress and the recent democratic presidential elections.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that Serbia is part of the solution to the problem and that, by helping Serbia, the EU is promoting security and stability in the wider region, what action and what decisions will the Council take to overcome the latent crisis which, if it erupts, will soon lead the Balkans into a new cycle of instability and conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At their informal meeting in early September, the EU’s Foreign Affairs Ministers adopted a twin-track approach with regard to Serbia and Montenegro which will entail one blanket stabilisation and association agreement with two differently negotiated protocols on trade, customs and other sectoral areas of policy, which clearly fall within the remit of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro. That was a positive gesture towards Serbia and Montenegro. At the same time, the Foreign Affairs Ministers decided in favour of enforcing political conditions, including compliance with all international obligations, including those in respect of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, or ICTY.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union would therefore ask all countries of the Western Balkans to cooperate with the ICTY as a token of their willingness to meet their international obligations and respect the principle of rule of law, the latter being one of the cornerstones on which the Union is founded in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. The leaders of those countries have promised to cooperate with the ICTY on several occasions, including during the Forum of the Western Balkans on 9 December 2003, which brought the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the European Union and of the region together. Moreover, the competent political leaders in Serbia and Montenegro, including the Presidents of the Union of States and of the two republics, as well as the Foreign Affairs Minister of Serbia and Montenegro have clearly spoken in favour of cooperation with the ICTY. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Demonstration by 'Grey Wolves' against the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople</span></p>
<p class="contents">In Turkey, hundreds of nationalist members of the paramilitary organisation the 'Grey Wolves' held a heated demonstration outside the Ecumenical Patriarchate, throwing stones and pieces of wood, after which they hanged and burned an effigy of a Greek priest. These events took place on the eve of the tragic anniversary of 6 September 1955 when a major pogrom was carried out against the Patriarchate and the Greeks of Istanbul. The Turkish police did, however, take the necessary measures to prevent the worst.</p>
<p class="contents">What representations will the Council make to the Turkish Government to prevent the occurrence of similar events in the future? Has the Turkish Government committed itself to the reopening of the Halki School of Theology? What measures will the Council take to persuade the Turkish Government to recognise the legal personality of the Patriarchate and the rights associated with the management of its property?</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Relations with Turkey</span></p>
<p class="contents">Violations of the Christian minority's human rights persist. The rights of individuals freely to practise their religion and use their own language are, in practice, restricted. Old churches and monasteries fall into ruin or are deliberately destroyed. The Turkish authorities continue to deny the genocide of Armenians and Syrians at the beginning of the previous century.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Council intend to raise the question of the oppression of Armenians and Syrians in Turkey in its contacts with that country with its possible membership of the EU in view?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 5 by Antonios Trakatellis (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2004-0329_EN.html">H-0329/04</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Respect for religious freedom in Turkey</span></p>
<p class="contents">The protection of fundamental rights is a founding principle of the Union and an essential condition of its legitimacy. In external relations, respect for fundamental rights is a categorical condition of candidate countries' accession to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of Commissioner Verheugen's answer to my previous question, No <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2000-3014_EN.html">E-3014/00</a><a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, in which he stated that 'Respect for religious freedom is indeed one of the Copenhagen criteria that all candidate countries must fulfil before accession negotiations can get under way', will the Council say whether Turkey has complied with the criteria set out in Parliament's resolution <a href="/doceo/document/TA-5-2004-0274_EN.html">P5_TA-PROV(2004)0274</a>, with particular regard to the violations of the principle of religious freedom in Turkey (paragraph 36 of the resolution)? Can the Council take a decision on a definite date for opening negotiations with Turkey before such violations, e.g. the failure to reopen the Halki School of Theology, have been eliminated and Turkey has also complied with the criteria set out in the memorandum of the Greek Orthodox, Syrian, Armenian and Roman Catholic churches submitted to the Human Rights Committee of the Turkish National Assembly? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In line with that priority, Turkey must create conditions corresponding to those in the EU Member States, so as to ensure that non-Muslim religious communities can function. This also comprises the use of ownership rights in accordance with Protocol No 1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Council is fully aware that non-Muslim religious communities, including the Ecumenical Patriarchate, continue to experience problems. Although some progress has been made in this area, various problems, particularly the problem of the legal position of non-Muslim religious communities and the registration of ownership, have not so far been resolved. Comprehensive new legislation is still being drafted. Meanwhile, the government is trying to find <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> solutions to most of the critical problems. In this context, the situation concerning the reopening of the Halki School of Theology also remains shrouded in uncertainty for the time being. The Council is closely following developments with regard to freedom of religion in Turkey against the background of the Copenhagen political criteria for accession. The Union will continue to raise this issue with Turkey within the bodies of the association agreement and in the context of the political dialogue, as well as at any other suitable opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, clear that preventing or handling specific incidents, such as the protests mentioned by the honourable Member, fall within the exclusive remit of the Turkish authorities. As the honourable Member knows, the Commission accepted its recommendations concerning Turkey’s progress on the road to accession on 6 October and has recommended opening negotiations with Turkey under certain conditions. In order to guarantee the permanence and irreversibility of the political criteria, the Commission would recommend a cooperation strategy in order to strengthen and support Turkey’s reform process, particularly with regard to the sustained compliance with the political criteria of Copenhagen. The pace of the reforms will determine progress during the negotiations. With specific reference to the Armenian and Syrian minorities, the report outlines an update of the situation, which is mainly reflected in the educational systems, schoolbooks and language teaching. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means, of course, that it is still directly prohibited to mention this historical fact, namely that hundreds of thousands of Armenians were murdered in the last century in what is now Turkey.

We, that is to say you and we, but also we among ourselves, will undoubtedly be discussing at great length the steps both in the run-up to December and thereafter, as regards the issue of whether or not to open negotiations with Turkey, when to do so, and in what way.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I can take the three questions together with the response to them. The Commission has indicated – and I agree with what you have said about this – that, where the political criteria are concerned, we still have a long way to go. The Commission has indicated, though, that a start could, under certain conditions, be made on negotiations with Turkey. One of those very conditions is the entry into effect of this criminal justice system which has, in fact, been enquired about in the way the Commission has indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">What is very important – and it is clearly also important to you, to judge by your questions – is the fact that the Commission notes that once negotiations have started with Turkey, the political criteria will continue to be monitored very closely. In fact, at least that is what the Commission proposes, if disappointing developments were to be noted, for example in this very political area in which you are now expressing concerns, it should be possible to activate a so-called emergency break in the form of suspending further negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">That would be a new, more far-reaching step in the way we conduct accession processes compared to previous accession procedures. I am convinced that these proposals and suggestions on the part of the Commission can in any event set the right tone in order to accommodate the concerns that have been expressed here and also by others elsewhere, if we were to take a decision on this in December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Negotiations with Romania about Chapter 24 are still underway. In order to join the European Union, the Member States need to meet the criteria of Copenhagen in which, among others, reference is made to stable institutions that guarantee democracy, rule of law, human rights and respect for, and protection of, minorities. Given the importance that is attached to respect for the rule of law, it is obvious that the utmost importance is attached to effective, non-discriminatory law enforcement in Bulgaria and Romania, with efficient mechanisms for lodging complaints about corruption. Both countries need to accept, and implement, a timeframe for legislation, as well as other measures aimed at developing the institutional and operational capacity of the law enforcement bodies and the judiciary. Anti-corruption legislation forms part of this. To date, the Bulgarian and Romanian authorities have taken a number of specific anti-corruption measures, the implementation of which is being monitored by both the Council and the Commission, which will continue to monitor it until the date of entry. They will, in particular, be monitored by those bodies that have been established pursuant to the Europa Agreement, namely the Association Council, the Association Committee and the subcommittees. The future European agency for external border control that is expected to be operational by 1 May 2005 will draw up, and develop, a common core curriculum for training border patrols and will provide training at European level for instructors for the Member States’ national border patrols.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in connection with the delays at the Turkish-Greek border, the Council would remind you of the decision of 29 April 2004 establishing minimum signposts at external border checkpoints. The use of these signposts is compulsory at airports. At checkpoints of their land and sea borders, Member States are entitled to guide the vehicles in separate lanes. These separate lanes are intended to simplify the control procedures and avoid unnecessary delays. This separation may also be deviated from when traffic flows at border checkpoints are temporarily disrupted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the meantime, members of the Greek ethnic minority in Dervitsani in Northern Epirus have complained that their houses were fired at by Albanians after the end of the football game in question and for days afterwards.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: European Council's position on the possible scrapping of euro coins</span></p>
<p class="contents">In various euro zone countries, a debate is in progress on the usefulness of the smallest euro coins (one and two cent). In the Netherlands and Finland, prices have already been rounded to the nearest five cents. In Belgium, the Minister for Finance is proposing to stop minting the smallest coins as from next year. A wide variety of studies have been commissioned: on the one hand, consumers are dissatisfied; on the other, business and manufacturers think that minting the coins is much too expensive. There are bound to be arguments in favour of the continued existence of the coins, and against, which need to be taken into consideration. There are bound to be benefits in terms of price stability, while costs for manufacturers, business and banks may be a drawback.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the EU may allow any Member State to act on its own initiative, which is what is happening now. Is that what the EU wants, however? Does the European Council not think that it is somewhat premature for an irreversible decision? Would it not be preferable to wait, for instance, until euro coins have been in circulation for five years? What is the Council's position on price rounding? Does the Council think that a Member State should simply be able to decide, on its own initiative, to stop minting small coins?</p>
<p class="contents">As any decision to scrap coins is a matter for the European finance ministers, what is the Council's position? Although, to the best of my knowledge, no Member State is calling for them to be scrapped, will the Dutch Presidency be calling for a clear decision from the European finance ministers or will each Member State be simply allowed to continue to muddle through? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Article 106 of the Treaty clearly defines the respective powers of the European Central Bank and the Member States with regard to the issue of euro notes and coins. Paragraph 1 stipulates that the ECB has the exclusive right to authorise the issue of bank notes. The notes are issued by the ECB and the national central banks. Paragraph 2 specifies that Member States can issue coins on two conditions. First of all, the ECB must approve the level of the issue and secondly, the issued coins must meet any other legislative measures that harmonise their nominal values and technical specifications.</p>
<p class="contents">Council Regulation No 975/98/EC determines the nominal values and technical specifications of the coins that can be issued by the Member States. It is up to the Member States to decide, within this framework, on the volume of coins they want to issue at which nominal value, with the European Central Bank’s approval being required for every issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For years, the Member States’ various competent law enforcement bodies, including police, customs and coast guards, have made every effort to prevent the import of illegal drugs into the territory of the Member States. It is of the utmost importance for those substances to be prevented from reaching the territory of the Member States. The framework decision concerning the illegal drugs trade, which will be formally adopted by the Council before long, gives the law enforcement bodies in the Member States the space they need to act effectively against the import of illegal drugs and against a whole catalogue of offences. In this connection, the EU’s drugs strategy should be mentioned; it is, as you know, the subject of discussion in the Council at present. There is agreement about the priority that is given to the implementation of existing European legal instruments where the fight against the drugs trade is central, such as the European Convention on Mutual Legal Aid in Criminal Matters, which provides for the setting-up of joint investigation teams.</p>
<p class="contents">On 2 June 2004, the Commission published a communication about the reinforcement of police and customs cooperation in the European Union. The Council’s response is included in the draft of a multi-annual programme for the area of freedom, security and justice, the so-called The Hague programme, which will be adopted by the European Council on 5 November 2004. Over the course of certainly ten years, the customs authorities in the Member States have organised joint operations every year in order to examine the smuggling of drugs, including Ecstasy, by air, land and sea. An operation focussing on the smuggling of Ecstasy by air is planned for the near future, and over 20 Member States are set to take part in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to the last question, as you know, there are far-reaching plans to improve cooperation and the exchange of information within the European Union, but the questioner was right to point out the major importance of improving cooperation with bodies outside the European Union too. Those contacts have been made, improvements are being carried out, and the honourable Member was right to mention cooperation with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Crowley was right to point out that, where the major and, indeed, increasing problem of Ecstasy consumption is concerned, it is not only a question of smuggling from outside the European Union, but also of what is happening in the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Logically, my initial response dealt with the external dimension of this discussion, but you are right that high priority should also be given to this problem internally, that is, within the European and national borders. This does not detract from the fact that, of course, cooperation within the European Union is first and foremost aimed at the cross-border issue and it is, in fact – at least that is how I understand his comment – also an appeal to national governments to shoulder their responsibilities in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The drugs strategy has been mentioned and questions have been asked about it. As it is currently the subject of discussion in the Justice and Home Affairs Council, I am unable to respond to the question about the content of this drugs strategy and the priorities which we are setting in this respect. What I can say is that the Dutch Presidency is hoping to take a decision on this subject in December’s European Council. This being the case, the European Parliament can find out about our objectives and priorities for the European drugs strategy before then. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does it consider that it would be useful for the European Commission to establish a Debt Department along the lines of the one established recently by the World Bank? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As well as national and international measures, a broad solution should be found for the debt problem of the developing countries so as to make debts bearable in the long term. In accordance with the consensus of Monterrey, which was approved by the Heads of State or Government of the members of the United Nations in March 2002, the EU recognises that permanent debt funding is of the essence for freeing up resources for private and public investments, and that the relief of foreign debt can play a crucial role when resources are freed up for activities that promote sustainable growth and development.</p>
<p class="contents">Achieving the millennium objectives for development is a core objective of the European Union and, in broader terms, of the international communities. The commitments into which the EU Member States entered at the Monterrey Conference reflect the Union’s leading role in international efforts to accomplish the millennium objectives and should find expression in the full range of the EU’s policy measures and in its decisions concerning the allocation of financial resources. In its conclusions of 14 November 2002, the Council confirmed its willingness to, and I quote ‘continue its efforts to restore the sustainability of debts in the context of the strengthened Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, so that the developing countries, particularly the poorest among them, can continue to pursue growth and development without being hindered by the burden of unsustainable debts’.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is also looking into the possibility of taking the present HIPC initiative one step further. During the high-level dialogue on development funding, which was held in New York in October 2003 in the framework of the 58th UN General Assembly, the EU urged all donor and creditor countries which had not done so, to take on their share of bilateral debt relief and to contribute to the multilateral funding of the HIPC initiative. The EU also emphasised that it is of great importance for the IMF and the World Bank to issue regular reports on whether their Member States meet their HIPC obligations, in particular with regard to Article 4 on control. It was also mooted that during the official bilateral debt rearrangement in the Club of Paris, consideration should also be given to debtor countries which meet their HIPC obligations as creditors. During the dialogue, the EU also declared itself prepared to talk with the international financial institutions and the other donors about possible changes to the way the requirements of additional debt relief, or topping up, are calculated at the end, on behalf of those HIPC countries whose debt burden is considered untenable at that time due to serious exogenous shocks. It also showed willing to study ways in which the financial gap can be plugged and at the same time to bring about a fair reduction in the burden.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the EU, HIPC countries, as well as donor and creditor countries, are all responsible for permanent debt relief in the long term. The question whether it would be a useful initiative on the part of the European Commission to set up a debt department, as the World Bank did recently, does not fall within my remit, as you will understand, but within that of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
