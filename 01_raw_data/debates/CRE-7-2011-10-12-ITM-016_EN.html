<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity to come again to the Parliament. It was only two weeks ago in Strasbourg that we discussed the situation in our Southern Neighbourhood and we felt that sense of impatience and uncertainty, that real change does takes time, and we know it will be measured in years and not in seasons. But we also recognised the importance of our continuing support and tonight we will focus on Egypt, Syria, Yemen and Bahrain where the latest events remind us of what we were saying two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin with Egypt and start by being absolutely clear that what we saw in Egypt on Sunday night was totally unacceptable. We were all shocked and appalled by the violence against a peaceful demonstration by the Coptic Christian community that led to the death of 25 people, with more than 300 injured.</p>
<p class="contents">These clashes run contrary to the whole spirit and goals of the revolution and the aspirations of all Egyptians – of all backgrounds and beliefs. They stood side by side asking for legitimate human rights after 30 years of authoritarian rule. The Egyptian uprising belongs to the whole population of Egypt. Protection of human rights is essential. I believe that is the only way to ensure that we are going to have true democracy. I made a statement calling for calm and restraint and an investigation so that those responsible for the violence can be brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I urged and I urged the authorities to protect the right to demonstrate peacefully, and the right to freedom of religion or belief – one of the most fundamental of all human rights. Yet the worst thing now would be for these tragic events to stand in the way of democracy. On the contrary, we have to learn these lessons fast. Sunday’s events should encourage the government and the ruling military council to investigate, to listen, to review the emergency law and to step up the dialogue with political representatives ahead of elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Our delegation met today with representatives from the Al-Azhar University and Mosque who can play a very important role in the dialogue between different communities. As we have said before in this House, Egypt faces its first opportunity to hold free and fair elections and we will work to help the judges and poll workers in the management of the upcoming parliamentary elections later this year.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to work both on the process towards democracy and in the relaunch of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the example of the Task Force in Tunisia last week, here we were able to bring together the international community – European institutions, Members of this House, Member States, the European Investment Bank, the Bank for Reconstruction and Development, multilateral financial institutions and, crucially, private sector companies – making sure that together we become a catalyst for quicker and more effective assistance; in Tunisia in this case, but important, of course, across the region.</p>
<p class="contents">We were able to pull together a package of EUR 4 billion over three years for Tunisia. We plan to do the same in other countries in the region where that collaborative approach can make a significant difference to the economic opportunities in those countries: Jordan, Egypt, and other countries too.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, too, that we will be able to do something for Syria in the near future, where the situation remains totally unacceptable and where we must continue pressure on the regime – bilaterally and internationally. You have noted our sanctions and their gradual expansion to include oil exports – even now, additional sanctions are under preparation.</p>
<p class="contents">You will have also seen our efforts in the UN Security Council and in the Human Rights Council. Member States worked hard in the Security Council to try to get a resolution but were unable to achieve that. I believe we have to redouble our efforts and I will be raising our concerns with our strategic partners, the United States and China, over these coming next few days.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no sign, of course, in Syria of the regime abandoning violence and repression and the risk of spiralling violence and sectarian rifts is very real. The recent incidents of targeted killings confirm this danger. That is why the unity of the people and the new political leaders on the ground is essential. We welcome all efforts by the Syrian opposition to come together. The creation of the Syrian National Council is encouraging. Inclusiveness, commitment to non-violence, human rights and democratic values are essential in that process. I believe this Parliament is unique in what it can offer to promote those values and is well placed to offer a forum for dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also seek to associate Arab countries in all of our efforts. We will remain steadfast and determined to support the people of Syria. Our sanctions are not directed against them but against the regime and those who support it, and we continue to send a message to the people of Syria that we wish to help them achieve their aspirations and will mobilise our assistance and improve our trade and economic links as soon as we see that genuine transition begin.</p>
<p class="contents">In Yemen, we wait and watch President Saleh, who has talked again about transferring power, but I am not convinced that he is listening to his people. Surely this time, he must match his words with deeds and transfer that power now. The time for empty promises is gone. The President and his family must stop holding the country’s future to ransom, not least when we look at the tragedy of the humanitarian situation: there is a great lack of fuel, power, food and water, and people face chronic malnutrition.</p>
<p class="contents">Even before the current crisis, 7.5 million people – one third of all Yemenis – did not have enough to eat. 400 000 Yemeni people are internally displaced, and the country hosts over 200 000 refugees from the Horn of Africa. How exactly that transition goes forward is for the Yemeni parties themselves to work out. But they have long ago accepted the principles of the Gulf Cooperation Council’s initiative. We have engaged at all levels, trying to facilitate peaceful solutions among the key players in Yemen. I have been working closely with the GCC and with the United States to keep a strong and united front, sequencing and coordinating our messages and actions on the ground and in our capitals.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also played a key role through the UN Human Rights Council, and will now step that up through our Member States in the UN Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, a 32-year-old Yemeni woman, Tawakkul Karman, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Her first meeting with the international community was hosted by our Head of Delegation on Sunday. He transmitted first hand my message that the prize recognises her relentless commitment to human rights, and particularly to the rights of women. Women are at the forefront of the fight against repressive regimes and they must remain central to the shaping of the reforms that follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, and finally, to Bahrain, where we have been following the situation very closely and we have made clear our views in statements and in direct talks with the Foreign Minister and with the King. This morning, the Bahraini Ambassador was called again to my services. We have adopted conclusions in the Foreign Affairs Council several times and we will not do other than continue to put the situation in the forefront of our work and of our statements.</p>
<p class="contents">Like many amongst the honourable Members here, I have spoken out against the death penalty – actually all of my life – and the harsh sentences handed down in cases connected to the recent unrest. Special courts should not be used to try civilians and I have urged the Bahraini authorities to stick to the commitments they have made and guarantee fair trials.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, I take some positive note of last week’s decision to retry in civil courts the trials against doctors and nurses accused of tending to the medical needs of those who oppose the regime. That request, from us, was heard, but now surely civilian courts should move to drop all charges.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision should be extended to all civilians tried in the Security Courts. About 60 more civilians, aside from those medical personnel, have been sentenced in these courts.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of this month, the International Commission investigating the human rights violations will deliver its report. All the documented allegations must be followed up properly – whoever the presumed perpetrator is.</p>
<p class="contents">Our members have also led the way in Geneva to try to secure follow-up to this Independent Commission’s findings in the Human Rights Council, and to allow the High Commissioner’s Office to visit. On both fronts, I have to say, the Bahraini authorities have chosen to remain evasive.</p>
<p class="contents">The investigations should change the political climate and should encourage reconciliation. There needs to be far more and better dialogue between the authorities and the opposition. The authorities should, in my view, inject confidence into this process so that those groups with a legitimate grievance can come to the table.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say though, that without dialogue, without real dialogue and real reforms, there can be no long-term, sustainable solutions to the challenges that are faced in Bahrain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was an awakening of freedom, of the safeguarding of human dignity, human rights and democracy; yet now we are looking at Egypt with concern.</p>
<p class="contents">As Baroness Ashton has just said, reports of many Copts and Christians having died – possibly even having been murdered – must necessarily give rise to great concern. We need to cry out to the countries of the Arab revolution, of the uprisings, and tell them to protect their minorities – because if minorities are not protected, then in the end, it will be their own freedom that is the target.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must call on Field Marshal Tantawi and his government to have these incidents investigated and to ensure that those who simply drove their vehicles over people are brought to trial and sentenced – even if they are soldiers. Anyone who has exercised violence must receive the proper punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not make the mistake whereby, because there is increased violence in some Arab states, we forget the many millions who are championing freedom, democracy, peace and dialogue between cultures. Those taking part in Sunday’s demonstrations included not only 100 000 Coptic Christians, but also Muslims. They were demonstrating peacefully with the Christians. Let us not forget, therefore, that millions of peaceable Muslims have a desire for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2008, the Grand Mufti of Syria, Ahmad Hassoun, visited the European Parliament. He gave a remarkable speech. He is undoubtedly also a man who is to be considered as being close to the criminal system of President Assad, who should resign. Now, however, the youngest son of this Grand Mufti, who is undoubtedly innocent, has also been brutally murdered – possibly by fundamentalists. In other words, the Muslims are paying the price too. That is why we must work towards achieving tolerance for all, and we should continue to support the movement for democracy in Arab countries with all our strength. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This topic features in almost every session of the European Parliament. We debate it, put forward solutions and call for action from the Commission, the Council and you personally. We greatly appreciate your speedy responses and the clear views you express. However, we have to admit that things are not changing at all for the better; quite the opposite in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Syria is gradually starting to get out of control. The resistance is becoming increasingly violent. The regime in Damascus clearly has no intention of stopping the violence and initiating rapid political reforms. On the contrary, it is even threatening to stir up a large-scale regional conflict which it wants to draw Israel and Iran into. Such behaviour always conveys weakness and uneasiness, which do not bode well for either the Syrian people or the region as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Processes are going on in Egypt which inspire mixed feelings. On the one hand, Egypt is approaching its first democratic elections, while international observers were not invited. Regardless of the official explanation for this, this is not a good sign. There are growing trends which may stymie the advance towards democracy from Tahrir Square. Inter-religious tension is nothing new, but instead of religious freedom being guaranteed, the conflicts are growing. The involvement of the security forces in what we can only describe as a massacre on Sunday is extremely alarming.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on you, Baroness Ashton, to insist on a full investigation into the events, as you stated, as well as on punishment and prosecution for the guilty parties, and new guarantees from the authorities in Egypt that the rights of minorities, including religious minorities, will be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we need to seek clearer support and commitment from our strategic partners with designs on a global role, such as Russia and China, as well as from EU membership candidate countries. I am thinking of Turkey, which should get involved more actively in joint actions carried out by the European Union and its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not ask any questions, but I would like you to take the opportunity of being present here to tell us whether there are other steps which the European Parliament can take to support your efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We debated a wide variety of demands, which differ from country to country. From your comments here, I understand that you are looking in detail at essentially the same things as we have been hearing about.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore simply like to emphasise here how essential it is that the EU supports the efforts of civil society in particular, and supports those working for non-violent change.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned that you are encouraging dialogue with civil society in Bahrain. We heard this too, but we also heard that, although representatives of civil society believe in reform, they do not think it likely that a serious dialogue will take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Within civil society, it is also important that the EU should stand up for women and their organisations. The fact that they exist, and are active, was shown by the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Tawakkul Karman, a Yemeni woman who founded the association ‘Journalists Without Chains’ back in 2006 and has been mobilising civil protests in Yemen since the beginning of this year. I am pleased that – as you mentioned, Baroness Ashton – the EU delegation in Yemen has already been in contact with her. The award of the prize does not just honour a woman who works hard for gender equality as a Muslim woman in a society heavily dominated by men; at the same time, the Nobel Committee has sent out an important signal that the fight for women’s rights and liberation must play a central part in the Arab uprisings. Any government that comes to power in the wake of the changes in society must work towards this. I hope that the EU will promote this as much as it can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all hope in this House that Sirte falls soon to the Transitional National Council.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the most recent reports coming from Egypt of the deaths of dozens of Coptic Christians, who were protesting peacefully and killed as a result of a brutal overreaction by the security forces, are shocking and need investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is concern both in Tunisia and in Egypt over the rise of hard-line Salafist influences now, and therefore in my view, the more moderate Islamist elements of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt need engaging with and need to be made to understand that they must pledge to respect international obligations made by Egypt on human rights if they are elected to power.</p>
<p class="contents">The brutal repression of the Syrian uprising by contrast has led tragically to 3 000 deaths so far, with President Assad sadly refusing to go and appealing to minorities such as his own set, the Alawites, and the Christians to resist the Sunni-led insurgency. The EU must now support the freezing of Syrian assets in Europe, ban oil imports and lean more on Russia and China in the Security Council for support with the hope of speeding up the Syrian National Council’s bid to topple the Ba’athist regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Yemen’s traditional alliance with the US against al-Qaeda is laudable but the regime is authoritarian. Street protestors have called for UN aid in forcing Ali Abdullah Saleh from power now, but the ECR welcomes the fact that the cases of medics jailed in Bahrain, for instance, for treating injured protestors are now due to be reviewed, which will give some credibility to the Bahraini Monarchy’s quest for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECR calls on the EU to mobilise all available means to the Middle East and North African countries, including direct aid and loan finance for investment, but conditional on respect for human rights and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, our political parties here in this House must share their experience in order to establish secular, democratic choices for the people of that region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we are always trying to keep pace with what is happening and responding to things event by event, and in doing so we are losing some of our perspective on the situation as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that every case is different, and every country that we are discussing here is a specific case, but forgive me for saying, Baroness Ashton, that it seems to me that it is difficult to discern the criteria that the European Union has been using for its actions in each case. I am afraid that we are often hostage to the interests of the Member States, or rather some of the Member States, but not all of them. That is why we have used and continue to use the phrase ‘double standards’ so much. Sometimes it is ‘yes’ to sanctions, sometimes ‘no’; sometimes intervention extends to bombing, as in the case of Libya, while sometimes the response is total silence, as in the case of the invasion of Bahrain by Saudi Arabian forces. Baroness Ashton, let me say that I have studied all the cases carefully and I have not seen a single declaration from the European institutions condemning the invasion of Bahrain by Saudi Arabian forces.</p>
<p class="contents">There are people being sentenced to death, non-stop violence, and doctors and nurses sentenced to up to 30 years in prison by a military tribunal because they were supposedly acting against the regime and should not have helped the injured who needed their aid. We have responded to the dictatorial monarchy in Bahrain and the dictatorial regime in Yemen – the Saleh regime – with far more silence than action. I am not in favour of intervention – I never have been – but I fear that, seen from the outside, we are putting ourselves in an untenable position when, instead of assisting the development, and democratic and revolutionary aspirations of the peoples of the Arab countries, and helping the Arab Spring, we are hindering its progress either by too much action or by too little, and I do not believe that this state of affairs should be allowed to continue.</p>

<p class="contents">Quite apart from the difficulties faced by the Copts when they request authorisation to build a church, according to a law dating back to the Ottoman Empire, there are an increasing number of attacks on Christians by Muslim extremists. The protests, instead of being guaranteed by the military authorities in power in Egypt, are being repressed with bloodshed. Paradoxically, these religious conflicts and these repressions were less frequent at the time of President Mubarak.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are other worrying signs which are disappointing for the expectations of the so-called Arab Spring. I am referring to the attack on the Israeli embassy and the subsequent withdrawal of the ambassador, the attacks on the gas pipelines in the Sinai, the requests by some political parties to revise the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel and, finally, the huge advances being made by Islamist parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the EU has rightly strengthened its political and financial support for Egypt, would it not be appropriate to apply the Füle-Ashton doctrine of ‘more for more’, and therefore also of ‘less for less’, by directing aid to those political, social and trade union organisations that promote democracy and stability in Egypt? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, we know how important freedom of demonstration and expression is.</p>
<p class="contents">The seriousness of what happened on 9 October 2011 in Cairo lies in the fact that disproportionate force was used against demonstrators who were part of a minority demanding protection for their religious freedom. There needs to be a rigorous investigation into what took place, and the guilty parties should be punished, as Mr Pöttering quite rightly said.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Ashton, religious freedom must be protected, and all countries must respect it, as this Parliament called for in its resolution of 20 January 2011. We want an Egypt of freedom, justice and peace; an Egypt that keeps its distance from events such as these.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, Egypt is a great country and a leader in the Arab world: what goes on there has major repercussions. Recent events cannot happen again. Egypt should be an example of tolerance and harmony, not one of violence and violated freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should do its utmost to see that freedoms are respected during the transitions taking place in the Arab world, which we wish to promote and accompany.

As a European Union, we must heed the failure of the latest session of the UN Human Rights Council to agree the decisive action needed to provide real protection and support for the region’s democracy protestors.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Yemen, where the situation is deteriorating, full military force is now being used against peaceful protestors, yet the resolution passed in the UN fails to form any conclusion about responsibility for rights violations or to back the High Commissioner’s request to establish a presence in that country. We must heed, too, the new evidence from the World Food Programme of the starvation and hunger affecting that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Syria, we should note the formation of the new opposition Syrian National Council and that the High Commissioner again called for referrals to the International Criminal Court, which were not backed in the UN. Interestingly, Egypt, as well as Russia and China, sought to obstruct the commission of inquiry that was set up.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Egypt, I join with others in this debate to condemn the violence, with witness statements showing that security forces opened fire on protestors and ran them over in armoured cars. I myself have told the Egyptian Ambassador that I was present in Cairo for the constitutional referendum and welcomed the warmth and affection shown by people experiencing their first taste of genuine democracy, so I just do not accept that public opposition is a barrier to the EU mounting an electoral mission which could help entrench that democracy for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would hope that Vice-President/High Representative Ashton will also comment, in her winding-up, on the report from Amnesty International which states that peaceful protestors outside Syrian embassies in our own countries – France, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the UK – have been threatened, intimidated and physically attacked by individuals believed to be connected to the Syrian regime. In the UN, we can do better to protect civilians in the Arab World. Here in the European Union itself, we have no excuse not to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

High Representative, I believe that this week’s statements on Bahrain, Syria and the violence in Egypt were very good, but what actions will now back up those words? The EU can seek stronger overlap between values and interests, but not if it continues to navel-gaze or fragment.</p>
<p class="contents">We should leverage the impact of our single market to make it work for stability, growth and the defence of human rights. Obama has announced oil sanctions for Syria. While the EU is Syria’s main trading partner, it was unable to unite or to lead in this issue. Looking inward also hurts our relationship with Turkey, while we need to cooperate and engage on North Africa and the Middle East in a more intensive way.</p>
<p class="contents">We are largely failing our neighbours and the next generation, and with that our own interests. The Arab Spring is turning into a winter and we must stand more closely with those people and their future. In Egypt, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces is behaving no differently than the Mubarak regime was. Citizens are tried in military courts for blogging – like Maikel Nabil – or for speaking out – like Asmaa Mahfouz. What concrete actions will the EU take to invest in a truly new Egypt?</p>
<p class="contents">In Syria, an illegitimate government continues to kill people, and there are now threats to Europe concerning that might happen to us if we recognise the Opposition Council. Those threats were made, Mr Pöttering, by the Grand Mufti, and Syrians in the EU are also facing threats. It is up to the Syrian people to determine their own future, but we must protect their human rights and we are not doing enough. More pressure, and giving a clear choice to the economic elites that doing business with al-Assad means no business with Europe would be a good start. Let me specifically highlight the need to ban the export of surveillance, security and censoring technologies to countries that use them to violate human rights. In Bahrain, the prosecution of doctors in military courts for treating people indiscriminately shows disregard for human life. The world unitedly condemns that in the strongest terms. I also wanted to highlight the case of two bloggers that are imprisoned in Bahrain – Abduljalil al-Singace and Ali Abdulemam. Please highlight their cases too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not because we are fighting tyranny in those countries – it is the peoples of the countries themselves that are doing that – but because we have a stronger enemy to fight, namely, our own past of complicity and collaboration with authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the case with Syria where, only a little while ago, we were working to open up relations with the regime and its police state, where we did not do enough to help the refugees in the country, and where we are not doing enough now to put pressure on Turkey to recognise refugees arriving in Turkey from Syria. It is also the case with Egypt, where we are once again stumbling into the same trap of falling into the arms of the military because of potential sectarian violence. It is important to investigate exactly what has happened, because the military regime may have a hand in the sectarian violence in Egypt and across the Arabian Peninsula, in Bahrain and Yemen; and frankly, Baroness Ashton, much more is needed than simply calling up the Ambassador of Bahrain. The Ambassador of Bahrain had the nerve to tell us, in this House, that the doctors being detained were not arrested for treating protestors, but for being in the hospital outside office hours. It is also necessary to speak with Saudi Arabia, and that is much more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to conclude by saying one last thing: it was the Arab Spring that brought about the release of the soldier Gilad Shalit, which you welcomed, Baroness Ashton: you should also have welcomed the release of Marwan Barghouti and of more than 1 000 Palestinians. The Arab Spring is bringing about change in that part of the world and is our greatest challenge at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union must act quickly and unequivocally on this. Our economic and political support should be clearly directed only at democratic forces. We must oppose the references to sharia law in the Egyptian Constitution. Elections in Egypt should be held after changes have been made to the constitution and should last for one day across the whole country in order to avoid falsification and intimidation.

Madam High Representative, as Chair of the Delegation for relations with Israel, I wholeheartedly join you in expressing good wishes to the parents of Gilad Shalit, now that he will shortly be released after five years of imprisonment and total isolation. That makes this a day to remember.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Egyptian newspaper <span class="italic">Al-Masry Al-Youm</span> has touchingly and accurately reported on the totally unexpected bloodbath involving peaceful Christian protesters which was caused by the Egyptian army on Sunday evening in Cairo. In a telephone conversation last night, I learned of the deep shock of the Copts and Christians of other denominations. In post-Mubarak Egypt, the government’s appalling failure to protect these people from the aggression of militant Islamists has already become a shocking fact.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the future prospects of Egyptian Christians could become still grimmer. We have evidence of that from the ominous events of the beginning of this week.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam High Representative, it is my hope that you will make every effort to ensure a genuinely independent and thorough public investigation into Sunday evening’s terrifying, deadly escalation of violence. At the same time, I expect the European Union to take a strong, clear position against the frequent daily social discrimination against the Christian minority in Egypt. After all, for them, for that minority, the proverbial Arab Spring is yet to dawn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This community has been trying to reach us by various means and tell us what is going on there. I have received photographs, for example, from this community – there are only 30 young girls here who have disappeared and whose whereabouts are not known. These communities say the girls have been kidnapped, and they say there are more cases like this. However, we are also faced with this recent massacre, which confirms that the situation for these minorities in Egypt is deteriorating. On the other hand, elections are to be held there very soon, and we are also sure that a new constitution is going to be drafted too.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is a moment at which we parliamentarians – as an international community and as the European Parliament – should react, so that the changes which are taking place there meet our expectations of those new democracies. If we are to support them, we should support them in a way which ensures that standards concerning minorities – and they are indigenous minorities – are also respected. This applies to all the countries about which Ms Ashton spoke today.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the opinion that tragic events should not slow down the progress of democracy in Egypt or in other countries in the region. However, if we do not react as an international community, it will be very difficult to achieve the standards we expect there. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will concentrate on Bahrain because I travelled to Bahrain a few weeks ago with a number of Irish medics and with the human rights organisation, Front Line.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific connection was that a number of the medics who had been imprisoned had trained in Ireland and worked in Dublin. The Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin also have a huge facility in Bahrain and indeed they trained many of the doctors who were imprisoned. In this context, I believe the College of Surgeons cannot continue to sit on the fence because they must do something about the totally unacceptable breaches of medical neutrality. They have a duty of care to their former students and also to the medical profession as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to echo your words, Vice-President/High Representative, when you say that the civilian courts should now move to drop all charges. The Bahraini authorities cannot seek to legitimise the entire process simply by changing from military to civilian courts. Yes, it may look positive, and it is, but only on the surface. The arrests of the medics and the subsequent and well supported allegations of torture, with no access to family members or to legal advisers, cannot be legitimised, and all charges must be dropped.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have the situation where there are at least 80 people who remain in prison. Furthermore I would like to draw your attention to an extremely serious situation where a number of prisoners, including a man called Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, are on hunger strike. Again, I mention Abdulhadi because he worked with the Front Line human rights organisation in Dublin and was arrested when he returned to Bahrain. He is on hunger strike protesting at the severe mistreatment of a number of women who protested in the City Centre Mall. Vice-President/High Representative Ashton, I agree with you: real dialogue and real reforms are the only ways to achieve a long-term, sustainable solution in Bahrain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will cast serious doubts on the democratic prospects for Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">Copts are among the oldest inhabitants of this ancient country and they participated actively, and in a spirit of solidarity, in demonstrations that put an end to the previous regime. The Egyptian revolution is – as you put it, Baroness Ashton – owned by all its citizens, including Copts. Now our External Action Service has to address this problem in a very forceful way, and I think we need to remind the new regimes that the basic criterion for democracy remains the establishment of secular constitutionalism. We need to indicate clearly that founding the constitutions of the revolutionary Arab countries on Sharia law is bound to legalise ongoing discrimination and the persecution of minorities. Democracy and human rights will not triumph if the constitutional starting point for the new regimes is fundamentally tilted in favour of a single dominant tradition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are now discussing North Africa and, more specifically, certain countries in North Africa. The Coptic minority group is found in Egypt, but we know that there are more minority groups, and it is important that we do not only talk about this on one occasion but that this voice is heard continuously and relentlessly. This is, incidentally, also what is required and expected of us by the Treaty of Lisbon. Human rights and freedoms are not something that we should impose on these countries, but rather something that should elevate them.</p>
<p class="contents">I also cannot help but recall what happened when Saudi troops were called into Bahrain. It was actually embarrassing, not to mention shameful, to see the Saudi troops and the tanks come in and mow down people who had a hunger and thirst for freedom, in view of the fact that it was us in the West, if by the West we mean the US and Europe, that had equipped these troops with tanks and weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">We did this because we put stability before democracy, and I believe that this has to be a lesson for us going forward: not to attach so much importance to stability that we accept the trampling underfoot of democracy or that democracy is not called attention to loudly and clearly enough. That is something that we have not done, but that must now be given consideration and be the order of the day in future, too. Oil was present in Saudi Arabia, and it is still there, but democracy must also take root in the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with you that the case must be investigated and the guilty parties brought to trial. As this is not the only outrage against the Copts, however, that will not suffice. Political action is required. I would like to ask you to issue a strong warning to the Egyptian leader that European support will be strictly conditional on securing genuine religious freedom, and that Islamisation accompanied by attacks on the Copts is a crime against which EU leaders must come out strongly, rejecting a relativistic approach.

It is not enough just to respond to current events. It is not enough just to call on all parties in Yemen to do everything possible for a peaceful political transformation. It is not enough to express shock at the unacceptable humanitarian situation in the country. The Union must have the ambition to take more vigorous steps towards ending the drama in Yemen.

I think there is a very clear message coming out from this Parliament tonight concerning the fundamental relationship between the countries in transition and their people and the need to protect human rights. In that context, I am pleased to associate myself with all that has been said about the need to ensure that freedom of expression and freedom of religion and belief should be at the heart of the values held in each of the countries we have been discussing this evening – especially so in the light of the difficult situations and the violence we have seen in Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with what has been said about the need to continue our engagement with civil society in the four countries we have been discussing this evening. That is something that we put – and that I put – at the forefront of the work of our delegations and of my own work. It is an enormous pleasure to meet those brave people, many of them women, who have been at the forefront of change and who are seeking the kind of society and the kind of freedoms they see that we in the European Union enjoy. We know that, if we can work collaboratively with them, we can help to engage in that process.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe, as I said earlier tonight, that there is a very special role for this House to play in that process, and I urge all the honourable Members to take up that challenge too, and be willing to engage with civil society – engage with those looking for a new political process, engage with those who are looking for what I have described as ‘deep democracy’ – and offer them your support.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that, in our new strategy for our neighbourhood, the ideas of mutual accountability and ‘more for more’ are really significant. They enable us to support those moving forward on reform, those in civil society and those local organisations and ordinary people who are willing their leadership on to change, and also to support those who are privileged to serve in leadership positions who likewise choose to move forward with reform, to support the economy and the kind of democratic institutions and deep democracy that we wish to see, and to keep that idea of accountability in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">We are responsible to the people for delivering what we say we will deliver; those in leadership are responsible for doing what they said they were going to do; and that mutual accountability should, I believe, govern the relationship we have with these countries across our neighbourhood into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I have put out 11 statements on Bahrain, I have put out a number of statements on other countries, and I understand the frustration of feeling that sometimes we use words when we need to seek action. That is also why we need to keep working in the Human Rights Council and in the Security Council, supporting our colleagues in civil society who are seeking change, and making not just statements but also contacts and links in order to say what we know to be true. In Bahrain, that means saying that those who offer medical care should be treated as the heroes and heroines they are, and should not be treated badly by the regime. In Syria, it means saying that those who are trying to come together to provide alternative leadership need to be supported in doing so. In Yemen, it means saying that those who wish to see President Saleh finally do what he said he would also need to be supported, not just with the humanitarian aid we have provided, but also with the full range of support which we can offer.</p>

Their crimes were no more than to treat injured demonstrators who were brought to the hospital, and to protest to the Minister of Health at the refusal to send ambulances to collect the injured. There are also serious and credible allegations of torture. Among the doctors and nurses currently on trial are three doctors who studied at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dr Ali Al Ekri, Dr Basim Daif and Dr Ghassan Daif. All three were arbitrarily detained, held incommunicado in detention, reportedly tortured, denied access to their families for two months and forced to ‘confess’ under duress. These ‘confessions’ were videotaped while they were blindfolded and are being used in evidence against them. The EU must do everything in its power to ensure that the Bahraini authorities: release all human rights defenders currently in detention; drop the charges against all 47 doctors, nurses and technicians; overturn the conviction of human rights defenders; end the unfair trials; and bring those responsible for torture to justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The repression of legitimate popular outrage is still one of the few certainties in Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">Egyptian social and political bodies have been warning that the situation in the country has been worsening day by day since the referendum in which the military claims to have legitimised its rule. The protesters decry the limits on freedom, the criminalisation of protests, violence by the civilian and military police, the trying of civilians in military courts, and the reactionary militias. They also complain of the government’s refusal to increase the minimum wage and impose a maximum income, at the same time as it is raising prices and insisting on selling national resources such as gas cheaply. In this context, it is crucial that the EU change the attitude of complacency and complicity towards the Mubarak regime – clearly evident in the partnerships and agreements concluded – that it maintained over almost two decades, despite frequent complaints from various organisations about the regime’s brutality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After 1939, he was responsible for mass deportations and executions of Polish, Czech, and later French and Balkan Jews. He is notorious for his role as executioner of Slovakian and Bulgarian Jews. He was wanted by the international bodies after the war but escaped punishment for his crimes against humanity. Alois Brunner managed to hide in Syria where he set about creating and building the Assad regime’s security forces. A Nazi criminal, responsible for murdering hundreds of thousands of Europeans, was the founding father of the forces that are now bringing bloodshed to the streets of Hims, Hama, Damascus, Latakia and many other Syrian towns and cities. Repressions and brutal torture are used against the old and the young, men and women alike. Having regained a new city, the army proceeds to cleanse it by capturing those involved in protests. Many of those arrested will never come back, and the bodies which have been found have been stripped of internal organs, which are cut out for the organ trade. According to Israeli sources, the organs are then transported to transplant centres in Turkey. In response to events in Syria, the entire European Union must speak today with one voice – that of condemnation. When demonstrations were going on in Libya, the decision to establish a no-fly zone was taken rapidly. However, while the Assad regime is murdering Syrian people, the world is silent and looks away. Europe must aim for peace in Syria at any cost and exert pressure on President Assad to introduce reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thousands of people have lost their lives in riots, and even more have been injured. At present, the situation leaves no doubt as to the brutal nature of the conflict, as is illustrated by an incident which took place a few days ago, in which men paid by the President of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, used stones and bottles to attack a rally celebrating the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Yemeni journalist, Tawakkul Karman, leaving 40 women injured.</p>
<p class="contents">The state of emergency declared in both countries is interfering with the functioning of these states at all levels. Human rights are being violated. Therefore, it is imperative that a solution to the conflict between the authorities and the opposition is reached. Peace must be established and a settlement between the parties needs to be agreed. The government’s attacks against the civilian population must be brought to an end. I call on the Yemeni and Bahraini authorities to resolve the conflict peacefully and to respect the rights and freedoms of its citizens. Al-Qaeda’s activities in these territories are also of concern, such as the attack on Yemen’s defence minister, the commander of a military offensive against al-Qaeda. The fight to oppose terrorism and bring security to this part of the world should be conducted with full respect for the principles of human rights. We should call for an end to arbitrary beatings and arrests. The European Union can play a significant role here by stressing the need for effective implementation of a variety of political initiatives aimed at supporting pro-democratic reform in Arab countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are waiting expectantly for the elections in Egypt on 28 November, hoping for the development of stability and democracy in that country. However, trends in recent months, such as the arrest of civilians and the fact that they are being prosecuted before military tribunals, the recent clash with Christian protesters and attacks on the Israeli embassy, demonstrate that tension is growing. Consciously or not, the division of Egypt is escalating. The current leadership must guarantee the fundamental rights of all Egyptians, including religious minorities, and address the issue of tension among religious communities. We must find out who was responsible for the deaths of 25 protesters in the recent clashes and prosecute those guilty. The special situation in Egypt still applies, with restrictions on the media and freedom of association. Unfortunately, under such conditions, it is hard to imagine the country being ready for democratic elections.
