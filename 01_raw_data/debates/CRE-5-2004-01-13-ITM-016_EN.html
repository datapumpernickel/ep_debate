<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prets (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is difficult to define cultural diversity, a concept just as complicated and complex as that of culture itself. Cultures are constantly subject to a changing and moving process and this dynamism is an impulse for human progress. Nevertheless, we shall have to produce a formal definition of cultural policy, cultural goods and services, and of course cultural diversity, particularly in connection with agreements under the aegis of international organisations like the WTO or the proposed international instrument on cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">In a Eurobarometer survey on enlargement in April 2003, Europe’s citizens described culture as one of the major winners in the enlargement process, alongside environment and trade. This testifies to the international organisations’ commitment to safeguarding and promoting cultural diversity. Cultural diversity forms an integral part of the European Union’s identity, and will include other cultures after the accession of the new countries. The EU’s external borders are shifting towards a faultline with very different cultural regions. From 2004, the European Union will be the direct neighbour of Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova. Parallels and similarities can be identified despite the existing differences, which can be explained through migration and intercultural dialogue. The aim, especially in view of enlargement, is to create stronger relations among both minority and marginalised cultures and stronger cultures so that no cultural conflict occurs, but instead cultural dialogue promotes mutual understanding in the interests of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Safeguarding cultural diversity does not mean fencing it in and preserving it. It means opening it up, offering individual development and marketing opportunities without subjecting it to current market mechanisms. It is the basic pillar for identity and an economic factor at the same time. This means that we must work not only to protect but also to promote cultural diversity. We must place it in an international context so that exchange, development and dialogue can take place. For example, the music and film industries appear to be very lucrative sectors in the context of international trade, especially if we look more closely at the market share of films in the European Union in 2000: American films accounted for 73%, national films in the home country 15%, and national films outside the home country 8%.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people only became aware of the Commission’s negotiations in the WTO framework through the Stop GATS campaign. Due to their lack of transparency, these negotiations caused a great deal of upset and were thus the focus of public attention. This lack of transparency has also caused doubts and fears that liberalisation is going too far, and has reinforced the view among cultural actors that the goal of international competitiveness takes precedence over the defence of cultural diversity. Cultural services and products are still exempt from trade liberalisation at present, but this is not secure in the long term. Public education systems currently also fall outside the scope of GATS. This must continue in order to safeguard free access, equal opportunities and quality. Privately financed education markets have largely been liberalised.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are demanding is that there should be no more forced liberalisation in this area. We must prevent the goal of international competitiveness from negatively impacting on cultural diversity. That means that the protection of funding instruments and therefore of cultural diversity should not be achieved within the WTO and GATS, but through the adoption of a Convention on Cultural Diversity in the framework of UNESCO. It is gratifying that UNESCO has decided, by a large majority, to launch work towards the elaboration of a draft Convention, and I hope that this will proceed very swiftly, for we need a decision very quickly here. Promotion – as well as protection – is essential, as I have already said, to maintain cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">European cultural policy must go hand in hand with pro-active and autonomous national cultural policies and indeed, in some areas, greater decentralisation in the regions and municipalities. The different levels should not replace but must complement each other. The internal market and hence the free trade in services must not take precedence over national funding mechanisms. Through greater cooperation between international organisations, the unique character of cultures worldwide should be safeguarded and promoted.</p>

It forms part of a long chain of ideas which supplement, repeat and strengthen each other. That is precisely why reports such as this one are so important, because each time they recall us to order and show us that Parliament is present, that it is keeping its eye on things and that it is not going to fall asleep on the job. It is ensuring that cultural diversity is a fundamental part of the European Union’s internal and external policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Prets for this report, which is in line with what the European Parliament, the mouthpiece of European citizens, has always wanted. You are right, Mrs Prets: cultural diversity is a fight, a fight in our everyday lives, and we are not fighting it alone: we need allies. On this point I welcome the continuous and long-standing support of the European Parliament, support which warms my heart and which never weakens, and support which helps the Commission to make progress in its actions aimed at implementing the Treaty in the area of cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, Madam President, the Prets report invites us to think about what is at stake. There are many things at stake, and Mrs Prets has listed them. First of all there are national policies, with increasingly difficult budgets admittedly, but it is essential that a part of those budgets should continue to be allocated to culture, to its diversity, and to the protection, particularly in the context of cultural production, to those who are weakest, so that our great cultural wealth here in Europe can continue to survive. Then there are our foreign policies, and I welcome, as you all do, the fact that we have just won this battle at international level – and it is only a battle, not the whole war – in managing to persuade the majority of the nations of the world to follow us in our fight so that, with regard to international trade as well, we can preserve our cultural stakes. We do indeed need principles to follow if the Union’s action, both within and beyond its borders, is to reflect our commitment to that cultural diversity which is our source of life.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this process, which is absolutely unique in Europe, and which we must have invented because it would not have been possible to copy it since it did not yet exist anywhere else, has served as an example throughout the world. I often hear that sentiment expressed on my travels to various countries, large or small, where people say to me, ‘The way in which you protect your minorities and support your cultures, whether large or small, important or less important, is leading the way for us to follow’. What better thing could we give to the world than to show it the way to preserve cultural heritage, to preserve what is most important to people, a way that involves a willingness to give priority to our hearts rather than to the market.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what it is all about, preserving our traditions, our cultures, our future talents, our young people seeking to express themselves. We must preserve them so that those young people can continue to express themselves in the future. It is this human dimension of the policy that we must strengthen, at local, regional, national and international level, because cultural diversity, ladies and gentlemen, is universal: we cannot talk about ‘my cultural diversity’ because cultural diversity is also the cultural diversity of other people, people who, as a general rule, are unable to express themselves unless we help them to express themselves. I also believe that it is important that this report on cultural diversity comes just after a report on development aid. It is a fitting symbol, because development aid is also a form of assistance which helps to preserve the culture of those who do not have the means of preserving it themselves. Therefore our universal action in this direction is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that within the Union we should preserve our capacity to support our diverse cultures by means of local, regional, national and European funding, and the Commission is committed to the full implementation of Article 151(4), which makes it compulsory to take into account, horizontally, the cultural diversity within all the other cultures. I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that it has become a reflex action for the Commission, even for those Commissioners who have responsibilities in sectors such as the economy, external trade or international affairs, to take into consideration the fact that cultural diversity is a part of our lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, our action, in this sense, is very important, and we shall not be sparing in our efforts here. I do not have sufficient human resources to undertake to make reports on what we are doing. I prefer to invest what human resources I do have in taking action rather than in commenting on possible action. That is why I shall not be able to issue any supplementary reports. However, we are in the process of drawing up a report on cultural expenditure in the context of the Structural Funds. I believe that this is very important, because the largest amount of expenditure on culture within the Union does not come under the heading of the ‘Culture 2000’ programme, but rather from the Structural Funds. I therefore believe that it is very important to look at the figures.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I am in complete agreement with the idea of strengthening diversity in our cooperation and development policies with third countries. There cannot be diversity without exchanges, in all countries and in all forms of expression, and I undertake to remind the Commissioners responsible for external relations – which is not difficult because they are already convinced of it – of the importance of making provision, in our foreign policies, for a cultural aspect, which is the human aspect and which is of primordial importance. I do not need to remind you of what we have already achieved, over a period of very many years, with our ACP partners or of what we initiated with our Mediterranean partners. However, what we are doing with all our partners is something new, and is perhaps in the process of becoming, thanks to Parliament among others, one of the new policies which are forging ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently visited China. What were people talking about there? They were talking about culture and about cultural diversity. Moreover, the Chinese are supporting us within UNESCO. The Chinese were also talking about education, and all this in a huge country like China, which is counting on Europe to help it to preserve its cultural diversity. You can see, then, that we have committed ourselves to a worldwide trend which is very important, hence my satisfaction as regards the battle that we won in UNESCO. It was not easy, but nevertheless we succeeded, in UNESCO, in persuading the nations of the world to stand side by side with us in order to preserve that which we all hold most dear. I do not doubt for a moment that, now that the General Assembly of UNESCO has decided to create an international instrument for the preservation of cultural diversity, that instrument will see the light of day and it will be a strong instrument. We shall be working with this end in view, not only within Europe, but also in all our international relations. In the same way as we worked in order to win the battle, we shall continue to work in order to win the war.</p>
<p class="contents">You will be aware that we are only at a preliminary stage in these negotiations, but I also have to tell you that we have sent a very strong signal to our partners by the publication, for the first time by the Commission, and therefore by the entire European executive, of a communication to the Council and Parliament on the European Union’s relations with UNESCO. This was a very strong point of departure for our partners to enable them to support us in our efforts in this direction. We still have a certain amount of time before we need to take action. UNESCO will make time available, and I would ask you to use this time in order to reflect, in depth, about the various aspects which are likely to be developed in this future Convention on which we shall need to consult our interested partners, professionals in the cultural sector and the cultural industries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must work together in order to define the detailed rules for cooperation with successive presidents of the Union, who will be conducting the UNESCO negotiations, so that Europe can prove that it is united on this occasion. This is important, because the rest of the world, the other continents, expect us to speak with a single voice, so that the Europe of cultural diversity, the example that others must follow, does not become scattered and lost in cacophony.</p>
<p class="contents">It is towards that end, ladies and gentlemen, that we should be working, and I should like to conclude, Madam President, by assuring you how pleased I am to have been able to benefit constantly from the unfailing support of the European Parliament. That has helped me enormously, and the successes which have been obtained are also your successes. Thank you very much; you have shown yourselves to be worthy of the cultural diversity of Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of the time, however, we avoid the problem of cultural identity, because that is far more sensitive, certainly where definitions are concerned. This is why I should like to talk about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Prets’ report largely draws on my ideas and on those of other Members, and I should like to thank her for the way in which we have been able to work together. I therefore endorse what both the rapporteur and Commissioner Reding have said in their fine speeches to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">My guiding principle is that respect for a community's cultural identity is a condition for peaceful coexistence. It is also a condition for the integration of people into another cultural community without this leading to frustration and alienation. Anyone who fails to respect a person’s culture does not respect the person himself, does not invite mutual respect and does not show any signs of being prepared to engage in a cultural dialogue which, in a world of ever more far-reaching globalisation, is necessary for cultural development. Striving towards maintaining one's own culture should therefore not lead to isolation, xenophobia or racism.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, however, be aware that the market will not rescue diversity. This is why we need instruments and resources to retain diversity, as well as opportunities of establishing this retention of cultural identity. Despite this, languages and cultures are disappearing very fast, and I am therefore delighted with the emphasis you have placed on this principle that should lead us, also for example in the contacts with the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that each community should have the opportunity of safeguarding its own culture against oppression, for example from language imperialism. Respect for languages is one of the major assets in the enlargement of Europe, one that we have already had the pleasure of experiencing among ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that the instruments that are being developed internationally, along with the instruments that you and the EU will be developing, will serve diversity and will facilitate cultural identity in the proper sense of the word. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is a great deal one could say about cultural diversity and its importance. This debate does not give us sufficient time. It is significant that we should be discussing this subject at 11.50 p.m., Harold Macmillan – the British Prime Minister and grandfather of a current Member here – who, over forty years ago, applied for British membership of the European Union, said that when discussing those things that are precious to a people, you do not sell the family silver. That clearly applies to cultural values. The rapporteur is therefore correct to state that cultural products and services should not conform to the normal free market of commercial and trade options.</p>
<p class="contents">Can we trust our governments to preserve our national, European and regional cultures? In my own country where, one might say, foreign languages are no longer taught, where history has become simply a background to current affairs and where Shakespeare is apparently too difficult for English students, those who say 'Yes, we may trust our governments to conserve our cultures' would perhaps be foolish. The proposals that this should be agreed at international level are correct, but we should also address ourselves directly to our own peoples and our own students. We have a great deal to fear from internationalisation, particularly of the television media. I hope that Parliament will continue to make positive proposals which are accepted both by the Commission and the Council, but I await a specific reply from the Commissioner on the point I raised initially. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am referring to the concentration of electronic media, especially television, which, as we know, is the key medium influencing public opinion. Protecting media diversity is also an important element in protecting cultural diversity and cultural identity. We cannot leave the task of affording this protection to the European judicial system, gratifying though today’s judgment by the Italian constitutional court may be. My earnest expectation of the international legal instrument that we hope for is that it will establish conditions which genuinely help to promote diversity in the media.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you have been talking about battles and wars, and we have a major battle on our hands here. Without wishing to play down your achievements in other areas, we have been left with no troops on this battlefield so far, and that creates a rather bitter after-taste. Diversity of opinion and pluralism in the media are valuable assets and there are many positive examples of them in Europe, despite the growing threats facing us. That is why Parliament has repeatedly, but sadly unsuccessfully, called for a directive to restrict media concentration for years. I would like to reiterate this call today. My group will therefore also be supporting a supplementary amendment by Mrs Fraisse, which sets out the arguments for this and which deserves the support of this House. I hope that it will have the Commission’s support as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Europe there is both unity and plurality, and it is in the field of culture that this plurality manifests itself in the clearest and most obvious way. There is plurality at European level, but also within each European State; and often, these different cultures within the States transcend the borders which mark State territories.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the existence of different languages in the States, as in the case of my mother tongue, Catalan, used by ten million people, is a manifestation of this plurality. When we talk about cultural plurality, in cases where this culture also has a differentiated history, its own linguistic characteristics and a structural form of society, we are talking about stateless nations, a phenomenon which also exists in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in many cases, these stateless nations are manifested through the existence, in this very House, of political parties which do not correspond to States, but rather to certain territories, and I am referring for example to the Scottish National Party, the Basque Nationalist Party and the party I belong to.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I believe that the European Union must ensure recognition of this plurality within it. Certain States, such as the Spanish State, recognise it through their official status, but this State recognition does not exist with reference to the European Union. It is regrettable that the European Constitution has not made progress in this direction through progressive measures, as it has on other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Plurality also implies the recognition of the existence of immigration in the European Union, which will be significant in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are several reasons for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The first reason is that, until a very short time ago, this convention, or this international instrument, was nothing more than a Utopian idea. I remember organising, together with my group, a public hearing in the autumn of 2002, in order to launch this idea before Parliament. I believe that we should be modest about this, and I would not say that this idea came from Europe and from the European Union. It came from, among others, countries like Canada, and from countries throughout the world which have established links with certain European countries. Therefore, though I can only applaud the fact that this Utopia is becoming a reality within the European Union, I do think that we should show a little more modesty.</p>
<p class="contents">If I call for modesty, it is because I would not like to see this future convention becoming merely the latest in a long line of declarations. We know all about declarations in favour of cultural diversity. We can make them, but then we have to draw up a restrictive and legislative convention which makes it possible to settle differences in a context which is that of the market. I would like to say that cultural diversity is also tied in with the question of the market. We must not disguise the fact that combining cultural diversity and the market represents a considerable difficulty. That is why, on this point too, I am modest and not always optimistic.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reason why I am not very optimistic is that I am not sure that we really are an example for others to follow, even if we like to think that we are. Are we really agreed, within the European Union, that we want to promote cultural diversity and, if so, what diversity? I think that if we look at the facts, we shall find it hard to be completely satisfied with ourselves. Mrs Junker has mentioned several problems, as have other Members. I think that we are confronted, right at the heart of Europe and not only outside it, with problems connected with the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would simply mention the question of the support provided by public State aids, for example, which as you all know is an element which is both provisory and derogatory, and which is in no way laid down in the logic, constitutional or otherwise, of the Treaties. Cultural diversity is therefore a right, but it is a right that we have to construct, and not a simple right to culture, to education and so on. The right to cultural diversity does not yet exist and I only hope that we shall know how to construct it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will not be able to happen unless we respect the principle of the equality, before the law, of all languages and cultures.

In fact, we do not need to go as far as the WTO; in this Parliament, we have repeatedly debated whether culture and the market are compatible, for example on the issue of fixing of book pricing and on the issue of copyright, and we have seen that there are widely divergent views, not only within this House but also between this House and the Commission in some cases. Within the Commission too, views have varied very widely, and I am referring especially to the previous Commission in this context. Certainly, we battled out the issue with Commissioner van Miert on several occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that cultural diversity, as a sensible countermeasure to the melting pot, is an absolute necessity and I am most grateful to Mrs Prets for producing this very comprehensive and detailed report. I also thank Commissioner Reding for providing such a detailed overview of the work from her own perspective and for pointing out that this House is and should remain the natural ally of the Commission and especially of Commissioner Reding herself.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs Prets especially for stating, in paragraph 15, that this Parliament reaffirms its vigilance concerning the treatment of minority populations and minority languages, including indigenous languages, in the context of the enlarged Europe. This should be made a condition if this House endorses this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that in an enlarged Europe, this should apply not only to the enlargement countries but also to the current Member States. There is undoubtedly a shortcoming here, in that in the cultural field – due to what is in my view the disastrous principle of unanimity – we have been unable to launch common policies to provide minority communities and languages with sensible options for their development. Here, we have a core Europe comprising a number of countries such as Italy, where I come from, which have broken new ground, and I say this as a member of a minority which is not Italian by origin but a German-speaking Austrian minority in Italy. There are other countries where this development has, unfortunately, been very sluggish, and I think that this effort and the abolition of the unanimity principle can achieve some progress here. Above all, we must address the fears of those countries which have concerns. I think that minorities and their cultures should be regarded as bridges and not as burdens – and this is where this report can make a contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For cultures to really flourish we need concrete action as well as speeches. I believe that the report by my colleague Mrs Prets will help us make some progress. There should be support for the Convention on cultural diversity as proposed by UNESCO’s General Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the rapporteur’s approach to examining culture as part of all the EU’s different policy areas is a welcome one. This way of considering the matter should also be extended to practical action. The Culture 2000 programme is the most conspicuous but by no means the only instrument. Money is channelled from the Structural Funds to projects in the field of culture, but the take-up rate could be raised with more effective systems of information. Internal market legislation has a partial impact on the mobility of cultural products, that is, arts and artists. We still too often run into problems in this area especially as far as taxation is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective set at Lisbon regarding the European information society has brought a new dimension to the field of culture. Technology offers more opportunities and tools, but they must be harnessed in the service of culture, not the other way round.</p>
<p class="contents">The European cultural networks are a key resource in the promotion of cultural diversity. I hope that we will establish a legal basis to ensure they are properly funded as quickly as possible.</p>

Nevertheless, the resolution, proposed precisely on the basis of a concept that is difficult and risky, does not hesitate, for a good 47 paragraphs, to claim to regulate, standardise and promote so-called cultural diversity, thus deluding itself, in the age of the Internet, that it can halt the liberalisation and globalisation of culture, information and knowledge. In this way, after in the past having risked dying of nationalism, fascism and communism, today Europe risks dying of legalism.</p>
<p class="contents">The text of this resolution is a clear example of this. Its contents challenge the principle of non-contradiction and even basic common sense and end up settling for vulgar hypocrisy. It is furthermore hypocritical to consider each type of cultural product as equally worthy, not just of survival but also of being promoted, and equating liberal culture with authoritarian culture, the culture of infibulation with the culture of sexual equality, the culture of tolerance with that of racism and anti-Semitism.</p>
<p class="contents">In truth, the contradictions in this resolution reflect those in our policy, which looks for allies in the developing world to protect it and to protect itself from the intrusiveness of the American audiovisual sector, in the name of respect for cultural diversity, subject then to fully financing, for example, French-speaking Africa; the culture which, in the name of assimilation, banned the veil and other religious signs in school classrooms, and which does not, however, object at all to them being imposed in an authoritarian manner in other countries; the culture that praises European democracy, even when it is noticeably absent, and claims in a racist manner, however, that the developing world is not ready for it; the culture that refuses to ‘export’ freedom does not hesitate to collaborate with dictators and tyrants, today ignoring the fight of Islamic dissidents, as in the past it ignored communist dissidents from Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In all this I do not see a fairer, more respectful choice to protect the heritage of the people of Europe and of the world but rather shapeless, hypocritical, and conflicting protectionism that protects the intellectual, national and regional elites, against the dynamism and the cultural conflict which, in its substance, is always ...</p>

This is not the case: individual States and nationalist ideologies were the ones that wiped out cultures and people in the past. Commissioner Reding, China has carried out the worst cases of genocide of people and of culture and continues to do so: the Tibetan people and their culture, the Uighur people and their culture. China cannot be held up in this Chamber as an example of fruitful cooperation for cultural diversity, at least if we are using the old idea of the Cultural Revolution as a reference for the word ‘cultural’.</p>
<p class="contents">Cultural diversity is not, in the abstract, a right; it can, of course, also be the result of rules, but of rules that must be based on the freedom of communication and of expression and not on protectionism – protectionism or State handouts for culture – on the cultural relativism of individual States. We do, of course, want these rules, in particular to counter the destruction of languages, but the policy of teaching only one foreign language in the Member States and the rules governing the European institutions run counter to the spirit of diversity called for in the resolution: European institutions with monolingual or bilingual agencies that publish public reports without even producing them in the official languages of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the explanation of vote we, the radical Members, will refer to our proposals on the Monitoring centre for linguistic policies to promote the international language Esperanto, for the right to free and non-discriminatory international communication, to preserve and maintain linguistic diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My country, Spain, is a country with great cultural diversity and wealth and we are naturally entirely in favour of cultural diversity. Nevertheless, I would like to say that we would have liked the report, rather than referring to non-uniform cultural identities, to have referred to the plurality of cultural identities in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus used seems to us, in general, to be rather negative. And the reality is that, in many countries of Europe, cultural identities are not uniform, precisely because they are plural and we must not forget that this is one of our great assets.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that the right of each Member State to define, apply and adapt its cultural policies is subject to national legislation and, therefore, this must be done in accordance with their respective national legislations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say finally that, given that there are differing positions and concerns with regard to this issue in the European Union, I believe it would be correct for us to leave it in the hands of Unesco as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am speaking in this Chamber as a Spaniard, as a member of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and as a Basque. I come from a country in which we have our own language, a native language in addition to Castilian, which is Basque, and which has a culture that goes back millennia, as does our language.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur on the importance of preserving linguistic diversity. I also agree that we must monitor the treatment of minority languages, including autochthonous languages.</p>
<p class="contents">In an increasingly united Europe, in an increasingly globalised world, we must pay special attention to cultural diversity. The wealth of Europe – and what differentiates us from other regions of the world, as the Commissioner has said – undoubtedly lies in our cultural diversity, and we must try to export that model.</p>
<p class="contents">We must prevent the Union from becoming a means for standardisation, and I would like to point out that the preamble to the draft Constitution spoke of a ‘Europe united in diversity’.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we must prevent the appropriation of cultural and linguistic diversity for political purposes. We must not accept the idea that the defence of language or culture, which belongs to all of us, can be used as a political weapon, a missile, or even a means for possible discrimination or division between us. Neither language nor the defence of language can be a reason for discrimination. Let us remember that this aspect is taken up in the draft Constitution. We must respect cultural and linguistic diversity, it is true, but we must not impose it. Respect for diversity also consists of respecting those people who speak another language.</p>
<p class="contents">Euskera must be preserved in the Basque Country, without question, but we must not impose it or discriminate against those who do not speak it. Certain nationalist parties who have tried to use language as a political tool have moved on from racial nationalism to linguistic nationalism. I believe that culture is the inheritance of all of us, we must all defend it and nobody must appropriate it for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to end by quoting from the preamble to the Constitution which reads, ‘while remaining proud of their own national identities and history, the peoples of Europe are determined to transcend their ancient divisions and, united ever more closely, to forge a common destiny’.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> Commission.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, you will understand that, owing to the shortage of combatants in the plenary session, I shall not reply to all those who – and at a quarter past midnight I can well understand why – have left the House. I would still like, however, to say a few words which I have set my heart on. It is as a Luxembourg woman that I am speaking to you, and it was this Luxembourg woman who developed, with you, the European Year of Languages, of all languages without exception, whether recognised languages, non-recognised languages, majority languages or minority languages, because I have always maintained that there are no great languages and minor languages: there are only maternal languages and they are all, by definition, great.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to continue in that direction. We have drawn up our action plan on languages on the basis of this multilingualism, quite rightly, and let me tell you that multilingualism includes those of our languages which are not official, but it certainly does not include Esperanto, because we have enough living languages in difficulty without creating, in addition, artificial languages. Therefore, let us teach languages to our children, and on this point I am happy to see that almost all – in fact I would say all – our education ministers are making an effort, and some of them are starting from scratch. They are making an effort to introduce languages into primary education. In the last two years enormous progress has been made. We still have a long way to go, but we are moving forward, and at least those ministers who are not making an effort have a guilty conscience. It is up to you, Members of the European Parliament, to continue to give them a guilty conscience, so that reforms are implemented at local, regional and national level. In addition, the Commissioner repeats to every minister he sees that continued multilingualism in Europe is a matter of survival.</p>
<p class="contents">For now, I should like to reply to certain specific questions, even though those Members who asked them are no longer in the House. On the question of UNESCO and our allies, it is clear that, in UNESCO, we need all the countries in order to constitute a majority to adopt a convention on cultural diversity. We also need, at worldwide level, to serve as an example of cultural diversity. What we are trying to do then – and we are succeeding, by serving as an example and insisting on respect for minorities – is to bring about changes in attitude, particularly in those countries – and some of them have been mentioned – which are very far from being perfect, and we all know who they are. You know this, you who are Members of the European Parliament, because you discuss the matter constantly, but we can only help these minorities by taking them with us and telling them that we will not allow them to be left aside, not by building a wall between those who are right and those who are wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to give you a very specific example, Last May, for the first time we opened the Cannes Film Festival with European Cinema Day. Twenty-five ministers, proud of their national film industries, accompanied by young, well-known producers, showed the world how much importance they attach to the cinema.</p>
<p class="contents">In the afternoon of European Cinema Day, we and our partners worldwide organised a conference on world cinemas, so as to allow those whose voices are not usually heard to make them heard, and to give an opportunity to minority cinemas which, without the aid of Europe, would never have had a chance to express themselves. That is how European policy should be. It is a policy which sets an example and which demonstrates our unique model.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now answer Mr Beazley’s question, which was very specific. He asked whether we were going to draw up a communication concerning UNESCO. Mr Beazley, I do not know whether you noticed, but in August the Commission, as far as I know for the first time in the history of the European Union, published a communication about UNESCO, which served as a way of moving things forward. We have now won a battle. I say ‘battle’ because the war is not over yet. The groups are hoping – and the first of them has already begun meetings – that there will now be discussions at UNESCO level. I believe that international negotiations, in the true meaning of the term, will be able to commence either at the end of 2004 or at the beginning of 2005. It will be at that moment, when we have the beginnings of a text, that we shall be able to define what Europe is seeking to obtain in the context of those negotiations. It is not enough to issue a communication every three months. That would not achieve anything. I am a supporter of what the Germans call <span class="italic">‘Realpolitik’</span>, which means that I want to take measures which will produce results. Our communication of last summer enabled us to get things up and running and to demonstrate that Europe was participating in the drawing up of an international instrument. Now, as soon as discussions have produced their initial results, we shall explain what we want the main thrust of the debate to be. Let us, therefore, be efficient and not militant merely for the sake of being militant.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to have to say to Mrs Junker that, as far as media concentration is concerned, we may be starting off from the same idea, but we are also taking as our basis the same Treaty. That Treaty prevents the Commission from proposing any instrument for harmonisation, preservation of diversity or pluralism in the media. The Treaty being what it is and the Commission being the guardian of the Treaties, I cannot do any better than that. I would never obtain the sustained approval of the Commission if I stray from the Treaty. We can only hope, Mrs Junker, that the new Treaty, as many Members have clearly said, will contain much stronger elements regarding such diversity in all its aspects, because it is multiform. It is concerned not only with dancing and the arts, but also – and above all – with language, minorities, the cinema and pluralism of expression, in other words the media and audiovisual technology. This is why I would like to see the new Treaty provide more opportunities for representatives of the people first of all, but also for the Commission’s initiative which is intended to take a further step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is said that the world is not a commodity, and that is even more true of culture. On this point, I believe that the Commission, by its action, has very clearly demonstrated, not only at the level of external trade but also at the level of authorising national aids, for example, for the cinema and for public television stations and so on, that it is not prepared to accept that culture should be regarded as a commodity. However, even though it is not a commodity, culture has its price, and we must pay it. It is up to us, therefore, to convince national governments and to make it possible for Europe to be able to invest sufficient resources to ensure that these cultures survive. It must be possible for Europe to serve as a living example to the eyes of the world, so that we can change that world, because, even though what we experience regarding diversity and respect for others is not perfect, our example is still of value. Let us show the way, and the world will be a better place for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even today, the Dutch culture and language, particularly in the Flemish periphery around Brussels, is treated with disdain by the numerically dominant French-speaking minority. Even within the EU, Dutch is at times ignored; it has, for example, disappeared as a working language within such institutions as the European trademarks bureau. I am therefore well placed to know that European institutions are guilty themselves when there is talk of not respecting cultural diversity or when it is stated that linguistic diversity should also be respected. This report, which contains a huge number of praiseworthy recommendations, has come none too soon, and I do indeed hope that the good intentions, following the enlargement of the EU, to protect all languages that are spoken in a Europe with 25 Member States, will this time not remain an empty promise. I stress that even minority languages, such as Welsh and Breton deserve to be fostered with European support. Europe should, where culture is concerned, put its own house in order first before seeking to take the moral high ground on behalf of the entire world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
