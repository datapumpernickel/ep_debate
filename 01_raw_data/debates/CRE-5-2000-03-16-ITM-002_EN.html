This is, of course, timed to coincide with the summit in Lisbon next week, and Parliament has had to work extremely speedily, for which I thank so many colleagues who have helped with this and, of course, the secretariat.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was a young child, a library was opened in a village where I was born and brought up; when the head teacher of the village school opened the library, he said that there were over 4 000 books in the library, and I thought with all the wisdom of a six-year old child: well, that is all the books in the world. Now, I personally own over 4 000 books, and, although this is hardly a knowledge revolution in itself, it is some indication, on a personal level extrapolated to a political level, of the pace of change in how knowledge is accessed, distributed, applied and refined. We ought to put this into some sort of context, though, and remind ourselves that the majority of people in the world have never made and probably never will make even one phone call.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposals and Parliament's response give a clear acknowledgement that the market can and should be the motor for much of this change, but not in every case. The challenge is to work out when the European Union should let the market do the driving, and when we should intervene and regulate – when we should intervene, in whose interests and for how long. We should remember – and the Commission proposal and Parliament's response highlight the fact – that third-generation mobile telephones, on which so much of our future depends, are an area where clearly the European Union has an important lead, and that this lead is partly, though not wholly, explained by intervention. The adoption of the GSM standard has meant that the European Union has a tremendous advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report mentions matters relating to social protection and the social implications of this change, and I am indebted to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and particularly Mr Cercas, draftsman of the opinion from that committee – the only committee that has been able to complete an opinion in the short space of time available – for his hard work. If I can explain procedurally and very briefly, the Social Affairs Committee voted on Monday evening at the same time as the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and, with the agreement of the draftsman, I have taken over some of his proposals and put them down in my own political group's name. I hope that there will be support for those, because they go into a considerable amount of important detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments are looking at matters relating to disability rights. I have consulted widely about the need to ensure that certain fundamental principles about the rights of disabled users and disabled people at work are incorporated into this report, and I hope into future legislation under the 1999 review of telecommunications legislation, at a sufficiently early stage.</p>
<p class="contents">We have amendments about consumer protection – so important in the establishment of trust in e-commerce – on the future of taxation, on the implications for healthcare and for transport. Particularly important are going to be the employment consequences already seen and I tried hard to obtain a balance: not to be too alarmist because, of course, some of these changes will mean unemployment, but, on the other hand, to look at the opportunities for new sorts of work that the changes will bring. Whilst I was researching for these comments to make to you today, I looked for examples, because I think these illustrate so well to the citizens of the European Union how these developments will bring benefits to their lives. It is important, too, that we in Parliament and in the institutions of the European Union also apply modern methods, methods characterised by transparency and openness, in our own deliberations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to use my final few seconds to draw to your attention three projects in my own area. One of these is in Rutland, the smallest county in England, where a virtual Rutnet was set up, bringing together people in rural, isolated communities for purposes of leisure, transport, employment and social life generally. Further north, the Nottingham rural community council have set up a similar project in an area of serious mining deprivation, and this is bringing enormous benefits to many of the people in that area. On a broader basis, M-net, the European East Midlands network helping small businesses and craft enterprises and linking in with universities and colleges, is also important.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, some comments, Mr President, on what the future holds. It is interesting to try to look into the future, and I should like to quote from the words of a famous Louis Armstrong song, ‘What a wonderful world’: ‘Babies are born, we watch them grow, they'll learn much more than I'll ever know’. I think for all of us the future for our children and grandchildren is a future of great opportunity, though also of great uncertainty. It is praiseworthy that the Commission is looking to play a leading, pivotal role in this, and I commend the Commission proposals and my own report to you.</p>

We have been working against the clock and we have been dealing with an excellent and supportive fellow Member, who has been very open to accepting all the points our committee wanted to raise in this important debate. Many thanks for your report and your skill, Mrs Read.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has welcomed the Commission’s very important initiative, <span class="italic">e-</span>Europe, for the Special European Council to be held in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March, with support and optimism.</p>
<p class="contents">We naturally applaud the Commission’s aim of making the information society benefit all sectors and all regions but now, with the Commissioner here, we also have the opportunity to consider the citizens’ viewpoint and remind the Commission and the public that rhetoric in announcing objectives and expressing desires is not enough. We want these words transformed as firmly as possible into specific objectives and precise financial commitments, because that is the only way to get a real strategy covering every aspect of the information society. And the strategy will only be of use to the weakest groups and individuals, and those who are most at risk of exclusion from the new society, if there are concrete commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">No doubt the Commission has the noblest intentions, but, looked at from the viewpoint of the workers and the least advantaged people, it still has not answered the questions this Parliament has raised in many documents, for example, the report on the Green Paper entitled “Living and Working in the Information Society: People First”. We still do not have much idea of who is going to finance the massive programme to teach basic digital literacy which Europe needs to close the gap with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have much idea of how the responsibilities can be divided between governments and Commission, or what role trade unions and civil society can play. So we want supplementary analyses taken into account, we want firmer commitments, we want a specific point about strengthening employment and social cohesion in the information society – because there is nothing about that in the Commission’s communication – and we want a strategy with guidelines, recommendations and indicators.</p>
<p class="contents">We want adults mentioned, not just young people, we want disadvantaged groups mentioned and we want you to remember equality of opportunity too. The new society must not exacerbate inequality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, there are great opportunities here, but they must reach all the people. And we want the European social model to be defended.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are asking for a step forward, with more specific commitments and far more adequate political and financial efforts.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Niebler (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner Liikanen, the <span class="italic">e-Europe </span>initiative by the European Commission is to be welcomed in principle. We all agree that new technologies will lead to extensive change, not only in our business life but in all aspects of our social life. It is also true that the evolution from industrial society to information society cannot be halted and that it therefore makes political sense to prepare Europe for the information society as best we can.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore expressly welcome the statement in the <span class="italic">e-Europe </span>initiative that its prime objective is to accelerate the positive transformation to the information society in the European Union and gear the transformation towards social and regional integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission sets out ten measures in its communication on the <span class="italic">e-Europe </span>initiative, which should level the playing field in the run up to the information society in Europe. As welcome as the individual measures are, they need to be structured as a whole and clear priorities need to be set for our policy. This includes clearly differentiating which tasks the European Union can and must take care of itself and which tasks come within the jurisdiction of the individual Member States, taking account of the fact that some Member States and regions have been promoting the new technologies and fostering their acceptance by their citizens for years now. In this respect, the summit in Lisbon should table recommendations to the individual states, without imposing comprehensive obligations or heavy financial burdens.</p>
<p class="contents">What must the European Union do within the framework of the <span class="italic">e-Europe </span>initiative? In my opinion, the following priorities should be taken care of by the Union and should have been addressed as core points in Mrs Read’s report, for which I should like, at this point, to thank her. First: we must create an open, modern, high-performance multimedia infrastructure. The policy objective must be to ensure that Europe has a modern, high-performance infrastructure which allows valuable quality telecommunications services to be supplied and demanded from the telephone via the PC and television.</p>
<p class="contents">This includes cheaper Internet access for all the citizens of Europe, which means fostering even more competition in local networks, for example by unbundling customer access. It also means that all platforms must be made accessible to service providers at competitive prices; this might include making television cables available. It also means that the policy regarding frequencies in Europe will need to be reviewed and we will need to take a more strategic approach based on economic principles, as you have suggested, Commissioner. But, in so doing, we must not, of course, forget commercial applications which are generally provided in the public interest, such as public service radio. On the contrary, this must be taken into account when frequencies are being allocated so that it can fulfil its purpose as an opinion-forming institution which provides a platform for a variety of opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: we must quickly create a legal framework for electronic commerce. This means that we must deal swiftly with legislative proposals pending, such as the <span class="italic">e-commerce </span>directive or the directive amending copyright protection. However, caution is required in the legislative area in that we must not over-regulate; in other words, the first question with future legislative proposals should always be, do we actually need this?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: we need an <span class="italic">e-Europe </span>test bench for European initiatives. I have already referred to the fact that the changes in information technology and the new media affect all areas of life. Consequently, it is advisable to set all initiatives at European level on the <span class="italic">e-Europe </span>test bench. In other words…</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President cut the speaker off)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I apologise. Please be so kind as to allow me to finish my sentence. I have inadvertently run over time, but allow me to use my closing sentence to stress once again that I welcome the <span class="italic">e-Europe </span>initiative and to say that the suggestions which I had made would have been taken into account in my intervention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a positive debate, very positive for Europe, and widespread interest has been shown, as evidenced by the large number of amendments. Let me pick out the points that we think are most important: infrastructure, legal certainty – people must know where they are – and the skills offensive, which ought, please, to be targeted not simply at our schoolchildren and students but at groups which have been neglected, such as women and older people, who represent an enormous source of skill if it were to be exploited. It is a disgrace that large countries in the past have not foreseen the need to train, and countries like Germany and the United Kingdom should not be having to bring in workers from elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that we will have a very good advertising and information campaign, and that we will capture the imagination of the citizens of Europe. We must not forget people with disabilities. There is also the fact that the documentation is not available to partially sighted people, and that is an oversight which could be put right in future. We must prevent divisions, divisions between the regions of Europe, between the households of Europe and between the individuals of Europe. Business-to-business communications are doing well but we must enhance communications between business and consumers in the European Union, where we lag behind the United States. Of course, to do that we have to ensure that people – customers – are convinced of privacy and security, and your measures will help to bring about that confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Business-to-consumer communications are particularly important for the elderly, the housebound and for those with family responsibilities who are finding it difficult to juggle work and career, overwhelmingly women. There are ethical issues which we must give regard to, but I am very optimistic, and I think that Mrs Read will continue her work alongside you, and we will find in this House many missionaries for the 'e-Europe' communication.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can also see this from the follow-up document prepared by the Commission. The initiative is important if we are to stop having to say that the United States is the overall leader within this developing field. According to the “2000 IDC/World Times Information Society Index”, published in February, Sweden has overtaken the United States as the leading information economy. The United States occupies second place. Finland, Norway and Denmark follow, in that order. People may hold different views as to the value of this type of investigation, but I think it is important to emphasise that the US model is not the only one which leads to success in the IT society, something which far too many people have said in this House. Scandinavia is acquitting itself well with its social infrastructure and also, perhaps, with its pensions systems. We ought to bear this in mind, something I am convinced the Commission has done. </p>
<p class="contents">We should also remember that the EU countries are very different from one another and that developments are very rapid. This must be reflected in the action plan. It is also important that the countries which are forging ahead most quickly should not be checked in their development. It is important that we should clarify what is being done at EU level and what is being done with EU resources and that we should be prepared to make changes to regional policy and redirect some resources for research in ways that benefit “e-Europe”. In view of countries’ different levels of development in the IT sphere, I am also sceptical about information plans and campaigns at EU level. “e-Europe” means more than just “e-commerce”.</p>
<p class="contents">The Directive on electronic commerce deals for the most part with things other than trading on the part of consumers. I should like to appeal to the Commission to pay attention to the question which is being discussed in an adjoining room with Federal Trade Commissioner Thompson: that of how we are to increase consumer confidence. The consumer has to be king when it comes to electronic commerce. Otherwise, it will not properly take off. When alternative ways of solving disputes are discussed, we ought to collaborate globally with the United States. Nonetheless, we should also support the OECD in its work. </p>
<p class="contents">The issues of broadband communications and of good infrastructure are on the agenda in the majority of countries. There is a need for diversity, but now more standards are being sought for Digital Subscriber Lines with the help of which it will be possible to upgrade the network. It is widely maintained that telephone companies are not making use of the available technology because standards are lacking. </p>
<p class="contents">Smart cards, encryption, mobile phones and “e-Europe” constitute our strength. We shall persist with developments in these areas but, when it comes to standards, we need to pursue further development. It is not we politicians who should decide on these standards. Instead, we should allow industry to reach an agreement concerning standards where there is a demand for these. Our task is to legislate more quickly and to make for new patterns of legislation where possible. I am glad that this point is made in the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to turn my attention first to the policy approach of the <span class="italic">e-Europe </span>initiative and to the approach taken by the Read report. The Internet, e-mail and mobile telephones will apparently do away with unemployment. But the reality of the matter is somewhat different. The IT boom is confronted by mergers and redundancies. History teaches us that this approach has failed. Industrialisation, atomic energy and biotechnology have not brought freedom and prosperity for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Initiatives and reports are informed by the concept that the playing field should be levelled for the youngest and best. Unfortunately, this concept totally ignores the fact that this group already represents the winners, while the general mass goes away empty-handed. What we need to do is to allow everyone to profit from technical innovation, irrespective of how old or how rich they are or in which region they live. We should hold our principle of equal opportunity up to the light of truth. A universal service points the right way, but the idea should not be implemented by providers which censor the Internet by using technical devices to deny their customers access to parts of the Net.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal aims to create equality through market liberalisation. That alone is nonsensical enough because liberalisation always starts from the premise that the strong will become stronger, while the state should only give the weak minimum support. In the case of information technology, however, we start with a totally different set of coordinates. For example, there are numerous initiatives to promote the Internet and computers in schools. But if no account is taken of the fact that each class contains at least one pupil who knows more than the teacher, then the initiative cannot but fail. The fact that strong anti-American arguments had to be used at numerous points of the Read report as an excuse for the liberalisation policy again illustrates the extent to which the interests of private industry have dictated the text.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my next controversial point: civil rights. What we in fact need is a concept for universal data protection. Instead, the Commission and parts of the European Parliament visualise a smart card on which all your data would be stored. Your medical health fund would know that you are homosexual and your employer would know all about your previous and expected future illnesses and your forefathers. It means a step in the direction of see-through man and yet more state interference in our private lives. It is being used to deliberately plan and implement a further massive restriction of fundamental rights at European level. It is being sold as an innovative policy at the same time as Parliament is arguing with other institutions for a Charter of Fundamental Rights. How can these two things be reconciled? In the light of “echelon”, I am calling for a rethink of this matter. Data protection and encoding are what we need. For the rest, the citizens must control the state, not the other way around. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are two different things. Information is only a raw material of knowledge. Information is chaos, while knowledge is order: order out of chaos. The information society is the chaos society. The knowledge society is more than that, and it may also be a society of social order, cultural diversity and human solidarity. The information society has to date made its presence felt in the form of price quotations on a chaotic stock market. The prices of shares in technology have risen in a such a way which cannot be justified economically. Neither has the money often gone into new investment for business but to the owners, who have become millionaires and billionaires. In that way the information society emerges as a bubble economy, a symbol of social inequality and imbalance.</p>
<p class="contents">The information society has been a matter of millionaires causing a social revolution: they have innovatively destroyed the old structures of society. Their revolution has been to sell computers and software to everyone. The rest of us should start a counter-revolution. We should set our aims higher than the Commission has done. We have to demand a knowledge society for all rather than the chaotic information society we are getting. It cannot just be a question of whether everyone has a mobile phone, how e-mail gets sent and what to buy over the Internet. At its best the knowledge society can be a social dimension of the new capitalism. The information society for all is too undemanding, too commercial and too culturally restricted a goal. We should want a knowledge society for all: that is democracy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed no one will deny that means of communication, and in particular the Internet, are most important to the future development of our societies, or that the EU Member States are currently trailing behind the United States in this respect, or that we need to legislate to control the potentially anarchic development of these means in order to limit the excesses to which they can give rise and ensure that they are as successful as possible for our people.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet I fear that the catalogue of good intentions before us today may, in fact, make it more difficult to achieve the objective we are seeking. Rather than moving ahead one step at a time and setting the Member States a concrete and quantifiable short or medium-term objective, Parliament is sending out a confused and confusing signal, largely, it is true, because of the rather bizarre committee work. We would have liked to see more precise details about the specific nature of the European approach to this subject and, in particular, on how the Commission proposes to help the Member States to check the headlong race towards standardisation, an exact blueprint of the American model, which is bound to encourage the development of these tools on the basis of purely technical and commercial considerations. The educational and social concerns set out in the report are, no doubt, laudable ones, but in the end they will have little impact given the immediate repercussions that the extension of this tool will have for the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In what way is the Commission’s document compatible with the existence of tax provisions in the field of commerce and employment specific to the various Member States? How can we ensure respect for our concepts of the freedom of the individual and freedom of expression, which have not yet been harmonised at world level? What guarantees are there for the security of our states in the context of the development of a technology operated chiefly by a big power which, while teaching the whole world the lessons of liberalism, never forgets to ensure that its own enterprises scrupulously respect its concept of the national interest?</p>

I do not want to deny this. I would, however, want to express a reservation regarding the boundless possibilities the information society has to offer. </p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me that the other side of the coin hardly gets mentioned. By which I mean, not only does IT exclude certain groups of society, it also creates a new electronic reality, that is to say a reality which has no room for standards and values. I would welcome the development of IT ethics, as proposed by Mrs Schröder. These IT ethics should not be optional but should be translated into adequate legislation. Subsidies to develop filters, so as to be able to offer a clean Internet, should form part of these ethics. </p>
<p class="contents">I find it useful that Parliament’s resolution questions the powers of the Commission and Member States. In the case of educational initiatives, however, I would like to make it clear that Europe has no powers. In this particular field of policy, national Member States can carry responsibility far more efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Read, for her work. It is thanks to her that we can vote on this before the summit in Lisbon.

The ‘new economy’ is here to stay, in Europe too. The European response to new challenges and exploiting opportunities has, however, been a long time coming. For that reason, the <span class="italic">e-</span>Europe initiative is in a more crucially important position than ever before with regard to Union competitiveness and, consequently, from the point of view of our citizens also. The proposals for reform in the initiative are ambitious, but do not even necessarily go far enough. The goals are too modest, especially for my home country of Finland, where, in many respects, we are ahead of our European partners in networking. The initiative should also be supplemented by the future challenges facing those countries with a more advanced information society.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I appreciate the amount of work that you, to your credit, have carried out regarding these issues relating to the information society. We Members of the European Parliament cannot stand by either, while Europe continually lags behind its global competitors in the world of the Internet. The clear lead Europe enjoys in the world of wireless communications is not enough for us to stop caring about the future of the European information society and about whether we really can keep up with the competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Being in a key position when creating the information society encourages real competition in telecommunications networks. Competition cuts costs, and we have to bring down these very costs of communications, so that consumers and SMEs can derive full benefit from the electronic revolution. Apart from reduced costs, the growth in electronic commerce also means that questions of security should be able to be resolved to the satisfaction of consumers and that defects in legislation should be corrected. I think it is particularly important to take measures to increase venture capital projects for SMEs in the high technology sector. The EUR 20 billion currently being used in venture capital projects in Europe each year is only one quarter of what the United States spends over the same period. The amount is much too small. Fortunately, the Commission has shown initiative in this matter, however, and has focused attention on accelerating developments here.</p>
<p class="contents">Speedy developments in the information society will drastically change our environment and our working and living conditions. As European legislators, we have before us an immense challenge, if we intend to keep legislation abreast of the times. The legislator does not always even have to interfere in developments: in certain matters industry and the players themselves may quickly resolve problems through cooperation. Examples would be the positive experience that was gained from the common standardisation of second generation mobile phone systems and which is directly visible now in the strengthened competitive position with regard to third generation output.</p>
<p class="contents">Control of the new operational environment will also require increased technical and pedagogic facilities and resources in training schemes. Consequently, there will have to be more focus on the training of teaching staff in European educational and training programmes. Finally I would like to say that I support the introduction of benchmarking with regard to the development of the information society. With regard to the concrete proposals contained in the <span class="italic">e-</span>Europe communiqué, I can only wonder why the Council has not discussed them before, so as to ensure commitment on the part of Member States.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is more than an economic challenge: it is a process of profound cultural change which must filter down to every family, every school, every company and every public authority. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this objective, although, on the one hand, we do need to promote the spread of new technologies, on the other, it is essential to implement the necessary measures and reinforce the confidence of consumers in the major opportunities presented by e-commerce. There is a genuine need for this, given the suspicion with which our fellow citizens approach these new tools. A high level of protection is essential for the effective spread of the use of new technologies to the daily lives of millions of people, and clear rules will have to be defined if European citizens are to be able to take full advantage of the benefits. </p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I had submitted a series of amendments for the attention of the Committee on Industry intended precisely to stress the importance of consumer protection in the project for disseminating new technologies put forward by the Prodi Commission. It was with regret that I learned that only some of these amendments had been included in Mrs Read’s report. I am, however, in agreement with the main points of the report, and I do hope that this omission was due to the unfortunate circumstances which meant that my Committee, which deals with consumer protection, did not have time to produce an official opinion. I trust that during work on the action plan, following the Lisbon Summit, there will be more effective cooperation between the two Committees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Moreover, I set great store by protecting small and medium-sized businesses, with special emphasis on the small businesses. In this connection, it is important to ensure that guarantees are provided for advertising purposes. Indeed, due to a lack of a harmonised policy on commercial communication, obstacles could well surface which cannot be negotiated, particularly by small businesses. Far-reaching harmonisation concerning commercial communication is therefore urgently needed. In the last instance, I would also like to underline how important it is that at least the parties involved, i.e. the consumer and entrepreneur, must always be able to make prior arrangements regarding the applicable legal system. After all, if it is stipulated that consumers can take legal action within their own jurisdiction, then this situation will be untenable for small businesses, which will need legal assistance in 14 other Member States. Needless to say, small businesses cannot afford to make this kind of arrangement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That means it is lagging behind the United States which, indeed, no one would deny. But having said that, we should evaluate the quality of this backwardness: economic, political and social. How do we measure it?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission says it wants to launch a political initiative, so let us take it at its word. Yes, Europe is backward in terms of access to the information society as a tool, a tool of knowledge, a tool of creativity, a tool for exchanging information. Yes, it is backward in terms of the development of e-commerce made possible by the Internet. But are these two forms of backwardness the same? Some might say ‘no matter’, we must strive for the wholesale development of the magnificent tool of digital information and that is an end in itself. That is the impression the Commission’s initiative could give.</p>
<p class="contents">But is it enough to set out a list of objectives, where the development of small enterprises is put on the same footing as the development of the public services, where electronic commerce vies with university education? The question that has not been asked is about the content of the information that is supposed to circulate thanks to this digital tool. Will that content be standardised or will it reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of Europe? Will it be a social content or purely market-related?</p>
<p class="contents">Even now, the information society is creating social networks, giving rise to new cultural experiences, producing sites for political debate and exchanges of view. We need to evaluate them properly. The Commission refers to Europe’s backwardness and the need to make up for it. Between considerations of backwardness and urgency, we must not confine ourselves to speeding up this process but must instead consider the democratic and political conditions under which it takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">Technological progress is an all-too familiar slogan. In fact, the transformation we are witnessing is reminiscent of what happened with the invention of printing. We need to reflect very seriously about the challenges and changes it is bringing about. If the objectives are to strengthen employment and improve democratic access, as so clearly elucidated in Mrs Read’s report, it would be a pity to evaluate them solely in terms of the market and of economic development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The new technologies which we are debating here have, for the most part, radically altered the bases of production, service, distribution, trade, research, use of information etc. in our societies. Productivity is increasing, as is the quality of various products. Moreover, one of the reasons why we have relatively high growth in the world economy and, at the same time, low inflation lies precisely in these new technologies. I think we are all fascinated by all the new products and applications which are being made available. It is nonetheless important that, in our capacity as politicians, we should pay attention to the prior conditions which are being created for using these new technologies to help solve urgent problems for society with which the market economy will not automatically concern itself. </p>
<p class="contents">One such example is, of course, the area of education. We live at a time when education is becoming ever more important as a factor in production. One aspect to which little attention is paid in this area is that knowledge, unlike other production factors (such as capital, minerals, and agricultural and other land), is not a scarce resource. Knowledge has a clear tendency to increase or to expand when it is used. It opens the door to incredibly exciting developments where democracy and justice are concerned. We are all born with the potential to learn and acquire knowledge. This cannot, however, occur without good prior conditions for education and learning. That is why the proposal in this report, according to which resources for education and learning would be made available, is so important. </p>
<p class="contents">It is not, however, just a question of technical equipment. It is also a question of developing new teaching methods and distance learning. This is important in our own part of the world but is also, of course, especially important in poor countries. I hope that the experience which will be gained by the EU in this area will also be used as part of our collaborative work on development. I would urge Mr Liikanen to have a detailed discussion with Mr Nielson on that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area which is just as important is that of the opportunities for using the new technologies to make the use of energy and materials more efficient. Commendably, in my view, the present programme refers to the area of transport. Do not forget, however, that it is also possible, to a significant degree, to achieve an actual physical reduction in transport needs, which is something we should be trying to come to grips with. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, where e-commerce is concerned, it is extremely important that a framework should be created which ensures that consumers can feel secure in engaging in this form of trade, that commerce within the EU is facilitated and that due attention is paid to the tax issue and to the risks concerning integrity. We are only at the beginning of an important discussion, and I look forward to further stimulating dialogue. Thank you, Mr Liikanen and Mrs Read, for an interesting report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I should like to raise three points which perhaps merit our attention. First: Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam clearly calls for the principle of sustainability to be integrated into all policies. To be honest, Commissioner, on reading the communication, I find too little account has been taken of sustainability, the question of ecological products, incentives for an ecological lifestyle or the question of the impact which I+C technologies have on environmental protection. Improvements are therefore needed here.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: how will our working life and employment relations change? Will people be able to influence how they are organised? We need to consider if we need new joint-decision structures in the face of these revolutionary developments, new structures for listening to employees and making decisions. Greater account needs to be taken of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: the Fifth Framework Programme on research contains a great deal of socio-economic research, the purpose of which is to analyse what holds Europe together in the area of I+C technologies. We cannot fill and heat our locomotive with ordinary fuel and, at the same time, carry out socio-economic flanking research under the framework programme which makes no reference to this communication. In short, we need to heat the locomotive but not to allow it to travel anywhere it pleases. This locomotive needs rails. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The information society has potential to transfer power from government to individual, from bureaucrat to citizen and, of course, from business to consumer. It opens up a global market place and almost limitless information to anyone with access to a computer screen. It is the biggest engine to break down barriers between communities and nationalities that we have ever seen – bigger than any EU directive can possibly be. It offers more power, more choice, lower prices to citizens across Europe and indeed across the world, and in my view the best thing that governments can do in cyberspace is to stay out of it as much as they possibly can and let consumers, businesses and citizens get on with their businesses and their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislators cannot keep up with this technology even if they try to. Technology and industry are better equipped to respond to consumer concerns in what is an immensely competitive market. It is that competitive market which will ensure that consumers are protected, not heavy-handed legislation which might stunt e-commerce and leave others around the world to reap the benefits of a revolution in our economy which is unparalleled since the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century. But we all know that we need a base line of government involvement. We need a basic legislative framework for e-commerce. I hope it will be a light-touch framework, but we need to drive it through quickly because the e-clock is ticking and there are many organisations around the world fighting for this business. It is in our interest to make sure that we get the answers and our legislation right, but also to get them through quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House should drive through the e-commerce directive with its country of origin principle as fast as we possibly can. We should adopt new rules on jurisdiction which trust consumers to make an informed choice about which jurisdiction they want to opt for. We should drive through the liberalisation of the telecoms package, because it is only with a low-cost competitive telecoms market that we can deliver this power, these low prices and these big opportunities to our consumers, because that is the only way to get low prices for our consumers. We want to build on Europe's lead on mobile telephony and adopt the examples of such great global players as Finland's Nokia. Member States should build on the IT skills concepts in their schools, but we must do this quickly because if we do not, others will take the prize on offer here, which is dominance in the global e-commerce market.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With the Lisbon Summit coming up in a few days, I think the European Parliament needs to send out a clear signal to the Member State governments that Europe’s entry into the digital age, and therefore into a new economic area with very considerable potential, must not be at the price of social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for solid social foundations and for consideration of the people’s real needs are, in my view, the <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> of the success of the information society, as we understand it in Europe, i.e. a society that cannot be built only on market forces. We must take the utmost care to ensure that all sectors of society benefit from the information society and that we do not create a society in which social inclusion or exclusion depend on access to the new technologies and the use of their potential.</p>
<p class="contents">I think three points need to be noted, as well as the risks and concerns to which they give rise. The first relates to the users and the risk of a gap emerging between the various victims of social exclusion. The cost of Internet access, the sidelining of entire sectors of society (the young unemployed, housewives, the elderly) and the shortcomings in education and vocational training are serious obstacles to an information society meant to benefit everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">The second relates to the individuals working in this sector; given the flexibility that is a feature of the sector, organisational structures must be set up for the employees, together with guarantees of their rights, in relation to social security, pensions or the necessary job-security provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and last point relates to the question of public service and improving the democratic systems to develop procedures…</p>

I would therefore like to congratulate the Portuguese presidency on its decision to make this issue the focus of the special summit. I should like to congratulate the Commission on its proposal and the rapporteur on her report and I should like to explain why I have praised you and why I should like to take you all at your word.</p>
<p class="contents">The focal point of the report and the prime objective of the Commission’s proposal make it clear that we need to achieve equal opportunities for, and equal participation of, all citizens in the information society. According to the text, <span class="italic">e-Europe</span> should, first and foremost, show each citizen, each household, each school, each company and each administration the way to the digital age and the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">This goal, in my view, does not justify the concerns raised here about a possible division in society between the haves and have-nots as far as access to information is concerned. I have highlighted this objective because I believe that it illustrates to particularly good effect how the citizens stand to benefit from European Union intervention in the information society, but, of course, only if we keep our word and fulfil the promises which we have made them. If we really do ensure by the end of 2002 that all schools – and this is in the programme – have high-speed access to the Internet and to multimedia resources in the classroom, if we really do ensure that by 2003 every citizen, rich or poor, has comprehensively guaranteed access to our health system and if we really do promptly take the action urgently needed in order to promote our SMEs, i.e. hedge the joint risks for venture capital in the Community. That is a task for the Council, Parliament and the Commission. I wish us all a great deal of success in the interests of our citizens.</p>

An information society for all is certainly an area of focus for the Commissioner in this process. It is important, and I thank her for it. Agreement should be reached at Lisbon on the principles of the sustainable funding of social security on account of this notion. We also have to reach agreement with management and labour, for example, on the subject of remote working and vocational training, if what we are talking about is an information society for all. It will not be so if the basic rights of employees are not safeguarded. There is a threat that, because of the Internet, services will become self-services, and that again is a major employment issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Another matter is that we have been deregulating the telecommunications industry for around ten years, and now, with these massive Internet players merging there is a fear that they will once again start regulating the market. This, I think, should be stopped. It cannot be allowed to happen and I expect the Commission to sit up and listen and take the necessary action.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the quoted share value for a certain Internet company rose by a sudden 4 000% in one month, and this came about merely because unsubstantiated information was given about it for the stock market. With many companies in the same position, or almost the same position, there is going to be a bubble effect in the industry, and when the crash comes I hope the taxpayer will not be footing the bill. Has the Commissioner a remedy in mind for if and when the air balloon companies in this sector burst so that the taxpayer does not have to pay out, as is the case with crises in the banks, for example?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">While stressing that many people had hoped for clearer answers in this area from the employment summit, I do not undervalue the relevance of the issue and the need to define a European strategy for the sector. We all know the Union is lagging far behind the United States in this sensitive area, which is so vital to our future. I concur with Mrs Read’s report and, borrowing an expression used here by the President of the Council, António Guterres, I want to highlight the three main deficits in the sector. </p>
<p class="contents">First there is the pragmatic deficit. As the Read report correctly points out, the document put forward by the Commission is full of general guidelines and laudable intentions, but it is weak on concrete measures and ensuing actions. I would not like to believe the Council’s conclusions will be restricted to this list. On this issue, as on others, we do not need more statements and speeches, we need measures and decisions that can reduce the huge lead the United States has on us.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the democratic deficit – which has been greater, admittedly – but it is important to combat the division between those who have access to the Internet, the new technologies and the benefits of the information society, and those deprived of them either for economic reasons, or because of insufficient technological information and education. Our first concern must be to prioritise our commitment to the educational system and in the carrier and telecommunications structures which make access to the Internet cheaper, faster and more powerful.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally there is the investment deficit. As the report rightly affirms, the response to these problems cannot be left to the market alone. A great deal can and must be done in the health system, in public administration, in relations between governments and people, and in public services generally to ensure that Europe takes the qualitative leap we all recognise to be necessary today.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How can we become more competitive? How can we create new markets? How can we create permanent, more highly-qualified jobs? We can take one of the leading roles in tomorrow’s global information society, provided that we learn the script. Europe has talents. Europe has skills. Occasionally we lack competent directors to motivate us. I personally feel that it is important for broad target groups to take an active part in these serious changes. They need to familiarise themselves with the Internet and data bases from an early age. Mrs Hieronymi pointed that out. Schools without computers must become the exception. We need a qualification offensive with computer-aided learning and active use of networks. The European Parliament’s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is calling for the information society to become the common property of all citizens, including the socially weak, the disabled and older people.</p>
<p class="contents">The pace of change is hotting up in the European economy. Undertakings are subject to constant restructuring, new holdings, strategic alliances and friendly or hostile takeovers. The consequences for both employees and managers is the same: greater mobility and faster and faster adjustment. Independence is increasing, as is pseudo-independence. Within companies, responsibilities are changing. Teams have shorter and shorter sell-by dates. That has repercussions for the internal composition and the representation of the interests of employees. Many companies are too small to set up works councils or are so large that relationships are not even forged and employee representatives become roving ambassadors. People in ICT professions who have a great deal of freedom, analysts, engineers and creative planners, want to be their own bosses. They are fighting for new working time regulations and new variable contract-based tariff and remuneration systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, trade unions in other areas fear that unregulated structures will spread and social standards will drop. Citizens must be familiar with new forms of work and working relations in the information and communications industry, be they in the hardware sector, the software sector, services or consultancy.</p>
<p class="contents">Once they are able to share in innovation, once they can be won over by the information society, then it must be made clear that this is a success or an advantage not just for private- and public-sector undertakings, but for consumers and employees alike. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is wonderful that there should be such a lot of interest in this area. I believe it is important that, here in the European Parliament, we should now promote further knowledge of these complex and exciting developments and create a readiness to implement the necessary changes. Commissioner Liikanen, with his personal commitment, and the Commission’s “e-Europe” document represent a positive vision of the new economy and a growth-orientated policy which I wholeheartedly support. </p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that certain Members see the burgeoning information society as a threat, rather than appreciate the opportunities it involves. The significance of e-commerce is difficult to overestimate. Until now, the single market has only been a reality for major companies. e-commerce means that the single market will become accessible in a quite different way to smaller companies and, above all, to individuals, customers and consumers, who can now finally benefit from the whole of the European single market. In the wake of technological change, there will not only be changes to patterns of trade, but new opportunities will also be created where the arts, entertainment and personal contacts are concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to best support the new economy, it is important that we as politicians should not believe that we can foresee companies’ and people’s every need. We must allow the market, that is to say purchasers and vendors, to choose for themselves. In view of the way this part of society and of the economy looks, it is even more important not to engage in a fever of regulation by controlling activities in every detail. Instead, we must further deregulate markets so as to increase competition with a view to reducing prices. That is definitely the best way of making information services available to all citizens. </p>
<p class="contents">An important part of creating growth in the new economy is to increase the flow of venture capital for newly started-up and expanding businesses. We must increase competitiveness and the development of ideas in our part of the world, that is to say in Europe. The most important thing that heads of State and government can do in Lisbon is to begin reducing taxes on capital in their various countries, for it is these which now constitute the greatest obstacle to an increased flow of venture capital. </p>
<p class="contents">To the left-hand side of this House, I would say, following the present debate: try to affirm the opportunities available to people because of the information revolution. Avoid being so fearful and negative. Take Mrs Villiers’ insights on board. Adopt Mr Wijkman’s global and positive attitude, and learn from young Mrs Kauppi’s experiences. I do not think we should underestimate the problem of making the relevant adjustments, but do not bury this initiative in your old conceptual world. That would be Europe’s loss. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, I want first to thank Mrs Read and Parliament for the report, which has been produced extremely rapidly and is very important, because the extraordinary summit will take place next week and the e-Europe initiative is one of the fundamental documents there.</p>
<p class="contents">The subtitle of the e-Europe initiative, “An Information Society for All”, or we could also say as Mr Seppänen has said here, “A Knowledge-based Society for All”, is an indication of the far-reaching objectives of this initiative. We welcome the contribution of Parliament to this very important policy debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently contributing to the preparation of next week's summit in Lisbon. To this end, the Commission has adopted several communications including a progress report on e-Europe last week and a paper setting out an agenda for economic and social renewal for Europe two weeks ago. I find it very important that Parliament is participating through today's debate in the discussions before the Lisbon Summit. The debate has been really illuminating and has shown the great interest and also the expertise of Parliament on this issue. We hope that the Lisbon European Council will endorse concrete, focused policy actions providing a strong signal that European leaders are determined to transform Europe into a dynamic and competitive economy.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the content of your reports, I note that you have expressed concern that mechanisms through which the targets of e-Europe are to be achieved are not made explicit in our initial document. In this context, the progress report submitted by the Commission to the Lisbon Council last week and also submitted to you last week will provide further details. In addition, there will be an e-Europe action plan by June as requested at the Helsinki Summit. I hope that these documents will answer many of your concerns in relation to the realisation of the goals of e-Europe, but it may be that some of the issues will not be addressed, because we must try to remain focused in this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased to see that the report shares the Commission's view on the key elements of e-Europe. It is essential to create a modern multimedia high-performance e-infrastructure, to create legal certainty in e-commerce, to counteract the skills shortage and to improve the availability of risk capital to stimulate innovation. Your support to move forward on these key elements of e-Europe is most welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I find the idea of organising an e-government conference highly interesting. It is important that we in the European institutions, along with Member States, develop effective means of exploiting the potential of regional technologies, to increase both the efficiency and transparency of our interactions with citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I can report to you that this will be one of the main topics of a ministerial conference organised by the Portuguese presidency in Lisbon in early April. I would also like to add that the White Paper on the Commission's internal reform contains an “e-Commission” action. The aim is to enhance the Commission's IT and communications infrastructure in order to provide better service by means of the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to briefly respond to some items where the emphasis of the discussion has perhaps been a little different from the Commission document. The Commission is asked to include an eleventh action line on employment and social cohesion. I fully accept that these are very high priorities, and for that very reason particular communications have been accepted on these subjects. I would like to mention especially the communication “Strategies for Jobs in the Information Society”. I also agree with you that the information society is perhaps the biggest opportunity for structural policies and policies for cohesion that we have had, because it means the death of distance.</p>
<p class="contents">The “e-Europe” communication focuses on the actions necessary to accelerate the transition to the information society. These actions will result in increasing numbers of jobs and will thereby reduce the principal cause of social exclusion, namely unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report expresses concern about the smart card action. I would like to assure you that this action is not intended to intervene in an area that, the report rightly notes, is market-driven. The Commission's role is purely a facilitating one, bringing together the key actors and enabling them to move towards agreement on standard approaches. The aim is not to disadvantage other technologies. It is not clear how the Commission can guarantee ethical security of services, but I fully share the view that we should take all measures to ensure respect for human rights; existing actions, primarily the Internet action plan, address this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to close by thanking you once again for your work in this area. The efforts which you have made confirm that you share with us a sense of the importance and urgency of this issue for Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
