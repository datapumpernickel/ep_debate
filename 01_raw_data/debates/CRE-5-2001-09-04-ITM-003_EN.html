<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE)</span></span>  <span class="italic">, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we hold this annual debate in order to assist the candidate countries, the Commission and the Council in completing their negotiations for enlargement as quickly as possible and also to admonish one or other of them because in many areas we have not seen the progress we want. We should like to point out that is it we who have to ratify at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, there should be no further delay to the enlargement process. We should all create our internal prerequisites, institutional and otherwise, so that the candidate countries do not become hostages to our own reform process. We should make clear that all candidate countries are treated as equals and that countries like Hungary and the Czech Republic will therefore get the number of mandates in the European Parliament to which they are entitled.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also make clear that no one outside the candidate countries and the European Union has any influence over European Union enlargement. It is a matter for the European Union and the candidate countries alone. In saying this, we should also like once again to make clear that in view of what we said last year, namely that the first candidate countries can take part in the 2004 European elections, the accession treaties with those countries that are ready must be concluded by the end of 2002 given that the ratification process will then still have to be completed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, the individual country reports also need to make clear where the individual countries’ strengths and weaknesses lie. I should particularly like to thank the rapporteurs of the various country reports for the commitment they have shown to their respective countries.</p>
<p class="contents">These countries must not only make the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> part of their own legislation, but in the coming year they must also demonstrate that they are capable of implementing it administratively so that they are really ready for membership. Of course, we understand that in some cases there will have to be transitional arrangements, both in the interests of the Union in individual cases and also in the interests of particular candidate countries. But we should like to make clear that transitional arrangements should be kept to a minimum and be for as short a period as possible so that we arrive much more quickly at a coherent union with fewer distortions of competition. It seems important in this connection that economic development, too, cannot yet be regarded as certain in all countries and that this market readiness, this ability to become part of the European internal market, as the Commission made very clear for the various countries last year, is, at the end of the day, another important point that needs to be examined.</p>
<p class="contents">From our point of view, we are deliberately not mentioning any favourites for accession to the European Union, because we know from experience that wrong decisions and mistakes in domestic policy next year may mean that a country that is perhaps fairly well ahead today is not actually ready when the time comes. For that reason, it is a genuine race where everyone has the same opportunities and at the end of the day we measure who is ready for accession at any particular time.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we should also be saying among ourselves that under the present financial arrangements we have assumed that the financial questions of enlargement have been settled for the period up to 2006. I mean that with phasing in<span class="italic"> </span>and phasing out<span class="italic"> </span>periods we shall be able to cope with it.</p>
<p class="contents">From our citizens’ point of view, internal security is an important issue surrounding enlargement. We can therefore only urge the Commission to negotiate particularly clearly and seriously in these areas, just as we take the view that questions of external security are very important. In my opinion, as many EU States as possible should also belong to NATO, but it is up to each individual country to make its own decision in the matter. If as many as possible do belong, we will also have a better chance of developing a single European security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not demand more from the candidate countries than the Member States of the European Union themselves are already doing today and we should not seek to cram into the negotiating package everything we might wish for. We must not require of them more than we ask of ourselves. We must not erect further new barriers.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, when the euro is introduced next year, more money will be available and we ought then to conduct a major campaign to make clear that the economic and political advantages of enlargement extend far beyond the debate about costs. If we can expand the area of security and economic prosperity in Europe, that will be the greatest political achievement of the decade, guaranteeing security and peace on our continent. We ought to strengthen this stability accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries that cannot, should not or do not want to be members of the European Union at present, over and above the twelve with which we are currently negotiating, should also be offered another option than full membership so that we can bind them to the European Union. Countries like Ukraine and others cannot be overlooked in this process if we want long-term stability on this continent.</p>

The European project is highly attractive and has contributed to peace, stability, democracy and prosperity. The appeal is so great that the European Union is currently preparing to double its number of members. The current enlargement process is in itself nothing new for the Union. However, it is unparalleled in its magnitude, the variety of candidate countries and its political and historical dimension. In today’s debate, I should like to discuss three questions with you. Firstly, why enlarge, even if I believe that the answer is evident to this House; secondly, and this might be of more interest to you, what is the exact stage we have reached in the negotiations; and thirdly, how should we prepare for the future?</p>
<p class="contents">Why enlargement? You, Madam President and honourable Members, may know the answer to that question, but maybe some of what I am about to say will seep through the walls of this Hemisphere and enter the sphere of public opinion, which is still regularly exercised by this issue as, of course, it is fully entitled to be.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, the future of Europe and enlargement of the Union are inextricably linked. Enlargement <span class="italic">is</span> the future of Europe. Pursuant to the objectives set out in Helsinki, the European Council of Nice took all the necessary steps to ensure that the Union will be in a position to welcome the new Member States. We could have easily rejected the compromise reached in Nice, but we opted not to do that so as not to send out the wrong message, namely that of an indecisive and reticent Europe, at the wrong time, that is to say on the eve of the reunification of Europe. Enlargement specifically embodies the magnanimous and open vision of the original European project. The decision in favour of enlargement, rightly deemed irrevocable at the European Council in Gothenburg, reflects the importance which the founders of Europe attached to international solidarity. Today’s Member States remain just as committed to this aim.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlarging the Union is an historical duty. Our peoples, who have been separated by history for far too long, must have a chance to be reunited. In addition to the genuine historical challenge, enlargement is also a political project. This project brings us, European leaders and elected Members, face to face with our responsibilities. We must henceforth make every effort to ensure a stable, secure and prosperous future for our fellow citizens in an enlarged Europe. Enlargement was, and still is, imperative in order to prevent destabilisation in the candidate countries, as well as the expressions of such destabilisation. The growing influx of refugees, the rise in crime, etc. spring to mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The unfortunate events in the Balkans in the last ten years have shown that a region cannot be stabilised without introducing and consolidating the enlargement or association process. In some of the countries of the former Yugoslavia, destabilisation has led to a deterioration in the rule of law and to the emergence of new hotbeds of international crime. The Union will have to strive hard to combat transnational criminal networks. In its efforts to stabilise the region, the Union introduced an association and stability process at the Zagreb Conference, which will naturally result in a European perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the positive results of future enlargement are already tangible. In Central and Eastern Europe, stable governments have been established which have adopted the common values, or the values which they have in common with us, such as democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and the protection of minorities. The remarkable improvement in the security of Europe and new prospects for economic development are the direct result of this. Enlargement, even if it is still to be translated into reality, is already making Europe more prosperous and enhancing its influence. In addition, we are also noticing – to put it in blunt, materialistic terms – that the amount of foreign direct investment – and I mean that in the candidate countries – is constantly increasing. The Union has become the largest trading partner of the thirteen candidate countries. The Member States therefore reap many benefits. The enlarged Europe will consist of 500 million citizens and, in economic terms, these are 500 million consumers. That is sufficient to allow the Union, also in economic terms, to better assert and defend its specific character in a world which is increasingly turning into a ‘village’, to borrow a term from a Canadian sociologist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, in the candidate countries, enlargement has become a strong incentive to take the measures needed to make the transition to a market economy. The implementation of these measures is still painful and has sometimes even been extremely painful. In several candidate countries, however, these changes have already led to rapid, balanced growth, making it possible to improve people’s standard of living. So, what stage have the negotiations reached? Since July, the Belgian Presidency has, as it pledged it would, been continuing the work begun by the Swedish Presidency, on the basis of the principles set out in Nice and according to the timetable agreed at the Gothenburg Summit. The Presidency is taking great pains to keep within the confines of its role of facilitator, to avoid taking over from the Commission and to allow the Commission and relevant Commissioners to conduct the negotiations. The Member States’ governments warmly welcomed the presentation of our work programme on enlargement at the General Affairs Council meeting in July. They all stressed the importance of carefully monitoring the implementation of the commitments made by the candidate countries, as did Mr Brok, when he expanded on the question that he submitted.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to open up all the negotiating chapters. Malta still lacks the chapter on agriculture and Bulgaria still has eight chapters that must be examined. Furthermore, in accordance with the Gothenburg conclusions, the Belgian Presidency will support the efforts made and to be made by Romania, which still has 14 negotiating chapters to be opened. In the case of several candidate countries, we will soon have completed the critical mass of the chapter that is provisionally concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">By this, I mean that the number of chapters which have already been negotiated, and for which provisional agreements have been reached, is such that the question now becoming increasingly specific and, therefore, increasingly urgent concerns the differentiation in treatment of candidate countries, each according to its merits, as well as the question of knowing how the negotiations will end. This time could, in fact, come sooner than we were expecting.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian Presidency is striving to maintain the intensive pace of negotiations. At the first meeting of substitute members on 27 July 2001, seven chapters were examined, five of which were concluded. Seven have now been able to be concluded with all the candidate countries. These were the chapters on statistics, small and medium-sized enterprises, research, education, health and consumers, as well as foreign relations. Those chapters that are still to be negotiated – and this will come as no surprise – are some of the most difficult. In addition to chapters on the free movement of workers and the environment, we tackled issues involving justice and home affairs, competition, transport, energy, fisheries, agriculture and taxation. In some of these areas, considerable progress was made. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the enlargement process cannot, however, be reduced simply to the conclusion of negotiating points. Every country must comply with and continue to comply with the economic and political criteria of Copenhagen and must implement these effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies in particular to a country with which we have not yet begun negotiations. I am, of course, referring to Turkey. During a visit by the Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, Louis Michel, to Ankara in July, he reminded the Turkish authorities that they have every interest in focusing on implementing the accession partnership. This will enable Turkey to comply with the political criteria set out at Copenhagen. As for Cyprus, we are pleased with the progress that has been made in the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the pace of negotiations does not depend on the efforts of the Commission, the Council or the Presidency alone. External events can sometimes influence them, or disrupt them. I am thinking, for example, of the beginning of the election campaign in Poland, or of the new Bulgarian government that has come into power. I am nonetheless counting on a positive outcome in both cases. Indeed, I believe that these changes will not slow down the pace of negotiations, which so far has been swift for both countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important event will take place in November, when the Commission publishes in-depth reports on the preparation of candidate countries. The information contained in these reports will allow the Presidency, at the Laeken European Council, to provide the following presidencies with clear indications as to what needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, how then do we manage the future? The conclusions of the European Councils in Nice and Gothenburg gave a boost to the enlargement process. The quality of this process is now just as important as the number of chapters being negotiated. On this point, I would like to say to Mr Brok that he is of course right, at least in my personal opinion, to urge us not to ask more of the candidate countries than we ask of ourselves. That is very true, but even so, the candidate countries have every interest in ensuring that the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> is implemented in the optimal fashion, because otherwise there is a risk that the initial stage of their membership of the European Union will be very difficult and very painful. I believe that we must help them to avoid this sort of situation. Achieving the aims that we identified at Nice and Gothenburg will depend on two very important factors. First of all, the determination of EU Member States – of all of us, in other words – to translate the commitments that we have taken into action. Member States will have to adopt common positions within the deadlines specified in the road map, and will have to determine transitional periods if necessary, even if this may, and will, give rise to difficulties. The second factor is, as I pointed out, whether the candidate countries can provide, within a reasonable time, sufficient and substantial information on their ability to comply with the required criteria, and also on their ability to prove that this process has been set in motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will wind up my speech but, before I do, I should like to say something about the outcome of the Irish referendum, especially in connection with enlargement. The outcome of the referendum has led to all manner of speculation on the feasibility of enlargement. Although enlargement on a purely legal plane is feasible without ratification of the Treaty by all the Member States, it must nevertheless be underlined that non-ratification of the Treaty would send an entirely wrong political signal to the candidate countries at a time when a segment of public opinion in those countries is starting to question the merits of this process, which is perceived as a restriction on their newly regained sovereignty. I am always reminded of that prime minister of a candidate country who stated in Brussels recently: ‘We have been told for ten years that we will be joining in ten years’ time. Well, if that situation lasts too long, nations and governments will begin to lose their patience.’</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the magnitude and institutional repercussions of enlargement, I advocate the Union adopting a realistic, responsible and ambitious stance. The enlargement of the Union must indeed be responsible; this means that the vital functions of the Union must be safeguarded. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, let it be clear that enlargement will put pressure on key components of the common or Community policy – the common agricultural policy and the structural funds policy spring to mind. To combat this will require courage and determination from the Member States and therefore from all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement also requires that we adopt an ambitious attitude in terms of devising new common policies. The introduction of a genuine common policy on fighting crime and harmonising asylum and immigration policy is needed now more than ever. In addition, the Union must also step up its efforts in the field of the common foreign and security policy. The Union must acquire the resources in order to deal with a destabilising crisis on the borders of an enlarged Europe – the Europe of tomorrow, in other words. It is crucially important that the Union have the necessary tools to manage unstable areas.</p>
<p class="contents">As the initial accession stage approaches, the Union must enhance its dialogue with the neighbouring countries of an enlarged Europe. What will be important, and is already important, is to reassure these countries about the impact of enlargement in terms of partnership and association agreements. Our very fruitful and extensive dialogue with Russia, but not only with Russia, is a concrete example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I should like to say that enlargement remains a political project. Whether this project is managed well or badly will determine whether Europe’s unity will be strengthened or weakened. In our society, a broadly-based debate must be held in order to clearly set out the risks and benefits of the project. Misunderstandings must be cleared up. The concerns of the citizens of the Member States, but also of the citizens of the candidate countries, must be taken seriously and must be responded to appropriately. As the initial accessions draw closer, more and clearer information must be provided than has been the case to date.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement offers enormous scope. However, it also imposes conditions and restrictions on both parties. The credibility of accession requires efforts on all sides. The Belgian Presidency has pledged to maintain the intensive pace of negotiations. It will ensure that the conditions for accession are met. The candidate countries will still need to make great efforts in order to implement the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. We have a very long way to go, but we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. We can now start counting the months, rather than the years. We can now also start telling all the candidate countries with which we have begun negotiations that they are future Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is no doubt that the accession of, certainly, twelve countries in the short term and that of thirteen countries in the somewhat longer term will turn our Union into something other than what we have known so far. That has been the case with each new accession. Each new acceding state, each new acceding nation has added something extra. I will not enter into any detail, for that could lead to bad feeling and that is not my intention. It is evident that this will also happen when new Member States join. The adventure which we started around ten years ago – at least the concept of it – is thus reaching successful completion, but that success will only be achieved if we all make the efforts needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore welcome the opportunity to take stock of the year and describe the tasks that still lie ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin by sincerely thanking the European Parliament and all its groups and committees for their great commitment to the process of EU enlargement. You have all done a great deal to give this historic project political credibility and to give democratic legitimacy to the enlargement process. In the decisive closing stage of negotiations the Commission continues to rely on Parliament’s support, and I am pleased to be able to say, on the basis of the contribution from Mr Brok, the rapporteur, and the presentation from the President-in-Office, that there continues to be a high level of broad solid agreement between the three institutions, Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">After the Councils of Nice and Göteborg it is clear that enlargement will come, and come soon. The point of no return is definitely behind us. The project is now irreversible. I do not want to reawaken the controversy surrounding the Treaty of Nice, but I would like to point out that this Treaty contains essential political conditions for the conclusion of the accession treaties. I, too, have my doubts as to whether the treaty is the best possible solution both to the question of institutional adjustments and to that of the combination of deepening and enlargement that many, myself included, believe necessary. But I fear there will always be differences of opinion over the best possible solution to this problem. But living in Europe means living with compromises. The Commission is therefore pressing for ratification of the Treaty of Nice here in the European Parliament and in the parliaments of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, the treaty fell at the first hurdle, the referendum in Ireland. The answer to such a referendum cannot be a simple “as you were”. If we simply close our eyes and continue, we shall be shipwrecked and miss out on a great historic opportunity. Enlargement must not be sacrificed to growing alienation between Europe’s citizens and the European institutions and decision-making processes. The answer to the warning signal from Ireland is also, but not only, a question of proper communication. Perhaps Europe’s citizens are looking for a more fundamental and more complex answer. As I see it, there is an intrinsic link between the debate about Europe’s future and the debate about our future borders. We need to make that link.</p>
<p class="contents">Nice has paved the way for negotiations to be steered towards the really substantive questions, as the candidates urgently require. The ‘road map’ presented by the Commission and approved by the Heads of State and Government is more than a timetable for negotiations. At heart it is a commitment by the 15 Member States to find common positions by particular deadlines, even in areas where interests are widely divergent. At the same time, this tells the candidates that their efforts are worthwhile and that nothing is being put off.</p>
<p class="contents">After almost a year, we can say that the Nice strategy has motivated the candidate countries enormously and that the transposition of Community law is running more quickly and more smoothly. At the same time, the candidate countries are showing greater flexibility in adjusting their positions and there have been genuine breakthroughs in negotiations as a result. The treatment of the free movement of workers issue is an instructive example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The desired time frame for the first accessions was then clearly defined in Göteborg. That came at the right moment. On the one hand, the progress in negotiations made it possible to define the finishing line for those applicant countries that are adequately prepared; on the other hand, the Göteborg decision gives the parliaments and governments of the candidate countries the necessary political tailwind to mobilise all their forces and respond to the doubters that most certainly exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Making the 2004 European elections the point of reference for the accessions is an idea that originated here in the European Parliament a year ago. We reached agreement on it in our debate last year. I am very pleased that we actually managed to follow the way pointed by the European Parliament at the Councils in Nice and Göteborg. I believe it was a wise decision not to set any specific accession dates for individual countries at Göteborg or to define groups for accession. The basic principles of the process – namely individual merits, differentiation and the chance to catch up – are working. If we stick to these principles, we shall arrive at a natural and real accession scenario that is justified by the results of negotiations alone. The Commission will be sticking to this line resolutely. I am also saying this to counter the view that in the end the decisions taken will be purely political, political here in the bad sense of the word.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will not propose the conclusion of an accession treaty for each individual applicant until it is convinced that the applicant is well enough prepared and satisfies all the conditions. I am not therefore going to speculate today about how many, and which, new members will already be represented in the next European Parliament. All I can say today is that 10 of the 12 countries we are negotiating with have decided that they want to use the Göteborg time frame. It would be a serious breach of trust if we were now to say to individual candidates: “You are in, in any event” or “Whatever happens, you are going to have to wait a little longer”. We shall therefore have to prepare ourselves for the possibility that we might have to accept an initial accession group of as many as 10 applicants. That sounds more drastic that it actually is, because those 10 together represent around 75 million citizens, while all 13 candidate countries together make up a population of 185 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office has already indicated how much progress we have made in the negotiations. I can, in fact, confirm that the question of the substance of the individual chapters is more important than the mere compilation of figures. It is quite possible that countries which have concluded fewer chapters than others are nevertheless further on in their preparations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> The example of the free movement of workers has shown the difficulty of the issues we now have to deal with. The compromise based on the Commission proposal will bring the most liberal and most flexible solution to the problem yet seen. We shall need as much freedom of movement as possible, and for a number of years also as much security as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to use this example to point once again to the Commission’s understanding of its own role in enlargement. The Commission has to look to the interests of the Union as a whole. It is in the interests of the Union as a whole that enlargement should not demand more of any Member State than it is actually able to give. In making its proposals, the Commission also has to take into account what the applicant countries and future members are able to bear and what they are not. Unless we are able to compromise, we shall not make the necessary progress, especially since we are now faced with highly controversial issues such as justice and home affairs, competition, taxation, transport, the budget, regional policy and agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to negotiating the chapter on justice and home affairs, the protection of the future external borders is a central issue. We are faced here with a classic conflict of aims. On the one hand, enlargement must not lead to a new division of Europe. There must be no new dividing lines created. Traditional cross-border contacts that often go back hundreds of years must not be made impossible or intolerably difficult, especially in places where the same language is spoken on both sides of the borders and there are close cultural ties.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, at the end of this round of enlargement we will have an eastern border extending almost from the North Cape almost to the Bosporus. That border will have to meet the security needs of today’s EU citizens. A secure frontier is one of the essential prerequisites. New members will not be able to be fully integrated into the Schengen system until the border system fully meets Schengen standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The other topics, such as taxation and competition, and to a large extent also agriculture, raise enormous social questions. On the one hand, this concerns the functioning of the internal market, but on the other also the matter of social cohesion in the countries undergoing transformation. We shall have to decide how much flexibility the Union is able to show so that enlargement is not experienced as a social shock in the future new Member States the day after accession.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to agriculture, we are dealing with an <span class="italic">acquis</span> that may change radically in the next few years. Many observers believe it would be better to go for agricultural reform first and then talk to the candidate countries about agriculture. If we were to do that, we would be setting a new condition. There would not be an enlargement timetable that was anything like reliable. The end of the project would be put off indefinitely.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the financing of enlargement, the Commission will ensure that the budgetary effects of its proposals for negotiating positions are fully in line with the expenditure ceilings agreed in Berlin for the period up until 2006. Account must, of course, be taken of the necessary adjustments for the number of new Member States provided for in Agenda 2000. But even with those adjustments, we shall not exceed the ceiling decided in Berlin in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to turn now to the situation in the candidate countries themselves. The transposition of Community law is now proceeding apace everywhere. Most countries have taken highly effective organisational measures to deal with the massive amount of legislation in time. The instruments deployed, in particular twinning and interparliamentary cooperation, have also proved their worth.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will be describing the progress made in meeting the Copenhagen criteria in the progress reports for the year 2001. These reports will be discussed by the Commission and adopted in early November.</p>
<p class="contents">What we can say today is this: the trend of the last few years is continuing. All the applicant countries with whom we have been negotiating continue to satisfy the political criteria. It is clear that the prospect of membership has made a decisive contribution to stability in the young democracies of Central and Eastern Europe. The value of the system’s stability for Europe as a whole can be seen everywhere where there are no concrete prospects for accession. We see increasingly that a definite expectation of accession is the strongest and most effective motor for necessary reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to leave you in no doubt that in the negotiations the Commission is continuing to press for human rights and the rights of minorities to be fully respected. That includes banning all discrimination on grounds of age, gender, sexual orientation or religious conviction. We are continuing to observe carefully the position of minorities and the development of the rule of law. It is symptomatic that national minorities in the applicant states are particularly keen on rapid accession because they see membership of the European Union as their most effective form of protection.</p>
<p class="contents">While the situation of the Russian minorities in the Baltic countries continues to improve, the integration of the Roma remains a thorny and substantial issue. It would be pure illusion to think that social and cultural discrimination against the Roma could be abolished before accession. That will take decades to achieve. But we are asking all applicant states to develop credible strategies to improve the integration of the Roma and to put them into practice before accession.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also at last see light at the end of the tunnel as regards the condition of orphanage children and the adoption trade in Romania. I want to be cautious because we have already experienced many disappointments, and in the past many fine words have not been matched by deeds. But with the present government that is starting to change. Its readiness to enforce a moratorium on international adoptions was an important sign.</p>
<p class="contents">There are such overwhelming indications that the existing system has knowingly and deliberately encouraged the abuse of children that the entire system will have to be radically reformed before international adoptions can be allowed again. I am convinced that parents who really want children and reputable non-governmental organisations that help them to satisfy that desire will be the first to understand that protecting children against possible abuse must be the top priority. At this point I should like to mention that the European Parliament’s rapporteur for Romania, Baroness Nicholson, has personally done the greatest service in uncovering an incredibly corrupt system and that the progress we can now see would not have come about without her persistence.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">So far as the economic criteria are concerned, even when we apply the necessarily strict yardsticks we can see that here, too, the positive trend is continuing. Free-market reforms have not yet been completed everywhere, but the market economy has been established everywhere. In most cases, the applicant countries are already competitive on the internal market because the exchange of goods and services between them and the EU has to a large extent already been liberalised.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall economic situation is another matter. We need to be very, very realistic here. It is true that the candidate countries are achieving higher growth rates than the EU-15 average, but economically they are still a very long way behind. It will be a very long time before we can speak of a real approximation. Here, too, we should be speaking in terms of a period of a whole generation. This means that, even after the accessions, enlargement will not have a drastic economic effect on the present Member States. Most of the positive economic effects are already with us. They will continue to grow. But enlargement will not at first bring large annual boosts to growth for the EU 15, although, of course, border regions and the future Member States’ neighbours in general will experience stronger positive effects.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, the economic effect must not be underestimated. There will be a sustained improvement in EU growth in the long term. The European Union’s roll in international competition will be strengthened. The economics and finance ministers and the Commission are watching the macroeconomic direction taken by the future new members closely. In some of them, inflation rates and budget deficits are too high. The balance of payments in some candidate countries has structural weaknesses. There is intensive dialogue with the candidate countries about macroeconomic stability and there is no dispute about the objective.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the impending introduction of the euro I want to point out once again that the new members will not automatically belong to the euro zone. That requires special preparation and a separate decision. The Maastricht criteria will have to be satisfied in full. But there will be no opting out of monetary union either. At present, there are clear priorities: first the Copenhagen criteria for accession, then the Maastricht criteria for the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">I can already say that the Commission’s next strategy paper will focus on the assessment of the third Copenhagen criterion, namely the complete application of EU law. That is a perfectly logical sequence. Up until now, the main thing was the transposition of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> itself. Now we are looking primarily at the ability to enforce and apply it in full. As you know, there were still major deficits in this area last year. We have strongly urged the applicant countries to remove those deficits. I must repeat here what I said on an earlier occasion: severe deficits remaining in the areas of administrative capacities and the legal system may become serious obstacles to accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding, I want to say a brief word about two regional problems, Cyprus and Kaliningrad. Our strategic objective is still to receive a united Cyprus as a new member. We are therefore continuing to give our strong support to the UN Secretary-General’s efforts to find a solution to the Cyprus conflict. I am very pleased to be able to say that we are working closely and confidently with the United Nations in this question. It was no accident that the UN Secretary-General’s meeting with the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr Denktash in Salzburg last Tuesday was preceded by a meeting between Mr Denktash and myself the day before. I must thank the foreign ministers of Greece, Turkey and Cyprus, the presidency and the special representatives of the United Nations, the United Kingdom and the USA for their close cooperation and constructive dialogue in this matter. I very much hope that things will now get moving again on the Cyprus issue and that talks on substantive issues will soon begin.</p>
<p class="contents">We should now concentrate all our efforts on resolving the conflict and refrain from speculating about what we might do if we fail. The Helsinki resolutions apply and give us all the room for manoeuvre we need.</p>
<p class="contents">Kaliningrad is an entirely different matter. It concerns the effects of enlargement on our neighbours, in this case Russia. While fully recognising Russian sovereignty over the Kaliningrad territory, we have made proposals to Russia about how Kaliningrad can benefit from its position as a kind of island within the EU in future. Dialogue in the matter has started, albeit rather sluggishly. We would like to see a faster tempo here. The immediate neighbours in the region, Poland and Lithuania, share our point of view. It is a general principle that enlargement should not harm third countries. In Russia’s case in particular I am absolutely convinced that Russia will benefit once the political and economic dynamics of the enlarged Union on Russia’s borders show their full effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Now one question remains. How can we ensure that people in the European Union and in the candidate countries will agree to the objective of enlargement? We need to make greater efforts here. I agree with what Mr Brok said about it. I have a proper degree of scepticism about opinion polls. But we cannot ignore the Eurobarometer findings and the trends in opinion in the candidate countries. However, we must not see the question of acceptance as purely a problem of communication. If we have problems of communication in politics, in my experience the problem lies with the policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people are frightened by enlargement. If those fears are based on fact, we can deal with them by information and participation. But if the fears are unspecific or part of a very general unease about the way European things are going, then we need more than a communication strategy. Then, the key issue is: What does Europe still mean to the people in the European Union? How can we make the idea of European unification as inspiring again as it once was?</p>
<p class="contents">If today’s European Union does not inspire people, how can we expect the prospects of an even larger EU to give rise to positive expectations? The answers to these questions must be found in another debate, but that debate has already begun. If we can develop clarity of goals and of language, if we can find enough courage and vision, then social acceptance for enlargement will also be forthcoming.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first to say a word to the Council. Please do not take it personally, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, we think highly of you, we are always pleased to see you and you do excellent work. But there were long drawn out negotiations over the date for this debate so as to enable President-in-Office Louis Michel to be present. Then we agreed on this Tuesday. Now he has stayed in Durban, which I do not want to criticise in itself, but I would like to say that the Council must be reformed,</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">that foreign ministers are the wrong people, not only because EU policy is not foreign policy, but because foreign ministers do not have the time to perform their duties in the European Union! We are going to be talking about governance – Commission President Prodi will be saying something about it later –, and the change must begin with the Council, not only as regards transparency, but we also need new structures so that the relevant members of the national governments are also always present here in Parliament. In other words, to be specific, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, if you had full powers over European policy and were not now dependent on your foreign minister, we would welcome that. So that is no personal criticism of yourself.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are very pleased that there is a broad majority across the groups here in Parliament – and with the Commission, too – on the questions of enlargement, and we say emphatically – as Mr Brok has also said – that enlargement is to everyone’s advantage, and we must say it in our member countries, too. National politicians, too, must say that enlargement is to the advantage of the present European Union and of the accession countries. No one would have thought 20 years ago that today we would be talking about the countries of central Europe being able to join our community of values. That is a tremendous historical development.</p>
<p class="contents">And I would also like to say a word of recognition to the accession countries, which have embarked on tremendous reforms after 50 years of communism. What they are doing is not a simple matter and instead of only ever giving voice, in the countries of the European Union, to certain fears about the dangers we should also say a word of recognition for the people in the accession countries for making this tremendous effort.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The accession countries also have dignity. I cannot understand why heads of government in the countries of the European Union tell the heads of government in the accession countries: Yes, we must demand a long period for freedom of movement because we have national elections. The accession countries also have dignity and an internal political situation, and our national heads of government ought to recognise that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe there will be a mass migration. I have the figures for the Federal Republic of Germany: in the last ten years, 900 000 people came to the Federal Republic of Germany from Poland, but 700 000 of them went back again. Commissioner, you are quite right: If the countries have the prospect of becoming members of the European Union, their citizens will not migrate but will prefer to stay at home. That is after all quite natural human behaviour, and so we should not demonise this question or abuse it for internal political reasons. We need a great deal of flexibility for the questions of freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I very much welcome what you said about border controls. On the one hand, the borders must remain open, the right to asylum must be guaranteed. People wanting to enter the Union across the external borders must also be treated humanely, and that is why we advocate a European border police. We should show solidarity, that is the countries with no external borders with the countries that have an external border. A European multinational border police would be a sensible way of cultivating mutual solidarity here.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, of course, also think of the border regions of the present countries of the European Union, which will have problems, and I note from a press release that you are also particularly sympathetic to the problems of these border regions. We will also increase acceptance in our border regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to one very particular problem, Commissioner, namely developments in Romania. We were very concerned to see that an opposition party that is not represented in parliament but which has a long tradition, the PNTCD, was banned there last week with dubious legal arguments, and I would ask you to look into the matter, because democracy and debate on a democratic basis are a high value and we ought to pay attention to that in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A final comment, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck: We know that in your case European policy is in good hands. We are approaching the Laeken summit, and if the decision about the convention, about a conference, is taken there, would you kindly ensure that the accession countries, too, are involved in the process in a sensible manner for the purpose of consultation and information, because we owe it to those countries because we shall have a common future with them in the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hänsch (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if anyone is looking for a juicy bit of controversy between Parliament and the Commission or Parliament and the Council, or even a juicy bit of controversy between the major parties here, I have to disappoint them. We all want and continue to want to make enlargement a success and it is not a matter for party political sabre rattling, Mr Poettering. I therefore have no difficulty in signalling to Mr Brok and everyone else that my group will be voting in favour of the resolution tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the enlargement reports and in fact all the country reports. There may be a difference of emphasis here or there, but over all both the resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the country reports satisfy my group’s principles and criteria for the continuation of the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with, and support, the Commission’s strategy as explained by Mr Verheugen today. We stick firmly to the principle of merit for the conclusion of negotiations with the candidate countries, and we also agree to your plan of saying that by 2004 ten candidate countries may have managed to conclude negotiations according to our criteria. It need not be 10, but it may be 10. We are prepared for that. We also agree with attention being shifted in future reports from the transposition of EU law to the application and enforcement of EU law. That is, in fact, one of the most important points that we must make clear and stick to until the accession treaties are concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">But we understand the target date not just as a window of opportunity for the accession countries. We also see the target date of 2004 as a means of applying pressure on the Member States themselves not only to pay attention to how and to what extent the candidates are solving their problems but also to ensure that the Member States themselves do not create new problems for accession. And that is the rub if we have set our eyes on the year 2004 as the target date. Of course – and here I support what Mr Verheugen, Mr Brok and Mr Poettering have said – we shall talk about the risks, the burdens and the deficits of the present enlargement process. There are many points there. But if we want to win the people of Europe over to support what we are planning and what we have to do, we must not speak only about burdens and risks. We must also speak about what all of us in Europe stand to gain from enlargement. Then let us talk about how reform of the common agricultural policy is naturally about financing and about reform. That is correct.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us also say that it is about strengthening consumer protection in Europe. Let us say that the security of the Union’s food supply will be preserved and must be further strengthened after enlargement. Let us say that enlargement presents no risk to environmental protection, on the contrary that in a few years’ time EU standards will apply in the whole of Europe and not just in the western part. That is an advantage for us, too, not just for the east Europeans. Let us make clear to the people in the EU that we can fight international crime and corruption better in the European Union than if the countries of eastern Europe are left outside, if the laws we have created to fight international crime also apply in eastern Europe. Let us talk about how enlargement will benefit us all because we will carry more political, economic and also ecological weight in the world, in a world that is becoming increasingly globalised. That in Europe together we will have more chance of meeting the challenges of globalisation than if we in Europe diverge into east and west or north and south. And economic and social cohesion, social solidarity in Europe will extend to Europe as a whole, and that is an advantage not only for the east, it is an advantage for us as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Funding up until 2006 is secured. But that does not mean that enlargement will come at no cost. Most surely not. It has its price. But non-enlargement is expensive, too. It costs much more than enlargement. Its price is economic, social, ecological and political stability in Europe, above all else its price is trust. Failure to enlarge will deprive Europe of its future. Basically, we are on the point of taking a step comparable to the situation in 1989/1990 for the whole of Europe. What is at stake is not merely one or other transitional period, not that this or that project or programme or fund will work better or worse. Neither is it only about this or that advantage for one country or another. It is about something very simple: It is about the future of all Europeans. And there we are only at the start of the debate. After the failure of Nice we are also setting great hopes on the Belgian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate about the future of Europe must not be conducted only in the Member States, it must also be conducted in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and in Cyprus and Malta.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, since our debate last year on enlargement, there has been very considerable and commendable progress. During this past year, several of the states in the Helsinki group have already in effect caught up with those in the earlier Luxembourg group. It is a year where the emphasis and the élan which was brought to this task by the Swedish Presidency has borne fruit. This is a process that I am sure will be continued and deepened by our friends in the Belgian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the European Council, with the encouragement of the European Commission, adopted the date of the next European election as a target timetable, all the while emphasising and respecting the fact that we should continue with a case by case analysis based on differentiation. It may well indeed be possible that ten states could be ready by that time and if that is the case, that would be very welcome. But we should not impose on those who are ready by that time the burden and failures of those who may not be and therefore we must still cleave to this notion of differentiation as the leitmotif through which we should analyse the outcomes.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a very disquieting level of public support indicated by opinion polls. The Commissioner is right in that we should not get carried away excessively by following every poll but when they are so consistent, underneath it there is a message. And again I would congratulate the Commission in the past 12 months on the deepening and extension of the information and communications policy. But it is very clear that that alone will not be enough. We need political leadership and political vision. We need the big picture to be put in place to convince people what the nature of this historic project is of. In that regard there is the question of the free movement of labour. I am bound to say on behalf of my own group that the Liberal Democrats here in this House are unhappy at the pace with which the thought of having a systematic ban on the free movement of labour became the <span class="italic">politique acquise</span>. We think that indeed there may be a burden but more empiricism and more reflection may have helped. At the end of the day whether it is realpolitik or empiricism that brings us to this conclusion, my group would appeal that each Member State would reflect on its own position and where possible would opt out from this particular policy. Already I understand four states, Ireland, Denmark, Sweden and Netherlands have given such an indication. I would appeal to other states to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">But inside this there is another real issue. The frontline border regions are the regions of our European integration process. We here in this House must express our concern for an enhancement of regional policy focus in those places because these regions will carry the most immediate consequence of enlargement. This solidarity is something we must inject into this debate, as Europeans, with greater vigour and not simply leave it to local or national interests to make the case.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the current state of the enlargement debate, I meet many friends in the candidate states in politics and diplomacy who worry about various tensions that have emerged. My own sense is to say to them they should take reassurance from this. We are now getting real. The shadow boxing has finished and these tensions reflect the reality that we are now in a vigorous process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally three very quick points which I do not have the time to develop. I should like to be reassured by the Commission that the failure to establish paying agencies for Sapard in so many states for reasons which I understand will not mitigate against the carryover of funding that we have dedicated for structural agricultural reform. Secondly, I welcome what the Commissioner had to say on Cyprus and Kaliningrad. I salute what he says about the optimum desires for Cyprus and I hope the UN process will take off with his and others' encouragement but we must remember never to make the best the enemy of the good. Finally, on the question of the Irish referendum, the message given both by the Council and the Commission today is an important one. Yes there may be legal means to get us over the legal niceties but there is within this a political signal and message and the signal must be, that however we may criticise the Nice Treaty, and we all do, we must get over that hurdle as a precondition politically not to do with enlargement but to do it ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group truly regards 2004 as a target timetable by which it is possible – not certain, but possible – that as many as ten new countries may join the European Union. Simultaneous accession by such a large group would,, of course, bring the advantage that we would avoid new division lines between the applicant countries, and in my opinion this is something which we must earnestly strive towards.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hänsch did a fine job of explaining how the enlargement process is one in which both the current and the future Member States of the European Union will benefit: everyone can benefit from this. I wish however to stress that this means that we must truly be able to create an economic and social dynamic so that these benefits will be realised even in the pre-accession period. Here I wish to stress the emphasis which my group places on this point: sustainable development must be sustainable not only economically, but also ecologically and socially. We need to emphasise that the applicant countries must take very seriously any Community legislation which aims to strengthen these sustainable characteristics. It goes without saying that children's rights and the principle of non-discrimination are the sort of principles to which we, as Europeans, must hold fast.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr. President, our group hopes that it would be possible to deploy additional resources in order to expedite this dynamic. Here we refer to the fact that the Community's funding framework for the years 2000-2006 contains some resources which could possibly be freed, since quite obviously no new Member States will be joining in 2002. Those resources which are freed on account of this fact could be deployed, even in the pre-accession period, as tools of agricultural and structural policy in order to strengthen this positive dynamic. We would like to see the common agricultural policy strongly reformed in such a direction that, instead of making direct aid payments to large farmers in the European Union or in the applicant countries, these resources would be firmly shifted to rural development and quality-oriented food production.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, one very important shortcoming in this process is that the involvement of citizens has, up to now, been particularly poor. We would like to take part in serious consideration of how we could increase the participation of ordinary citizens in the enlargement process also in the applicant countries, since at the moment what is happening is that it is only the narrow élites of society who find enlargement to their advantage, and it is these people who are pushing enlargement. A great many people, however, are perplexed, and fear that enlargement will be to their detriment. The position of women and the fight against poverty must be taken into account, and our group would like to emphasise these matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Madam President-in-Office, if you have compared this accession process with others, I think it must be made even clearer that this accession process is qualitatively quite different, not only because of the number of countries, the languages, the territory, the population, but also historically, because it is a far-reaching cultural opening towards Central and Eastern Europe such as has hardly been discussed before, because it is an economic and social challenge on an entirely new scale, and, of course, also because of the far-reaching foreign and security policy implications.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of that, my agreement to what many of the previous speakers have said must be qualified. I think the policies pursued by the governments and also by the Commission are seriously flawed, even though I do recognise the commitment you have shown, Commissioner Verheugen, the progress made in negotiations and the great support given by the EU to the accession process. I would like to highlight five questions:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in my opinion the involvement of the citizens has been minimal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, hardly any attempt is being made to use the opportunity presented by eastward enlargement to overcome the Nice crisis and for the democratic and social shaping of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, equality for the accession countries has not in my opinion been adequately achieved. That applies to the question, which has already been raised, of the excessively long transitional periods for the free movement of workers just as much as to the lack of clarity that is now emerging over transfers to agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I have to say clearly that the Commission’s recent decision on funding for border regions is irresponsible. A year ago, Mr Verheugen, you made quite different promises in the regions concerned. You are being measured against them there and I am measuring you against them. As you well know and others here have already mentioned, these are the very regions, above all others, where expansion will be experienced directly. Whosoever wants it to be an economic, social and political success and not a breeding ground for nationalist sentiment must change this position.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, I find it totally unsatisfactory that the number of Czech and Hungarian members of this Parliament was decided undemocratically in Nice and that that has still not been changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hänsch, I was also surprised that the amendment I tabled in the matter to the report on the Czech Republic was supported by the European People’s Party and others in the Committee on Foreign Affairs but was not supported by the majority of the Social Democrats. Whether that was out of deference to the national governments that decided it, I do not know. At any rate we should agree that Parliament will in this matter be calling uncompromisingly for a change.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank everyone, including Mr Brok, for their reports. I believe that here, too, a critical, thoughtful attitude was formulated towards many aspects of the eastward enlargement strategy. But I would also like to draw attention to two differences, which in part also affect other reports. The first is the stereotypical concentration on economic and social deregulation and privatisation at the expense of social division and destruction which, given the scale of it, are unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The second difference concerns Mr Brok’s report. When it says that the expansion of the EU and NATO are sensible complements to each other, I would think that eastern enlargement of the EU also offers prospects for a productive and cooperative shaping of the relationship between Europe and Russia. But NATO expansion, especially under the conditions of current US and NATO policy, is in my view fraught with serious and in part incalculable risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office, it remains my great wish that the citizens might be able to experience EU enlargement as something that concerns them not primarily through glossy brochures, but that they might help to shape it as a democratic, social and ecological reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, the enlargement of the European Union is an irreversible process. We must be quite clear about this. The conclusions of the Göteborg Summit of EU leaders with regard to the enlargement negotiations and the accession process stated that the road map should make it possible for those countries that are ready to complete negotiations by the end of 2002. I am confident that, under the Belgian Presidency of the European Union, extensive progress will be made with regard to the enlargement negotiations. Key chapters of discussions which it was said will be opened during the Belgian presidency include competition policy, transport, energy, taxation, customs union, veterinary and hygiene aspects of agriculture, fisheries, justice and home affairs, and financial control.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of concluding the enlargement negotiations with the more advanced countries by the end of 2002 is an achievable objective. The leading candidates are provisionally closing chapters at an impressive rate and the leading candidate country, Cyprus, now has 23 chapters concluded. But it is equally important that the European Union and the applicant countries get down to negotiating the more difficult chapters of talks, which to date have remained closed. It is in the interests of all contracting parties that the bottom line issues that remain outstanding are debated, resolved and finalised. We must all continue to play an active and constructive role in the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement of the Union is an economic and political opportunity for Europe. The expansion of the single market should be of real and tangible interest to European exporters and to indigenous European companies seeking investment abroad. On a continental level, the enlargement of the European Union will contribute to further stability. An enlarged Union will be able to play a more positive and influential role internationally, both politically and economically. It will help to consolidate democratic and civil structures in eastern and central Europe. It will contribute to the development of greater free market economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Our input into organisations such as the World Trade Organisation would be very much strengthened by the enlargement of the European Union. As an Irish Member of the European Parliament, I would like to take this opportunity of restating that the result of the Nice Treaty referendum in Ireland should not be interpreted or construed as a vote against the enlargement of the European Union. Irish public opinion is strongly in favour of the enlargement process, as indicated by a recent Eurobarometer poll which found that 59% of the Irish people were in favour of the enlargement of the Union. This figure is the second highest amongst the 15 Member States of the European Union. Hopefully this Eurobarometer poll will be reflected when the Irish electorate next have an opportunity of making a decision on the issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
