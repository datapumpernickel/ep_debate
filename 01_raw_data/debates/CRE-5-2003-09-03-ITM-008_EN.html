<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sylla (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that I am honoured to present this annual report on the situation as regards human rights. It is a summary of the fundamental values on which the European Union is founded, a summary that is recognised and that is included in Part II of the draft Constitution prepared by the Convention. In my view, according to Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, the European institutions may monitor, each according to their respective remits, strict respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on the part of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, following this vote, the legally binding nature of the Charter, once implemented, will enable European citizens to directly and individually refer matters to the EU’s Court of Justice. I say that because I insisted on involving citizens in the drafting of the Charter. Thus, at the first hearing I included two schools, one German and one French, which have been following the work for six months now. I then brought together the major non-governmental organisations – Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation for Human Rights – as well as representatives of the national parliaments, including the candidate countries. I believe that I was therefore able to gain a great deal more information and verify it during my own visits.</p>
<p class="contents">An overabundance of information, far from being a handicap, can be very rewarding. Therefore, I also wanted to ensure that the report highlighted strong elements. For me, this meant first of all looking at perhaps one of the greatest splits in the European continent since the fall of the Berlin Wall, namely the consequences of 11 September, both within and outside the Union. I had the opportunity of undertaking a three-week study trip to the United States. While crossing the country, I saw that there are still very many negative effects of 11 September. People are afraid and, above all, everyone recognises that an unprecedented wave of Islamophobia is growing: it is very much to their credit that they recognise it. Churches, judges, citizens and NGOs were working to protect Muslims. From that point of view, it should be a lesson for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should it be a lesson for us? In my opinion, all too often we forget the primary goal of terrorists: to destabilise the rule of law. Therefore, each time we do something that does not help to strengthen the rule of law, anywhere, we are contributing to the aim of the terrorists, which is precisely to destabilise the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">It is then important to remember, within the context of defending the first fundamental right – the right to life – which is set out in the first chapter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the need to remain united in the fight against terrorism. That is the least we can do while terrorists are striking indiscriminately. One story came back to me when I was working on this report. In 1994, I had the good fortune to meet with Nelson Mandela, who was just about to take power in South Africa. At the very time when he was about to take power, a report was published that classified the ANC as a terrorist organisation. Is it not also true that the German Occupation considered the Resistance to be terrorists? The UN has listed more than 142 definitions of terrorism. At some stage, one wants to say: everyone has their own adversary.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, Mr President, the fact remains that terrorism today is a real source of conflict from all points of view and can lead to caution within societies and cause them to shut themselves off. It is therefore up to us to ensure that in this context we find solutions as quickly as possible. I am thinking, in particular, of the concern regarding the fact that citizens, European nationals, are today being held in what I would call great secrecy in Cuba because they are suspected of have carried out terrorist acts. Thus, combating terrorism also means helping to maintain the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing that worries me is the situation in our prisons. I think that it is particularly shocking at this beginning of the millennium to see what is happening in the EU’s prisons, where the situation is far from satisfactory. The prisons are overpopulated almost everywhere, and particularly in France, where there are 60 000 prisoners but room for only 50 000.</p>
<p class="contents">Another concern is the threats posed to freedom of expression. Here I am thinking, in particular, of the economic mega-groups and the case of Italy. The final problem is equality. From this point of view, it is essential for more European political parties to sign the 1998 Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Member States’ transposition of the directives adopted by the Council to combat all types of discrimination in the workplace is often incomplete or even nonexistent. Other issues, such as solidarity, civic and social rights, gender equality and equality in the workplace, seem to me to tie in with European citizenship and justice. Too much progress is still required. I did not want to point the finger at any specific country. I simply wanted us to share what is best in each of our countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to welcome this timely debate and congratulate the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Sylla, on the report we are today discussing, which has demonstrated the ongoing nature of the efforts being made by Parliament on protecting fundamental rights in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one particularly significant aspect to this report: this is the first Parliamentary report drawn up on the basis of the annual report on the situation of fundamental rights in the Union and in the Member States drafted by the network of independent experts set up by the Commission at the specific request of the European Parliament. The network’s report expresses the points of view of independent experts, not that of the Commission, and examines the specific situation of the protection of fundamental rights, in light of changes in national legislation and national practices and of developments in the case law of the Luxembourg and Strasbourg Courts. I therefore welcome the fact that the network’s report has been useful to your work. I am also aware that it is certainly possible to improve it in future and to make it more operational, as proposed in item 4 of Mr Sylla’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the recommendations that Parliament will in all likelihood approve, the Commission has already held discussions with the coordinator of the network of experts in the aim of adapting the network’s work to the concerns and priorities expressed by Parliament. I can also state that, in future, the honourable Members of this House will also have access to the national reports drawn up by each expert in the network and that meetings between the network and the future EP rapporteur will be held more frequently. Similarly, as early as October, the Commission will be holding a meeting with representatives of non-governmental organisations to ensure that the information included in the report is as complete and as reliable as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We are clearly at an extremely important juncture for the protection of fundamental rights in the European Union. Firstly, because the Union will be enlarging to encompass the entire European family and, secondly, because the Union is laying down its constitutional rules following the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe and in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. The Union is also working on an area of freedom, security and justice which, it is hoped, will contribute to defining its true identity as a political union that respects the fundamental values of the democratic rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the cases raised by Mr Sylla’s report and to some of the problems in the field of fundamental rights in the European Union, I wish to inform the House that the Commission has already adopted, or is in the process of adopting in relation to some of the issues, measures that will provide solutions. In October 2002, the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on compensating victims of crime in general, which specifically covers victims of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to freedom of movement and of residence, which is a crucial element of the European project, on 15 April of this year, the Commission adopted an amended proposal for a directive rethinking freedom of movement. We are also currently working closely with the Italian Presidency to ensure that Council and Parliament reach a common position that will enable a second reading to be held quickly so that this legislative process can be concluded before the European Parliament elections in June 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Commission is closely monitoring the situation of the Roma minority in the context of enlargement, both from the point of view of countries’ compliance with the political criteria for joining the European Union, and of their receiving funding through the PHARE programme. We also intend to launch a study to assess the form that the Commission’s programmes should take in order to ensure that they are coherent and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to preventive strategies to deal with the consequences of mass redundancies, the Union has developed a universal policy for addressing company restructuring. Consequently, before any restructuring takes place, employees must be informed and consulted in order to eliminate or mitigate the social impact of such decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of reconciling family and working lives forms an integral part of the aims of the Community framework strategy for gender equality for the period 2001-2005. With regard to the draft proposal for a framework decision on the procedural safeguards given to suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings in the European Union, which has arisen as a result of the Green Paper published by the Commission on 19 February, the drafting of this proposal is now under way and the text will be available at the end of November, once it has been adopted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union will have a Constitution. Central to this Constitution, according to the conclusions of the Convention on the Future of Europe, will be the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was adopted by the preceding Convention and which received the political endorsement of the three institutions at the Nice European Council. This means that a constitutional legal system will be based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union. The Commission realises the importance, however, of implementing Article 7 of the Treaty of Nice before the Charter can take full effect. To this end, I wish to confirm that at some point in September, the Commission will approve and submit to Parliament and Council a communication on the implementing conditions of Article 7 of the Treaty of Nice in the field of the protection of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, therefore, by saying that, through this debate and through these initiatives, the Commission, like Parliament, is making a decisive contribution to a sea-change in the Union’s legal and political framework. One of the components of this transformation is that of fundamental rights, which must not only be respected but whose entire development must be safeguarded. We will then be able to construct a genuine fundamental rights policy in the Union, implement it ourselves and thereby set an example to the entire world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The length of this report makes it clear that the European Union, which constantly preaches respect for fundamental rights to the rest of the world, is not yet free from breaches to these rights within its own borders.</p>
<p class="contents">As the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport for this report, I am happy that in paragraph 38 Italy is finally and explicitly named and shamed concerning its media concentration and the influence in this regard of its Prime Minister, without any rules at all on conflict of interest being adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I say I am glad because the majority of Members on the Culture Committee sadly voted against making an example of Italy for its bad record in media concentration, which poses a very serious threat to democracy everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that individual media conglomerates control a significant portion of the national news media in several European countries: Bertelsmann and Kirch in Germany, Rupert Murdoch's empire in the United Kingdom and Vivendi<span class="italic"> </span>in France. But Berlusconi's combination of media influence and political power is unique in Europe. A recent report on media conflict of interest in Italy by the NGO Reporters Without Borders quotes Freimut Duve, the OCSE's representative for media freedom, who has repeatedly condemned the concentration of so much of the Italian news media in the Prime Minister's hands. The OSCE says it is both a challenge to the European constitutional architecture and a bad example for new democracies in transition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly also holds that the potential conflict of interest between the holding of political office by Mr Berlusconi and his private economic and media interests is a threat to media pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">I could elaborate further, but I am sure you all understand the problems that media ownership concentration in Italy poses to democracy and freedom of information. I sincerely hope, therefore, that you all agree that the case of Italy should be included in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights, I should like to express our deep satisfaction with the comments and recommendations in the report on safeguarding and applying democracy and equality in daily life and practice, in the sense of a balanced participation of the sexes in democratic institutions and respect for the human rights of women.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not possible, Commissioner, for women to be treated as human beings and citizens with restricted rights in twenty-first century Europe. It is unacceptable for there still to be professional sectors and areas in the European Union in which Community legislation, democratic rules and fundamental freedoms only apply to men.</p>
<p class="contents">My committee has repeatedly condemned gender-based discrimination and discrimination based on sexual orientation or national or social origin. In other words, we condemn the different weights and measures which derive mainly from cultural traditions and social stereotypes and which today refer to dark and sad periods in the history of mankind.</p>
<p class="contents">We insistently and constantly call for the self-evident: for human rights and fundamental freedoms to apply equally to men and women, with no discrimination whatsoever. Only then will we be able to talk of the universality of human rights and mainstreaming.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to take the opportunity of today’s vote on the report on the DAPHNE programme to prevent and combat violence against women, Commissioner, to call once again on the European Commission and the Member States, to put combating violence against women, which is the worst form of violation of women’s rights, high on their political agenda. I do not think that any policy should carry greater weight than the protection of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to remind you that this is the third report since an extremely important reform, which Parliament desired, which involves looking at the situation of fundamental rights in the Union in light of the Charter, and this implies a number of obligations. We have established the means – a network of experts that produces a report, normally a collective working group – but the catchword is above all the Charter and nothing but the Charter. That naturally requires the rapporteur and all those who would like this report to be adopted with broad support to ensure that it is not a pretext for political activism, that it is not an opportunity to put forward personal opinions, and that it is not a forerunner for action by lobbies that are totally unrelated. Nothing but the Charter, but all of the Charter! It is a principle that must be reasserted, as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment relates to the countries. This report is divided into two parts, according to EU regulation. In reality, the report forms a whole and, thus, the resolution should contain only the true substance of the report and highlight only what Parliament would like the public to remember. That would prevent nationalist reactions on the part of some of our colleagues who do not agree with their country being mentioned. Also from this point of view, it would be in our interest to ensure that the resolution contains only the important points, those that correspond, in fact, to the reasons why Parliament decided to draw up this report. It decided to draw up the report as a guardian of public liberties and so that it could answer the following question: was the Charter of Fundamental Rights as written, and not as one would like it to be written, respected during the year in question throughout the Union? That is the aim of the report. It is very important not to forget these aspects concerning the method if we want the report to be adopted with as broad a political foundation as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore time for us to ask what has changed in the meantime. Let us first look at the facts. Structural highlights are, and continue to be, the misconduct of government officials such as police officers, the situation in prisons, trafficking in human beings, forms of unequal treatment and discrimination, racism and xenophobia. If you take a cynical view, you say: what else is new? In addition, however, civil rights are also put at risk by an over-reaction to terrorism, and this is a new problem. We are worried about cooperation in terms of criminal justice with the United States and the exchange of personal data. All in all, it therefore seems to me that the human rights issue within the European Union has become more pronounced over the past few years, despite the efforts of many to carry out improvements in specific areas.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the collection analysis of data, I can be somewhat more upbeat. First of all, our work has become more systematic and objective, because we have taken the Charter of Fundamental Rights as our guiding principle. Our work has also become more professional since we can now fall back on the network of experts under the guidance of Professor De Schutter. Both improvements are clearly thanks to initiatives of this Parliament, and we should be pleased about this.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the political response is concerned, I am a little less optimistic. Each time, the European Parliament gets cold feet as soon as the time comes for someone to be nagged and shaken up a bit, and this year is no exception. Despite this, it is clear that abuses in the Member States must be highlighted. Why else would we have a report of this kind? Consigning the abuses we have come across to an explanatory statement is, after all, not what we had in mind where human rights violations in third countries are concerned. Mr van den Bos’ sterling report, which was discussed earlier, bears witness to this. I think that we should emulate this approach where human rights violations within the European Union are concerned, and this is why my group will be giving Mr Sylla's report its unqualified support.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European Commission's position is concerned, I have to say I have great regard for its commitment, and certainly for Commissioner Vitorino’s own, about which he spoke in such quick order that it was even difficult to follow everything in detail. There is a slight problem though. The network is a fine institution, but is the Commission not hiding behind it too much and failing to catch enough of the limelight in what is always referred to in the textbooks as the role of the European Commission as the Guardian of the Treaties? Where does the Commission itself stand on this, and when will it show the political courage to raise human rights issues in the European Union? I am therefore very much looking forward to the communication that the Commissioner has announced regarding the further details of Article 7 of the Treaty of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Council, Mr President, allow me to add one thing: those empty seats over there are a downright scandal. The gentlemen of the Presidency were present for the previous topic. Should I infer from that that the Presidency takes the view that human rights only deserve serious consideration outside of the European Union? I refuse to believe that. Perhaps you can ask them on our behalf the reason for their absence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though we may have different views on certain parts of it, we should be able to agree that this survey is useful and significant.</p>
<p class="contents">I should nonetheless have liked to have seen more practical examples. Mr Cornillet, I wonder for what purpose we should have this report if we did not single out a number of countries. If the EU is to set an example to the world, we cannot put blinkers on and not put our own house in order. What credibility would we then have in the surrounding world? The question to the Commission and the Council is, of course: what practical measures are you taking to tackle the problems?</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to comment on three areas. The first is the EU’s and the Member States’ asylum policy, which deserves to be criticised. There is a political anxiety whereby all the countries apparently feel able to compromise fundamental legal principles. Naturally, we must put an end to human smuggling and prevent the asylum system from being misused, but we cannot send refugees back to be tortured or ill-treated. We must give all children who find their way to the EU the chance of a life of dignity. There are many deficiencies in this area, including in my own country.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area is prison conditions. We have overcrowded prisons, extensive violence and increasing problems involving ex-prisoners’ readjustment to society. Europe must have prisons that are fit for human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area concerns a sensitive but important issue. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights states clearly and unambiguously that ‘[t]he freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected’. I agree with Mr Eurig Wyn on this matter and wonder if it is perhaps an irony of fate that it is the Italian Presidency that is to get the Member States to agree upon a constitution that Italy, through its prime minister’s monopoly on the media, clearly and unambiguously violates. We cannot have this situation. I want, in conclusion, to ask you, Commissioner, what you are doing about this sensitive matter. The situation in the Italian media is the whole of Europe’s responsibility, including yours, Mr Vitorino. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With the adoption of European provisions such as the framework decisions on terrorism and the European arrest warrant, or even the freezing of assets of certain entities and individuals considered to be terrorists, the European Union is consolidating the many anti-terrorism and repressive laws adopted by the Member States. However, if the need to combat terrorism must not be an excuse to adopt discriminatory and arbitrary laws, the absence of a clear and precise definition of terrorism in European legislation today allows the implicit criminalisation of social movements linked to freedom of expression and freedom of association. A simple suspicion can result in detention.</p>
<p class="contents">Entire populations that were already vulnerable have been even more so since 11 September: nationals of third countries, asylum-seekers, Roma and Muslims. With disregard for fundamental rights and public freedoms, these populations are often treated as if they pose a threat or a danger to state security and it is easy to blame it on 11 September. It allows us to ignore the real issues society must face: integration, xenophobia and immigration and asylum policy. Today, the fight against terrorism serves as a pretext for the fight against immigration, which is no longer considered to be anything but illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">The association agreements with Algeria, for example, are a good illustration of this amalgam of terrorism and immigration. The same applies to the agreements on the readmission of <span class="italic">sans-papiers</span> sent to third countries. The list of violations carried out within the European Union by the states and institutions is a long one: xenophobia, double punishment, arbitrary detention, discriminatory practices as regards hiring and housing, and offences based on identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet human rights have no borders, so we must be frank and begin by putting our own house in order. We must stop using human rights as a currency with third countries; the aim of the European Union is to promote peace, the values of freedom, justice and solidarity and the welfare of its people. We must now make all efforts to ensure that human rights are at last respected in the European Union for all residents, regardless of their nationality. </p>

The report does, however, in most of its 150 long articles, give in to this temptation, straying from its stated intentions and boundaries and in some cases serving as a political judgment on the Member States. Such a role does not fall within the sphere of the European Parliament’s competence, as we know, except in serious and specific situations that could trigger the sanctions set out in Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union. Are any of the Member States really in such a situation? I think not.</p>
<p class="contents">No one should conclude from my words that I am any less concerned about or attentive to protecting fundamental rights or to fighting against the various forms of discrimination. Let us not forget that in the fields of combating terrorism, asylum policy and immigration, police and judicial cooperation, conditions of detention and many others, these are, in political terms, extremely sensitive matters. Today, in stark contrast to the generous nature of the policies that have traditionally defined democratic systems, sophisticated forms of international crime and terrorism exist and only with a considerable sense of responsibility and balance will it be possible effectively to fulfil the requirements that the complex current situation sets for us all.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I come from an ancient nation that prides itself on having been the first in Europe to abolish the death penalty and to abolish slavery and life imprisonment. For this very reason, I find it hard to accept the criticism made in comments about supposedly racist behaviour or behaviour involving sexual discrimination which, at the very least, betray an ignorance of the facts. Furthermore, I must inform you that the Portuguese authorities are continuing to modernise their prison system and to make it more humane, without harbouring the illusion, of course, that they can do overnight everything that has not been done to date. This, then, is my response to the report’s main observation about Portugal, in the certainty that future documents will reflect, and with this I shall conclude, an improvement of the current and future situations in terms of the security of our citizens, and in the living and working conditions and also the safety of prisoners themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This annual report contains yet again many painful areas. For example, in paragraph 33, the Member States are requested to promote the principle of secular neutrality, which does not rule out the teaching of the history of religions in school, but this in fact flies in the face of the rights enshrined in the Dutch Constitution by outlawing religious classes themselves. Indeed, it is possible to opt for special education in the Netherlands, a right which is assumed by many, including Christians, people with non-religious ideologies and now also Muslims. It is downright ridiculous to find such a thoughtless, ill-formulated statement in an EP report. What is it anyway, this principle of neutrality? Politics, and therefore a government, is never neutral. This once again sums up what happens every year when this report comes out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This can lead to blunders and completely the wrong line being taken, as, for example, where, examining the problem of widespread crime among immigrants from third countries, the report states that this is surely due to poor integration policies while completely disregarding the rights of the communities on the receiving end of this kind of unregulated immigration who suffer the damage and the harmful effects, not least in terms of their culture, of what is, in some cases, a genuine invasion and abuse of the rights of the people of the country of reception.</p>

What you have delivered is unfortunately an ideological wish list, a shopping list of left-wing ideologies. I say ‘unfortunately’ because it was an important and substantial report.</p>
<p class="contents">We can discuss the issues you raise in it, and we can be for them or against them, but the point is that they do not belong in the report about fundamental rights and respect for these rights in the European Union. For that reason, and as a matter of principle we, in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, will vote against this report. You also, however, criticise a number of Member States, and as a rule you do so unfairly. You have quite simply failed to inform yourself adequately about the real situation or you are criticising because the rules they have in place do not conform with your ideological preconceptions. We reject the criticism – and that includes your criticism of Austria – because it is quite unjustified, and we therefore reject your report for these reasons as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I reject the report on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party because we do not support your substantive demands. These range from the expansion of the right of asylum, to access to education and healthcare for illegal immigrants, the regularisation of the status of illegal immigrants, and recognition of the equality of all partnerships in the EU – we reject all these demands unequivocally. Finally, we reject the report outright because of your demand that homosexual couples be given the right to adopt children. You can think what you like about such partnerships: I tolerate them, but in the interests of the children, we must ensure that such a demand is never put into practice.</p>

I say that because, unfortunately, we have to recognise that Mr Sylla's report is full of such examples, and it is not enough for us as Members of the European Parliament to denounce violations of fundamental rights in countries outside the EU if we do not point the finger at violations in our own countries. Our good name is at stake here.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the conclusions of the report are extremely important as regards the other challenges we face. For example, the current economic crisis and the many redundancies associated with it mean that we have to be particularly vigilant about respecting social rights. For example, we are unfortunately having to contend with the closure of an assembly plant in the Somme region of France. Recent events both in France and in other European companies also demonstrate that the freedom of the press is often violated. That certainly happened during the summer heatwave.</p>
<p class="contents">On an entirely different point, I would also like to support what some of the previous speakers have said: if the war on terror is to be legitimate, it should not involve flouting the most basic rights.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, given that the Annual Report on Human Rights is the fourth of its kind, I would like to ask the same question as my colleague Mrs Swiebel: what is the human rights situation, and what changes has the report brought about? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the actions of the Spanish Government do not respect the rights of prisoners and their families. Prisoners are moved further away from their homes and not allowed to study in their mother tongues, thereby preventing them from registering in universities in their communities. All of this goes against the constitutional objective of rehabilitation and social reintegration of prisoners with a view to achieving a fairer and more civilised society.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also unacceptable, in a state which purports to respect the rule of law, that the government has ordered the closure of two news organisations. These closures were furthermore of a pre-emptive nature and no sentence has been passed for any crime. This is all the more serious in view of the fact that one of these daily newspapers – <span class="italic">Egunkaria</span> – is the only source of news written in a minority national language – Euskera – which we are obliged to respect and not to discriminate against under the terms of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This Parliament is making a hopeless fool of itself by entrusting this report to a Communist. It is an insult to all victims of the criminal Communist ideology. It is tantamount to asking Mrs Claude to write a report on moral corruption, or to ask Mr Bernard Cantat to write a report on violence against women. Mr Sylla has been elected on a Communist list; he must be the last person to talk to us about our fundamental rights. This was demonstrated once again in this Chamber this morning. I would refer in this connection to the shameful statements made by some of his group colleagues during the debate on Cuba this morning. These were like a slap in the face of the many poor souls behind bars in Cuba. Mr Sylla, take yourself to Havana to preach about fundamental rights, but not here in Europe, not here in Strasbourg! When I hear the rapporteur call for the freedom of expression, I wonder whether we have ended up in the world of Orwell, because it was his party, no less, which in France continually took the lead to scale back the freedom of opinion, via totalitarian acts such as the Gayssot Act. It was the party of this rapporteur which, some time ago, commissioned the bulldozing of a home for immigrants in Vitry-sur-Seine, so please let us remain serious. Communists must be the last people on earth to give us lessons in what Europe should look like based on the principles of a constitutional state.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with the new annual report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union which, owing to the method used for its production – a different political group every year – makes it impossible for the final result to reflect a consensus – which furthermore is necessary – of all the groups in this House. This would be my first critical comment with a view to future reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sylla – whom I respect and whom I thank personally – has made considerable efforts to ensure that the European Union’s anti-terrorist policy is well-considered and supported by this Parliament. I would like to expressly state, however – and in this regard I do disagree with his explanatory statement – that it is only the victims of terrorism who really suffer torture and all types of suffering, and not the ETA terrorists, who use the strategy of accusations of torture to try to weaken the rule of law. This is why in paragraph 12 we called for a European instrument for compensating victims which, let us hope, will be reflected in the 2004 budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there are other issues which prevent an entirely positive assessment of it. One of them is its proposal on active euthanasia, which clashes head-on with a decision of the European Council of 26 March 2002, or the chapter relating to immigration and asylum, which confuses economic immigration with asylum seekers – an issue which has already been overcome by the Commission and also within our Parliamentary debate – or the request for equivalence between marriage and homosexual partnerships, and it also proposes that homosexual partnerships be allowed to adopt children, something which goes further than the logical non-discrimination against any person on the grounds of their sexual orientation. We can also talk about the proposal that resident third-country nationals who have been in European territory for more than three years should participate in municipal and even European elections, which would mean removing the link between European citizenship and nationality, thereby depriving it of any content.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else which I consider to be a serious error is the very negative reference made to cooperation with the United States on an issue which, apart from anything else, does not correspond to the year dealt with by the report, that of the communication of passenger data to the United States authorities, which is currently at the negotiation stage and subject to open debate in this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Measures intended to create a genuine and coherent Community policy on illegal immigration are experiencing delays in being adopted that are incompatible with the urgency and the gravity of the problems facing these individuals. Measures designed, on the other hand, to guarantee security or to control illegal immigration, measures that are generally repressive, have shown themselves able to bring about consensus between governments more easily than measures that are positive or which seek to integrate communities. We can see the progress made in 2002 with the adoption of various instruments that constitute the first steps towards a common immigration and asylum policy. Amongst these instruments, I would highlight the directives on minimum standards for the reception of asylum-seekers in Member States, the directive on refugee status, the Dublin II regulation and the directive on reuniting families.</p>
<p class="contents">These instruments are not sufficient, however, to remedy the weak legal and social position of the several thousand immigrants who have settled in our countries and whose situation is extremely precarious and exposed to all types of abuse. One fundamental instrument is still awaiting final approval by the Council: the European Statute on Long-Term Residents, which applies to immigrants who have lived within the territory of a Member State for more than five years and which will give those concerned the right to a set of benefits in the same conditions that apply to nationals of that country.</p>

We should therefore all be sitting here calmly, but, as you can see, it is a report which still provokes heated debate after four years. Moreover, we are discussing principles which distinguish a civilised society from a tribal community, and, in this respect, the Charter of Fundamental Rights would seem to be the most appropriate, most equitable, most reliable reference when it comes to principles and values.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the broad lines taken by the report: no to terrorism, protection of prisoners, combating the trafficking of human beings, data protection and protection of privacy, provision of accurate information, immigration, asylum and many other issues like, once again, combating all forms of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a shame that all these issues, these principles, are jeopardised somewhat, adulterated by invasive ideological and political views when they warrant greater respect.

Furthermore, it was the subject of a number of amendments, which I discussed with the Chairman of my committee once again this morning. That means that not all the proposals and amendments were of my making. I believe that some caution is called for. Debates do take place and some points are not clear-cut.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, that does not mean that I am not considering this issue. I find it really shocking that the role of the rapporteur should be reduced to a duty of responsibility. My intention was quite simply to emphasise those points that I regard as important, and in particular the aftermath of the attacks on 11 September 2001, conditions in prisons and discrimination. Various proposals were subsequently made, however, which I did not originate. I am neither for nor against the adoption of children by same-sex couples, it is quite simply not a clear-cut issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is essential that we develop strategies promoting equal access for all to fundamental rights such as education, healthcare and culture and to a permanent job and housing.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is more than just a geographical and historical entity with expanding borders. It is, first and foremost, a community of people bound by shared values which has been shaped over the course of time by its political, economic and spiritual history.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not feel that the report reflects or upholds certain values of our European civilisation. I believe that imposing a particular set of moral values on the entire European Union is contrary to the principle of respect for diversity, which is, moreover, enshrined at the very heart of European integration and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Local cultures and different ways of living must not be destabilised.</p>
<p class="contents">Each of our countries has its own history and perspective, which are, of course, different, having been shaped by countless different experiences. We owe it to ourselves to respect them, for our cultural and religious diversity enriches us.</p>
