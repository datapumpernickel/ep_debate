<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span> <span class="italic"> Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Perry, let me preface my answer to your question with the following. As President may I specifically state on behalf of the Council that it attaches the utmost value to protecting freedom of expression, of which the freedom of the media is one of the most important factors. The Council is profoundly convinced that freedom of expression is a cornerstone of democracy and of the other individual freedoms, as stated 50 years ago in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That is why the Member States and the Community check very carefully, within their sphere of responsibility, that access to the media is assured in all areas of society, taking account of the variety of political and religious convictions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards consulting the Council on questions of media ownership concentration, let me point out that to date the Commission has not submitted any proposal on the subject to the Council. Of course the Council would consider any such proposal in detail. In this connection, let me draw the honourable Member"s attention to the fact that the question of concentrations between undertakings comes under the Community"s competition law, specifically in this case Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 of 21 December 1989 on the control of concentrations between undertakings. Responsibility for applying that regulation lies with the Commission.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Perry </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to thank the President‐in‐Office for his response. I, of course, like all democrats, totally share the views expressed about the necessity of a free press in democratic societies. The problem I am seeking to address in this question is that concentration of media ownership sometimes causes problems with freedom of the press, particularly when that concentration of ownership stretches beyond just ownership of newspapers and into other economic fields. Many European citizens are concerned when they see, for example, the takeover of Manchester United by BSkyB, the extension of the ability of broadcasters to strike deals with particular football clubs and the proposals for a European Super League. All this could be challenging the freedom of sport to operate as it has up to now. I would like to think that when a report comes from the Commission the Council will address that issue.</p>

But let me point out again that this matter comes under competition law. We have definite legal bases for this within the European Union and the Commission is responsible for applying this law and implementing the regulations. This matter has to be dealt with in the Commission and that is the appropriate procedure. Let me repeat that the Council is prepared to consider the matter if the Commission puts the appropriate proposal before it.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 2 by <span class="bold">Hans Lindqvist </span>(H−1254/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Depopulation of the Swedish countryside</span></p>
<p class="contents">Not since the 1960s has there been greater depopulation of the Swedish countryside. The population has declined in some 210 of the 280 municipalities in Sweden, mainly in inland central and northern Sweden. Membership of the EU was to have strengthened regional policy so that the country as a whole could be developed. The reality has turned out to be different. The present trend is unacceptable. Can the Council hold out any hope for those regions in Sweden which are now severely affected by depopulation? Will the approximately SEK 4 billion refund on Sweden's annual membership fee of SEK 21 billion increase or decrease in the future?</p>
<p class="contents">I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Lindqvist's question.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span> <span class="italic"> Council. – (DE)</span> Mr Lindqvist, the Council is aware of the problem of depopulation, especially in certain parts of the Union, and has always attached great importance to measures to maintain a viable population structure in rural areas. As for aspects related to the reform of the common agricultural policy, during the deliberations on the Agenda 2000 proposals the Council envisages formulating a European agricultural model that will have to be further developed in the future, namely the model of a multi‐functional, sustainable, competitive agriculture that exists throughout the Community, which means also in regions that have the kind of specific problems to which you refer in your question.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council acknowledges that rural development policy has a fundamental role to play in endeavouring to make use of every means of preserving viable rural structures throughout the European Union. Under EU regional policy Sweden currently receives structural aid for its least populated regions. Until 31 December 1999 the Structural Funds, the financial instrument for fisheries guidance and the European Investment Bank will each continue to make their respective contribution to achieving a priority objective, which is called Objective 6. That objective is to promote the development and structural adjustment of very sparsely populated regions. As is also provided in the second recital of Protocol No 6 of the Swedish Act of Accession, these rules are currently being reviewed in the context of the Commission"s proposals on reforming the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">For the period from 2000 to 2006 the Commission proposes continuing the fund aid for Objective 6 regions under Objective 1. As for the progress of discussions within the Council, I can tell you, Mr Lindqvist, that in addition to this Commission proposal there is another one from the Member States, on which no decision has yet been taken. It proposes that the existing Objective 6 be retained and the aid measures continued. This will be decided on in the context of the global package of Agenda 2000, on which I reported to you during this afternoon"s debate.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lindqvist (ELDR).</span>  – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Thank you for that reply. Today's demonstration by French farmers in support of their livelihood and their very survival provides a graphic example of the situation in this part of Europe. The same problems exist in Sweden, particularly in the north of the country. Three or four farms close down every day. It is the small farms with 15 to 20 cows whose owners are forced to give up and move to the cities, above all to Stockholm, Malmö and Göteborg. There has not been such a dramatic migration away from the inland communities since the 1960s. Of the 279 local authorities that exist in Sweden, 211 – all of them in the interior of the country – have lost part of their population.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a supplementary question concerning Objective 6. Could the Council provide more information on whether Sweden and Finland are to remain as Objective 6 regions, and will the Objective 6 criteria be included in the new framework for Objective 1? I would appreciate an answer to this question.</p>

I myself was informed of it in detail by the Swedish Government in Stockholm last Sunday. Let me repeat that in addition to the Commission proposal there is another one that will be decided upon. Only when it has been decided what funds will be available in future for structural aid in sparsely populated areas, and not just, as you rightly said, in Sweden and Finland, but also in other parts of the Union, can the decision be taken on the concrete shape of such a programme.</p>

It is based on decisions that were taken in years gone by. At this moment we are about to embark on a reform of European agricultural policy that is aimed at making agriculture in Europe more competitive, more productive, more sustainable and more ecologically acceptable. The Commission"s proposals to that effect are on the table and what I have just said holds true here: within the Council, the Member States have very different ideas about the final shape of the reform of agricultural policy. Some Member States even think we should not make any changes at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I am expecting the Agriculture Council, which will be meeting from 22 to 24 February, to give us the first insight into the agriculture ministers" view of the future of European agricultural policy. It is too soon to do so today. I cannot answer this question today because the relevant decisions have not yet been taken.</p>

On the regional question, if you take the Highlands and Islands of my own country, Scotland, you will find that it is a very rural area in danger of greater depopulation. At over 75 % it would seem to be the very sort of area that we should be defending in this reform. Yet if we stick to the Commission's strict 75 % it will lose out.</p>

<p class="contents">I must add, however, that the deliberations to date show that a broad majority within the Council is in favour of an extremely strict application of the 75 % criterion for Objective 1 regions. That is partly because there are of course also a number of areas that come just below that threshold and a few that are just above it. The trend as I see it at present is to continue to apply this criterion strictly. But the Council is fully aware of the problem. I will see to it that Parliament"s and your concerns are taken into account during the further deliberations.</p>

It pays great attention to the NGOs" opinions and recommendations and seeks contacts and exchanges of experience with them. The same applies to the question of fleshing out the European Union"s human rights policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect let me point out that in December 1998 the then presidency of the Council distributed the Amnesty International report referred to by Ms Oddy to the CFSP Working Party on Human Rights. The Council agrees with Amnesty International on the importance of seeking constantly to further improve EU human rights policy. In that endeavour, the Council will also pay attention to Amnesty International"s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council would refer you to the declaration published on 10 December 1998 on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was subsequently confirmed by the European Council. The declaration of 10 December contains a range of operative proposals and the Council will be discussing their formulation in the coming months. On 25 January 1999 the General Affairs Council confirmed this.</p>
<p class="contents">The follow‐up to the operative proposals in the declaration of 10 December 1998 forms an important part of the presidency"s work programme. It includes the question of an annual EU report on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The work programme also gives high priority to the endeavours to gain recognition of the EU"s positions on human rights policy in relation to specific countries and issues in the framework of the United Nations. That includes the important questions of the reform of the UN human rights mechanisms and preparations for the world racism conference.</p>

<p class="contents">In the resolution on humanitarian aid to the Russian people, adopted by Parliament on 19 November 1998<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> , attention was drawn to the outbreak of tuberculosis in Russian prisons, where up to 15 % of the prison population are carriers of the disease.</p>

For that reason, on 17 December 1998 the Council adopted a comprehensive programme to supply agricultural produce to Russia. Since 1991, ECHO has spent ECU 50 m on humanitarian aid for Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">A sum of ECU 4.8 m remains from the allocation for 1998. After checking where the people were in greatest need, it was decided to concentrate on trying to resolve the problem of tuberculosis, especially in the prisons. The Commission and the Council therefore entirely share the concerns expressed in the European Parliament"s resolution of 19 November 1998 and the concerns voiced by Mr Provan.</p>
<p class="contents">With the new outbreaks of tuberculosis in the developing countries, prisons became the main breeding ground for this disease. Russia has the highest rate of imprisonment in the world, 1 % of the total population. Russian prisons are overcrowded. In many penal institutions up to 10 % of inmates are infected. That is why the Commission decided to use the lion"s share of the ECU 4.8 m remaining from the 1998 budget, namely ECU 4.24 m, for projects to stem the tide of tuberculosis.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the ECHO aid is dealt with by NGOs in the EU, the United Nations agencies and international humanitarian organisations.</p>

<p class="contents">Regarding the other aspects of agricultural products that might be going to the Russian people at the present time, I believe that part of the programme is going to allow the food aid that is sent there to be sold on the local market at existing market prices. The main problem, however, is that the people do not have the funds to pay for it. There is insufficient funding in the economy at the present time, and that is a major problem.</p>

Indeed we are facing the dilemma of on the one hand recognising a humanitarian obligation and wanting to help, while on the other we know that in the country we want to help we come up against structures that often stand in the way of achieving the purpose of the aid. The Council has therefore laid down a political guideline for the Commission, to the effect that when these products are supplied to Russia, it must be ensured that they do indeed reach those who are in greatest need, that this does not disrupt any remaining food supply structures that still work and that it helps promote a viable policy for securing future food supplies to the people. That was the Council"s intention. It has proved extremely difficult to apply these political conditions in relation to practical aid. That is why I am persuaded that the Council will have to look into this whole issue again at once.</p>

<p class="contents">Given that the EU, and some Member States in particular, had raised objections to the initial plan of the Cyprus Government to site a surface‐to‐air missile system, consisting of S−300 missiles, on the island and subsequently congratulated it on its decision to cancel the plan, how does the Council feel that Cyprus should improve its security?</p>

Here Cyprus can continue to count on the full support of the European Union and of the entire international community. The European Union takes the view that there are already far too many weapons in Cyprus, producing a real risk that each new build‐up of weapons on one side will immediately be matched by the other side, which will lead to less rather than more security. For this reason the European Union welcomed the decision by President Clerides, which Mr Dimitrakopoulos mentioned, not to site S−300 missiles on the island of Cyprus. That decision sent out an important signal about reducing the excessive number of weapons in Cyprus and the European Union hopes both sides will take further steps in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision not to site those missiles has removed one of the sources of tension on the island. The Council believes this can promote progress towards a just and lasting solution to the Cyprus conflict. The European Union strongly endorsed UN Security Council Resolutions 1217 and 1218 and fully supports the ongoing efforts of the UN Secretary‐General"s Deputy Special Representative for Cyprus.</p>

<p class="contents">So far this hope has not been fulfilled, but we still make the same very clear demand to the Turkish side to take part in the negotiations. In any case, of course, we call on the Turkish side to keep a low military profile and to help defuse the situation by taking steps towards disarmament. I cannot tell you anything about the possibility of Cyprus joining NATO, or about deliberations within NATO on the potential membership of Cyprus, since I represent the presidency of the European Union and not the NATO Council.</p>

Nevertheless I can provide you with some information. The Council reaffirms the position it adopted in regard to the agreements reached at the EU‐USA summit in London in May 1998. At that time the Council said that for legal reasons and reasons of principle it firmly rejected secondary boycotts and laws with extraterritorial and retroactive effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council welcomes the new measures taken by the US Government. But even if they reflect a more flexible attitude on the part of the US towards Cuba, the Council regrets that the American embargo on Cuba remains in place. Such actions are not the best means of promoting democracy and respect for human rights. The Council still believes it right to seek a dialogue with Cuba, as we stated in the common position of December 1969, and to support a process of peaceful transition to a pluralist democracy, together with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and sustained economic recovery in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU still regards the implementation of the agreements of the EU‐USA London summit of 18 May 1998 as a priority. But in spite of the efforts of the US Government, to date there is still not the kind of progress that would lead the USA to radically review its sanctions policy.</p>

I would ask you to bear in mind that the paradox might arise that North American farmers are able to sell to Cubans without any problems, while Europeans continue to find it very difficult to trade and conduct a normal relationship with Cuba because of the Helms‐Burton Act and the blockade, which, as you know, is illegal and contravenes United Nations resolutions.</p>

At their plenary meeting on 2 and 3 December 1998, the 33 contracting states of the Wassenaar Arrangement merely decided to review the rules on export controls for encryption techniques; these are known as cryptographical goods. The aim was to relax the export controls and ensure that cryptographical restrictions did not become entrenched. Those contracting states that are also EU Member States were particularly concerned to avoid any rules that would further restrict free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the European Union as such is not a contracting party to the Wassenaar Arrangement. At present there is an integrated system in which the Council, the Commission and the Member States exercise their respective responsibilities, with a view to protecting the Member States" fundamental security interests and fulfilling their international obligations. The Council is currently preparing to implement the Wassenaar decisions. To this end it will amend Council Decision 94/942/CFSP and adjust the list of dual‐use goods subject to export controls pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 3381/94, which is the dual‐use regulation in question. The Council hopes the revised list can enter into force on 1 April 1999.</p>

If you did, you are wrong. The licensing process was made much tighter at that time, and the Member States of the European Union went along with demands mainly from the United States to make the prevention of espionage more difficult. Cryptographical goods are used specifically for protection against Echelon and other spying activities carried out by the USA. Was I right in thinking that you said the trade in cryptographical goods has become less restricted, and do you think that this licensing arrangement for trade in cryptographical goods is generally in line with WTO regulations?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span> <span class="italic"> Council. – (DE)</span> Mrs Ahern, at last year"s conference of the contracting parties to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North‐East Atlantic – the OSPAR agreement – held in Lisbon, the OSPAR Commission adopted a strategy on radioactive material, in the form of a political declaration. The goal of that strategy is to prevent the pollution of the marine environment from ionising radiation. This is to be achieved through the continuous and substantial reduction of discharges, emissions and losses of radioactive material with the aim of keeping their environmental concentration close to the background values for naturally occurring radioactive material and keeping them virtually nil for man‐made radioactive material.</p>
<p class="contents">In pursuing this aim, account was also to be taken of the legitimate uses of the sea, technical feasibility and the radiological effects on man and organisms. By the year 2020 discharges, emissions and losses of radioactive material are to be reduced to a level where any concentration increases above the already existing concentrations are virtually nil. The OSPAR working party on radioactive material that is responsible for implementing this declaration met in Dublin from 19 to 22 January 1999. The contracting parties agreed to report by autumn 1999 on the measures they had respectively planned to reduce discharges, emissions and losses of radioactive material. The Council wishes to point out that the question raised by Mr Fitzsimons primarily concerns bilateral relations between two Member States of the European Union and therefore falls within their terms of reference. At the same time the Council would specifically remind him that the nuclear plant he referred to is subject to the Community"s legal provisions relating to health protection, in particular Directive 96/29/Euratom, which lays down stricter standards for the protection of workers and the general public against ionising radiation.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency‐in‐office of the Council can also inform you that the German Government is currently holding intensive negotiations with the UK on the continued operation of the Sellafield reprocessing plant. I will be happy to report to you on this at a later date, once these talks are concluded.</p>

Since 1994 significant increased emissions have been documented from THORP, and this cannot possibly be compatible with the commitment to reduce emissions to zero.

<p class="contents">Question No 16 by <span class="bold">Mihail Papayannakis </span>(H−0027/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Third pillar and illegal immigrants</span></p>
<p class="contents">What is the position regarding the problem of illegal immigrants who are smuggled into an EU Member State which does not have diplomatic relations of any kind with the countries of origin of the illegal immigrants, thereby leaving that State in a quandary over what to do with them? In Greece, for example, this intractable problem is apparent with immigrants mainly from Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Myanmar who have been held in police cells or prison for some 7 months and have been poorly or humiliatingly treated. Could dilemmas of this type be dealt with at Community level by enlisting the help of those Member States which have diplomatic relations with the countries in question? Should there not be specific provisions within the third pillar to deal with such cases, which would take into account the principles of human rights, fundamental freedoms and respect for private life?</p>

The responsible Council bodies have taken them into account when they discuss the problems facing Member States that want to deport people to certain third countries. Deportation to third countries does indeed call for good cooperation with the state in question so that the necessary formalities can actually be completed. In particular, the identity of an individual must be determined before he or she can be provided with the necessary re‐entry documents. If there are no diplomatic relations or there are only restricted diplomatic relations, that is of course an obstacle to this cooperation.</p>

These countries do not have embassies in Athens, and I imagine that this must be the case in other countries as well. The upshot of this is that illegal immigrants who have been arrested cannot be set free or expelled; nor can they be sent for trial, which means that they stay in police custody for months, and I regard this as unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Could not the Council intervene, possibly via the consular authorities of these countries in another Member State, so that these people can be given the documents they need to solve their problem? Otherwise we end up with something resembling a Kafkaesque impasse. This is my question to the President‐in‐Office and I would ask him to intervene, if he can, in such cases.</p>

Access to public transport plays an important role in this context. The Council"s concern in this regard is also reflected in the new Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, one of the aims of which is to prevent discrimination on the basis of disability. As for the special case to which Mrs Malone referred, I am sorry to say that the Council is not aware of it. But since it obviously concerns an EU Structural Fund measure, I would suggest that she address this question to the Commission, which is responsible for ensuring the proper implementation of EU structural policy.</p>

It happened when I saw disabled people protesting in the rain outside the transport company because of the fact that new buses had been acquired with EU structural fund money and that they were not accessible. There are buses that are accessible. They are in use in London. So this is disgraceful. I hope that the presidency will bring it to the attention of his colleague, the Irish minister for public enterprise, Mary O'Rourke, and to try to force her to take the needs of disabled people into account in all EU funds expenditure. She will probably tell you that the shape of our roads is inadequate. One of the excuses the minister has given is that there is a dip in the roads and the types of buses available in London would not possibly be suitable.

On 6 June 1996 the Commission submitted a proposal for a decision on a first multiannual programme to promote European tourism. The subject has been considered several times since then. The Austrian Presidency took it up again and at its meeting of 7 December 1998 the Council once again considered the multiannual programme to promote European tourism on the basis of a document drawn up by the Austrian Presidency. In spite of the presidency"s proposal to shorten the duration of the programme and to reduce the budget funds allocated to it, some delegations continued to raise objections. Let me point out that if no consensus is reached the German Presidency proposes the following: continuation of the work on this programme, taking account of the recommendations made by the High Level Group on Tourism and Employment, and renewed consideration of the subject in the light of new developments.</p>

In this regard, I am interested in the position of the Council, that is if it insists on solving the Cyprus problem on the basis of the recent Security Council Resolutions 1217 and 1218, and if it considers that a loose federation, such as that sought after by Mr Denktash – and unfortunately Sir David Hannay appeared to agree with this idea – is the solution which the European Union could be happy with in respect of the Cyprus problem and in respect of the process of solving one of the longest‐standing problems in Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">The German embassy in New Delhi, India, reportedly issued an official document on 6 January 1999 concerning the German Presidency's objectives for the first six months of 1999. This document makes no reference to the accession of Cyprus to the EU; chapter 5 ('Enlargement of the EU and accession process – European Conference', pp. 17 and 18) merely refers to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, while placing particular emphasis on the promotion of EU relations with Turkey.</p>

The contents of the official telegram from your embassy were not disclosed this time by Sir David Hannay, but by the representative of the German Government.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like you to give me a direct answer. Firstly, what is the position of the German Government and of the German Presidency? That is what concerns me. Is there a question mark over the accession talks concerning Cyprus because the political problem has not been solved?

<p class="contents">Question No 26 by <span class="bold">Maj Theorin </span>(H−0061/99)<span class="italic"> Subject: Nuclear disarmament</span></p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear weapons continue to represent a huge threat to the whole of humanity merely because they exist. The UN General Assembly has decided, by a very large majority, to support the proposal by Sweden and Ireland for new nuclear disarmament measures. The vote showed a marked change in attitudes towards nuclear weapons; the only EU Member States to vote against the resolution were the UK and France.</p>
<p class="contents">What steps does the Council intend to take to support new nuclear disarmament measures?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to appeal to your generosity, Mr Verheugen, and ask you to answer Mrs Theorin's question.</p>

Naturally the European Union is committed to strengthening the Non‐Proliferation Treaty and making it universal. This treaty gives rise to obligations on the part of nuclear states to take nuclear disarmament measures. The EU reaffirmed this commitment and took note of the decision in question and of the New Agenda Resolution at the European Council in Cardiff on 15‐16 June 1998, thus expressing its position.</p>

My reason for putting it is that nuclear disarmament is at a standstill. Nothing much had happened before the initiative by Sweden and Ireland, amongst others, which prompted new questions about a realistic way to eliminate nuclear weapons. The initiative was based on the Canberra Commission proposals, as they are called. It does not involve anything unrealistic or Utopian, but is a practical initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that most Member States of the Union either voted for the resolution or abstained; only the two nuclear powers voted against it. I have high hopes that the German Presidency will be prepared to take up the initiative, bringing nuclear disarmament a step nearer.</p>

The German Presidency attaches the utmost importance to strengthening the non‐proliferation system, to ensuring that the provisions are respected, that the commitments contained in the treaty are fulfilled and that the non‐proliferation system can be maintained and further developed in future too. As you yourself just described, there are still differences of opinion on this subject among the Member States of the European Union; that also applies to the New Agenda Resolution tabled by Ireland, Sweden and a number of other states in the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Irrespective of these differences of opinion, the reasons for which you know as well as I, let me also emphasise that there is agreement in some important areas. That means the Council supports the implementation of the decision, of the principles and objectives of nuclear non‐proliferation and disarmament, of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference. In this context I would point out again that under this treaty the nuclear states have undertaken to totally abolish these weapons in the framework of the general disarmament efforts, under strict and effective international control.</p>

Would it not agree that this report and others reveal that the extent of damage to fisheries by seals is very significant financially in local terms?

I received another non‐answer from the Commission. I do not know where we stand.</p>
<p class="contents">European taxpayers' money was given to the <span class="italic">Bord Iascaigh Mhara </span> to do this research. The documentation and the serious scientific research has been in print since 1997 and it sits there gathering dust. I suspect, Mr President‐in‐Office, that we lack courage to tackle this major problem. But I want to point out to you that in the three sample cod catches on the west coast of Ireland, 98 % of the cod caught in the nets was either destroyed or severely damaged by the seals.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, with other species of white fish, the overall figure was 58.8 % of the total allowable catch of Irish fishermen destroyed by seals one way or another. It will take a lot of courage to stand up to the nonsense that goes on about those pretty animals. They may be pretty with their heads out of the water but they are not so pretty beneath the sea where they are devouring thousands of tonnes of very precious fish and food for the people of Europe. I say to the critics: is it more important to feed the seals or to feed human beings? My opinion is that it is more important to feed human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like the President‐in‐Office to continue to put pressure on the Commission to have the moral courage to stand up to this awful situation which is staring us all in the face.</p>
