<p class="contents">First there is the paragraph inviting the Commission to withdraw its proposal. We are sorry to hear from Mrs Gradin that Mr Flynn cannot be here, but she has explained that he intended to propose withdrawing the proposal to amend the 1976 directive. I do not know whether that formula is to do with the internal organisation of the Commission. Is Mr Flynn required to propose withdrawal of the proposal to the Commission, which we know to be a college after all the debates we have had on the subject? If he does so, can we be sure the college will back him? It is very important for us to know that. If the Commission had told us it was withdrawing the proposal, that would have been fine. But it is telling us it is going to propose – I do not know to whom, to itself, I suppose – to withdraw the proposal to amend the 1976 directive, which we consider dangerous for positive action, and I want to know whether the Commission is effectively going to withdraw this proposal. Is it going to back Mr Flynn?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions) </span></p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry, but this is very important. You may think issues of equal opportunity for men and women do not matter much. Well, I want to point out to the male majority here that they will soon need positive action too, because the professions are becoming more predominantly female. In my country there are hardly any male teachers in primary schools and hardly any male magistrates left. So positive action is not just for women. It is for under‐represented sexes and you will soon be an under‐represented sex. So you need to realise that positive action is for you as well.</p>

The authentic text is ‘under certain conditions". That needs to be made very clear. Obviously we do not want to legalise abortion wholesale, without conditions, at least not in my group. So it has to be ‘under certain conditions".</p>

The audiovisual sector plays an essential role in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The present draft decision seeks to define more precisely the industry, the various audiovisual markets and related sectors, and to get a better idea of its components and the way they are evolving, by establishing an appropriate statistical information infrastructure. This is a useful exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the Europe of Nations Group are therefore in favour of this decision, provided certain amendments are adopted. The ‘relevance" of these statistics needs to be monitored and the statistical data must be collected in the light of a ‘need to know" for businesses, but also to manage policies in the sector. So Eurostat should at least look at employment levels and trends, qualification requirements, and age distribution for this sector, which would give some insight into the policies undertaken at both European and national levels.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital not to forget the essential role of the SMEs in this sector. Too often, when it is mentioned, the need for concentration is highlighted. But business in the audiovisual sector is essentially done by small and medium‐sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">So policy must support these SMEs, and there is also the advantage that they are distributed right across the entire territory of the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to mention that these SMEs will only be able to develop through cooperation at European level and real subsidiarity benefiting Member States and respecting their autonomous policies, taking account of the impact and influence of their national languages as well as their individual cultural diversity. That is the only way to avoid another type of uniformity, which would not respect the specificity and diversity of our European culture.</p>

<p class="contents">1. Negotiations between the governments on the reform of agricultural policy are still in progress and will be resumed today. There is no reason for Parliament to comment on individual sections of agricultural policy in the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">2. Special decisions which benefit some Members States pose a threat to the reform process as a whole.</p>

<p class="contents">As the CAP"s name indicates, it is a common policy. That is why the Europe of Nations Group opposes paragraphs 3 and 7 of the rapporteur"s resolution. In fact, a specific regional agricultural policy for the agriculture of the arctic regions is being proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">While it might be possible for us to consider incorporating specific products, such as reindeer, into an existing COM, for example the COM in beef, we should not use the excuse of a specific ecosystem to replace a common agricultural policy with 30 specific agricultural policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The regional aspects of the CAP must be recognised in both rural development policy and regional policy. I would emphasise that the sub‐arctic regions are currently part of Objective 6 and have been incorporated into the new Objective 1 under Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">So these regions benefit now, and will continue to benefit in the future, from specific and significant support to compensate for the higher costs inherent in the ecosystem. I would remind you that, in the context of regional policy for this region, Community subsidies amount to 75 % of the total cost of structural investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, as paragraphs 3 and 7 were adopted, our group voted against the resolution in the final vote.</p>
<p class="contents">After the drive by some people to ‘break" the CAP by incorporating the principle of cofinancing, a principle which is contrary to the Treaty and the specific status of compulsory expenditure, others are now hoping to damage the CAP by trying to regionalise it on the basis of specific ecosystems.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of our group are attached to the CAP which has been one of the fundamental bases of the construction of Europe as enshrined in the Treaty of Rome. It is surprising that those who defend an integrated and federal Europe should be destroying the only genuine common policy apart from the common fisheries policy.</p>

They are a central factor in development and the keystone of employment in European Union countries. In the European Union 99 % of companies have fewer than 250 employees and they represent 66 % of total employment. Almost all of them contributed to net job creation during the period 1988‐1995.</p>
<p class="contents">At some stage in their development all SMEs experience problems arising from their weak capital resources. So risk capital needs to be developed. If we take the United States as an example, of seven million jobs created in that country between 1991 and 1995, six million were the result of new SMEs starting up. Some of them have become large companies, even world leaders, in the high‐technology sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United States it is easy for an SME to obtain access to risk capital. Things are very different today in European Union countries, where SMEs with competitive advantages in terms of high technology are penalised in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">So entrepreneurs must be able to access start‐up capital, then intermediate and development capital as the company expands, and, finally, they must be able to access institutional and private investors supported by a sizeable European financial market.</p>
<p class="contents">At Community level, the absence of legislation on venture capital funds is an obstacle to the operation of the market. Existing Community financial regulations are too fragmented and are lacking in terms of both readability and consistency. We might do well here to draw on the experience of the United States, which created a national control body – the Security and Exchange Commission – by establishing a regulatory body responsible for harmonising the provisions of national regulations so as to allow secondary financial markets to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the finance that venture capitalists can mobilise, there is also a vital need for mentorship in terms of management. Finance and mentorship should go hand in hand. A simple but effective way for the investor to reduce risk is to be directly or indirectly involved in the daily management of his or her investment and to give the entrepreneur real support.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Europe of Nations Group would like to highlight the contradiction we face. We are all aware of the role of SMEs, and we often boast of their economic success and the major role they play in creating jobs, but when we are dealing with environmental standards, technical standards and administrative measures, the majority in our Parliament does not pay enough attention to the concerns of entrepreneurs and their special responsibilities. Entrepreneurs take major risks with few guarantees, either in terms of welfare payments and or in terms of retaining their family property.</p>

Fragmentation itself probably has very little to do with the availability of capital.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my main objection is that, to my way of thinking, the principle reason for the major shortage in terms of small businesses in the European Union is low demand rather than the availability of capital. If demand were to increase, so too would risk capital, regardless of whether the markets are fragmented or not.</p>
<p class="contents">I also object to the numerous references to tax harmonisation. This has nothing to do with the subject under discussion and is simply an expression of a desire to create a federal Europe. The report would have been better without such intellectual ballast.</p>

Community cooperation policy for youth has undeniably achieved a great deal in terms of education, vocational training and exchanges through the Socrates, Leonardo and Youth for Europe programmes (and we should add the European voluntary service initiative to that). But these achievements are still not enough to meet the specific needs of young people. Highlighting the need for education and training for all, however essential that may be, is not sufficient to create a youth policy. Complementary issues need to be considered, such as creativity, civic education, learning about tolerance and democracy, health and housing.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur sets out these objectives very clearly, while respecting the necessary complementarity and added value that Europe brings to the ‘plinth" formed by the Member States. Hence her appeal to the Member States to draw up ‘national plans for young people", similar to those they drew up for employment. The Commission"s role, after evaluating the national youth policies, is to disseminate information about best practice and the most successful examples within the European Union. All of this can assist the creation of innovative projects, by and for young people, and encourage young people"s spirit of enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">Youth policy at Union level must be designed to pay greater attention to young people and involve them more in decisions through youth groups. I will therefore be voting for this report, which gives us an overall view of what that European policy might be at the dawn of the 21st century.</p>

This document reflects our group"s main concerns about the future of the ACP‐EU link.</p>
<p class="contents">ACP‐EU cooperation has proved its effectiveness, and is an indispensable instrument of multilateral cooperation for the EU and the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, yet it is under unprecedented attack, putting its survival at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Predictability and confidence are central to this instrument. The fear is, unfortunately, that these factors are being undermined by the continuous attacks to which it is being subjected by those whose view of the new world order includes no regulation other than that of markets and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the ACP‐EU Joint Assembly more than ever constitutes an essential forum where the people and their elected representatives can express their real needs and be heard. It is also the place to reflect on the long‐term future of North‐South relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Joint Assembly is also playing a central role in the negotiations for the next Lomé Convention. In particular, it has spoken out on several occasions in favour of giving greater consideration to the legitimate interests of developing countries in the world economic order. Since 1995 it has been expressing alarm at the negative consequences the Marrakesh Agreements were bound to have on the very existence of preferential tariffs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lomé Convention is an exemplary instrument of North‐South cooperation. It must certainly adapt to the progressive diversification of ACP countries and, in particular, to the development of the African private sector, as the President of the OAU, Mr Blaise Compaoré, rightly stressed this morning in this Chamber. In this era of globalisation it is as relevant as ever. The Lomé system must be renewed and strengthened, not weakened in the name of a free trade ideology that is irresponsible and is prepared to expose countries with fragile societies and budding economies to excessive competitive shocks which would have destabilising and destructive effects on them.</p>

<p class="contents">The Europe of Nations Group very much welcomes this cooperation to promote a pan‐European transport policy based on a partnership among the main actors involved, the states first and foremost.</p>
<p class="contents">The first such conference only took place in 1991, in Prague, and it opened the way for the first steps towards a common transport policy between countries bordering on the European Union and its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Three working groups were set up in 1994 at the Crete Conference: Transport and Market Economy, Transport Infrastructure and Financing, and Horizon 2000 (intermodal transport, new technologies, safety and environmental protection). For the first time, a special link was established with the Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs).</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the third conference, which was held in Helsinki, introduced long‐term promotion of transport systems which are efficient, respect the environment, and can meet the economic, social, environmental and safety requirements of the public and of businesses. It was also necessary to reduce regional disparities and equip the European economy to compete on world markets. That is why principles of interoperability, subsidiarity, transparency in decision making and non‐discriminatory cooperation were established at all levels and between all the parties and groups involved in the transport sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the decisions adopted in Helsinki is to implement the following measures: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ approximation of safety and environmental legislation; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ progressive liberalisation of transport markets; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ development of intermodality; </p>

<p class="contents">Alongside very widespread and well‐known diseases, there are a whole series of diseases which affect only a limited number of patients. Some 5 000 diseases of this kind have been identified. However, pharmaceutical research and development is so expensive that the industry is not inclined to develop medicinal products for the treatment of these diseases. With such a limited market, the industry cannot make a profit on the cost of developing these treatments, hence the term ‘orphan" medicinal products. So incentives need to be established to encourage the industry to develop this type of medicinal product to help sufferers not only in the European Union but throughout the world, certainly including developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Commission"s proposal is to establish a Community procedure for designating orphan medicinal products and to provide incentives for related research, development and marketing, in particular by granting exclusive marketing rights for ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Europe of Nations Group certainly applauds this initiative from the Commission, because it is an example of real cooperation between Member States where a larger market facilitates costly research, we do find it regrettable and unacceptable that the process has been so slow. This proposal for a regulation was actually included in the Commission"s 1997 programme. Apart from the fact that it has taken nearly two years to present this proposal for a regulation, we have to recognise that an incentive system for developing orphan medicinal products has existed in the United States since 1983. A comparable system was introduced in Japan in 1995, Singapore in 1997 and Australia in 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">Areas vital to the health of Europeans certainly ought to be prioritised for intensified action and initiative by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe of Nations Group has voted for the amendments supported by the rapporteur, Professor Cabrol. We hope the process will be completed rapidly, because we all know it is necessary to act quickly where public health is concerned. The European pharmaceutical industry can take advantage of this type of programme to develop new medicinal products more easily, thus helping to boost the level of research and enhance its reputation.</p>

But there is many a slip ‘twixt cup and lip, as shown by the difficulty of actually obtaining truly equal treatment between men and women in terms of access to employment and vocational training. There are many reasons for this, several of them involving the persistence of stereotypes prejudicial to women who work.</p>
<p class="contents">Equal treatment is a very important issue. Parliament has demonstrated its great interest in this area on a number of occasions. But the debate we are holding today seems to be outdated, for two reasons. The first is that the ruling of the Court of Justice in the Marschall case has made it broadly possible to clarify the meaning of its ruling in the Kalanke case. Secondly, under the Amsterdam Treaty, equal opportunities policy is a Community mission, and political and objective equality is a collective right. In addition, it provides a strengthened legal basis for positive action in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no longer any point to the Commission"s proposal to amend Directive 76/207/EEC following the Kalanke ruling. So I agree with the rapporteur. We should reject the Commission"s proposal and invite it to prepare a new proposal for a directive which takes account of the new factors which have since arisen.</p>

As Christians we cannot pronounce against life and the unborn child is just as alive as the child that has been born. This is something we find quite simply intolerable, which is why I voted against out of my innermost conviction. Today we are in the minority. Perhaps we will be in the majority one day, for in the long term this situation will be a great disaster for our population. Let me also say that I am not against women, for whom I have infinite respect. I have seven children and 18 grandchildren. So you can imagine how much I respect my wife.

However, I cannot support the reference to abortion. The European Union has absolutely no competence in this area. It cannot interfere in the policy of individual Member States in this sensitive area, nor, I believe, would it wish to do so. This is formally stated in the Treaties in reference to public policy, which is reserved exclusively for the Member States. Member States have an absolute right to legislate in matters of public policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as my own personal position is concerned, I have voted in accordance with my own conscience, which is that I am opposed to abortion. However, just as I am guided by my own conscience, I do not presume to pass judgement on how other people will act in relation to their own consciences and in very difficult circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also supported paragraph 10, simply because if one wants to reduce the number of abortions, one should recognise the right of individuals to avail of counselling about sex education, including counselling about responsibilities in relationships and information about contraception. I was guided by these particular principles when I voted on this important report.</p>

<p class="contents">It is surely rather curious for a report on women"s health to call for the alleged right to abortion. For me, health policy means saving lives and not destroying them. If a report on women"s health does refer to abortion in the first place, then in my view there should also be some discussion of the effects of post‐abortion syndrome. But the harmful psychological effects that abortions have on women are deliberately and constantly concealed.</p>
<p class="contents">Pregnancy is not an illness! It is absurd to posit a so‐called women"s right to go against the right to life, which applies to everyone. Demands of this kind abuse the dignity of women and create a culture of death, which in the final analysis rebounds against women and harms them. For these reasons I had to vote against the Hautala report.</p>

Furthermore, the report contains a number of specific ideas which should lead to a breakthrough as regards the status of gender in health.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is one issue, outlined in paragraph 11, which clearly detracts from the report's otherwise good intentions. Entitlement to free abortions equates with women having the right to manage their lives and make decisions about their own bodies. It should always be the woman's choice as to whether she wishes to terminate her pregnancy. Every day, 500 women die from the complications that arise as a result of illegal and risky abortions. The only way to deal with the problem is to give women access to contraceptives and safe, legal abortions. In our view, the right to free abortions should be unconditional.</p>

It points out some of the illnesses faced by women and also puts forward some proposals about how certain policies could be adapted so that consideration is given to women"s special needs. However, we have problems with some parts of the report, for example the sections where the Commission is called upon to ensure that regular check‐ups for breast and uterine cancer are free and repeated at intervals, where attention is drawn to the benefits and side‐effects of hormone replacement therapy in connection with menstruation problems, and where the demand is made for the sexual rights of women to be safeguarded. We believe that these are matters which should be dealt with by the Member States. However, we can fully support these measures, as long as they are carried out at national level.</p>

Given the stresses of contemporary society and the increasing responsibilities women rightly have within it, it is important to recognise in this way the specific health problems women are facing, or are liable to face.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Committee on Women"s Rights and the European Parliament thought fit to include abortion in the list of problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In chairing the meeting, Mrs Fontaine herself recognised that this was a ‘sensitive" issue. Is it right that the life of a child in its mother"s womb should be dealt with surreptitiously, as one point among so many others, in a report examined between a request for waiver of immunity and a communication from the Commission? There is no easy answer to the painful issue of abortion. Respect for all life should make us act responsibly when faced with the distress some mothers suffer, as well as welcoming life which only women have the joy of giving, though not without the intervention of a man; this is a fact that we must unfortunately point out, since the affirmation of women"s rights can lead to the rights – and duties – of fathers being overlooked. At any rate, this subject should at least be dealt with more objectively and seriously than has been the case today.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am sorry to find some on the left applauding this text, just as they applaud the liberalisation of the ‘drug market" or the recognition of euthanasia, seeing this as progress in our society while in fact only a terrible culture of death is gaining ground.

This means a specific health policy for each sex is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The report deals with work by the European Commission which takes account of this requirement for the first time. That can only be a source of satisfaction. The European Commission must continue to forge ahead, paying special attention to the problem of women"s health in its new action programme on health.</p>
<p class="contents">Some health problems concern only, or mainly, women. Specific measures are therefore needed. I would also like to highlight the new eating disorders which are wreaking havoc among adolescents. It is deplorable that the European Commission"s report does not give them higher priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Women live five years longer than men on average and are more affected by physical and psychological problems linked to ageing. As a member of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, I would like to mention that the fifth framework programme provides funding for research to meet the challenge of ageing population.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must take account of the fact that unemployment, which is more frequent amongst women, job insecurity and poor social security cover have repercussions on women"s health. It is well known that health care is virtually a luxury for people with limited means. That is absolutely intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must implement a global approach that includes both a specific health policy for women and employment and social security policies which incorporate a health dimension.</p>

Too often, in fact, the issue of health is approached globally, disregarding the specific needs of each sex. So I fully support the demand for regular assessment of the gender impact in all health budgets, programmes and projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is particularly important to emphasise how much the state of women"s health may depend not on the specific physiology of their sex but on socio‐economic disparities that are objectively quantifiable and verifiable. Member States need to recognise this and remedy the situation by means of appropriate policies and measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Domestic violence – including marital rape and sexual mutilation – also constitutes a particularly worrying attack on women"s health and we need to put maximum effort into combating it. In fact this must be a fundamental dimension of Community‐funded campaigns for combating violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same spirit, I share the rapporteur"s conviction that Member States must implement all necessary measures, including criminal prosecution, to eradicate this evil and help the women who are victims of it.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, and more generally, I want to stress the importance of prevention as a means of fighting early deterioration of health in general, and the consequent importance of the kind of society we want for ourselves and our children.</p>

What are the prerequisites guaranteeing that laws – where they exist and are good – are effective?</p>
<p class="contents">We need: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ a society that gives women the freedom to make vital choices. In other words: creches, school help, home help, medical help, shop opening hours, flexible working arrangements, teleworking, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ education, from an early age, in equality and peace. In other words: teacher training and curricular reforms from kindergarten level onwards so that from an early age tomorrow's men and women can build different relationships with each other and with the world around them, excluding violence from their daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Female involvement in public responsibilities is necessary for a healthy democracy, but it needs to be done not against men or despite men but always with them. The notion of quotas is a last resort and a subject that mainly comes up at election time, but it is a solution that I shall never support because women are not a minority in need of protection. What they do need is positive discrimination in the work place to enable them to come up to the level corresponding to the 52 % of the population that they represent.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that the Daphne programme will develop a coordinated policy between the Member States to promote public recognition for the role of women and I hope that my country will finally take the basic measures necessary to deal with the under‐representation of women in decision‐making posts.

<p class="contents">This involves bringing about fundamental changes of both an external and internal nature to and in the existing institutions. ‘Quite simply, what is involved is a power struggle. A redistribution which is as difficult for those with power to accept as the struggle to redistribute economic resources from the haves to the have‐nots."</p>
<p class="contents">This objective requires a comprehensive approach to policy making and the mobilisation of all policy actors. It involves a systematic rather than an individual approach, which is why the rapporteur is calling on the Commission to develop an evaluation method to identify the impact of all Community policies and measures on gender equality. She also asks for gender relevant statistics and for the Member States to act in a similar manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur also calls on the Commission to identify the circumstances and reasons why, for equal work, women are valued lower than men in terms of pay. In addition, she gives specific examples of how to promote gender equality in various policy fields, in particular by setting aside a percentage of the Structural Funds for measures specifically for women or by treating social services which provide child care and care for the elderly as infrastructural requirements. Similarly, in public contracting, tenders should indicate how many jobs per year the project will create and how these jobs will be divided between women and men, and so on.</p>

As may be expected, this involves underlining the current shortcomings and the subsequent requirements. The rapporteur"s requests include the following: an evaluation method to identify the impact of the measures taken; the implementation by the Member States of the recommendation on the balanced participation of women and men in the decision‐making process; the identification by the Commission of the reasons why women with equivalent qualifications are valued lower than men in terms of pay, and the setting up of a working party between Parliament and the Commission to promote the objective of equality between women and men in all spheres of activity of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lulling"s report on the ‘proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions" is radical, and rightly so. It rejects the Commission proposal which is based on the European Court of Justice ruling on the Kalanke case and it calls for a new proposal for a directive based instead on the Treaty of Amsterdam and on recognition of the collective nature of the positive action measures needed in order to achieve equal treatment and opportunities for men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the Kalanke and Marschall rulings, the rapporteur rightly concludes that ‘only rigid, inflexible and automatic positive discrimination granting the absolute and unconditional right to appoint or promote women where they are under‐represented would be incompatible with Community law".</p>
<p class="contents">She consequently calls on the Commission to await the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam which requires the Community to eliminate all inequalities and to promote equality between men and women and which allows Member States to maintain and adopt positive action measures in favour of the under‐represented sex. The Commission must withdraw its now outdated proposal and present a new directive which clearly must be based on the Treaty of Amsterdam. Only constant vigilance on our part to ensure that our equality requirements become reality will allow us to fight against the ever‐prevalent spirit of conservatism.</p>

<p class="contents">However, equal opportunities cannot just remain an ideal but must become an objective which must be achieved. In this respect, we welcome the fact that this objective was incorporated into the European employment strategy, as agreed in Luxembourg in November 1997, and that the Vienna European Council called on the Member States to make tangible progress on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We clearly have a long way to go to achieve real equality as so many sexist prejudices and attitudes are still so ingrained in us and in our actions that we are not even aware of their profoundly discriminatory nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Without underestimating the extent and difficulty of an evaluation task which is uniquely complicated by the diversity of our cultures and traditions, I share the rapporteur"s belief that the Commission must strive to define accurate indicators and common criteria which will enable the progress made in equal opportunities to be regularly evaluated. This work must be based on specific objectives and clear and predefined accountability mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">To change society is an ambitious objective and we must therefore firstly make sure that our own ‘house" is in order. This is why I totally support the rapporteur"s proposal calling on Parliament and its political groups to take certain initiatives to effectively promote genuine equal opportunities for men and women within the European Parliament.</p>

We all know that the future of society depends on women and so everyone is in favour of equality, parity and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in India is appalling as 50 million women are missing because they are eliminated right from the stage of conception.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet this legitimate defence of dignity, equality and freedom is hypocritical!</p>
<p class="contents">How can Europe allow the immigration of Jews, Muslims and those with diminished legal status while defending the rights of women enslaved by countries, religions and ‘civilisations" supported by us?</p>
<p class="contents">In Belgrade, we are threatening to bomb a people who refuse to hand over the region of Kosovo to a culture which practises concealment and confinement. In Baghdad, we are bombing a secular people where the women teach and work, and yet we are supporting the interests of countries where women are veiled, confined and demeaned.</p>
<p class="contents">You should realise that the defence of women is simply rhetoric when not confirmed by the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">But it gets worse. Are we really sure that blatant injustice is based on gender rather than society? Are women marginalised because they are women or because they are members of a disadvantaged social group? When Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister of India, it is well known that women were not victimised among the Brahmins. It was among the poor, the untouchables and the working class that women were victimised.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the cynical part of the Left"s feminist rhetoric as it uses gender to classify discriminations which are actually social. It is not because she is a woman that the female worker in the textile industry is in a sorry situation, it is because she is working class.</p>
<p class="contents">What is appalling is not so much that the number of women in parliament is small but that the number of working‐class women, female employees, women who are socially of low birth and women of modest income is played down. Where is the progress in replacing a male MP from the upper middle classes with his privileged wife, sister or daughter? This is even more pertinent given that those supervising the political leadership will always replace elected males from modest backgrounds with elected females from privileged backgrounds.</p>
<p class="contents">What a deception the Left is practising! It is forgetting its working‐class roots. It is forgetting the poor, the disadvantaged and the marginalised in order to protect one more advantage of the social category which already has everything, even a clear conscience.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already had to suffer the anti‐racist rhetoric which would have us believe that social discrimination is based on colour. In fact, the basis of racism is social. The top universities, the highest circles, the magical places of power are not closed to blacks or to women, but to the poor.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on we will have to suffer even more of the anti‐patriarchal rhetoric of Mrs Eriksson in particular and of the Scandinavians in general or of Swedes. It was in Sweden under a Socialist government that 60 000 women from modest backgrounds were sterilised. The descendants of that government are here today claiming to be defenders of freedom and dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">The revolution in our societies will not occur by changing the sexual order as this is only a reflection of other greater inequalities. Now and in the future, the revolution to prevent actions which injure, humiliate and destroy will occur by changing the social inequalities which Europe has simply aggravated. The fate of the poorest, of those at the bottom of the wage, income and asset scales, still depends on the goodwill of those at the top of the tree.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what is appalling and this is what feminism, like anti‐racism, makes us forget. It is clearly not by chance that feminists and anti‐racists are by profession from the privileged classes.</p>
