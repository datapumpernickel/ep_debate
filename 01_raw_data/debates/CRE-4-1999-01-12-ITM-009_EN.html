<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sainjon </span> <span class="bold">(ARE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, at a time when we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Europe, the world"s most important trading power, owes it to itself to continue to further the idea of what I call ‘social globalisation". I firmly believe that if the European Union wishes to have a high degree of credibility on this issue its own record must be irreproachable.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we be taken seriously by the developing countries when in the United Kingdom, for example, two million children have jobs, and 500 000 of these are under the age of fifteen? Why do the authorities there refuse to ratify ILO Convention 138 on child labour? I do not believe it is sufficient to have ratified the European directive on the protection of young people at work or the Social Charter; we must also apply the principles contained in them and take into consideration the fate of these thousands of children who work under extremely difficult conditions in the handling and construction sectors. I could also mention Austria, which has not yet ratified Convention 138, and Ireland, which has not ratified Convention 111 on non‐discrimination. But even with regard to countries that are likely to join the Union, I believe that we need to take steps that are just as strict.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these circumstances, we must not hesitate to rely on the Declaration of fundamental principles, which was adopted by the ILO last June. This includes the conventions on forced labour, child labour, non‐discrimination and freedom to join a trade union. Bringing these conventions together within a single unit constitutes a very important step as it means that the countries that have not ratified one or other of these conventions will still get to see reports on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must therefore take action with the ultimate objective of requiring WTO members to have ratified this ILO Declaration on fundamental principles. But attempts made so far with regard to the developing countries have all failed due to the negative approach that has been taken most of the time. A change occurred in March 1998 when an incentive clause was inserted into the Community GSP for the first time, proposing to introduce a customs bonus for countries that respected these minimum social standards. This helped to create a more positive approach to the social clause. This step could serve as a model for or indeed a precursor to the European Union"s strategy in the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another strategy to promote labour rights at international level is represented by the hundreds of codes of good conduct introduced by multinational companies. However, the right to join a trade union and the right to engage in collective bargaining are often forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that we must now go further. As I see it, a code which is based on the Declaration on fundamental principles must be a minimum core. In concrete terms, Parliament is calling on the European Commission to organise discussions on drafting a European code within a forum bringing together the European Trade Union Confederation, European employers and certain NGOs. The European multinationals will be able to ratify it and their names will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and on the Commission"s Internet sites.</p>
<p class="contents">The code will not contain sanctions but, thanks to the creation of a database, a special unit in the Commission would be able to monitor effectively the companies choosing this path. However, in the long term, it is the WTO that can do most to promote a code of conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity here in Parliament today to make a solemn appeal to all the international institutions, to the world"s most noteworthy figures in the political, philosophical, religious and cultural spheres, to take a joint decision to finally launch a merciless fight to eliminate forced child labour from the world once and for all in the first decade of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">What seems to be a new phenomenon is in fact age‐old. It is not acceptable to allow millions of children to languish in squalor, atrocity and suffering. All children should be able to experience a childhood of play, a childhood of joy, hope and happiness. We who are in a position of political responsibility have a moral duty to show determination in taking the exceptional measures needed to achieve the objective I am proposing; it is an objective inspired by the legacy handed down to us by those who fought, often at the cost of their own lives, to defend human rights throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take a practical approach and consider what measures have proved to be successful. Promoting education is a good thing but it is not enough. The governments of the countries concerned must grant a substitute allowance of a few dollars a month to the families of children who stop working. This is the only solution. It must of course be accompanied by a very strict monitoring policy. UNICEF has denounced the consequences of, for example, the closure or sudden departure of a multinational company. The children do not then turn to school as an alternative but instead find themselves on the street once again, looking for a job to continue to provide for their family, and if they do not find work they often end up in the awful situation of becoming involved in prostitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though the fight for the social clause will be long and difficult, we really have tremendous scope for taking action today. It is up to public opinion to take this on board and to politicians to show that they are not simply sitting back and watching the globalisation of the economy.</p>

That is why I very firmly support minimum social standards at the European level. On the other hand, the globalisation of international trade, which is leading to a liberalisation of trade, investments and capital transfers, compels us to consider social development on a global scale. In its 1995 World Development Report, the World Bank emphasised the importance of good industrial relations to the creation and maintenance of an efficient labour market. This, however, presupposes a democratic system in which employees enjoy rights that enable them to thwart any attempts by governments to gain a competitive edge by means of discrimination, exploitation and repression.</p>
<p class="contents">A second conclusion suggests itself. If international trade is to be potentially beneficial to a country, there must be scope to take decisions and express preferences. In other words, we must grant people at least the same rights as workers that we accord them as consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, therefore, I emphatically endorse the demands for social clauses in international trade agreements. This means that the Member States of the EU would insist on and promote the fundamental standards of social protection, principally in the framework of the International Labour Organisation. It is absolutely essential that the work of the non‐governmental organisations in pursuit of these goals should be supported by the EU and its Member States. Moreover, incentives must be created and enhanced so that the developing countries can be induced to observe the basic social standards – in other words, no sanctions and no concealed protectionism. We should also support trademark campaigns, such as the Rugmark and many others born of consumer initiatives, as well as voluntary undertakings by companies to respect fundamental human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee also supports the inclusion of social clauses in the trade and cooperation agreements concluded by the EU Member States. My opinion contains a proposal for the wording of such a clause. I thank Mr Sainjon for repeating and amplifying in his report the call I made in the opinion, although I do feel that he has overstretched his demands. Excesses are sometimes unhealthy. What I do not understand, however, is why, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Howitt is seeking to delete the good example of the United States from Amendment No 10. I do not really wish to support that deletion.</p>

I can therefore express sincere congratulations to the rapporteurs and the committees which, by virtue of a thorough and open procedure, were able to enhance the original reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not attempt to reiterate or add anything to what the rapporteurs said. I will declare my support by referring to two points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I wish to dwell particularly on and to underscore how important it is, today, just a few days after the introduction of the euro, for us in the European Parliament, us in the European Union, to spell out the true dimension of global society. This is none other than the fact that alongside the global market there is also – I repeat, there is also – another dimension, a global social policy of solidarity. To this I wish to add that it has been shown by authoritative bodies such as the World Trade Organisation that there is no contradiction, no conflict between this and economic development which is at the same time a prerequisite for social prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wish to stress that today, in this phase we are passing through towards enlargement, we in the European Union must insist, by clarifying and refining the Copenhagen criteria, that human rights should be included in this process.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Günther </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, this is not the only time this week that we shall be discussing a code of conduct for international transactions, since tomorrow's agenda, as you know, includes a report on the same subject which was compiled on the initiative of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. I believe there are a few points about these reports on which we have to come to a basic understanding. The first is that we do not have the right on the one hand to include extraterritorial provisions in such reports, and then to criticise the United States in connection with the Helms‐Burton Act.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the developing countries must also be brought into this discussion if it concerns them, for they do not wish to have standards imposed on them over their heads either, standards they have played no part in formulating.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, child labour is a vital point in this whole issue. If this is a report about recognised standards, it should surely take more account of social standards and of other forms of work, instead of being confined to one point that virtually swamps the entire report. International agreements naturally require clarity and precise alignment, so that they can be recognised and observed, especially if we have to insist that this should be a voluntary code of practice.</p>

However, the implementation of agreements entered into is another matter, especially when we are talking about banning child labour. The rapporteur sees a clear role for the European Commission in this field, but unfortunately this role must be limited as the European Union is not a member as such of the International Labour Organisation. Nevertheless, the rapporteur still feels that the Union has certain responsibilities here.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me immediately to my second point. In Article 19 of the resolution the rapporteur requests a European initiative in the fight against child labour. I should very much like to support this, but he proposes, first of all, introducing compensation for families whose children are forced to work and, secondly, education for children in the countries concerned as well as supporting measures.</p>
<p class="contents">This would be an excellent proposal if the Union had any powers in this field. I also wonder whether the rapporteur realises what the financial consequences would be for the Union if we granted a guaranteed income to families in developing countries. I estimate the EU"s budget would double. The Liberal Group is of course solidly behind the banning of child labour. But income support is not the way to go about it. What is vital is education, as the rapporteur has indeed recognised, not only for boys but first and foremost for girls. I therefore call on honourable Members to support the Liberal Group"s amendment to Article 19 which calls for the combating of child labour by means of European measures to support children"s education.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must assume its responsibilities in this field, preferably by cooperating with international organisations such as UNICEF and UNESCO.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Herzog </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Sainjon on his excellent report. Observance of social rights in international trade is a fundamental issue and one that has been under consideration for more than a century without any significant results. One of the major causes of this failure is doubtless the protectionist and unilateral approach of the economically dominant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It must therefore be clear that the affirmation of respect for human rights is not just a matter for the poor and emerging countries but also for the developing countries and in particular for the countries of the European Union. It also requires real solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with this in mind that a strategy has been undertaken by the European Parliament in recent years – and of course André Sainjon has played a very important part in this – to give the European Union a kind of two‐pronged role: as a regional power that can introduce the principles of a social clause into its external relations and, to complement this, that can also act multilaterally, its main concern being, of course, to promotion the multilateral approach.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to internal strategy, beyond what was undertaken within the system of generalised preferences, the committee and its rapporteur want the European Union to develop other dimensions to its own action, in particular in the case of its trade and cooperation agreements and agreements on aid to investment. On the issue of codes of conduct, we have a subtle approach; this will later be coupled with a study of how to incentivise countries to apply sanctions, but it is obviously a step in the right direction. Similarly, it is right that, on the issue of child labour, we should give examples of incentive schemes that go in the direction we wish to take.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we must at the same time take multilateral action – this second role reinforces the first, and the first is not possible without the second – and this is done by means of two major ideas. The first involves not only recognising fundamental social rights but also beginning to put in place instruments for enforcing observance, in cooperation with the ILO and the WTO. The second involves pursuing policies that allow affirmation of the joint imperatives of competitiveness and social progress at multilateral level. This presupposes very strong objectives such as the abolition of child labour or education of children, objectives that must be developed at the same time perhaps as pursuing other possibilities such as setting up or improving upon systems of social protection. But this is undeniably a very good report.</p>

The ILO Conventions are undoubtedly very helpful in that respect. It is high time we implemented them, but how? In the debate on the World Trade Organisation and the GATT agreements, there were absolutely no problems involved in deciding on everything, even enforceable sanctions, that would further the cause of deregulation and liberalisation. But when it is a matter of creating acceptable conditions for people at work, out come conventions that are not binding, and suddenly we are being warned not to rush into things and not to create excessive burdens.</p>
<p class="contents">There is only one thing I can say to you: if we do not finally make up our minds to introduce binding standards, we shall gradually create the same conditions that exist elsewhere. It is surely unacceptable that people all over the world are now being pitted against each other in a race to achieve the grimmest working conditions, the lowest pay levels and the worst social standards. And yet that is precisely where this development will lead, which is why I am so delighted that Mr Sainjon has presented such a clear report.</p>

<p class="contents">The need for balance between the liberalisation of international trade and commerce, on the one hand, and viable economic development with respect for human and social rights on the other hand, is today a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for the very survival of our planet. That is why we must achieve agreement about commonly accepted rules and the way they should be implemented, and why a code of basic social obligations should be drawn up. To this end, the Union should forthwith take priority measures as follows: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ Firstly, it should give active support to the initiatives of the International Labour Organisation and facilitate its cooperation with the WTO, with the aim that all WTO members should ratify at least the ILO's declaration of fundamental principles.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ Secondly, it should take action to combat forced child labour and to finance programmes that assist the school education and vocational training of children, with parallel compensation – I agree with that – for loss of family income. Besides, we have the very good example of the Union's programme for Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned in a recent report by the International Labour Office, approximately 250 million children all over the world, aged between 5 and 14 years, are working under harsh conditions for humiliatingly low wages, while 120 million children have to give up their schooling to take up work. Just recently there have been revelations about child labour in Turkey and about the behaviour of some multinational companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that with its continually increasing profile, authority and political power, the European Union can intervene effectively to establish labour norms which will respect human rights all over the world.</p>

<p class="contents">The size of this divide may be interesting. But does it really come as a surprise? The report by André Sainjon may enable considerable progress to be made in terms of social standards. It introduces into economic relations values and standards promoting collective bargaining. It takes up the fight against the exploitation of children, which includes employing them to make toys for our own children. It is therefore without the slightest hesitation that I support his appeal and his proposals, which demonstrate both pragmatism and a real political will.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I am particularly pleased with the introduction of social clauses for undertakings benefiting from Community measures for investment in third countries. In line with this proposal, I would like to see this mechanism extended in future to undertakings which respond to invitations to tender in the area of public procurement. Authorities should be able to set out basic principles and minimum social conditions in their tender specifications.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, in public procurement accepting the lowest bid all too often means accepting the lowest bid in social terms both within and on the part of the undertaking chosen, and this is not good for anyone, especially not the employees.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to conclude, although I support the proposal to list in the Official Journal and on the Commission"s Internet sites the companies that do not observe the minimum social rules that have been fixed, I admit that, personally, I would have preferred more tangible or heavier sanctions. However, for all that, I must say once again that I fully support the report and proposals by André Sainjon.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Vice‐President of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, the Commission welcomes this excellent report by Mr Sainjon, which demonstrates once again his sensitivity in these matters. We believe that this is the right time to take stock of the European Union"s policy on such a sensitive and ever‐changing issue, and I think that Parliament and the Commission have always cooperated actively and successfully in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">From a general point of view, the Commission agrees with the analyses, questions and concerns set out by Mr Sainjon and, in general, by the European Parliament. And it is true to say that as far as this issue is concerned, we are at a crossroads. Since the first major debate on this matter in Parliament, in 1994, we have taken various measures. One of these – and this was a very important point when we first discussed the matter – was to reject an approach relying on constraints, sanctions or protectionism, an approach that was also clearly rejected at the World Trade Organisation"s Ministerial Conference in Singapore in 1996. Instead, the European Union decided to follow the line recommended by the European Parliament by defining a policy based on the promotion of internationally recognised social standards through incentive schemes, such as those that come under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). We joined our partners throughout the world in a dialogue based on cooperation and encouragement. This is illustrated in what we believe to be the most significant advance made, that is, the negotiations with the Pakistani Government on the IPEC programme, which is a very ambitious programme where we have done all we can to increase our level of cooperation with Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">To reply to what other speakers have said, such as Mr Kreissl‐Dörfler, this agreement has at least been signed. We must now look at how we are going to implement it. In any event, this is an example of how the Commission does sometimes get things right. The negotiations with Pakistan were far from easy, but we now have a very important and clear project that is going to be implemented there on the highly sensitive issue of child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr Sainjon, I believe that the approach taken by the European Commission is entirely in line with the report adopted by Parliament in 1994. We have also acted on negative aspects such as in the specific case of Burma, where we had to adapt the entire procedural system at the request of the European Trade Union Confederation and NGOs, as there were no precedents on how the Commission might exclude Burma from the benefits of the GSP.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the assessment of the Union"s policy is, in principle, a positive one, taking into account that we need time to develop the programmes. We have a policy based on incentive schemes and to apply it we have the special mechanism of the GSP at our disposal. However, this is clearly not enough and we believe that the European Parliament, and particularly Mr Sainjon, are right to emphasis that point.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still many obstacles to overcome to ensure that this policy is suitably implemented on the ground. The first of these lies in the mechanism itself, the Generalised System of Preferences. This mechanism is limited by its very definition. It involves an additional preferential margin of between 15 % and 25 % according to the products involved, yet this is currently very limited since, as the WTO negotiations progress, the preferential nature of the GSP is naturally going to diminish and it will become less attractive as time goes on. This is a reality that we have to face. As a result of this, the tariff margins will gradually become less and less appealing over the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from the invitation made to the Commission in the report, it would be extremely interesting to look at how social and environmental aspects could be given full consideration in the trade agreements the European Union negotiates or plans to negotiate, particularly in cases involving free trade or the progressive liberalisation of exchanges.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring here, first and foremost, to the region that affects me personally, that is, the Mediterranean countries, the ACP countries – if this idea is accepted in the review of the new agreement – and Latin America, with Mercosur and countries such as Chile and Mexico.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, this strategy must not put the objectives of the common commercial policy at risk. There is also a series of interesting precedents, including the fact that such clauses are already included in the Free Trade Agreement for the Latin American region and, as you know, they also exist in the bilateral agreements with Chile and Canada. As a result, I would say that, although progress is slow, little by little this philosophy is starting to spread.</p>
<p class="contents">The Howitt report, which we are going to debate tomorrow, covers the issue of the code of conduct for European undertakings, and we do indeed need to make progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Another interesting idea is the European initiative on the creation of the financial conditions required for a genuine accompanying policy to help families and provide education for children. The Commission will obviously have to consider this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, leaving aside these additional provisions, we cannot ignore the reality of the matter. The real obstacle is not a technical one but is, above all, a political one. The mechanism – the Generalised System of Preferences – exists and could still be used. However, it is not being used, or at least it is not being used sufficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 25 May 1998, when it was adopted, only one country has requested the benefits involved in the so‐called social clause. That country is Moldova. That is the only request we have received. Moldova"s request only represents a small step, but it is at least of some significance. The other countries are reluctant to take the initiative, so we must therefore establish political dialogue to overcome this reluctance on the part of many third countries to look at social standards and trade on the same level. There is still no international debate that would allow us to convince third countries asking for the GSP benefits to move in the direction we all want. We must admit that many of them still believe that this constitutes interference in their internal affairs. They look at it from a political point of view and say that that is what the ILO is for and that it is enough to sign the ILO"s conventions. In their view, there is therefore no reason why the European Union should seek bilateral agreements in this area, as it means interfering in their internal affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the GSP"s social clause does not cover a sufficiently broad geographical area. As you know, we had proposed to the Council that the social clause be extended. However, the Council rejected this Commission proposal and, for once, allow us to render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar"s, and unto the Council the things which are the Council"s. The Council is not normally present during this type of debate and, as a result, the Commission always has to take responsibility for explaining such things. I myself do not fully understand why the Council rejected this proposal from the Commission, but that is exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that we should support the ILO, which, as you know, is currently trying to apply a series of mechanisms. The problem with the ILO mechanisms is that their scope is limited precisely because all three parties have to agree. I was talking to Mr Hansen and I proposed to him that, if the ILO agreed, we could hold a large conference involving the member countries, trade unions and third countries with a view to determining which exact elements would provide clear motivation to enable us to implement this policy. This proposal is currently being considered.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is fitting, as you point out in your report, that the WTO has decided to amend Article 29 and to make social standards a criterion for entry to the WTO. This is an issue that should be discussed within the European Union. It will be an extremely delicate matter as you will be aware that the Member States are very divided on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It was suggested that we make the accession of the applicant countries conditional on a specific criterion relating to the ILO conventions. We already took the main aspects of this into consideration when screening the applicant countries. In fact, it is only natural that an ILO convention that has been signed by the European Union or by its Member States forms part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> , and I do not believe that there are any particular problems for the applicant countries or those who eventually want to join in terms of accepting the European Union"s general system.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must point out that this debate is far from over. As I said, the Commission agrees with the criteria set out in the Sainjon report. I recognise that we are making only slow progress, but we are following the right philosophy. There can be no alternative.</p>
