<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stenzel (PPE-DE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, and those ladies and gentlemen who are still present, the report on the 2001 annual report on the European Agency for Reconstruction was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on 11 June 2002. The vote in plenary was, however, deliberately adjourned to the autumn, in order to give the Commission the opportunity to comply with a demand constantly reiterated by the Foreign Policy Committee by presenting a strategy for overall policy in the Balkans and the Agency for Reconstruction's role in it and clarifying how, in future, functions are to be shared out between, on the one hand, the Agency and, on the other, the delegations on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not submitted a report on this, nor has it kept to the November 2001 agreement in which it undertook to present the report on the medium-term strategy for the administration of EU aid in the context of the stabilisation and association process before the end of March 2002. The European Commission's report on strategies for assistance in the Western Balkans is a very thorough depiction of the situation, and Commissioner Patten was also available on 19 June to give us additional information. No strategy in this sense was articulated, however, something that Mr Swoboda summed up with words to the effect that, if there were no such strategy, that itself spoke volumes.</p>
<p class="contents">The demand that the Commission submit a report to the Council, not as late as June 2004, just before the European Agency for Reconstruction's mandate expires, but by June 2003 at the latest, and involve Parliament in this, is therefore all the more important. Only thus can we avoid destabilising the Agency and ensure that it can work efficiently. This becomes a matter of even more pressing concern in view of the EU's financial commitments in the Balkans. I was myself able, when visiting Pristina, to satisfy myself as to the Agency's efficiency, which, incidentally, the Court of Auditors has also confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely regrettable and gives cause for concern that the export of electricity by the local electricity company KEK resulted in substantial irregularities, with export earnings amounting to USD 4.2 million landing up in an illicit account in Gibraltar. The Agency has itself, however, introduced measures to prevent future criminal manoeuvres of this kind within KEK and help it to clear them up.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agency for Reconstruction also itself called in OLAF in relation to the contract of a questionable external advisor. What is important in this connection is that an internal auditor is to be appointed as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The provision of electricity in Kosovo still leaves much to be desired. That a new agreement between UNMIK and Serbia created the political conditions for making it easier to supply Kosovo with adequate electricity is something to be welcomed. As rapporteur, I am aware that the Agency works in Kosovo under difficult political conditions. Its political status has still not been clarified, and there are continuing ethnic tensions between the Serb minority and the Albanian majority. Making the positive influence of the European Union and of the Agency visible is thus all the more important. Any strategy for this region must have as its objective the facilitation of a sustainable policy and the progressive reduction of financial grants from the EU, principally through efficient charging for all public services.</p>
<p class="contents">The extension of the Agency's mandate to Macedonia aroused controversy, as the political situation prevailing in Macedonia at the outset, whilst extremely fragile, was quite different to that in Kosovo and, above all, because the consultation mechanism between the Commission and Parliament, by which of course funds have to be approved, was not always ideal. The report therefore proposes political guidelines for the Agency, and future work can centre around these. The decision-making mechanisms in the Commission's individual offices should also be as clear and transparent as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning specifically to the Agency's commitments in Macedonia, the situation has improved, and it has been possible to complete 900 houses. Progress has also been made in clearing mines. It is also particularly important that the Agency should enjoy a problem-free working relationship with the local delegation in Macedonia, where elections are due to be held on 15 September. The situation there is extremely tense, and it is not certain whether these elections will be held under proper conditions, if, that is, they are held at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Today in plenary, we have been debating the European Union's responsibility for Afghanistan, and have assured Commissioner Patten of our support. What is true of Afghanistan applies far more to the Balkans, for which the European Union has a direct responsibility. In this sense, the report on the Agency for Reconstruction should make a contribution to sustainable crisis management. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since the beginning of the crisis in the Balkans, we – especially the Budget Committee – have insisted that all the substantial EU funds invested in reconstruction <span class="italic">must </span>be used in such a way that our principles of good governance are respected. This means, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, that we have demanded assurances in terms of efficient administration, decentralisation, swift payments, avoidance of bottlenecks and scrutiny of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">When the European Agency for Reconstruction was created in early 2000, it was actually in response to a request from Parliament. Furthermore, we did away with the original, unwieldy committee procedure. We obtained a much simpler model that we believe has been extremely important and thanks to which, <span class="italic">inter alia, </span>decisions on practical projects can generally be taken at local level.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also say that cooperation between the Thessaloniki office and the operations offices in Pristina, Belgrade, etc., has been more effective than many of us had believed at the outset. We would perhaps still like to have a little more information from the Commission regarding how many people are left in Brussels and how many are working in Thessaloniki and in the other localities. Have we really managed to avoid duplication of effort, which was one of our aims?</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, what we can say is that an extremely high percentage of the available funds have been allocated and paid out. The Court of Auditors also commented on the high levels of efficiency, which is very good. At the same time, guidelines are, of course, needed for the future, particularly since we now realise that we have been so efficient that we might have too little money left at the end of this seven-year term of the CARDS programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Even now, the Commission has been forced to propose a radical reduction in aid to Kosovo, for example, and this present us with a big challenge. Can we delegate to the local and national authorities? How shall we proceed in the future? Strategic reflection is now needed for the future, if we are to continue to have the same levels of efficiency. That is the message from the Committee on Budgets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that we, as my group has demanded, are actually debating it this evening is almost enough to give one a bad conscience. I wish to apologise to all those for whom that is their reason for being here.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think, though, that it is right to review what we have achieved in the Balkans, especially in the area where the Agency is active, and consider what we have not yet achieved. As previous speakers have done, we must hang on to the fundamental truth that the Agency has performed well and that we can take much satisfaction in that. At the same time, though, it must be said that there are a number of aspects in which the European Union's policy has to be continued with and perhaps even stepped up.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to use the Agency to disburse funds – Mrs Stenzel thinks the amount should decrease, and she is right – we have to be aware that the economic situation continues to be very, very bleak. Money will not compensate for all of that; we must rather concentrate on building up structures that make it possible for there to be perceptible – but, admittedly slow – economic development and growth. Such structures are, unfortunately, not yet in place.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the political situation is concerned, we still also have great deficiencies to deal with; one might almost say we have to deal with the lack of a maturation process, both in relations between Serbia and Montenegro and in the conditions within them. There is still, alas, insufficient willingness in Kosovo to accept that this European Union of ours has committed itself to a multi-ethnic Kosovo inhabited mainly by the Albanian population, but in which the Serbs must also be able to live in freedom and peace and go about their normal work and economic activity. That has not even started to happen in Kosovo! In Macedonia, to which some of us are travelling in a few days to observe the elections, there are still recurrent incidents, and some killings. There, too, the process of political maturation has not yet progressed as far as it needs to.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that Commissioner Vitorino is present to hear the third point I would like to make, which is that the central Balkan region continues to be a country of transit for a lot of objectionable cross-border activities. We are of course aware that certain illegal organisations do not object to ethnic cooperation and have no problem with the overcoming of borders. Now, I do not want to run this region down, as activities such as trafficking in drugs and human beings often have EU countries as their destinations, whilst their sources are often elsewhere. I do believe, though, that it is with our own population in mind that we have to shoulder full responsibility for a Balkan policy that makes it possible to put the brakes on these dealings as quickly and effectively as possible. Some of us have ourselves visited the Bucharest centre that is actively dedicated specifically to combating these criminal activities, and I want to ask Commissioner Vitorino, as a matter of urgency, to collaborate to the utmost with Commissioner Patten in seeing to it that a stop is put to these criminal activities, which are giving the region a bad reputation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot claim to be a close observer or to have very detailed knowledge of the operations of the agency and therefore I find her report very valuable. As someone who for the last three years has been on the delegation to south-east Europe and more recently a vice-chair, I feel it is essential that we keep up and develop the financial assistance to allow the Balkan countries to aspire to the eventual goal, which must be membership of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I was one of those who was not convinced by the original decision to site the headquarters of the agency in Thessaloniki. It was the rather traditional story of doling out prizes to Member States. I may have slightly changed my view because Greece is playing a very valuable role in leading and in coordinating regional cooperation. Yet I think we need to reconsider whether this is the most effective way for an agency that has several different bases to operate.</p>
<p class="contents">The agency is doing a good and essential job. It will be important over time to rationalise and if possible to expand our assistance to the Balkans. This assistance must evolve from reconstruction to development, just as it evolved from emergency aid to reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The network of agencies that are perhaps in danger of tripping over themselves in south-east Europe is a challenge we have to resolve. It is a very complex scene – a kind of alphabet soup. It is very difficult, even for someone in my position, to understand who does what and I am not sure what the impact is on the local citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Stenzel makes several valuable points, among which is the need for agreements with other donors on 'sharing' out who is responsible for what sector to avoid overlaps. She particularly mentions that the agency should take the lead on energy in Kosovo, with which I would agree. She also emphasises the need for a strategy on the future of the agency's relations with EU delegations. I wonder from my experience in Skopje whether we have not gone too far in bypassing the competence of the local Commission delegation. I felt there was a danger of the agency taking a slightly imperialist tone towards the local delegation. In view of the upcoming elections on 15 September, I am still not sure that we have reconstructed enough houses there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should come as no surprise that there are differences of opinion regarding a European agency which manages financial aid for south-east Europe, and so the calls for promotion of adequate investigation of any suspicion of mismanagement and/or corruption, in particular those related to investments in the energy sector, are understandable. Hence the need to improve transparency in the financial transfers and practices of all areas of the organisation’s activity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no coincidence either that a call has been made for an internal auditor to be appointed and that the importance of the European Court of Auditors, of a financial auditor and, lastly, of the role of the European Anti-Fraud Office has been stressed. All this points to the fact that things are going rather as we had feared but that that was rather to be expected: we cannot work miracles in the region, it is almost impossible for good governance at all times, on all occasions, to be guaranteed, but we must, of course, make every endeavour to reduce the possibilities of illegally providing or receiving funds.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, there is no international cooperation strategy, and this is quite a serious matter. Our organisation has not contributed a strategy either, but it is difficult to establish a strategy when we do not know where our borders will lie in the short- or long-term future. All this must be borne in mind. On the other hand, however, the competence of the European Agency for Reconstruction has been extended geographically, and I wonder whether this is the right way to proceed, given that the problems presented by each individual situation differ quite widely.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission had promised Parliament that it would produce a report, although this is not yet available. This too is confirmation of the difficulties and is a further indication of the problems encountered by the reconstruction bodies in the Balkans. It was, of course, an easier matter to provide initial aid, but things become more complex when it is a question of defining reconstruction and deciding where and how to strengthen the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures on the aid managed by the agency would appear, however, to be more or less in order as regards the relationship between projects, financing, payment times and results, and this is good news. The reconstruction of the Balkans is too delicate and sensitive a matter to be neglected even temporarily, and so I feel that we should devote more attention to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Stenzel on behalf of the Commission for her report on the European Agency for Reconstruction. It is a thorough and thought-provoking report which raises important questions. My colleague, Mr Patten, discussed it with some of you at the meeting in Strasbourg on 2 July and circulated an information note in June which I hope covered many of the concerns of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Patten has promised to present a report outlining the future implementation of assistance before the end of 2003. This will form the basis of the recommendations which the Commission is required to submit by 30 June 2004 under the European Agency for Reconstruction regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I will outline some preliminary thoughts, but first allow me a few comments on some specific points in the report. I am pleased that the report so clearly acknowledges the efficiency and high delivery capacity of the European Agency for Reconstruction. The agency is indeed a success story. It is doing an extraordinary job in channelling Community assistance to the former Republic of Yugoslavia and former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In this context, I would also like to highlight the success of the deconcentration to Commission delegations. This has, for example, been a major factor in the successful implementation of the European Community assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission endorses many of the observations in the report. We strongly agree, for example, with Parliament's suggestion that we need to focus increasingly on institution and capacity building. That is certainly our approach. A large percentage of the overall assistance is allocated to institution building and it is increasing all the time.</p>
<p class="contents">The country strategy papers and the multiannual indicative programmes allow for some flexibility and do not need to be revised for these transitions. Mr Swoboda mentioned the issue of illegal immigration and the Balkan routes and we have made it very clear that we need a regional approach to fight illegal immigration and organised crime in south-east Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Swedish presidency we organised the first meeting of the five countries in the region, because without regional cooperation we will not succeed. Some Member States have developed a liaison officers' network and we have been cooperating with border guards and police forces in the region and that has definitely improved the situation although it is still far from resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">The shift I have mentioned above applies to the countries with deconcentrated delegations, as well as those where the agency is operating. There is no reason to think that the agency will handle institution-building programmes any less successfully than it has physical reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal base for the agency is perfectly adequate and does not need to be amended. Nor do we want to change its successful brand name, even if the focus is no longer principally reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The report suggests that if the territorial competence of the agency were to be extended its regulations should be modified. The decision to extend the agency's mandate to the whole of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia and to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was taken because of exceptional circumstances. We do not see a need to extend the agency's territorial competence further.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report you emphasise the need for coordination. We share this view. It is an absolute necessity to ensure that our assistance brings the highest added value possible. We are therefore pleased to note the systematic and extensive coordination already taking place between Commission services and between actors on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">From previous debates, I know that you want to discuss the broader issue of the future of assistance to the western Balkans and its organisational aspects, including the competences of the European Community delegations and the agency. Our preliminary thoughts are as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no reason to assume that the coexistence of the agency and the Commission delegation in the same country leads to an overlap. The political role and the status of all delegations in the region are identical, beyond assistance implementation. They are focused on developing the political and institutional relationship with the European Union. As each country moves further into the stabilisation and association process, we will have to evaluate whether support for the process of bringing the countries up to European standards needs to be completely integrated with the political work of the delegations. This question will be at the heart of the decision on the future of the agency. But we cannot give a clear answer at this point. Above all, we do not believe it will be to the region's benefit to dismantle recently established arrangements which are working well. Administrative and institutional tidiness must not impede our primary objective of achieving real change on the ground. However, we clearly need to keep our options open and be ready to change how we deliver aid, when there are clear benefits in doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will ensure that these decisions are taken on the basis of what is most effective in achieving the four objectives: more focus on quality, speedier implementation according to the highest standards of management, visibility, and above all the impact of our programmes on the ground. Parliament's views will be invaluable in developing the arrangements that best suit the needs of the region and the strategic ambition for its closer integration into the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
