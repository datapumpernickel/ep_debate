<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seppänen (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="italic">– (FI) </span>Mr President, the European Union has an easy way of helping other countries: the European Investment Bank receives guarantees for loans it grants to other countries. The recipients of loans benefit from the EU guarantees in the form of interest rates that are lower than market rates. This is also the case here as we are debating a loan guarantee in respect of loans granted by the EIB to Russia for environmental investments. The maximum amount of credit is envisaged as 100 million euros. The bank is imposing the criteria according to which the loans are to be granted. If Russia fails to propose projects that fulfil the bank’s criteria the loans will not have to be granted. This is a new, positive initiative that will put new life into the notion of the EU’s northern dimension, which has become rather anaemic. The loans will be used to try to improve the state of the environment throughout the Baltic region and, eventually, therefore, the Member States of the EU also.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has not called into question the matter of loans to Russia. The proposal has the broadest possible political support. Problems have nonetheless been caused by the way in which the Council and the Commission are taking the matter further. In the summer, the Commission submitted a proposal to Parliament that the loan guarantees should be issued in the same way as other EIB loans guaranteed by the EU, and that the guarantee in question should be 65%. That is still the only proposal that the Commission has submitted to Parliament. The Council, however, decided later to take exceptional action and insisted on adopting a full 100% guarantee in respect of the loan to Russia, rather than one of 65%. Russia has therefore been treated differently from other recipients of EU loan guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission endorsed the Council’s proposal, but it has not submitted a new proposal on the matter to Parliament. Consequently, we, in Parliament, are debating the Commission’s original proposal for a 65% loan guarantee. Parliament demanded a new round of consultations as a result of the revised proposal. After all manner of talks with representatives of the Council and the Commission we have received a letter from the Council that may, with a little goodwill on our part, be interpreted as a rehearing of the Parliament. The Commission also has indicated in writing that it has approved the 100% guarantee. As this is a deviation from the general rule, the Committee on Budgets would have liked to have an entirely new proposal from the Commission. The Commission said it could not submit one in time. In this case ‘in time’ means it would be most beneficial to all parties if a decision could be taken on the issue this year.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a ceiling for EU loan guarantees, which is formed by a special Guarantee Fund. Funds are gradually transferred to it from the Guarantee Reserves as guarantee commitments are made. This year the ceiling is 208 million euros. The guarantees in respect of the loans to Russia fit into this year’s envelope even though the 100% guarantee takes a larger part of it than a 65% guarantee would. A decision is needed this year, as there are so many commitments for next year that there will be no room then at all in the Guarantee Fund for new guarantees – not for loans for environmental investments in Russia either, which is the case here. It would take consensus on the part of all the EU institutions to raise the ceiling for guarantees and it is not always a simple matter to achieve that.</p>
<p class="contents">If, therefore, we want to ensure that the EIB loans will be used for Russia’s Baltic Sea basin environment, it is best to take the decision this year. The Committee on Budgets has been ready for it, even though the action of the Council and the Commission cannot be deemed to be completely appropriate. Thus, the committee is working on the principle that there should be no precedent set here and that similar matters should not be dealt with in this way in the future. Parliament insists that account also be taken of the priorities it has set.</p>
<p class="contents">As the permanent rapporteur on loans and guarantees in the Committee on Budgets, I would like once more to draw attention to the fact that next year there will be no margin whatsoever in the Guarantee Funds for new and unexpected aid actions. The Commission must take action accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel considerable unease faced with the environmental situation in that area, which is in immediate proximity to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that environmental investment in that area is required urgently and, in certain cases, even as an emergency measure. We note that the European Investment Bank has already begun negotiations concerning participation in projects for dealing with waste water from St Petersburg and Kaliningrad. It is important that the problems in these areas should be solved as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also reason for pointing out that environmental investment in this area can be more effective than many other investments within the Community and that major positive effects on health and the environment can be achieved for people in the European Union.

In certain parts of the immediate surroundings of the European Union, the environmental problems are genuinely alarming, especially when it comes to the water in the Baltic. EU countries are naturally affected just as much by these problems as large parts of Russia, Poland, Kaliningrad etc. To obtain clear water in the Baltic, it is crucial for us to cooperate across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">I, myself, live in an administrative district on the Baltic, Norrköping, where one of the greatest problems we have when it comes to water quality is that we still receive so much untreated waste from the candidate countries and from Russia. This is a very big problem for the EU Member States too. We know, for example, that untreated waste water from 3-4 million people in the St Petersburg region is still being released and that the situation around Kaliningrad is much the same. Such conditions affect us all.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to develop this region and to get to grips with the major problems, especially at a specifically environmental level, we have created the Northern Dimension, covering a very large area from Iceland in the west to Russia in the east. Restoring the balance in the Baltic is a measure to which exceptional priority should be given.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter is urgent, and that is why I am pleased that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has also expressed its wishes. For myself, coming as I do from the Committee on Budgets, it is also a question of presenting the financial aspects of this proposal. From the Committee on Budgets, we should like to sound a warning note in this House. The guarantee reserve that exists to cover possible credit losses is seriously stretched, both this year and next year. The scope for this loan to Russia is really created simply through our not successfully implementing other commitments. We have had to postpone other promised projects. Otherwise, we should not have managed to grant this loan within the framework that had been set. If we are neither to renege on our promises in the future nor to give up our new ambitions, the Council and the Commission will therefore have to review the guarantee reserve ceiling relatively soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is slightly reminiscent of the discussion we had in the budget debate earlier about the fact that the Council is happy to issue promises but then does not arrange satisfactory financing. I should therefore like to ask Mr Solbes Mira what the Commission’s plans are when it comes to tabling proposals concerning the future of the guarantee reserve. I assume the Commissioner agrees that there is a lot of pressure upon the ceiling for this reserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also know that the decision we are now discussing probably concerns the most important individual position to emerge from the meeting of the European Council in Stockholm. I would again point out that it is the north coast of the Bay of Finland that has to receive all the waste from St Petersburg, something which leads to a particularly high degree of algal bloom. I therefore wish to declare that I have a major interest in this issue and that the waste water from 3.5 million people has a very profound effect upon the environment and archipelago in my native Finland.</p>
<p class="contents">We have set a ceiling of EUR 100 million. These funds are to be used for selected projects which have clear environmental objectives and are also of considerable interest to the EU. I believe that this is one of the critical points, if account is taken of what emerged from the discussion yesterday at the meeting of the Northern Dimension in Finland. One Russian minister said that there is criticism of the selection criteria and wants international funding organisations to play a larger part in the project planning. At the same time, we know that the budget of the North West Sewage Treatment Works has significantly exceeded Finland’s and the Nordic Investment Bank’s estimates.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must give a one hundred per cent guarantee. I do not believe that EUR 100 million will solve the problem. We know that the Russian Federation does not give guarantees and that the guarantees of the city of St Petersburg are completely used up. I, therefore, appeal to my fellow MEPs to show solidarity on this issue. Give a one hundred per cent guarantee for this project. It would be in our interests, and we should be gradually paving the way for greater environmental awareness in St Petersburg, something to which we must always be attentive. The situation is significantly more complicated than Mrs Wallström imagines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, this decision was adopted in a very specific way. This is the first time that financial operations in Russia have been accepted and the operation is not only of interest to Russia but also to the bordering Union countries. The Commission had proposed the 65% guarantee normally considered for this type of operation laid down in the general mandate of the European Investment Bank. However, we know that the Council, for a series of reasons relating to the unique nature of this operation and the need for greater transparency, suggested that in this case a special Community guarantee of 100% was required.</p>
<p class="contents">The urgency of the use of resources this year has led the Commission to accept this 100%. I do not exactly know the procedural problems which have led to the information reaching Parliament excessively late, but, according to my information, the Council informed Parliament on 20 September of the amendments under consideration, on 12 October the Belgian Presidency explained the changes in greater detail and, on the same day, the Commission sent the Committee on Budgets information on the reasons why we were accepting the Council’s amendments. With the unanimous decision of the Council and with the Commission’s acceptance, there was no need for the Commission to present a new proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that it is urgent to approve this decision during 2001 for the same reasons you have raised. A delay until 2002 would clearly hinder funding given the narrow margin for manoeuvre we have for next year. However, this decision is not going to affect any other type of operation. In his report, Mr Seppänen made references to other fundings: the Turkish case is the most obvious, coming from the 2000 contributions. Actions in 2000 and 2001 have already been financed and problems of this nature do not arise.</p>
<p class="contents">However, another longer-term problem does arise: how are we going to handle the funding capacity of the European Investment Bank within our lending mechanism? Mr Färm also asked what we intended to do as a Commission. I wanted to tell you firstly that the Commission is grateful to Parliament for raising this problem of the limited capacity for indebtedness that we have within the mechanism of the Guarantee Fund. The Commission has already raised this problem in the Council and also here in Parliament on various occasions, and we believe that, if there are new initiatives in the context of 2002, current problems will become more serious and it will be essential to take certain decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently weighing up various options and we intend to approve an initiative relatively soon by means of a Communication which we will send to the Council and to Parliament. I cannot respond to Mr Färm by indicating which option we are considering at the moment but I can point out that in the past we proposed a reduction in the level of coverage from 65% to 60%. This could be one of the instruments, like any other which may be necessary, for creating a greater margin for manoeuvre in future actions. This is what I can tell you at the moment and I would like to thank you for your cooperation in the debate on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
