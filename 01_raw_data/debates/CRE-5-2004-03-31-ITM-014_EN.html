I hope that this is not the case for the future and the ultimate result.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in 1996 that the Commission first submitted a proposal for a directive designed to improve the safety of aviation in our Community, to include aircraft from third countries. At the time the procedure could not be brought to a successful conclusion because of a dispute between the United Kingdom and Spain over Gibraltar. It was not therefore until after the disaster of 11 September 2001, when a crisis broke out in aviation, that everyone appreciated the fact that now they did have to set to work to guarantee safety and to reassure citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We then worked with all possible speed and following the first reading in Parliament on 3 September 2002 the Commission submitted an amended proposal on 26 November, which included 13 of the 19 amendments adopted by Parliament. That was not bad. The Council adopted its common position on this in June and Parliament concluded its second reading on 9 October with the adoption of five amendments. For example, concerning the requirements for the annual report, the power of the Commission to impose measures imposed by a Member State, such as denial of access to the territory or operational conditions for a company, and to extend them to the whole Community, and the speeding up of the implementation procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there came another disaster which moved things up a gear. This time it was the Flash Airlines accident, in which 149 people died at Sharm el-Sheikh. We were then very quickly able to hold a trialogue, at which the issue of transparency in particular, which was now also being raised in all circles and by public opinion, was discussed. We subsequently adopted a compromise Council proposal on condition that a few further changes would be made. Initially the Council was not very keen on this, but we were nonetheless able to bring the process to a successful conclusion and we are happy with that.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be an annual report with aggregated data, which will contain all the information. At the insistence of Parliament the report will also be accessible to interested parties. It must also be simple and easy to understand and it must be made clear whether there is any question of an increased safety risk for travellers. We emphasised this sensitive point strongly. I am therefore pleased that the powers of the Commission with regard to States or companies failing to apply international safety standards have been significantly improved. According to the common position of the Council, there could however only be a question of recommendation. We have now however succeeded in substantially strengthening the powers of the Commission in this regard. We are pleased with the procedure that is being followed in this, because it is precisely this procedure that gives us the guarantee that it will be possible to work very clearly, transparently and in public.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we are not blind to the fact that the whole process is far from complete. I would remind the Commissioner of her own words in connection with charter companies. Often we do not know who is providing the air travel of travellers who have otherwise been informed of all the details of their journey. A further new initiative will be necessary here. I also think that we must take account of the comments of the people who are currently carrying out the SAFA procedure. I find them in a report on the Belgian aviation inspections according to the SAFA procedures. It is said in the report that we must not expect too much of them, because there is really too little time to carry out these inspections with any thoroughness and regularity.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the further implementation of the procedure and the directive, and also the way in which the public and the persons concerned around the airports are informed and may be able to play a part in raising the alarm, will give rise to further refinement of the procedures. I hope that the other directives to be adapted will contain the same guarantees, so that this directive offers the full guarantee that all travellers boarding an aircraft, be it from a third country or from a Member State, have the same guarantees with regard to their safety. Political will is needed for this and, I hope, not new disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Maes, the United Nations has stated very clearly that Gibraltar is a colony. It is rather shocking that in Europe, in European territory, we still have a colony, but the United Nations says it, no less. Anyway, I mean to say that we must understand the problems which are hidden behind other problems we are faced with on occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks not to the problem of September 2001, however, but rather to the United Kingdom and Spain once again putting this issue to one side and accepting a formula which does not prejudge anything, either in favour of one country or the other – it simply leaves the dispute between the two countries frozen, despite the progress made within the European Union and the other countries, including those two – we were able to unblock this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an issue which affects not just this proposal, but a whole series of other proposals relating to the air sector. When I arrived I found that there were nine or ten, then the whole of the ‘Single Sky’, but in the end, in 2000 we managed to unblock everything and we have been able to bring it forward.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, on 3 January this issue arose once again in an extremely brutal manner, following the Flash Airlines tragedy which led to numerous deaths.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, we realised that we should act more quickly. But, finally, we have done so. At that point we were in the conciliation process, we had made a lot of progress, and unquestionably what it did was facilitate the conciliation and I would like to thank the European Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee as well as the Council for the work they have done and which has allowed us, I believe, to achieve a good conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">This conciliation will provide inspectors, national authorities and the Commission with the resources needed to identify foreign transporters who do not respect international safety rules and deny them access to Community airports if necessary, as well as overflying of European airspace.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that, before being approved, this Directive is already having an effect. Specifically, a few weeks ago, one of the countries of the European Union, within the framework of the SAFA programme, which now exists within the context of the ECAC, detected serious deficiencies in a third country airline and has denied it access to its airports.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, this measure has been communicated to us, to the Agency, to the Commission, and we have also communicated it to the countries of the Union and a further four countries have followed that country in its decision to exclude this air company from its territories.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reply to Mrs Maes by saying that, before the end of this Commission’s term of office, before relinquishing my duties, I hope to have presented the modification which clarifies the companies with which charter flights are carried out and, possibly, any change which may provide guarantees and rights for customers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the honourable Members and the Council for the work they have done, and I hope that tomorrow you can support the result of this conciliation, the application of which, I will insist, is extremely urgent, not only an informal application as is the case at the moment, since it is already being applied, but in a full sense so that it may have full effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Safety is the key issue in air travel – as it is in other sectors, but it is particularly so in air travel, not only since the tragic accident at Sharm-el-Sheik. As air travel is global, more and more third-country aircraft are using EU airports. One black sheep is enough to undermine safety. The directive which we will adopt tomorrow is therefore extremely important in the transport policy context and, indeed, in the eyes of the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">We are finally establishing uniform Europe-wide procedures for safety checks on third-country aircraft, thus guaranteeing a high level of safety. In my view, the following points are important: firstly, the carrying out of uniform apron checks on aircraft about which a particular suspicion exists, as well as spot-check inspections in the case of aircraft in which defects have already been identified frequently in the past, and on all others; and secondly, the collection and dissemination of all relevant information on safety, as well as on specific incidents and the measures implemented. This transparency will result in the existence of black lists or white lists sooner or later. Naturally, I would prefer white lists, which is what the French Government once proposed, as a kind of quality seal for the safe airlines and also organisers of package travel, which would benefit all passengers and ensure greater transparency. Thirdly, measures adopted at national level, such as flight bans and so on, can be extended to all Member States in line with the relevant procedure. In my view, given the ever-increasing volume of air traffic, these efforts to achieve harmonisation come at the right time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
