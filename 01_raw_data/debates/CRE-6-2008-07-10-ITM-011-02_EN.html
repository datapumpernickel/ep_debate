<p class="contents">In June there was a mass wave of arrests in Bangladesh, taking advantage of extraordinary powers enabling arrests to be made without a warrant when a link between the person being arrested and criminal offences can be presumed. In fact, the arrests concerned leaders, members and sympathisers of the two main opposition groups, the Awami League and the Bangladesh People’s Party, who were refusing to cooperate with the government in organising general elections until their leaders were released from captivity. Today’s incipient negotiations with the Awami League are cause for hope. The massive rise in food prices is threatening the stability of the country, however. Under these conditions, the elections planned for December are no guarantee that Bangladesh is setting off down the road of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Government of Bangladesh to lift the state of emergency and respect human rights, which will help to maintain democratic standards during the course of the elections. We call for the armed forces to be withdrawn from actions linked to the organisation of the elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We supported calls for moves to ensure free and fair elections and we also supported the calls from civil society for revised and updated electoral registers to ensure that maximum participation would be possible within those elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important to say that we very much welcome the progress that has been made on that new electronic register. It is a major task which has been undertaken and indeed, if it is fulfilled in time and ensures that minority groups etc. are also included on it, this will really be an historic achievement by the Bangladeshi authorities. We know that the electoral register has also had a very positive effect already, certainly for a number of women from poorer families and backgrounds, who feel that at last they have an identity, that they can now borrow small amounts of money to set up their own businesses etc.</p>
<p class="contents">So there have been some positive moves. We also welcome recent action on war criminals and the action that the government, or at least some of it, has taken against corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">But we have major concerns about the role and activity of the continuing interim government and the state of emergency. There are some who have said that the state of emergency is a technical issue, as it were, to ensure that a government can at least continue beyond the caretaker period.</p>
<p class="contents">But whether one agrees with that or not, I think that what is happening with the state of emergency is really beginning to reflect a clear lack of checks and balances within the system there, particularly given the reports, as we have just been hearing, of mass arrests, the lack of due process, the allegations of torture, reports of extrajudicial killings, pressure on journalists and increasing violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">So there is a clear need for the interim government to rein in the security forces, to cease the mass arrests and to proceed to either charge or release those people arrested and to ensure due process. Certainly this resolution reflects the wish which I think is there in Parliament to lift the state of emergency and to ensure that civil society can proceed to full, fair, free elections with the support of the European Union, at any rate in its electoral monitoring capacity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The state of emergency, with all its anti-democratic manifestations – a state which was declared by the caretaker government set up in January 2007 amid violence in the run-up to the election – should have been lifted by now. All individuals held under emergency power rules should either be brought before a court of justice or be released.</p>

<p class="contents">The situation in Bangladesh is very problematic. The whole country has been in a state of emergency for 18 months and there are no free elections on the horizon. Bangladesh is not a democratic state, but of course the world is full of undemocratic states and violations of democracy. Of all the undemocratic states only Zimbabwe has received the condemnation of the EU and the United States. The undemocratic nature of its elections can be freely criticised in the western media because the country has no oil. Oil is a protective buffer against condemnations of violations of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Bangladesh is not an oil state either. For that reason the media could highlight the situation in the country with the silent blessing of the oil-dependent ruling powers. Bangladesh has re-introduced the death penalty and following the declaration of the state of emergency 300 000 people were arrested on flimsy grounds, 12 000 of whom have died in the last month. Several of the people arrested in recent weeks were defenders of democracy, active local members of political parties and supporters of democracy whom the state and the government regard as criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism is the word of the day in Bangladesh too, and is the guise for violations of human rights. Bangladesh is not a state based on the rule of law. Human rights violations are carried out there in the form of detentions of the most varied kinds, shortcomings in the defendant’s rights of defence, and defects in both the publication of judgments and in the grounds on which they are based. The human rights enshrined in the constitution are not respected. For those reasons we call on Parliament to support the joint resolution demanding the immediate abrogation of the state of emergency and the holding of free elections in due course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the elections must be conducted fairly, respect international conventions and give ethnic and religious minorities the opportunity to be involved, both passively and actively. Electoral observers, including from the European Union, should perform the necessary monitoring within the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, extremist attacks must be prevented. The new Counterterrorism Ordinance 2008, aimed at achieving this, must comply with international law, however. That is not yet the case. Currently, it is being used mainly to target people who are victims of political persecution. It is no wonder that Bangladesh is a place of fear, when human rights activists and citizens who express criticism are arbitrarily arrested.</p>
<p class="contents">Those arrested have a right to due process. The human rights organisation Odhikar has stated that information about mass arrests and maltreatment has been substantiated. As a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) delegation of the European Parliament, I have visited Bangladesh several times. Many Members here today were also present. In that moderate Islamic country, there are many in positions of responsibility who are favourably disposed. They are waiting desperately for input from outside, namely from the European Union – the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I congratulate you on the decision you have just taken regarding quorums in the European Parliament. Mrs Gill, I wish we could keep all our urgencies alive and did not constantly have to say that they would be handled by the relevant committee. Mr Matsakis is absolutely right. One step further in this regard would be that suddenly there were no more intergroups. That would also be fatal, because committees cannot do this work.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make the most of the opportunity of having enough time, so that we no longer see the situation we now have, where the poor President has to use the gavel – because, in the future, we shall hopefully have twice as long to speak, so that the European Parliament will be known as the voice of human rights and can become stronger – and that takes time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe the focus of our relations with Bangladesh should be to support the democratic movements in the country and the establishment of rule of law, as well as helping to build democratic institutions. Whilst the EU has an important role in assisting Bangladesh to achieve these goals, this should be translated into constructive action towards assisting the country, not into trying to micromanage their problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I really welcome the announcement of elections scheduled for the third week of December this year and I call on the caretaker government to ensure that these elections will be free and fair, and to allow the Election Commission to continue with its road map.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address the points Mr Mann raised against me because I think it is not proper to take on points from the previous debate. I would say that, if we take our urgencies really seriously, Mr Mann should make sure that those people are here. The onus is on all of us to make sure that our colleagues are here because we have minority groups influencing how the European Parliament is viewed across the world. It is important when we have these debates that we keep that in mind: it is important to have urgencies, but get all your people here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1991, however, something else began there. Democracy sprang up, and there was a 5% rise. The well-known company Goldman Sachs stated that Bangladesh was a country with a very promising future, as far as swift economic growth was concerned. Today we are looking at a massive regression, and there is a political crisis. The army has appeared in the streets. Moreover, the army would like to change the Constitution in order to introduce, as it puts it, its own form of democracy. We have heard this one before. We have had the opportunity to observe close up what this special form of democracy is all about. If this new form is to involve bringing the army into politics, my view is that it is a very bad direction to take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One effect of this has been, for example, to increase the number of death sentences, and more than 300 000 people have been arrested, a number of them having been tortured. The problem is that these repressions are showing no signs of weakening. Six weeks ago more than 12 000 people were arrested. All this is taking place against a dramatic economic background. Rice and basic foodstuff prices have risen by a third. There will probably also be a vast wave of emigration, which will reach 25 million in the next 40 years. This exodus will be caused by the floods that are highly likely as a result of rising water levels in the Bay of Bengal. This all points to one conclusion: Bangladesh is a country in which we must take an interest; we must give it support.

The world keeps hearing of more and more instances of human rights violations in that country. Since January 2007, Bangladesh has been in a state of emergency. The Anti-Terrorism Ordinance introduced on 11 June has placed additional restrictions on human rights, becoming another tool in the political battle. During the past 18 months 300 000 arrests have been made and the scope of application of the death penalty has been widened. Prisoners are subjected to torture and die in unexplained circumstances. The Bangladeshi authorities are not doing a lot to support the economy in the country, where food prices have risen by more than a third in recent months, and where a quarter of the territory is threatened by a constant risk of flooding and humanitarian disaster. An opportunity for change in the country is provided by free parliamentary elections preceded by a lifting of the state of emergency. It is essential for the caretaker government to guarantee freedom of the media in the pre-election period and the involvement of representatives of all the country’s ethnic and religious minorities in the elections. The EU should restore as soon as possible its election observation mission in Bangladesh, and prior to that the European Commission’s Office in Bangladesh must carefully monitor the political situation in the country and the status of observance of fundamental human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can I say that this is disrespectful, unfair and unfounded. These resolutions are discussed extensively at meetings where representatives of all the groups – including the PSE Group – are present, one or two days prior to coming here on the Thursday afternoon. They are approved by the representatives of these groups, if they agree to their content, and then they are debated and voted upon.</p>

The PPE-DE Group has the majority on Thursday afternoon and it is what the PPE-DE Group wants that passes because they have the majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the things we are looking at today is the situation in Bangladesh, where the elections planned for 22 January 2007 did not take place and have been postponed until December 2008. This fact has exacerbated the situation, leading on the one hand to numerous socio-political protests and on the other to a tightening of legal regulations and a tougher response from government forces. The expressions terrorism, acts detrimental to goods and individuals and serious crimes are often used as grounds for arrests and court rulings. The state of unrest is being made worse by a food crisis, causing a rise in expenditure on food by as much as 60%. The problem is not one that can be resolved by the use of force – arrests, court rulings, incarcerations. What is needed is a reconciliation between the warring factions. Such a reconciliation could be brought about by democratic elections, so a resolution calling for them to be held makes sense and should be supported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Jo, you were saying that if we did not vote this afternoon, the vote would take place next time. You would be right if it were not a vote on urgencies, because Rule 115(6) of our Rules of Procedure, according to the interpretation produced by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that you chair, states very clearly that motions for resolutions on urgencies that cannot be dealt with within the time period allocated for the debate shall lapse. The same applies to motions for resolutions for which it has been established that the quorum is not present.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, for urgencies and urgencies alone, if it is established before the votes that a quorum is not present, the vote never takes place. It cannot be deferred; this is stated in Rule 115(6). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is progress but much more progress is needed, especially in the field of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">So far we assess largely positively the steps taken by the government to prepare for these elections as regards the electoral framework and dialogue with political parties. Technical preparations have made substantial progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, since Bangladesh is under a state of emergency, we will be monitoring closely whether the progressive lifting of restrictions to the exercise of civil and political rights allows credible free and fair elections. Let me also make it clear that our engagement in the process, including the eventual redeployment of an electoral observation mission suspended in early 2007, will be linked to this commitment by the government.</p>
<p class="contents">We also share the concerns expressed in your resolution of 6 September last year as well as in your motions submitted by political groups for this debate today. Restrictions to the exercise of fundamental freedoms must be limited to what is strictly necessary to guarantee security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The caretaker government has now informed the EU and USA that it will proceed to democratic elections in December 2008, having successfully completed an electoral register which is robust against fraud. The military are now committed to withdrawing from policy-making. Ex-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has been released on humanitarian grounds. The emergency powers, which this resolution rightly wishes to see lifted, are still in place and need to go before the election. The large numbers arrested following the violence last year, which led to the state of emergency, need to be released or charged. Long-term EU observers should return as soon as possible to monitor the pre-election situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is watching Bangladesh very carefully, given the concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation over the last few years and increasing Islamist radicalisation of its society, with an exodus of Hindus, Ahmadias and Christians, and the government’s seeming abandonment of its successful model of a secular multiparty democracy. Bangladesh has the makings of a successful democracy in the Muslim world and the EU needs to strongly support this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
