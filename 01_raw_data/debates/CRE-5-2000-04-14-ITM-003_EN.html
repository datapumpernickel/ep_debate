Enlargement to include the countries of Eastern and Central Europe is the biggest challenge in the Community’s history, and if we do not tackle the issue correctly now, we are putting a lot at risk. It is extremely important that we explain to the Union’s citizens, and the citizens of the candidate countries, what the Union stands for. An information and communication strategy must, therefore, be high on our agenda. I am looking forward with great interest to hearing your answer, Commissioner Reding, because I know that information is also of great interest to you: an interest which we share, moreover, because we are both journalists by profession. I believe that we also have the same interest in the Union’s communication and information activities being organised in as close proximity to the citizens as possible and in our applying the policy so that the various groups in society get the information which they most need.</p>
<p class="contents">The keywords are coordination – partly when it comes to sharing information between the Commission and the Parliament – decentralisation, targeting and optimum exploitation of the available information technology. I am curious as to how the Commission will go about the task. I imagine that the Commission’s offices in the major European cities will be involved and that they will be assigned tasks and responsibilities and given resources to contact and inform the public at large. The experts, the authorities and those who are genuinely interested in the EU should not have problems getting information, and I must admit that I am a little sceptical when I hear about an "interinstitutional" library in Brussels or similar central functions. I would much rather that the Commission’s office in Copenhagen was a little more accessible. It is the Commission’s local offices, in cooperation with Parliament’s local offices, which must meet the man on the street, the man who always thinks that Brussels is so extremely far away. He must understand that Brussels means all of us together, as Commission President Prodi put it. It is a very difficult task because, in my opinion, the gap between the citizens and the institutions is wide, and with the major challenges which the Union is facing the task will become no less great. Enlargement, the Commission’s ambitious 5-year plan, the Commission’s plans for reform, the Intergovernmental Conference: there is a lot to provide information about, and I think that this is an urgent matter. I believe that you share many of my views, Mrs Reding.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Andreasen for his question since it gives me the opportunity to express the extent to which I share his views, as, indeed, I emphasised during my hearing before this House last September. It is true that there is a gulf between the citizen and Europe. It is true that we have all, not just the Commission, but also Parliament and the Member States, made many mistakes in our information policy in the past. We must all, not just the Commission in isolation but the Commission in collaboration with the Member States and with Parliament, proceed to examine the matter in depth and develop a new information policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, let me tell you quite explicitly that I have taken careful note of the problems which exist. I must tell you, too, that there are some things which are working well; it is not all bad. For instance, we have just started up ‘Europe direct’, a new access facility for citizens looking for information about Europe. We have our Euro-info-points and information outlets in the Member States, which, generally speaking, are very successful. Along with the honourable Member, I admit that we might be able to improve the way they operate, and I shall indeed make every effort to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member also mentioned modern technology. Obviously, the new information policy which we are going to be implementing will have to optimise the use of all the information and communication possibilities which this new technology makes available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, one of the major mistakes of the past, in our information policy, was the fact that this was often top-down information identified, wrongly, I must say, as propaganda. That must be taken into consideration. We must take the psychology of the public into consideration and we must ensure that dialogue is established. Moreover, I would draw your attention to the fact that my fellow Commissioner, Michel Barnier, and myself, have initiated dialogue on the Intergovernmental Conference which is to follow this new approach, i.e. making contact with the public, with young people and opinion formers, and discussing matters with them, and also approaching locally, regionally and nationally elected representatives on behalf of the Commission, not to make fine speeches, but to discuss things with them and to gain some idea of their general expectations. I am, of course, counting a great deal on Parliament to play its part in this citizen information campaign. Parliament is the body which is closest to the citizens, and if all the Members of the European Parliament fulfil their task of informing citizens – and I shall assist them as much as I possibly can to do so – this will enable us to change mindsets.</p>
<p class="contents">We have once again started to work within an interinstitutional working party on ‘information’, in which Parliament is represented, and as part of this work, which is a tripartite effort involving the national states, the European Parliament and the Commission, I plan to present a communication to you in the near future outlining a new approach which I shall first present to the Commission, some time before the summer, and which I shall then discuss with you. I cannot give you any details at this early stage of the actual proposal, as it is still being drawn up, but I can assure you that the main pillars of this new approach will be decentralisation, subsidiarity, closeness to the citizens, the coresponsibility of the European institutions and the national administrations and also the increased participation of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think we must all clarify our respective roles. Obviously, the Parliament’s role is different to that of the Commission. I am deeply convinced that Parliament’s special role must continue. Any collaboration in the field of information must allow for the specific character of each institution. It is possible to cooperate without the parties involved losing their own identities, but we should nonetheless all work in the same direction and we must know that the closer we are to the citizens, the greater our chances of being comprehensible, credible and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to do so, we must seriously examine the way we are organised, the instruments and procedures we select, what is being done at the various levels, at institutional, national and regional level, and how tasks are divided between the three institutions. We must also, openly and objectively, look at our own way of working and examine how we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr President, is what I wanted to say for the time being. Obviously, the discussion is only just being initiated and will not be completed today, because in the very near future we shall be presenting a communication on our new information policy which we are going to discuss in detail with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have a very committed commissioner in Commissioner Reding. She has a really tough task on her hands but I am sure that she will get the full support that she recognises that she needs from the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I find myself totally supportive of this motion in addressing the information deficit of the EU. The information deficit is actually more serious than the democratic deficit that we often talk about. In a sense, the information deficit and the democratic deficit are part of the same problem.</p>
<p class="contents">In the recent past, we have had the Oostlander report in 1993 and the famous Pex report in 1998. They have analysed the problem, suggested improvements, but sadly little has been achieved. I wish Commissioner Reding well in getting on with this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">This week I had a visitors' group from the Winchester Probus Club, mainly retired people and, in general terms, well informed about world affairs. However, you could write what they knew about the aims of the EU on the back of a one euro note. Before anyone tells me that euro notes do not exist, it would not make any difference: they could not write anything.</p>
<p class="contents">When I speak to British groups, I often start with the question: do you want to be in the European Union? The immediate response I got this week was: "No". Five or six years ago, the response would have been: "Yes, but we do not want too much interference". This situation is getting worse. I know that it is a particular problem for the United Kingdom, but it is not exclusive to the United Kingdom. It is getting worse right across Europe. We only have to look at the turn-out in the European Parliamentary elections to see that.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is this so? Why this lack of enthusiasm for the EU? To begin with, we must remember that the best advertising in the world will not sell a poor product. Even if you have a first-class product, if you do not market it properly it will not sell. We must make sure that the product is good first and then make sure that we advertise it effectively. I fear we are doing neither.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that, when history is written, the greatest achievement of the 20th century will be seen to be the creation of the EU. It has delivered peace and prosperity for half the continent for half the century. Now the other half of the continent is queuing up to get in, yet my constituents want to get out.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not an expert in marketing; I know there are no simple solutions; I certainly know more propaganda leaflets are not the answer. Let me just suggest a few possibilities. What happened to President Prodi's idea of a rapid rebuttal unit? If it is in existence, it does not appear to be very effective. If they are giving answers, can I suggest that they e-mail their answers to the MEPs as well, so we can use the information, not just to the press, who often just spike it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner said quite rightly that new technology is good. We must make more and better use of it. We must make sure that our website address is known. we could maybe spend some of the Socrates money giving every student in Europe a computer mouse mat so that they can see the website address of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With the plethora of new TV channels, with digital TV, have we got anywhere with a Parliamentary TV channel? I can watch the US Senate on television gavel-to-gavel. But not the European Parliament. We must emphasise the good-news stories of when we help the citizen. We have a Committee on Petitions that addresses a thousand petitions a year. When did the information departments of the Commission or Parliament last attend a meeting of that committee? When did they past publish any of the good news that comes from that committee?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have to address the problem of Parliament in Strasbourg. I am not anti-Strasbourg. I am certainly not anti-France. I understand that Strasbourg was the symbol of peace and unity of our continent, but that was a symbol of the 20th century. In the 21st century, I am afraid it is a symbol of waste and inefficiency. I ask Parliament, Commission and the Council of Ministers to address that problem.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have known you for many years and we know of your commitment and dedication, not only to what we could call the European cause, but also to ensuring that the European cause really reaches the citizens. In your political activities you have always paid special attention to the most sensitive groups: young people, elderly people, the workplace, and you paid special attention to the media.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the general lines which you have put forward here and which will be specified in the document which you will present and which the European Commission must approve next June.</p>
<p class="contents">You have mentioned two aspects which I would like to stress: the regional dimension and efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the information policy is to reach the citizens. In order to do that properly it is necessary to take account of the regional dimension, because it is one of the fields which is a subject of great sensitivity in terms of society and its problems. Therefore, so that the citizens may understand and participate in European construction and not see it as a superstructure reserved for politicians and technocrats, it is essential that the work of providing information is done at the level of the regional institutions and in conjunction with them.</p>
<p class="contents">This goes hand in hand with efficiency. In your review of information policy, I would ask you to bear in mind the experience of certain Member States. For example, during the euro campaign, there was an agreement at the time between the European Commission and the government of a Member State. That government’s decision was to commission an information campaign on the euro from a very important advertising agency. That advertising agency made some very nice advertisements and hundreds of thousands of leaflets were distributed. However, that it is not the way to reach the public, nor is it efficient. It is perhaps very pleasing to the government, which gets to make fine speeches, and to the relevant Minister, who gets to appear on the television and in the newspapers, but that does not reach the public. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the maximum possible degree of decentralisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has long had an office there. The Commissioner has mentioned the importance of national regions, as well as the states, in its communication policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to say that this week it has been announced that <span class="italic">The Scotsman </span>newspaper is closing down the office of its Brussels and European correspondent. It is rumoured that BBC Scotland is about to remove its special correspondent from Brussels. That would be a disaster. It is not just the Commission and Parliament which need to think about their role. Our own media also need to look seriously at the problem of adequately reporting to their citizens the issues of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">May I mention one other sad case, which is of importance in the area of information and communication. I want to draw attention, yet again, to the case of the Italian language lecturers. New developments in the case have shown that the quality of openness in information and communication by the Commission on this sort of issue leaves much to be desired. In these proceedings it is vital that the interested parties are fully informed by the Commission, but the practice fails to honour that ideal. There has been some evidence this week that the former Commission has actively misled parties in cases of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">During the current Parliament, I have had a number of assurances that the Commission is serious about upholding rights derived from Community law on behalf of lecturers in all issues involving non-discrimination. That really must be taken seriously. It is a point about openness, about being ready to communicate what is going on and about informing people how seriously we take rights arising from Community law and how seriously we take the need to demonstrate to our citizens and our public the importance of what is accomplished here.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that the Commission and Parliament have helped to make information available in Scotland and I wish our own media would do likewise.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Prodi’s Commission has started off badly with regard to information. I have heard that last autumn it issued an instruction to the national Commission offices to focus on the reporting of political information in place of the former citizens’ information service. This means information and propaganda from above. Actually, this means the spread of propaganda, not information.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has started off badly in the most important area of information reporting, that of public accessibility. The Commission has issued a draft for a directive on public accessibility, which, by any common yardstick, is an untenable document, more conducive to secrecy than increased public accessibility. This is the Commission’s line on information policy insofar as it concerns public accessibility. Public accessibility is just as important as information. It offers our citizens and the media the opportunity to have hands-on access to documents themselves and draw their own conclusions, instead of being dependent on those of the Commission. There is a very obvious discrepancy between the official documents themselves and the conclusions being drawn. The documents state that the European Union’s crisis management troops are not a European Army, but the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, says that whatever you call it, it is one. In an information context such as this, it is important to have access to the documents and draw one’s own conclusions, as the documents do not always spell things out clearly either.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the way Parliament disseminates information must be criticised. Parliament has its own information offices, but the Finnish office apparently has no money to buy copies of the EU Treaty, which would allow Members to familiarise themselves with its contents in their office at Parliament. It has one Internet connection. To this extent, we could conclude that the officials working in Parliament’s own information office do not know what is going on in Parliament, although Parliament has excellent Internet connections. To all intents and purposes, it is a war of propaganda that is going on here. In many respects, it is also a civil war.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We thank you for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to point out that we too must ask ourselves whether this morning’s initiative to prevent voting was a positive information and communication strategy for Parliament outwardly as well as inwardly? I do not think that it was! The homework which we have to do we must do ourselves and we must not confuse information and communication within the framework of our work with self-promotion. It is a matter of Community promotion and not self-promotion. In this regard we should all resolve to understand that one of the causes of the problems of the political parties and of the institutions is a problem of communication and information.</p>
<p class="contents">We, and I say that very clearly, the institutions of the European Union, the European Parliament and the delegates cannot bear sole responsibility for providing information on Europe. Without the support of the Member States, without the support of the public representatives at borough, county and national level, without the support of all the institutions, we will not get directly to the citizen, because either we are here doing our work or we are involved in communication and information processes with our citizens. We cannot do both at the same time within the meaning of Maastricht and Amsterdam!</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am waiting for your master plan, your schedule, your specific measures for implementation. The public mandataries, all persons and institutions who receive money from the EU, should be involved in this implementation. We must increasingly involve the visitor groups and also two areas of activity which, in my opinion, are in your sphere of responsibility, i.e. schools and youth, and the staff in the offices of the Community institutions must be equipped accordingly. Please submit to us a specific plan of action and a schedule. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Like Mr MacCormick, Mr Gasòliba i Böhm touched on a major issue related to the fact that centralising the provision of information is not viable. If information were to be issued solely from Strasbourg or solely from Brussels, it would not reach the public. I am absolutely sure that, if we want to bring Europe closer to the citizens and the citizens closer to Europe, there must be a regional dimension to the information policy at all levels, including information relating to the euro. In practice, the euro cannot be introduced by means of a television programme. We must not forget the importance of television but, in addition and above all, we have to keep the people at grassroots informed – to approach the people and talk to them. And there are a great many information outlets available to us in our regions, towns and villages which can play a very significant role in this. It would be a mistake for a policy to be managed solely by an advertising agency and not implemented at grass roots level in consultation with the citizens directly concerned. I am in total agreement with Mr Gasòliba i Böhm when he says that we must integrate this regional dimension into our information policy and, when I discuss the issue with the competent national politicians, I will ensure that this is taken into account.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is what we are doing.
