<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fayot </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Europe is working towards the creation of a single market in financial services. It is a process that was given political impetus by the Heads of State and Government at the Cardiff and Vienna summits and which should lead, at the Cologne summit, to a report detailing the measures needed to implement a single financial market.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Commissioner Monti will continue to participate in this process for the remainder of the Commission"s term of office as he has the authority and know‐how to see it through. He has headed a high‐level group of representatives of the finance ministers which assisted the Commission"s deliberations on the matter and which has just completed its work. We hope that this method will bear fruit at Member State level.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to Parliament"s report, together with the consultations the Commission held with experts, Mr Monti is in a position to put forward a series of measures at the Cologne summit. In spite of the restrictions the resigning Commission has imposed in terms of new legislative initiatives, I feel that the work undertaken in this area over quite some time now should be brought to a conclusion at this European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The present Commission communication is entitled ‘Building a framework for action" and it is extremely useful for examining all the issues relating to financial services. I should like to begin by saying a few words on the theoretical background to the communication. The document states that a financial market, a genuinely single financial market, would automatically mean better optimisation of resources leading to lower cost capital for industry. Such increased efficiency would appear to lead to stronger growth and therefore to the creation of jobs. However, I remain somewhat sceptical about all of this. Mergers and economies of scale in this sector, the trend for the creation of mega banks and conglomerates, technological developments that lead to improved productivity, and the consequent pressures on employment or on the actors working at a regional level all have their own particular logic which is not necessarily akin to the general interest or the employment objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication outlines the measures that are needed in the area of the single market and financial services. If we really want to make progress, we must establish political priorities, though it is clearly not easy to make clear choices. So, for example, I believe that we need to rebalance the current strategy that places the emphasis on the supply side, through a strategy that has a more demand‐driven approach. In fact, consumer organisations have shown, for instance, that existing European legislation in this field concentrates on the supply side, whereas demand, which benefits consumers and small businesses, plays a minor role.</p>
<p class="contents">It is striking to note in this connection that, contrary to all expectations, the advent of the euro has not improved the supply of transnational financial services, but has instead made it more expensive. Whereas trade and cross‐border consumption are on the increase, the general feeling is that this increase has not been mirrored in the area of financial services. Nor have these services adapted to the new context. They either remain entrenched behind their national and sectoral logic, or appear to consider the sector of little interest. What is more, this logic may simply be the logic of easy profit, rather than one that takes account of the nature of the services in the general interest that the bank should provide for a range of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The retail market undoubtedly merits special attention. Instead of enabling consumers to benefit from competition, the present situation is marked by huge price differences in credit cards, mortgages and other services and the communication contains detailed information on this. However, the wholesale market needs as much impetus and supervision from the Community as the retail market. Pension funds and risk capital markets are good examples of this. In its report, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs highlights the importance of liquid and efficient European venture capital markets for start‐ups and innovative companies in the high‐technology industries. Nonetheless, at the moment, almost all the Member States are trying to develop their own venture capital markets, yet none of them have achieved the necessary critical mass to allow such markets to really take off.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also stress the need to create a single market in pension funds. Whatever the attitude towards this type of social security, it is true that the aging of the population creates considerable demand that financial services will have to meet. And this sector will only be able to evolve within a large internal market. To achieve this, the funds collected must be invested in diversified and internationalised portfolios, the principle of freedom of choice must be respected and we must also prevent all types of discrimination on a national level, be it of a fiscal or procedural nature.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally speaking, the Commission is proposing eight points for action concerning the wholesale markets. These initiatives will form a major legislative body of new legislation and revisions of existing outdated legislation or ineffective regulatory apparatus. It would be interesting to learn what the high‐level group thought on this issue. Are we, for example, to replace the 11 banking directives, the eight directives on investment services, the 21 directives on insurance as well as the interpretive texts, and if so, what are we to replace them with? Are we heading towards the creation of a single body of legislation for financial services, or are we going to continue, as we have done in the past, to pile essential texts on top of one another, according to developments in the market and in financial services?</p>
<p class="contents">One of the very sensitive issues in this sector relates to supervision and prudential supervision, which is still currently based on the frontiers of a country and the home‐rule. The debate on supervision in home countries as opposed to supervision in host countries has, until now, prevented any major shift towards either European supervisory systems or a European body for supervision. However, the increasing pace of electronic banking, distance selling and electronic commerce will render the differences between home and host rules obsolete. At present, the speed with which capital movements take place defies the ability of national authorities to supervise them. We must therefore think in terms of new form of international cooperation and therefore consider, for example, defining a European Union rule and making it the basis of the new rules and new prudential supervision within the Union. I am well aware, Mr President, that, given the present situation, this presents some prospects for the medium, and even the long, term.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is very concerned about the high levels of consumer protection that exist in relation to the retail market. This is why we are proposing to study the appointment of a European Union ombudsman for financial services provided in the retail markets, independent of any Community or national institution and of any particular interests. There are many arguments in favour of the creation of such an institution. No genuine cross‐border appeal and redress procedure currently exists. Pan‐European products are going to be developed. National appeal and redress procedures are very varied and are often difficult to understand. I should just like to add that there is a need for legislation on financial middlemen in the area of consumer and housing credit and insurance in order to protect consumers in cross‐border markets. I regret that the committee did not support me on this point which is, in my view, a very precise and important requirement of European consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, our political task is clear. The Commission must present an action plan on financial services to the ECOFIN Council, which must then submit this plan to the approval of the Cologne European Council. I might add that, once their blessing has been given at the highest level, the Commission and the Council will have to act promptly. I can assure you that Parliament will not delay the decisions needed to set up this single market in financial services, which, to a greater or lesser degree, we all hope will become a reality.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Herman </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights. – (FR)</span> Mr President, we broadly agree with what the rapporteur has just said.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we believe that a Commission, even a resigning Commission, must continue the work it has undertaken since such work forms an integral part of the management of daily business. This might seem quite daring in relation to some of the definitions in national public law, but bearing in mind both the urgency and the pressure applied by the Council to complete the work within the deadlines – we have timetables to adhere to – we must see it through to completion. We are therefore particularly pleased with the request put forward in this respect since we have here in the House a Commissioner who has shown himself to be an expert in these matters and who has demonstrated his ability to listen to Parliament"s requests. Moreover, he is someone who holds considerable sway with the governments and with the ECOFIN Council in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the conditions are right for this work to continue, and if I might add a personal wish, I hope that Mr Prodi will include Mr Monti in his new team; both the Commission and Parliament would benefit from this.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at several retail problems. I do not exactly share Mr Fayot"s doubts as regards the significance of the single market, though it is true that it is not providing us with much proof of its purpose at present. This is simply because there is still great diversity in terms of the various national legislation and very little harmonisation. For example, we have 38 different securities markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the key element in all of this is prudential supervision. Much can be said and done in this respect at European level because securitisation has completely changed the nature of prudential supervision. Before, there were only banks, where it was easy to find the appropriate recommendation, sanction, etcetera. But it is a different story when it comes to securities that can travel across the world, because this creates systematic risks that our current organisation does not allow us to compensate for. This is all the more reason, therefore, for creating a form of European prudential supervision that is more effective than our own systems.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Katiforis </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, I in turn would once again like to thank the Commissioner for carrying on with the work he had already embarked upon in this extremely important area of the drafting and renewal of financial services legislation. I am especially pleased that, despite the shock waves that have reverberated through the Commission recently – even though the Commissioner himself is above suspicion in this affair – he has not stopped promoting this extremely useful work in the area of financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to agree for once with what Mr Hermann said on the subject of the usefulness of the major stock exchanges. One of the things we are expecting from the single currency is the unification of the securities market in Europe. This will put it on a par with the American money market. In this way we will be able to draw from it the necessary investment to increase the activity of the European economy and to create jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are some very real dangers associated with the major stock exchanges, some of which have quite rightly been pointed out by our rapporteur, whom I would like to commend on his work. We should add to these the danger of systemic shock, which is caused by excessive ‘leveraging" and may even lead to the collapse of the stock exchanges.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to end by announcing in this part‐session that last week a historic event took place in this area. The Canadian Parliament, the first in the world to do so, took the decision to introduce a tax on speculative capital, the famous Tobin tax. I think that this is something we must begin to address in the fullness of time.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, I must begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Fayot, for the extraordinary work he has done in this complex report. I am also grateful to Mr Fayot, Mr Herman and Mr Katiforis for their kind words: needless to say, I am greatly touched by them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the fact that the report expresses general support for the framework for action. It sets out what we believe needs to be done. The Fayot report largely mirrors our own views and I am grateful for the support that has been expressed, particularly in relation to the urgent need to fill a number of existing gaps in the law, for example in relation to integrated pension schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in complete agreement with the rapporteur that, despite the substantial progress which has been made towards the completion of the single market in financial services, cross‐border sales of financial products on a retail basis to individual consumers remain the exception rather than the rule within the European Union, and there are still large variations in price between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I take a slightly different line from Mr Fayot, in terms of explaining the situation at least, in that I believe that we have to look here both at the economy of supply and the economy of demand, which are closely linked. In any event, I believe that the concerns he voices have to be fully shared.</p>
<p class="contents">Union policy ought to be based on a pragmatic approach tailored to three key sectors: firstly, it is essential that those who purchase financial services are provided with clear and comprehensible information; and secondly, the appeal procedures are vital to consumer confidence. In that context, the rapporteur suggests that we consider the arguments in favour of setting up an EU ombudsman for financial services; I would suggest that we go further along that path and consider more widely the forms of redress which are currently available to users of financial services throughout the Union. Thirdly, harmonisation and mutual recognition are intrinsically linked. If all the Member States have the same basic level of protection, it will become easier to accept and grant mutual recognition for protection accorded in other states.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur suggests setting up a system of integrated retail payments. There is already in operation a fully effective and integrated infrastructure for wholesale and inter‐bank transactions, but developments in the infrastructures for small‐scale cross‐border payments have not kept pace with this.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that it is absolutely necessary to reinforce the efforts being made by the financial institutions and the national administrations to overcome these obstacles. But it is not possible to create by statute a single retail financial area in which basic banking transactions are economic and effective, as in the national systems; however, the framework for action illustrates how progress can be achieved in that process.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the prudential rules are concerned, and the rapporteur suggests that the Commission should submit a report on the effectiveness of those currently in force, I believe that the recent upheaval and the way in which the European Union has, on the whole, coped with it, demonstrate that the prudential rules are basically effective. I therefore prefer to focus on how to integrate and improve them, rather than on what I might describe as a backward‐looking report.</p>
<p class="contents">The pace of change in the markets and the financial intermediaries has revealed the possible limits of a sectoral approach, and that tendency becomes more marked with the process of global financial integration. I agree with the rapporteur that, as far as the regulatory and supervisory authorities are concerned, these developments represent new challenges that can be met through effective cooperation and coordination between the regulatory and supervisory authorities, with a clear division of supervisory responsibilities and sound financial regulations to manage the global institutional and system risk. I would stress that, as far as the possibility of better supervision of financial services at European Union level is concerned, our attention ought to focus on the large financial groupings.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, how can the Commission, Parliament and the Council take forward this process? The framework for action is addressed to the European Parliament, which will have a key role in the process of modernising the financial services sector, on the basis of the results obtained by the group in which the representatives of the finance ministries are taking part and Parliament's own report. We are now working towards the ECOFIN Council of 25 May, and I have to say that your words have given us great and valuable encouragement to press on with this work.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish finally to say that as regards the amendments tabled at the end by Mr Fayot, I am in agreement, with three exceptions, namely Amendments Nos 2, 5 and 7. I have already explained to the rapporteur why I have some doubts about them. I will also add a word of explanation about Amendment No 11.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end by making the point that, as regards the large number of directives in the sector – and Mr Fayot is right about that – the bulk of the existing directives are in fact directives amending earlier directives, so that rather than there being 22 banking directives in force, there are actually only six. But we are working to codify those six directives into a single directive and, to give you an idea, to reduce the mass of banking legislation in the European Union from 360 to 80 pages. We are trying to do the same in relation to insurance and securities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must agree with the point made by Mr Herman, to whom I once again extend my thanks, about ensuring security, a view which I share. We shall be tabling proposals that reflect the broader aspect of the capital markets, and following closely the work under way in Basle.</p>
