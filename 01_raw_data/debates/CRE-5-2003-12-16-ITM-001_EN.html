<p class="contents">- The European Council report and Commission statement European Council (Brussels, 12 and 13 December 2003);</p>
<p class="contents">- Council and Commission statements <span class="bold"></span> Meeting of Heads of State or Government on the IGC (Brussels, 12 and 13 December 2003);</p>
<p class="contents">- Statement by the President-in-Office of the Council The work of the Italian presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like at the outset to profit from this moment to share with you a brief report of the summit meeting and the IGC from the perspective of those questions which I raised on behalf of this House so that before we go into our debate proper you will have been informed of what we had to say.</p>
<p class="contents">I am bound to say that, as regards the work that was done at the European Council meeting, a very high volume of business was transacted in a short period of time and considerable progress made in quite a number of areas. Indeed it is worth placing on the record that we in this House enjoyed in those terms a very positive engagement with the Italian presidency in working across our committees on many different areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular and following the recent resolutions of the House I welcomed the conclusions on EU-transatlantic relations, but I made the point that it is precisely in a phase of deepening transatlantic relations, which is the objective of the conclusions, that our candid friendship with the United States should not exclude our candid concerns about Guantanamo Bay. I spoke on behalf of the House in those terms.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Kyoto Protocol, I recalled that as we were meeting there was a UN-sponsored meeting in Milan. It seems that Russia still has an open mind on whether to sign the Kyoto Protocol. We Europeans have a strong interest that the Russians should do so and therefore make it effective. I believe the Commission and the incoming presidency should take clear initiatives to ensure that in the months to come we who believe in Kyoto should seek to bring it to a satisfactory definition by deepening our contact with Russia, and I made that point also this weekend.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Intergovernmental Conference we will have a debate today on the wider questions and I look forward to being guided by that debate and our resolution. When I spoke at the Intergovernmental Conference, I raised two specific concerns of a parliamentary nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concern was on the financing of the European Union and its budget procedure. I pointed out in the clearest terms that the European Parliament supports the balanced outcome of the Convention as regards the different institutions and their roles in budget-making. I explained what that Convention procedure was and what its balances amounted to.</p>
<p class="contents">I explained that the European Parliament wholly rejects the interference by Ecofin as an undue, unwarranted and unacceptable interference in the budget process.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I explained that not only was Ecofin an attack on the conclusions of the Convention, but even on the budgetary treaty of 1975, and that in institutional terms it in fact represented a step backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">I pointed out that through that period Parliament has exercised considerable restraint on spending. The House will be interested to know, because it is the product of our collective work, that we have 15 years of budget-making experience since we signed an interinstitutional agreement with the Council on financial perspectives in 1988. In that period, by discretionary additions in the aggregate, the Council added EUR 33 billion of discretionary expenditure. Parliament, under its discretion, added EUR 21 million. If there is a relative tendency to stretch the budget, it is found more in the Council than Parliament, and Parliament should not be the object of the presumption that if it gets responsibility it fails to act responsibly.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The final point I made for Parliament regarding the Intergovernmental Conference and Parliament was to invite the IGC to ensure that Parliament should not be used as some kind of last-minute bargaining chip, where the numbers of Members in this House would increase regardless of our ability to be effective. We are not some kind of globalised rubber-stamp congress of the peoples of Europe; we have serious budgetary and legislative functions. There must be an upper limit on our size, and we must respect the principles enshrined in the work of the Convention to cope with who gets how many seats. These were the points I made on behalf of this House to the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the outcome of last weekend, there is no doubt that the failure to agree in the IGC represents a setback. However, that setback is not necessarily a calamity. If agreement was not possible last weekend, it does not make agreement less necessary. It shows the immensity of the challenge we have undertaken together. Last weekend, although the key players arrived, a collective spirit and a will to settle were absent. That absence is something for which we paid a price, and that absence of a spirit of compromise on the part of all key players needs to be explored.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the leaders of the Groups, I would like to carry from this House a clear set of messages from today's debate to the incoming Irish presidency. I look forward to this debate and to what messages you, as the European Parliament, believe we should give to the incoming presidency regarding the next phase of play.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to welcome this morning the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Berlusconi, and to say to him and his colleagues, Mr Frattini, Mr Antonione and Mr Buttiglione, how welcome they are. I should like to say again in Mr Berlusconi's presence that in the course of the ordinary work of the presidency, work with our committees, legislative work and contact with Parliament, we have enjoyed very good, positive relations with the Italian presidency.</p>

<p class="contents">With regard to the Conference, Italy has been committed from the very beginning to achieving consensus on a high-profile document, without any watered-down compromises; a document that would allow the Union of the future to function and to stand as a leader on the world stage. Added to this commitment was the hope that the enlarged Union would be able to establish a genuine Constitution on the basis of the draft drawn up by the Convention, within the timeframes agreed at Thessaloniki and thus in time for the European Parliament elections next June. As we know, the hope we all shared that the constitutional negotiations would be concluded within the 60 days we had available from the opening of the Conference in Rome has not been fulfilled. This fact must be accepted calmly, without drama or exchanges of recriminations but, at the same time, with a clear vision of how we are to proceed now. Our commitment to keep clear of compromises and agreements, which are difficult for our citizens to understand, has been fully respected. This was an obligation on which our Presidency focused from the very beginning of this complex negotiation process, for we felt that the contributions of the national parliaments and the Union’s institutions, first and foremost – as you said, Mr President - your own, and the work of the Chairman, Mr Giscard d’Estaing, and the Vice-Chairmen, Mr Amato and Mr Dehaene, combine them into a document, which should form the basis on which to build a unanimous agreement, without further delays on the key points of the draft approved last July.</p>
<p class="contents">At the formal opening of the Intergovernmental Conference, the Presidency’s intention was to reaffirm these concepts by means of the Declaration of Rome adopted by the Heads of State or Government of Member States, of acceding countries and candidates to the European Union, President Cox and President Prodi. We have remained faithful to this approach throughout the negotiations, reconciling the desire to preserve the Convention’s draft to the greatest extent possible with the obligation to give due consideration to the legitimate needs of all the Member States with regard to their priority issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Our working method has been visible and transparent. We have fully involved the European Parliament representatives in the work of the IGC, going beyond what was done in previous Intergovernmental Conferences, and we have ensured that all the documents presented during the negotiations were made fully public and available for consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to this impressive, patient, meticulous work – for which I would like publicly to thank all those involved, in particular the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Frattini, who is sitting here on my right we have been able to resolve almost all the questions raised by the IGC participants without much diminishing the overall level of ambition of the Convention’s draft.</p>
<p class="contents">During the initial exchanges of the Conference, we reviewed over 80 controversial issues on which the different States were in disagreement, and for each one of them, with the exception of a purely institutional point, adequately mediated solutions were found. I would add that, on some aspects in particular that absolutely crucial aspect of defence the IGC has supplemented and improved on the Convention’s draft, succeeding in defining permanent structured cooperation that is fully compatible with the Atlantic framework and respectful of the political needs of certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This fundamental step forward will be made in accordance with the decision-making procedures of the Union using an inclusive approach that will allow some countries to proceed more rapidly on the basis of a specific protocol governing the military capabilities required for participation in this permanent structured cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, to start with, this point seemed very problematic. We succeeded in reaching agreement, fully in harmony with Nato summits, and, as you know, the three pillars on which the Spring Council can take action and decisions have been taken on board by all. The first pillar – the regulation establishing structured cooperation and making it operational – will have to be approved by the European Council; the second pillar will make it possible for each Member State to become part of cooperation at any time; the third pillar stipulates that European defence – necessary to give Europe independent power and dignity, enabling it to sit down at all tables with the other world military powers – must not be seen as in opposition to Nato but must, on the contrary, work hand in hand with Nato, the means having been found to establish a European military planning and command cell in the Nato operational base in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The final IGC session has thus had to concentrate its efforts on the major institutional issues which, because of their particularly high political sensitivity, it had not been possible to resolve in the previous phases of the negotiations. Thus, the final meeting had to decide on the composition of the European Parliament and the Commission, there were still some points to be clarified regarding the extension of qualified majority voting in the Council, and, most importantly, the method of calculating that vote remained to be defined.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the most recent bilateral meetings that the Presidency conducted at a spanking pace through the days and nights of Thursday, Friday and Saturday, a solution to some of these issues appeared possible, although all the Heads of State or Government assembled felt the need to point out that the institutional framework of the future Union should ultimately be evaluated in its entirety by means of a general, all-encompassing agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreement on the composition of the Commission and on the matter of the qualified majority was within arm’s reach. As regards the number of Members of Parliament, Mr President, there was practically no debate: the countries with smaller populations asked for one more Member, taking the number from four to five, and all the other countries assented.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it was not possible to bring positions sufficiently close on the point qualified majority voting despite all our efforts, and, therefore, after consulting all the delegations, we decided to put an end to a debate that was in danger of causing conflict and that, at best, might have resulted in a watered-down compromise of the kind we had excluded from the very beginning. True failure would have been precisely a watered-down agreement incapable of ensuring the proper functioning of the Union in the future and its ability to act as a decisive political entity on the world stage.</p>
<p class="contents">As the meetings concluded, all my colleagues expressed great appreciation of the work of the Italian Presidency which, of course, gave my team and myself great pleasure but, most importantly, I can tell you that I perceived the firm desire not to waste the heritage that we have built up in the negotiations of these past months. Indeed, we counted 82 points on which agreement has been reached – 82 points which, before that, were under discussion and many of which even seemed impossible to resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, an <span class="italic">acquis</span> of negotiations remains from the Conference which all felt to be important and, I would add, not to be reopened. For this reason, all the speeches made at the Council table recommended that the Conference’s next task should be to focus on the points, or rather the point, on which agreement has not yet been reached. We should not reopen the chapters of the major work carried out on the other points, in which all the delegations of the Member States were involved.</p>
<p class="contents">It will therefore be possible to resume the constituent process completing the great project launched by the Convention, on the basis of the Conference’s precious <span class="italic">acquis</span> of negotiations, which covers almost all the previously controversial points. I have to tell you that we were genuinely close to concluding the agreement. Late on Friday night, agreement seemed possible, for some of the countries who had initially appeared to have taken up certain specific defensive positions became much more open, but then, the following morning, a step backwards was taken and, by mutual agreement with all the delegation heads, we decided that everyone needed more time. Some even asked to be able to consult their national parliaments. Thus, rather than starting a debate which would have given the failure to achieve an agreement a higher profile, we decided to close while everyone was feeling positive. All expressed the willingness to resume the debate, to preserve the <span class="italic">acquis</span> on which all had agreed and to proceed with the goal of giving Europe a Constitution which would make it able to function properly, to take timely decisions and to act on the world stage as a political giant, not just an economic giant.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to illustrate the most important results of the European Council that has concluded the Italian Presidency’s six-month term of office. I do so with particular satisfaction, not only because we addressed important matters, but also because the decisions we have adopted are the result of intense work carried out with all the countries sharing responsibility. The tangible results affect the direct interests of the European citizens and reinforce the Union’s overall image. These results have been made possible by an excellent relationship of cooperation with the Commission - which I would like to thank - and worked on in a spirit of open, constructive dialogue with Parliament, to which I would like to express my appreciation once again.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin precisely with the economic issues that we addressed in order to boost development, to boost employment, to increase the competitiveness of European industry and to complete all elements of the internal market. Firstly, the December European Council formally approved what we have called the ‘European Initiative for Growth’, a measure proposed by the Italian Presidency which was developed by Ecofin and the Commission with a contribution from the EIB. This is an initiative with which you are familiar, seeking to promote a substantial programme of investment in the sector of major trans-European infrastructure that includes transport, trans-European energy networks and the telecommunications sector, as well as investment in human capital, in other words in research and development, innovation and technology.</p>
<p class="contents">We set ourselves a two-fold objective: to create, by means of these projects, the conditions for improving the quality of material and immaterial infrastructure networks dedicated to linking up the great European market, especially with a view to enlargement, but also help to boost economic growth overall, and therefore employment, with adequate financial support. We are hoping to use both public funding - from the Union budget and, in part, from the individual Member States - and private sector financing, thanks, not least, to the decisive role of guarantor played by the European Investment Bank. I would like, in this regard, to stress that this is the first major economic policy manoeuvre at European level decided on in a framework which fully complements the Lisbon Strategy and is also fully compatible with the Stability Pact. There is no point in hiding the fact that, as individual States, now that the single currency has been adopted, we have no means of implementing monetary policy or economic policy; we cannot devalue our currency in order to support our products and exports; we cannot use deficit spending policies, even medium-term policies, to observe the Maastricht criteria. This right, this power, which the individual States no longer have, must, therefore, be replaced with a higher power. Unfortunately, our European Bank, the European Central Bank, has the task of controlling price increases, of controlling inflation, that is; it does not have the task of supporting the economy, unlike, for example, its counterpart in the United States of America, the Federal Reserve. Therefore, Europe must muster the will and give itself the ability to take steps to support its economy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to a different, more specific matter, although still in connection with strengthening the internal market and boosting growth, we then reached agreement on the adaptation of the trans-European transport networks TENs to the new context of an enlarged Europe. In this same framework, the European Council has ratified the agreement on the decision to double the contribution from the Union budget increasing it from 10%, as provided for up till now, to 20% for interventions on cross-border sections. This is a highly significant result in terms of the capacity to mobilise private funding for large-scale infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council has stressed the importance, in terms of the free movement of goods, of overcoming the difficulties posed by mountain passes and natural barriers, and by traffic congestion along the main communication routes. We hope that, on this basis, it will be possible in the near future for the Commission to evaluate and quantify the negative impact of mountain passes and natural barriers on the proper functioning of the single market. I would say that, as regards trans-European networks, extremely important work has been carried out, in that we are completely without roads and communications, both rail and road, to provide links with the countries which are to become the new Members of the Union as of 1 May. It was absolutely essential to update the plan of trans-European networks, which was laid down some years ago, and this has been done. There is something else I would add: we have produced a list, known as the quick start list, which provides for a series of projects. I would, however, like to make it clear that this is not a closed list: quite the opposite, it is an open list to which all the projects which are ready for implementation can be added, projects which are ready for presentation to give the go-ahead for contracts and for the necessary funding to be sought.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the matters on the Lisbon agenda, we have focused, in particular, on the issue of employment and competitiveness in order to underline once again the need to pursue structural reforms. These reforms have already been launched by a number of Member States, and are measures that, at times, impose short-term sacrifices and costs on society but which constitute the necessary conditions for ensuring reinvigoration of the economy. I am talking about labour market and pension reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to employment, we have assessed and evaluated the report by Mr Wim Kok’s Task Force and its recommendations. I have to say, Mr President, that Mr Kok has done a truly outstanding job and his work is the fruit of his experience as both a trade union leader and a head of government. We all owe him thanks, for not only has he identified solutions to general problems but his Task Force has gone into the situations in the individual countries and has recommended for each individual country the measures that it feels need to be taken. I can say that, where my own country is concerned, the Task Force’s analysis is absolutely spot-on. It is to this report that the extraordinary Social Summit was dedicated, which I chaired on the eve of the European Council, a summit of trade associations and trade unions. This summit revealed the shared desire of the social partners to proceed with the implementation of the European Employment Strategy within a framework of greater flexibility and commitment to the greater enhancement of human capital.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to competitiveness, the European Council has noted the progress made over these six months in line or almost in line with the expectations of European enterprises and economic operators. I must make something clear regarding this point: I was able to participate in a conference held by UNICE last month in Brussels. The symbol of the conference was a giant created by Jonathan Swift, the giant Gulliver, held prisoner by the Lilliputians. The image was intended to convey to the political representatives of the individual States and Europe that the European economy is a giant held in the grip of too many traps and snares – as industrialists call the excessive amount of regulations, directives and laws which prevent them competing fully with external economies.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must give this fact all due consideration, for the European economy is going through a difficult time, which I fear will become even more difficult given that the economy is gripped in a vice consisting, on the one hand, of the United States economy, which is expanding rapidly with the support of an injection of USD 350 billion decided upon by the Bush administration, an economy sustained, first and foremost, by rates of taxation which are the lowest in the Western world, and, on the other, by the Far East economy, which is in a state of almost total anarchy, with no rules being observed where either workers or the environment are concerned and not even minimal fiscal control.</p>
<p class="contents">European entrepreneurs welcomed the creation of the Competitiveness Council, which will, from now on, have the task of assessing the impact of measures adopted by authorities and European institutions on the competitiveness of our businesses. We must all cultivate awareness of this dimension if we do not want our economy to stop being competitive with other economies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the understanding reached recently on the proposal for a directive on takeover bids. This is a highly significant political agreement that brings to a close almost 15 years of negotiations. Thanks to this agreement, we can now say we have helped to define a key element for the completion of the internal market. In this connection, I must thank the Italian minister, Mr Buttiglione, who engineered this agreement. Much work remains to be done, however, to give firms operating in Europe those general conditions associated with the legislative framework and the state of the job market that can guarantee their genuine competitiveness on world markets. This is an important undertaking to be pursued in the coming months and to be formalised at the spring European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings us to the matter of security. With the objective of putting the Community institutions increasingly in touch with the citizens’ real needs and interests, the Italian Presidency has worked on strengthening the security of the Union’s citizens in the knowledge that, even more so than other issues, it is on this matter which is particularly relevant to the daily lives of us all that the effectiveness of the Union’s action will be judged by public opinion. One of the central themes of our work has been the development of common strategies in the field of the management of migratory flows. In the first place, the concept of ‘common external borders’ has been further reinforced, and, in that sense, the European Council has taken note of the agreement reached on the main constituent elements of a special Community border management agency. The decision has been taken to set up the agency and the Commission has committed to making it operational as of 1 January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council has also taken note of the adoption, at the Presidency’s proposal, of a special programme of measures on immigration by sea, a tangible sign of the Union’s particular concern over the often tragic phenomenon of the attempts of illegal immigrants to reach our coasts with results, I would point out, that are often genuinely disastrous. As regards this point, too, we must inform the European Parliament of the meeting, held in the presence of the Presidency and the Commission, of the five European countries bordering on the Mediterranean and the five countries of the North African coast. These countries are traversed by increasing migratory flows which they describe as characteristic of our time, by citizens travelling from Africa to Europe, which they see as heaven on earth. These countries, when invited to take part in bilateral agreements by individual European countries, declared themselves willing to participate in cooperation, which would make it possible to control departures from their coasts. However, during this ‘five plus five’ meeting, they did call for greater involvement in this measure and, of course, for us to bear the substantial financial costs which they incur for the benefit of Europe. In this connection, the Council has invited the Commission to look into the matter and put forward solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has paid due attention both to the issue of the reception and integration of legal immigrants and to the issue of persons in need of international protection. We are awaiting, in particular, a Commission study on the relationship between legal and illegal immigration, a study that should also include the matter of the establishment of European entrance quotas. We have, nevertheless, taken note of the progress that has been made in the matter of asylum, even though I am afraid that it has not been possible, as we had hoped, to reach agreement on the two directives under examination, relating, respectively, to minimal procedural regulations and to the definition of the status of refugee and beneficiary of subsidiary protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Effective management of migratory flows must, moreover, go hand in hand with fruitful cooperation with third countries of origin and transit. To this end, we have gone ahead with the process of fully integrating migration issues into the Union’s external relations. We have noted the implementation of a mechanism for the evaluation of third countries in combating illegal immigration. This is a mechanism called for by the Thessaloniki Summit, on which we very quickly achieved an interinstitutional agreement with the European Parliament by means of a regulation establishing a new programme of technical and financial assistance to third countries in the field of asylum and immigration. This programme will endow a sensitive sector with new financial resources, EUR 250 million for the coming five-year period, as the first step in a more substantial increase in funds for immigration, an increase that should take place with the next Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on the subject of immigration, but with aspects clearly associated with citizens’ security and combating terrorism, as the European Council we noted the agreement reached on the inclusion of biometric data in visas and residence permits. In the near future, this innovation will be extended to the passports of Community citizens as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Significant results have also been obtained with regard to combating drug abuse. I would mention, in particular, the political agreement on the framework decision on combating drug trafficking an agreement patiently brokered by the Presidency. The European Council has highlighted the importance of interfaith dialogue, a matter to which the Italian Presidency dedicated a special conference in Rome in October as an instrument in the integration of the immigrant communities in Europe and, more generally, as an instrument to aid understanding and cooperation in international relations. The issue of relations between the West and Islam, between Christians and Muslims, is a matter which comes up every time we meet with the countries of the Arab League. We need to work hard on this, for an Arab minority is still emerging which sees the challenge as to be taken up at all costs. There can be nothing worse than going down that road. I believe, therefore, that we must make every effort to achieve genuine, ongoing, constant, far-reaching dialogue between the West and the Muslim countries. I would also point out that the Heads of State or Government have formally confirmed their firm opposition to every form of extremism and intolerance and their condemnation of terrorism and all other kinds of violence, and their explicit, unambiguous condemnation of all forms of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council has also adopted the European Security Strategy: an excellent document, the work of Mr Solana and his team, which analyses security threats to the Union and how to address them. On this basis, we should be able to improve our capacity for intervention in the area of both conflict prevention and crisis management. Finally, the European Council has noted the progress achieved in the development of the CFSP. Acquiring more capability remains our primary commitment and, to this end, the decision to create a European agency specifically dedicated to fostering the development and acquisition of new military capability has particular importance. In this context, the European Council’s decision to accept the proposal presented by the Presidency, on the basis of discussions with various partners, to boost the Union’s planning capacity according to procedures compatible with the role of Nato and the ‘Berlin Plus’ agreements, takes on special significance. With this decision, a matter that, up until a few months ago, was the object of far-reaching division among the Members of the European Union has now been brought to a positive conclusion in an institutional framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to mention that, at the Brussels Summit, the agreement on the location of 10 European agencies was concluded something that had been left on hold for about two years. On the basis of this agreement, which was the result of diplomatic preparatory work in the months preceding the Summit, we will now be able to work with greater peace of mind to provide the operating conditions in the respective locations for agencies which will supplement the work of the Union institutions in a number of major sectors. The Italian Presidency is justifiably proud of this major agreement, which deserves to be emphasised all the more as it was achieved under conditions certainly not facilitated by the difficult negotiations over the Constitutional Treaty taking place at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Brussels European Council has taken place just a few months before the entry into force of the Accession Treaty. The enlargement set to take place in 2004 looks increasingly set to be a complete success, thus confirming the wisdom of the decisions taken by the Heads of State or Government at Copenhagen in December 2002. We noted that the acceding countries are continuing with the full transposal of the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span> and will, I am sure, by the deadline of 1 May 2004, be capable of shouldering the responsibilities deriving from their full membership. The Commission’s recent strategy document has confirmed without a doubt that Bulgaria and Romania have made considerable progress towards entry into the Union. These two countries are now ready to complete the decisive steps that precede accession. The European Council has drawn up a timetable with specific deadlines: 2004 for the conclusion of negotiations: 2005 for the signing of the Accession Treaty and, finally, accession to the Union in January 2007. Turkey, too, has completed a substantial part of its institutional reforms and has made further progress towards compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria. We have therefore duly recognised these positive developments in the conclusions of the European Council. Moreover, we have also given Turkey our recommendations and encouragement to continue in this direction, while also highlighting the areas in which Ankara is being asked to make a particularly intense effort. The medium-term goal remains Turkey’s adequate preparation with a view to the decision to be adopted by the European Council one year from now.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council has also devoted great attention to the major developments which have taken place over these six months in the European Union’s relations with its partners, its neighbours and the rest of the world. We have, first and foremost, noted significant progress being made towards achievement of the objectives of the Stabilisation and Association Process for the Balkans and the major work carried out by the Italian Presidency in this field, and we have reiterated the Union’s determination to support the European prospects of the countries of that region, inviting them to intensify their commitment to reforms, especially in the sectors essential for integration into the Union. Equal importance was accorded to the results achieved in these six months in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and, in particular, on the occasion of the Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Naples on 2 and 3 December 2003. I would like to point out that, on that occasion, the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly was formalised, we agreed to set up the Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations and we provided for a substantial increase in the EIB’s Euro-Mediterranean Facility, all in the anticipation and hope of a genuine Euro-Mediterranean Bank being set up handling capital from the countries of the African continent too.</p>
<p class="contents">Transatlantic relations remain an irreplaceable cornerstone in the Union’s external relations. The European Council has devoted a specific declaration of major political importance to the matter. Moreover, it comes at the end of a period that we will remember as one of the most difficult in relations between Europe and the United States. Among the declaration’s most important points, I would mention the statement that constant dialogue between the Union and the United States on an equal footing is necessary and fundamental if we are to deal successfully with global challenges. Therefore, the Union will have to commit itself to strengthening cooperation with the United States in order to convert that community of values that lie at the root of our historic relationship into a community of actions. A common commitment to combating terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction will be central in this regard. Lastly, the development of the CFSP and the EU-Nato strategic partnership will increase the overall effectiveness of the transatlantic community.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also stressed the strategic value of our relationship with the Russian Federation and the importance of developing a broad-based partnership with Moscow aimed at facilitating and promoting the increasing integration of Russia with the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as outgoing President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, I would like to leave you with a message of confidence. Indeed, I can assure you that all the countries have defended legitimate interests with respectable arguments, and, most importantly, that no one has denied the existence of a prevailing common European interest at all. It is normal now that there be a pause in which our countries and public opinions can reflect more deeply on the debate, but we are certain that the negotiations will be resumed on the basis of the Convention’s draft and of the results achieved through the work carried out by our Presidency and all the Member States together. Each Member State will have to make its contribution in the coming months to the process of integration, for the European undertaking must remain unified and inclusive, without shortcuts or fragmentation. The Constitutional Treaty is a goal that will certainly be reached. The upcoming presidencies, with your support and the support of the future European Parliament, will certainly be able to work to this end thanks, not least, to the work already done and the results already achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will end by thanking you for having responded so actively to my invitation to cooperate closely in every phase of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference. I have handed over the texts of the agreements already concluded to the Irish Presidency with my very best wishes for successful work in creating that great Europe that we all want.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span><span class="italic"> (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the six months that are drawing to a close have been full of events and projects. You will remember that, at the opening sitting on 2 July 2003, I listed 13 legislative proposals that the Commission hoped would go through by the end of the year. I am very happy to note that, thanks to the efforts of the Italian Presidency, agreement has been reached on five important items on that list: I am thinking, in particular, of the amended directive on the traceability of GMOs and the framework agreement with the European Space Agency which will give a great boost to the development of our space policy; the introduction of the Single European Sky and the rules on public procurement are other major achievements of these six months and both will be formally approved early next year; lastly, clear outlines have now emerged on a political agreement on takeover bids, which Parliament will be considering during this part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Presidency has carried the flame responsibly and with a great spirit of cooperation, for which the Commission is grateful. For this and for the strenuous efforts they have made, I want to express my thanks publicly to the political leaders of the government and the whole team, both those working in the various institutions in Italy and the Permanent Representation in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">The last act of these six months was the Summit of Heads of State or Government that ended in Brussels last Saturday. The part devoted to the Intergovernmental Conference rightly attracted most of the public's attention, but we must not overlook the other important issues on the table that were successfully resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the topic to which I attach most importance is the European Initiative for Growth, which the Council approved unanimously. This Initiative is the most visible part of a general plan of measures to stimulate the European economy. Indeed, the measures adopted by the Council include measures to enhance our competitiveness and encourage job creation. Ladies and gentlemen, the opportunity offered by the current recovery needs to be grasped now so we can reinvigorate the Lisbon agenda, which remains the key strategy for sustainable growth for the continent as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I welcome the agreement reached in the Council on the seven new European Agencies which will deal with transport safety air, rail and maritime safety - food safety, fisheries, chemicals and disease prevention and control. I want to stress the role played by the Commission over the now four years of work which have led to this achievement. It is all the more satisfying to reach this outcome because the course has been uphill all the way. The task was difficult and called for quiet work behind the scenes, but the Commission never doubted we would succeed in our undertaking. There are two reasons why the agreement on the Agencies is so important. Firstly, it provides a more flexible and more efficient model for Community structures, a model that will bring the Union increasingly close to the European citizens. Secondly, it is the result of a comprehensive approach that reconciles individual countries' interests, which can hold up or impede progress towards the common interest if they are not aligned.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now move on to the other major topic of the Brussels Summit: I am sad and disappointed at the failure to adopt a Constitution for the European Union. Let us cast our minds back two years to the Laeken European Council and the reasons behind its historic conclusions. The conclusions were a response to a need felt by all at that time: for the Union to be given a more coherent, better-structured institutional framework. At the time, the Member States were agreed on three basic points. Firstly, the need to improve the functioning of our institutions, following that famous night at Nice. Secondly, the need to rationalise our legislative and institutional structures. Over the decades they have grown so complex that this has diminished the coherence of the Union's policies and procedures. Thirdly, the need to involve the European citizens more in European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The great innovation at Laeken was the Convention, the most ambitious and democratic institutional project in our history. We have invested years of work in the undertaking, bringing together under the same roof 105 delegates from democratic bodies across Europe: national parliaments and governments, representatives of the European Parliament and members of the Commission. The Convention did a good job. After 18 months, it presented a draft Constitution that we concluded was a good basis for the Intergovernmental Conference to work on.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as we have stated repeatedly, the text needed just a few amendments on certain points, because we were convinced as we still are that it strikes a delicate balance for the whole system<span class="bold"> </span>underpinning the European Union and its work. On the major points, the Convention's work was excellent. I am thinking of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the method of qualified-majority voting and the distribution of political responsibilities. I am also thinking of the increased role of the European Parliament, to which the draft Constitution gives, at last, greater decision-making powers in the area of the Union's budget. As regards other issues, in particular the procedure for amending the Constitution, there was just not enough time. Lastly, on the issue of the drafting of the Constitution, the principle of one Commissioner per Member State was already there in essence. The practical arrangements were not satisfactory, but work carried out after the Intergovernmental Conference sorted this out.</p>
<p class="contents">Like every working basis, the Convention's draft was intended to take us forward, but some Member States have used it to take us backwards. That, ladies and gentlemen, is why I am here expressing my sadness and disappointment to you today. Last week, the European integration project ground to a halt and we all, all of us, missed a great opportunity. The consequences will not be tragic, however, if we can keep resolutely to the course set by the Convention. The problems identified in the Laeken declaration still need resolving; the basic text is still that produced by the Convention. Although there is no sense in pointing the finger and pinning the blame on any particular national delegation, I must stress that we cannot shape our institutions with the possibility of blocking decisions as the only parameter. That is not our role, it is not the role of Parliament or the Commission. The deadlock at Brussels means that the Council as a whole failed to reach consensus on a unified proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Sharing the blame is not enough, however, ladies and gentlemen. We will now have to explain to the citizens how best to protect their future. Alone or together? Divided or united? There is only one answer: we just need to open our eyes. In line with the Laeken declaration, I still believe the solution cannot lie in a combination of vetoes but in the convergence of interests and proposals. The right of veto is not an expression of democratic will and our institutions cannot side step the rules of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are currently seeking a common solution and I realise that this is terribly difficult when there are still so many important issues on which agreement has yet to be reached. Having said that, however, I am convinced that the right solution will be found with time and patience. I therefore hope that future European Councils will come back to the issue of our Constitution with a realistic timetable and also with an overall perspective that we have, perhaps, lost in the course of recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">We all need to display courage and imagination, the qualities that major political decisions demand. Only a few days have gone by since the Brussels Summit. It is too early and could even be presumptuous to put forward a full response as yet. However, we clearly have a duty to reflect on what has happened and what we need to do in the future. Some are thinking about a vanguard of pioneering States paving the way for greater cooperation and serving as the foundations for a stronger and more closely integrated Union open to all. Solutions of this kind are part of the tradition of European integration, and if we cast our minds back, we see that such solutions emerge first and foremost when things are at their toughest and most complex. Today, we are at one of those moments of crisis, and we therefore need to be courageous, responsible and forward-looking as we start to reflect on the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I want to close this brief speech with an appeal from the heart. I ask you to bring your political wisdom, your farsightedness and your experience to bear in the service of the first Constitution for a united Europe. I know there are many of us in this House who see the European Union as the only viable answer to the challenges of history and politics. As the directly elected representatives of our fellow citizens, you are very familiar with their views: thus, you know that they are perfectly aware that Europe is not an abstract ideal or a whim but a historical necessity. Just step outside our geographical borders: from a Chinese, Indian or American perspective, the individual countries of our continent grow indistinct and merge; what people see increasingly is Europe as a whole; just cast your mind beyond our own age: in the eyes of history, the integration of the whole continent is the only chance of survival for the individual States.</p>
<p class="contents">Only Europe can give us the strength to maintain and develop our cultures and the regional and local traditions we are so proud of. If we do not all stand shoulder to shoulder and defend this Union we have started to build over the last half a century, we will lose our autonomy and our influence in the world. The Union will be the loser, but the biggest losers will be the Member States and our citizens, and we will all inevitably end up on the sidelines of history.</p>

We are disappointed, but, in our disappointment, in the darkness, a light shines, for it was on 13 December 2003 that we got the news that the Charlemagne Prize of the city of Aachen had been awarded to the President of the European Parliament and thus to Parliament itself, which shows that we have allies in the cause of a strong, democratic, and active Europe. Mr President, we congratulate you on this distinction.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That the Intergovernmental Conference has failed must not mean that the Constitution has failed. Let me say, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that there must be no doubt about our desire for a European constitution, that we declare our determination that there should be one, and that we are striving to have one as soon as possible, because without a constitution, Europe has no future in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We want a European constitution, because, in a community of 450 million people – and perhaps eventually even more – it is the only foundation for our peaceful progress through the twenty-first century. We need a constitution so that the problems that arise in our society can be resolved on the basis of law. We need a European constitution in order to be able to defend our European values in the world. Let there be no doubt about our desire for a European constitution founded upon Community law. We will stubbornly resist any attempt to take us back to mere intergovernmental cooperation or to the formation on our continent of axes squaring up to each other.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Italian Presidency and the President of the European Council for having managed to get agreement – as you said – on 82 points. My appeal to all those in positions of leadership is this: let us not again unwrap this package; let us instead focus on the few contentious issues that remain. No one European government is in the right, and nor will we get caught up in apportioning blame, for once started on that, we will soon come to recognise that almost all of us bear a large part of the responsibility for Brussels having been inconclusive. Rather than holding just one, two or three countries responsible, we now need the good will of all.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a compromise; our willingness to compromise has always been a distinctive characteristic of Europe, for compromise is an expression of our shared goodwill, of our mutual trust, and of our desire to go forward into the future together. Let me make it perfectly clear that if a government thinks – and I am putting this in very abstract terms – that it can get out of European solidarity and defend only its own national interests, then such a government will, if that is how it behaves in future, be excluding itself from European solidarity. Solidarity is not a one-way street; it is binding upon all, and so it is that the practice of solidarity is in the national interest, because those nations that withdraw from European solidarity will end up having no part to play in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Today, we hear people pondering the idea of a ‘core Europe’, but how is that meant to work? A ‘core Europe’ is no solution, for the problems on which the few agree are always different ones. One group will agree on monetary issues; another on defence matters, and yet another on questions relating to the environment. It is for that reason that a ‘core Europe’ is no solution. We must walk together; together we must take the road that leads to Europe’s future.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I urge everyone to join in seeking out this road. People’s questions to me betray their concern; this very morning, a renowned European journalist asked me whether the euro would still be there in ten years’ time. Let us defend what we have achieved in Europe rather than jeopardising it. Certainly, what we need right now is a moment to pause and to consolidate, but let me tell you that we should now be thinking about Europe’s need for clear foundations in the shape of a constitution. We should not already be talking about further enlargements of the European Union that could put the whole concept of European integration even more at risk.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by reiterating my gratitude to the Italian Presidency for its goodwill. We know how difficult things are in Europe, but Europe will indeed suffer harm if we now lack the will to keep on working on the basis of what the Convention produced. Next Thursday and Friday, we will be in Dublin, and I hope that the Irish Presidency will do everything in its power, starting by sounding out the individual governments as to their positions, so that the foreign ministers can then achieve a result that will enable, in due time, a summit of the European Union to be held, at which the European Constitution can be adopted. In this responsibility we all share.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a day for apportioning blame, but a day in which, despite the difficult situation in Europe, to have faith and to keep working on Europe – with patience, but also with the passion that the task demands. Our group is determined that this Europe should be a success, and for it to be that, we need a European constitution.</p>

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, when your Presidency of the Council began, you said that what concerned you was the football in Tokyo and we should point out that the Milan team reached the penalty stage. You did not even play in the second half. We can see the results.</p>
<p class="contents">This is despite the serious and professional work of the Italian Presidency – and I would like to publicly thank Mr Frattini, Mr Antonione for their efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">My group profoundly regrets the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference and the fact that it was not possible to approve a Magna Carta, which may cause us an existential crisis if we do not provide a serious political response. We believe that we must recover the Community spirit, which is to take decisions together, combining our interests, acting in solidarity and not trying to block decisions. I say this with particular feeling, because my country was always in the vanguard of European integration and now it is in the rearguard.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I must also say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you have said – and I believe this must be recorded in the Minutes – that 95% of the Constitution is not subject to debate, but is part of our <span class="italic">acquis</span>. I believe this is an important fact. Now, in order to resolve the other 5%, there is something that was demonstrated in Nice and which has now been ratified: that methods involving all-night negotiations, haggling, do not resolve the problem. And therefore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would put a question to you: the Convention was not the outcome of Nice; we achieved it at Laeken. The Convention has produced this text. Are you in favour of returning to an open and democratic method – the Convention method – or do you think we can resolve the matter by staying up for another night like tonight? I believe we have to be very clear in this approach, and it is also important, therefore, that the Irish Presidency takes up this baton.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been particularly struck by the fact that you have been especially critical of the current situation in the economic field and this is understandable. What you have said would justify reconsidering the issue of economic governance. You mentioned Gulliver and I am a great admirer of Jonathan Swift, but I do not believe this is the appropriate example. We are not like Gulliver, but like Italo Calvino’s <span class="italic">Visconte dimezzato </span>[The Cloven Viscount], we have one half, the European Central Bank, but we do not have a figure in charge of the economy. Are you prepared to propose an amendment to the Constitution and a reform of the Stability Pact aimed at giving us Europeans strength? I believe this is an important issue to which we have to respond.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also say to you, on behalf of my group <span class="bold">–</span> and of the European Parliament I believe <span class="bold">–</span> that we are prepared to continue working to achieve the Constitution. We have 95%. The important thing now is to complete a Magna Carta, which is absolutely essential for our future and also for enlargement.</p>

In six short months, the presidency has conspired to undermine the Stability Pact, has shown contempt for the European Union's policy towards Russia and offended Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office has treated us to a 40-minute catalogue of the achievements of his term of office. Yet it is hard to escape the conclusion that this presidency and IGC have been a personal failure for the President of the European Council. The 'piece of paper' in Mr Berlusconi's pocket turned out to be a <span class="italic">gelato</span>-stained napkin with a few bad jokes scribbled on it. The President came to the IGC poorly prepared; he ignored the warnings of this House that holding back compromise proposals would produce this kind of stalemate.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">While the Americans were digging Saddam Hussein out of a hole in Iraq to global acclaim, our leaders were digging themselves into a hole in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">A successful summit needed two things: political will on the part of the major countries, and skilful diplomatic leadership. It showed neither.</p>
<p class="contents">This IGC was not fated to fail it chose to. Five countries walked away from an agreement which everybody needed but none of them wanted enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, a delayed deal is better than a bad one. But the problem with postponing a decision by kicking it into the long grass is that you might not find it again. Especially with a crowded agenda ahead which includes negotiations on the next financial perspectives, talks on Turkish membership and elections in Spain, Britain and Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">So after a short post-mortem, the IGC must resume and must conclude its work under the Irish presidency. The Irish have Mr Ahern, one of Europe's most seasoned negotiators, and Mr Cox, the President of our own House, whose joy at the Charlemagne Prize we share. It may be possible to relaunch the European Union. Our first Constitution deserves public debate and endorsement, and that requires a Treaty before the European elections in June 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to underline the extent of the concern felt by Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House and beyond and our feeling that the actions of the larger Member States are plunging the European Union into a crisis which could endanger the democratic nature of our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit conclusions are also a disappointment to us. There is nothing on Guantanamo Bay, despite the explicit demand of this House that our leaders should uphold the rights of the detainees. On Russia, the conclusions scandalously make no reference to elections which the OSCE called 'a regression in the democratisation process'.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The decision to bring the People's Republic of China into the Galileo programme seems to have encouraged talk of the lifting of the European embargo on selling arms to the world's only significant remaining Communist dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On all these issues, the Council behaved as if it is ashamed of our values or ignorant of them altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">At your press conference after the summit, President-in-Office, you said that but for the IGC, your presidency would be remembered as 'the most glorious of recent years'. Yet agreement on the five issues mentioned by the President of the Commission represents a meagre return on a presidency in which such high hopes were invested. If this was a glorious success, I would be fascinated to know your definition of a failure. You set your presidency the target of a Constitution by Christmas. By your own standards, you have failed.</p>

I was extremely critical of the text at the time, since I and my group saw it as constitutionalising the liberal model by perpetuating the most contentious part of the Maastricht Treaty both in its direction and as regards the institutions. The project is now frozen for several months. Some might think that gives us some satisfaction, but for my part that is far from being the case.</p>
<p class="contents">First because the course of liberal Europe is not affected by this failure. It will continue for one simple reason: it is unfortunately not the subject that divided the 25 governments. Everyone, from Mr Berlusconi to the Polish Prime Minister, has been keen to underline that there was consensus on virtually every point of the draft constitution apart from the method of calculating the qualified majority in the Council. All the problems so forcefully raised in the growing public debate on the draft constitution, in the recent European Social Forum for example, are therefore still on the table. That is nothing to be pleased about.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we had the distressing spectacle of ambition for power and dreams of power, with no comparison being made of the options for the Union’s policies, objectives and values, seemingly echoing that stupid watchword ‘Nice or death’, a complete denial of the politics and spirit of responsibility. This Europe long in tooth and short on ideas, alien to people’s expectations and insensitive to the frustrations welling up everywhere, is a princely gift to populists and demagogues of all kinds. This failed prelude to an enlarged Europe is likely to have a devastating effect on all who have real ambition for Europe – an alternative ambition to the present treaties, but a strong ambition nevertheless.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this impasse is giving new life to the outdated old ideas of the hard core. Only too glad of an opportunity to pull out, the richest countries are threatening to cut back the funds intended for the least developed. By doing away with the notion of solidarity between Member States, such a development would be the death-knell of any community, allowing the dream of the most liberal to come true, the free trade area.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept such a view. It is a caricature of the idea of closer cooperation between nations, some of whom want to see a more advanced social model and some a more independent and more offensive international policy prevail without waiting for an impossible unanimity of 25. But for that to happen there would have to be a real European political project within the European Council. But the truth is, there is no project, except perhaps for that very ambiguous one of European defence, made worse by the Union’s new strategic doctrine that makes your blood run cold simply by reading it. There is the rub.</p>
<p class="contents">The way this European Council has gone and the results it has produced ought to convince the doubters on one point: because of the major changes it will require to the present institutions and directions, a project that our fellow citizens can identify with and feel part of will not, will never come about spontaneously from a conclave of Heads of State and Government. A convention will not be enough either. The challenge must now be taken up by the citizens who aspire to it and the parties with which they identify. In my view, it is this level of ambition, more than ever, that will have to shape the next stage in European policy.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frassoni (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, by way of assessment of your work at the helm of the European Council, all we need to do now is say that the Union is not stronger or more united than it was six months ago, that your government’s contribution to increasing the cohesion lost during the battle over Iraq has been insignificant and that your statements on Chechnya, your failure to produce an initiative on the death penalty and the support and lack of criticism you showed for the Bush and Sharon governments have reduced the already poor credibility of the Union as a player on the world stage. Or else we could point out the disinterested involvement of Mr Tremonti in Ecofin’s attempt to undo the agreements reached by the Convention on the budget, or, again, the outrageous behaviour of Mr Lunardi, who is pushing for European funding for trans-European networks which his company would then like to build.</p>
<p class="contents">Your Presidency, however, will be remembered, above all, by Europeans for the failure to achieve agreement on the Convention’s text. This will be the case even if you, with the help of your television networks, succeed in convincing the Italians that success was achieved because you have managed to win the seat of the Food Safety Agency for Parma and to produce an agreement – as yet still on the drawing board – for the funding of a couple of tunnels and a useless bridge.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it really would not be fair of me to say that the reason for this failure lies entirely in lax preparation or in the original approach of bilateral meetings which provided for no plenary discussion and prevented everyone from forming a clear idea of what the mysterious compromise proposals were or of who was for or against what. However, we do believe that the agreement that was taking shape would – we are sure of it – have created more problems than the current crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I will tell you something else: I do not believe that we can genuinely say today that there is a consolidated agreement on the majority of the 82 points put forward by the Italian Presidency, points which, moreover, are largely unacceptable because they represent a step backwards, and not just with regard to the Convention but with regard to Nice too. Whether you like it or not, the only text on the table is that adopted by the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Your weak Presidency and the Spanish and Polish Governments are not the only ones to blame for this crisis. There are many others, starting with those who rejected double majority voting at Nice and are now setting themselves up as unlikely European political heroes.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we accept the challenge posed by the crisis: it might lead to a better Constitution for the future. However, we need to take note of the fact that the governments of both old and new Member States of the Union are unable to reach unanimous consensus on a viable Constitution for Europe. It is useless: you will not be able to do it on your own! The Irish Presidency will not succeed where Italy has failed. In order to succeed in giving Europe a Constitution, you need us, your citizens, your parliaments, if you want to prevent the project for a united, enlarged Europe breaking down soon in disastrous disputes over the Financial Perspective or over national sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Constitution is not dead; the governments are not the masters of Europe, not least because when they attempt to be they lose their way in domestic wrangles. We must resume the initiative without delay and prevent the work carried out by the Convention being filed away in some dusty drawer forever with the excuse that we need time to think or to fulfil our electoral obligations. To this end, we need to find allies both in the national parliaments and among those governments which, like us, can see the urgent need to overcome the crisis quickly, restoring confidence in the European project and restoring its credibility and also asserting the need to abolish the right of veto for institutional reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret, Mr Berlusconi, that it is not clear whether or not Italy is one of these. I hope you will tell me that it is. Beware, however: we are not yet resigned to the idea that, with the European Union only just reunited, it should already be divided or that the time has come to set its rate of progress on the basis of the interests of a small élite: we do not believe there should be two different groups or factions. Our aim must continue to be the reinvigoration of the project for a democratic, effective Europe with which all can identify.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be true that an agreement was not far off in Brussels. If that is so, we call upon the Irish Presidency to convene another Convention without delay to ascertain in the clear light of day whether it is still possible to reach agreement. Otherwise, the plan must be to relaunch the constituent process after the European elections.</p>

The memory of those who gave their lives for freedom and democracy in Iraq will be indelibly engraved in our minds as we pursue our political undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian Presidency said that keeping the peace – and, therefore, combating terrorism and disruptive forces across the board – and pursuing stable prosperity for our people and for all the countries whose people live in difficult, tragic conditions because of hunger, poverty or lack of development, or, as is all too often the case, because of oppressive political systems, are the primary tasks performed by society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency stressed that, if we are to achieve a stronger, freer, more independent and inclusive Europe, institutional changes are necessary and they cannot be brought about by watered-down compromises. The European citizens need clarity and efficiency and the Council has a duty to define unambiguously the political, economic and cultural role that Europe must play on the world stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Terrorism cannot be overcome by conventional methods alone, without the involvement of the citizens. The globalisation of the markets calls for new financial and economic rules to replace the obsolete rules of the past century. There must be renewed cooperation with regard to the geographical areas closest to us, in particular, and fresh consideration must be given in this context to the countries whose languages and cultures are similar to ours.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like express the regret of the <span class="italic">Alleanza nazionale</span> and my own regret as a member of the Convention at the failure to reach agreement on a new Treaty. The Union cannot have a two-tier system of first- and second-class States, or several individual or alliances<span class="bold"> </span>of dominating States, displaying two faces to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">A new Treaty is necessary and each State must lay aside the mental reservations which are a barrier to political Union. The undertakings given to the citizens must be delivered on and we are sure that Italy will give its full support to the Irish Presidency so that what was not achieved yesterday can be as soon as possible. The citizens of the 25 Member States of the Union want neither a federal superstate nor a Europe consisting merely of a free trade area.</p>

Let us have mercy therefore on Turkey, Mr Berlusconi, and let us think again for a century or two, maybe even longer.</p>

You treated the minor economic – but so very understandable – egotistical concerns of Spain and Poland equally, but then gave in to the constant, arrogant, nationalistic blackmail from France, which is used to being the only country to gain anything from Europe. It was time for France to start paying too, now, as we have all paid. Well, Prime Minister of Italy, you have certainly failed to remember, you have not put enough faith in those who, more in prison than on luxurious conferences, laid down for us the path set by Parliament in the period 1982-1984. We need to go back to that time, to the Europe of our Parliament, whose primary task must be to break free from its shackles. It is a symbol: we do not even have the power to decide where we should meet, when or how. We are forced to meet in Strasbourg. First and foremost, we must show an example to the Europeans. As Members of Parliament, we must decide on the location of our Chamber, in which we will debate the matters which concern us.</p>

Surely it is just a reflection of current opinion at government level about the structure and implementation of a new EU Constitution. The lack of unanimity reflects divisions that are real within Member States, divisions which are too readily dismissed and which perhaps have been too readily dismissed in this particular debate.</p>
<p class="contents">To me the question is where we go from here. Is it an issue on which we have a realistic prospect of seeing progress during the course of the Irish presidency? Sweden said at the end of the IGC that it is a matter that could probably not come back before the Council until 2005, and others have talked about it not coming back for at least two years.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to the President-in-Office that he should dismiss much of what he has heard in the more recent speeches, not least from Mr Watson, the leader of the Liberal Group. Mr Watson was up to his sanctimonious best during the course of what I regarded as a number of cheap shots against the President-in-Office of the Council. The President-in-Office might like to know that when he was endeavouring to reach agreement in the IGC on Friday, Mr Watson had his name on the front page of the Murdoch press arguing in the United Kingdom for a referendum on the outcome of these constitutional talks. That was just a day after all his members had voted against a referendum here in this House. That inconsistency is something that we have come to recognise from Mr Watson.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is worth reflecting that the President of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Robin Cook, the former Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, has recognised what he believes the route forward should be. He said that perhaps we in Europe need to move away from this introspective constitutional debate, as it has taken up too much time and energy; and that what we need to focus on are the issues that matter to our European citizens, such as jobs and growth, the environment, human rights and quality of life. He says that we need to get closer to the citizens we were elected to serve. These are remarks he made on the BBC broadcasting in the United Kingdom. They may not be said when he comes to speak to Mr Barón Crespo's group here. However, I welcome the fact that Mr Cook has endorsed the approach I have adopted in almost every debate we have held in relation to this constitutional issue.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much that is contained within the draft Constitution with which I take issue. This is not the occasion to revisit that area. But all of us should be committed to the prospect of getting back in touch with what matters to our constituents; and I would just remind everyone that we face them in June of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is not the case. This Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which met yesterday evening with a great many representatives from national parliaments, has expressed a common, deeply-held feeling of disappointment and concern, together with a common determination to help in every way possible for the constitutional process to be resumed and brought to a proper conclusion. We must not play down what has happened; we must not hide behind the comforting argument that the European Community has faced other crises and come through them successfully. This time there is likely to be a deep split in the Union, on the eve of the great enlargement. This time public opinion in all our countries is likely to suffer a serious crisis of confidence in a united Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday evening we talked about how to prevent the road to the constitution from remaining blocked. It is a fact that when the process of drafting the constitution or revising the Treaties stopped being a government monopoly and was entrusted to a European body on which representatives of the national and European parliaments also sat – that is to say, the Convention – the work proceeded in a European spirit and an agreement was reached that was based on the common interests of Europe. When the process was handed back to the governments with the Intergovernmental Conference, individual interests and even matters purely of national prestige prevailed in crucial areas.</p>
<p class="contents">What can be done? First of all, the approach that you, Mr Berlusconi, mentioned remains valid. The constitution cannot emerge out of a watered-down compromise. It would, however, be a good idea to clarify what the Italian Presidency meant by ‘a watered-down compromise’. What was the actual compromise that was avoided? A return to Nice, the intangibility of the Treaty of Nice as regards the system for calculating a majority vote? It would be useful if the outgoing Italian Presidency could tell us more clearly instead of praising all those who took part in the IGC. Secondly, we must not throw away everything that has been negotiated in recent months. Well, we still want to know what solutions have been found for the 82 points and they have to be made public, so that we can see what substance there is to these solutions. Further discussion is also required on one issue that has remained unsolved: the procedures for revising the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Irish Presidency has been given an extremely limited mandate. Our message – as you, Mr Cox, have mentioned – is that the Irish Presidency should interpret this mandate in a broader and more inclusive manner, extending its consultations so as to make good use of the Convention’s advice and contributions. Mr Berlusconi, you have finished your work, but Italy’s responsibilities do not end here: as one of the founding countries, it must be a decisive driving force at this critical moment in ensuring that the process of integration continues.</p>

Clever brokerage will still be able to achieve a respectable deal upon the outcome of the work of Mr Giscard d'Estaing and the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the IGC has failed makes the process and the outcome of the Convention more attractive. The Irish presidency should certainly press forward quickly to seek to complete the IGC. For them to be able to succeed they will need assistance and there is nobody more capable of proffering advice than the Convention itself, which should be recalled in January to consider the full package of presidency proposals that was published on 9 December.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Berlusconi says that much has been agreed, but precisely what was agreed? That the financial system of the Union should deprive Parliament of the last word on the budget? Was it agreed in the area of the third pillar that the emergency brake clause would suppress qualified majority voting and codecision? Was qualified majority voting agreed for foreign and security policy, as the presidency proposed? In the 'passerelle' clause, will the blocking of a single parliament be able to paralyse it? Parliament has a need and a right to know the answers to these precise questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem happens to be knowing what kind of setback it is. I believe it is the defeat of the construction that you have chosen. Whom do I mean by ‘you’? The Italian Presidency, the Treaty Convention and the IGC. You have reduced the conflict that Europe is experiencing to a clash over the political aspect of Europe – whether it should be as much as possible or as little as necessary – in short, a clash between Europhiles and Eurosceptics. By doing so you are obscuring the real conflict and the drama of the choices Europe is being called upon to make. You have thus stayed within the same real model and have called this conflict – which is over who should make decisions and how – a model when it is not, distancing yourselves even further from the peoples of Europe. The model is, in fact, a social model of a political construction: it is its international aspect. You have chosen to constitutionalise the market at a time when neo-liberalism is failing and, although you prefer peace, you have considered war possible, in these terrible times when the world is racked by wars and terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The uncritical alignment with the Atlantic framework negates any ambition for an independent Europe. You did not choose the ambition of a model but settled for an accommodation and for staying afloat, which in practice has proved to be a framework of shifting sands, which has exalted the power struggle between powers and between countries. That is how the construction was blown apart.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be good if you at least did not deny your failure, as the Italian Prime Minister has done. The chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party used the word in all its harshness. Mr Prodi has, I think, also recognised this, but I believe he is wrong in thinking that a solution will come from setting store by the Convention. In fact, I think the answer will be to stop pursuing a mistaken path which, if we continue along it, will lead to the ultimate crisis of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall have to make a new start, then, but from what point? The first point is one of method: from a different relationship with the peoples, movements and democratic public opinion of Europe. The second is one of substance. There are three core issues facing us: the economy, social conditions and the international aspect, and these are inescapable. There is not just yesterday’s failure; there is also the Maastricht crisis, the paradigm for a Europe of markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, as the President-in-Office has said, is caught between the political process in the United States, where the dollar favours their competitiveness, and the aggressiveness of economies like China’s. In this situation, the IGC response is not at all convincing, positioned as it is between a bastard Keynesian view and an attack on the social conditions of the workers. Mr President, what really needs attention is the rights of the workers and the peoples. If we do not make a new start based on this reality, Europe can have no future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The punchline is that someone advises you to throw yourself out of a helicopter. We are very glad that you did not do so, but we are not amused by the way you threw out the European Constitution instead.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three kinds of failure: you can lose to your opponents, you can fail to achieve goals that are set too high, and you can be your own downfall. The Intergovernmental Conference brought itself down. Nobody was against it. You had the Convention behind you, with an overwhelming consensus of the larger Member States and the smaller ones, the old ones and the new, of parliaments and governments. Only in your own ranks did you have opponents.</p>
<p class="contents">Did you fail because you were aiming too high? No, for, apart from the Convention proposals, there was no controversy; even with your 300 amendments, you went nowhere near as far as what the Convention had proposed, and not even as far as the Treaties of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">You were the cause of your own failure. Having been called upon to take responsibility for Europe, you fought for national egoisms; having been called upon to create a balance between the institutions and a European democracy, you tried to build on your own power advantage, and to waste no time in gaining advantages for the national governments. You had the chance to defend the Convention’s consensus – which was the greatest that could have been achieved – but instead you lost it.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, I believe, one hope left to us. You, Mr President-in-Office, have tried; the governments have tried – and they have failed. After the partial failure of Amsterdam and the total failure of Nice, they have now, finally, failed. All that we can now do is to appeal to the governments’ sense of reason in persuading them to accept the Convention draft, Europe’s highest common denominator, after all.</p>

At least, that is what I used to think, because this morning I confess I am surprised, but not at the outcome of the Brussels European Council or the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference. I have said on a number of occasions, including here, that I never imagined for one second that the Heads of State or Government, who represent the highest democratic authority in the Union, could reasonably agree to the draft European Constitution prepared by the Convention as it stands, without amending it – at least that is what the ukases of the majority of this Parliament wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">No, what surprises me is the behaviour of the federalist majority here present, whose blindness it must be said is beyond understanding. You never question yourselves. I have not heard one of you say: ‘Perhaps we were mistaken. We must have gone the wrong way.’ No. You persist, you sign, as if nothing had happened. Better still, like worthy followers of poor Lysenko, you look for someone to take the blame for your failure. Like all fanatics, you want heads to roll. But if you look things calmly in the face, you will see that the cause of this fiasco is not the Italian Presidency, whose excellent work I commend in passing, nor the attitude of some Member States, who have courageously defended their national interests as their peoples demanded, but quite simply our Convention and its incredible draft constitution. Noble as it may have been, this project was doomed before it even saw the light of day, because it ran radically counter to European political reality, a reality which, whether you like it or not, continues to be determined by the existence of peoples and nations.</p>
<p class="contents">In rejecting a division of power based on the federal model, Spain and Poland have rendered Europe a great service by finally saying out loud what many others have been quietly thinking for months, namely that the old Europe of Jean Monnet inherited from the division agreed in Yalta is dead and gone. Do not persist in trying to resurrect a federalism that is a thing of the past. Unlike the chairman of the Convention, the draft constitution is not immortal, so let it rest in peace. Let us rather take the opportunity that is given to us of laying the foundations of a new Europe, one which has rediscovered its natural borders. Let us build a political Europe which, while never denying its history and taking into account the constraints of modernity, tends towards an ideal of freedom and not of uniformity.</p>

Why not use the time to prepare referendums in all the countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Parallel with the summit, the European Referendum Campaign met in Brussels with 100 participants from many different organisations. Both Mr Leinen and I were among the speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of SOS Democracy and the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, I should like to undertake to contribute to some solid information work on the draft Constitution. Let federalists and Euro realists present our different visions for Europe, together with accessible editions of the Constitution wording. Let us together demand referendums in all the EU countries under a common motto: EU Constitution? Ask the people.</p>
<p class="contents">In Denmark, we are to be given a referendum, but the June Movement would like to help gather signatures for referendums in all the EU countries. When we have a referendum and vote ‘no’ in Denmark, a new referendum is held. Instead of giving the Danes and the Irish a second ballot, it would be better to consult the whole of the EU.</p>

This does not mean that Europe is dead or finished. The Treaties are still fully in force and will remain effective and in operation until they are replaced with a new text.</p>
<p class="contents">In the President-in-Office’s speech, I was pleased to hear the reference to issues closer to the citizens, who, I believe, are not particularly interested in whether voting is by double majority, whether Spain should have 27 rather than 28 votes or other such things. I think the citizens are very interested in major public works, not having tailbacks on motorways, being able to travel on fast trains, having special attention paid to employment and – as Mr Berlusconi recalled – taking action against those countries that operate on the free market without complying with the rules on environmental and worker protection. Ten years ago in this Parliament I was arguing for exactly the same things, so I was pleased to hear the President-in-Office of the Council calling for them.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also add that this kind of unfair competition is also seen in the pirating of products and brands, and in this context, now that the baton is being passed on to Ireland, we must in my opinion make a great effort to protect our industries, our products, our workers and ultimately our standard of living. The institutions are important, as is their reform. We must, however, as Mr Berlusconi has done, pay attention to the living conditions of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I do not want a compromise if it does not increase our capacity to act. Discussion of that brought the IGC down. There can be no compromise if, having got it, there is less transparency – the Legislative Council springs to mind – or less democracy, of which the Budget debate and Parliament’s budgetary rights provide us with examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these criticisms, though, I would like to thank the Italian Presidency of the Council for having kept close to the Convention’s text throughout all these weeks and months and for actually keeping the commitment it made in respect of it. This is why the Convention text still stands; it is now for us to breathe new life into it. This being so, and in view of Mr Berlusconi’s statement that a number of formerly critical points – apparently 82 of them – had been satisfactorily dealt with in Brussels, it would make sense to hold fast to it if we are to maintain momentum. For this reason, I believe, the foreign ministers should meet together as early as January in order to consolidate what has been achieved. That, I believe will enable us to maintain momentum, and you, Mr President, could perhaps prompt them to go down this road.</p>
<p class="contents">This could provide a basis on which the Irish Presidency of the Council could put forward proposals for holding a new meeting of Heads of State or Government as soon as possible, although the timetable has to be planned in such a way as to make compromises possible. This meeting must be held, and must resolve matters, before 1 May, when enlargement is due to take place, for this project is, logically speaking, intended to enable the European Union to be enlarged.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to give a second reason why this meeting should be held before 1 May, which is that I do not know how, if things remain as they are today, the Heads of Government and we in this House can face the voters on 13 June. It is for this reason – so that the voters can have a perspective that keeps them from losing faith in Europe – that it is from this point that the Heads of State or Government must make a new start before 1 May. I hope, Mr President, that you will, in the remaining weeks of your presidency, join with your successors in setting a project of this kind in motion.</p>

For years, we condemned lowest-common-denominator compromises; this time, the lowest common denominator would have been a ‘Nice II’, which would have destroyed the draft constitution. Let me say, therefore, that it is better that the summit should fail than that the draft constitution for Europe should be lost.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We in Europe’s Parliament will not now allow this draft to disappear back into the archives of history. It is still on the table. Working to keep it there will be our first priority in the coming months and years, and we will have to keep working to that end even after the next European elections with our new fellow-Members here in the European Parliament. Europe is indeed in a crisis situation, and we have to face this crisis calmly. We must not allow ourselves to be influenced by soothing words about business as usual. We will overcome crises like this one not by standing still but by getting moving.</p>
<p class="contents">Where is this danger that hangs over Europe’s future? It does not lie in the possibility of the constitution arriving a couple of years behind schedule. It lies in a new division that is opening up in Europe. In a stronger and united Europe, there are, on the one hand, governments that seek to use it as a means of promoting their national interests and, on the other, there are governments that want to defend their interests against it. This gulf must not be allowed to get any wider; bridging it is our most important task.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, the dispute at your summit was about the division of power in Europe, which the world powers have long disregarded. Therein lies the danger facing Europe. While you are in Brussels, fighting tooth and nail over influence, Europe is in the process of losing all influence in the world. Such is the danger of which this summit is the source.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I will dare to say that it is easy to overcome the differences that have become apparent between the governments, but restoring people’s confidence in Europe’s future will be difficult. Yet it is that which will be our task, a task we must accomplish over the coming years and decades, a task in which I wish us all much success.</p>

<p class="contents">The final report that Mr Berlusconi gave here for three-quarters of an hour – 82 points ‘with one exception’, which must be the success of the IGC – is a clumsy way of giving us an extra dose of misery. Unfortunately, he is once again concerned with distancing himself from a mark of failure rather than pointing out the right road on behalf of a great founding country like Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi has honestly expressed the extent of the failure and the risks associated with it, and has started to mark out a possible route for the future. I say yes, Mr Prodi, to an initiative by pioneer States for a Europe that in no way underrates the importance of this broad Union extending from Portugal to the Baltic States, but you know we have to move towards an effective, democratic integration of the Community based on the results of the Convention. Yes, then, to starting out with those who share the results of the Convention – an honourable compromise – on the new European Community path. In this way all 25 can be helped to reach the goal. This is the objective around which we should and can unite as from tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the first failure of an enlarged European Union, even before the accession of new Member States. It represents a setback for European integration, but what brought it about? The Brussels summit did not focus on the creation of a democratic, social and peaceful Europe. Instead, power and influence were haggled over, and a narrow-minded nationalism again prevailed in yet another demonstration of the fact that Intergovernmental Conferences are completely unsuited to advancing European integration. The European idea sustained serious damage at the summit, at which it was the real loser.</p>
<p class="contents">There were winners, though, as well; they include, for example, the USA, for it is the USA that will profit from the summit’s conclusions on European security and defence policy, which tied Europe and NATO together as brothers in arms and put us under American guardianship in security policy matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of a European constitution – a modern and progressive one. It was with that in mind that I involved myself in the Convention, but it should give politicians like ourselves serious misgivings that – figuratively speaking – nobody took to the streets to demonstrate in favour of the constitution that the Convention produced. Only 38% of the public at large have ever heard anything about the Convention and only a fraction of them are familiar with the text. Quite apart from that, the real problem is to be found elsewhere, in that the public are not convinced that their fundamental concerns and needs are a priority. The degree to which they are right about this is demonstrated, to take one example, by the fact that the IGC as a whole did not even once turn its attention to the inherent contradictions between Part 3 and Part 1 of the draft, and by the manifest fact that two mutually antithetical economic philosophies are to remain in the text of the constitution – the social market economy on the one hand and free competition on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not the way to get people enthusiastic about a European constitution. I hope that the time of reflection – the crisis – will be understood as an opportunity. I urge you to have an open discussion with the public about the constitutional project, and, above all, take seriously the serious criticisms that civil society makes of the Convention’s draft.</p>

<p class="contents">I have often had to hear disparaging descriptions in this Parliament of the historic democratic nationalist traditions, such as the Basque nation, when all we want is to safeguard our identity and our culture and are prepared to share our laws and political competences with the other Europeans. To this end, not only are we calling for recognition as historic nations, but also a role in the democratic decision-making processes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not we, but certain irritating State nationalist traditions, which are slowing down Europe, as in the case of Mr Aznar, who only thinks about how to block decisions in order to impose his views on others, rather than thinking about how to build a stronger, more prosperous Europe, united in its diversity. I am convinced that, in order to move forward, the Union must cease to be dominated by State governments, that is, by executives, and become a genuine federal union, in which it is the citizens and their representatives, we Members of the European Parliament, who determine the Constitution and other Community laws.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to leave behind intergovernmentalism and to move towards becoming a full political entity, a supra-State with common laws for all the peoples and nations of the continent or at least for those who wish to build a common future based on dialogue, trust, understanding amongst equals and good for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, Spain and Poland’s opposition over the method of calculating the qualified majority was in fact motivated by profound differences, which were shared by other States although they did not say so openly: the rejection of a unitary Europe run supranationally by a coopted elite. Our thanks are due to those countries for defending Europe’s true interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and lastly, the intransigence of those who clung to the qualified majority formula proposed by the Convention showed that in reality they did not want it to succeed. Perhaps because they thought the Convention’s conclusions were not as good as all that. But perhaps especially because, knowing the state of mind of their fellow citizens, they wanted to defer the problem until after the European elections.

Work by many people over many months has resulted in a proposal with which a great majority appear to be in agreement. The good work of the Italian Presidency has furthermore allowed us over the weekend to add something very important to the agreement, which is the establishment of a European defence doctrine. All of this acquis, the fruit of negotiation – as Mr Berlusconi has said – must be recovered and consolidated as an approved text. What then has led to this failure?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the failure stems from a proposed institutional reform which the President of the Convention came up with at the last moment, which was not debated sufficiently, and on which there was certainly no consensus within the Convention. Apparently in Brussels six months has not been enough time to complete a compromise. This is no great tragedy. We must remember that of the five previous Intergovernmental Conferences which negotiated reforms of the Treaties, only one ended within the six-month period in which it had begun. The Irish Presidency must simply carry on working where the Italian Presidency has left off.</p>
<p class="contents">What I believe should be ruled out, Mr President, is the following: firstly, the absurd idea of postponing this debate until after the European elections; secondly, the idea that what interests me is Europeanist and that what does not interest me is anti-European; thirdly, the nonsense of dividing Europe even before it has been enlarged; and fourthly, the recriminations which get us nowhere, except for some people, of course – such as the President of the Group of the Party of European Socialists – who believe that the government of their country is solely to blame, whatever it does and whatever happens. I believe that the only phrase he knows in Italian is <span class="italic">Piove, porco governo</span> [it is raining – damned government]. He indulges in this type of national opposition in the European Parliament and is then surprised that he loses election after election. It must be the electorate’s fault, naturally.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we now all have responsibility. Mr President, we must keep the IGC open, we must contribute to dialogue and the commitment we all aspire to. Let us pray that we achieve it before 13 June. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The two camps are the optimists and the pessimists. The pessimists point out that we are in a major crisis, perhaps, I have heard it said, the biggest since the rejection of the EDC Treaty in 1954. The optimists say no, because 95% of the draft Constitution has not been challenged and has virtually been agreed though I would like to see the text of the final versions of these articles that have virtually been agreed at the IGC. There is just one key subject left to argue about and settle. It concerns the voting system within one of the institutions. We can still do this. After all, on the original timetable nobody had originally thought we would finish before Christmas, so there is nothing to panic about. It can all be resolved in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">Which of these two views is right? I tend to be an optimist by nature, but I am a cautious optimist. We can salvage this IGC but it will need us all and the Member States in the IGC especially to be focused: focused on the remaining issues that need to be settled and attentive to solving them sooner, rather than later. If we take too long, there is a risk of reopening the debate on virtually every article in the draft Constitution. That above all must be avoided. We must focus on the points that remain. We must ask the Irish presidency to tear up its original plans and timetable for its presidency and focus first and foremost on this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that business as usual can go on to a degree on the basis of the old Constitution, namely the various treaties that we have, but these treaties are not satisfactory. They need updating, they need streamlining. They need modernising. We need the new Constitution. The Irish presidency must not just carry on, business as usual. It must focus on getting a result on this as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their fight solely over the right of veto not only caused the Brussels Intergovernmental Conference to fail, which is what happened three years ago at Nice, but also managed to obscure the positive aspects and the shortcomings of the draft Constitution, stifling real debate in European society and in our various States and Nations. These factors have obscured the extraordinary value of the existence of the Constitution, the progress made in external policy since the crisis in Iraq, the leading role given to Parliament and consequently to the citizens, and the shortcomings of our policy for social and territorial cohesion, the failure to recognise national political diversity in Europe as well as in the Member States, which I wish to highlight as a Member of the European Parliament for Galicia and as Chairman of the Intergroup on Stateless Nations.</p>

<p class="contents">That is why there is a touch of melancholy in the air today. What I mean is that, although this contradicts the philosopher, this melancholy is not the result of pointless efforts. The Convention’s efforts have not been pointless, because – and I firmly believe this – this Constitution is necessary for the enlarged Europe and there is no alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the European Parliament – as the poet would say – has yet to speak, we must now consider how we are going to act in the future. Firstly, we must recover our common sense, and there are a series of things we must not do: we must not talk about dividing Europe, about dividing ourselves, the Europeanists, up; we must not talk about founding countries, about pioneer or vanguard countries, as if to reproach those countries which do not seem up to the job; and, at this time, nor should we send letters to the President of the Commission telling him to reduce the budget to 1% of GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">We must recover our common sense. We must consolidate the constitutional <span class="italic">acquis</span>. You, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, have said that 82 solution measures have been proposed. Tell this House whether this is the case and, if it is, they must be consolidated. Let us consolidate them under the Irish Presidency and, before 1 May 2004, let us resolve the outstanding institutional issues and let us go into the elections of 13 June asking the Europeans to vote for this Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many Members have done that already.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to refer back to what I said on 2 July, when, in this House, I asked you, as President of the European Council, ‘What do you intend to do to speed up the introduction of the European arrest warrant?’ On that occasion, demonstrating a distinct lack of charm, you declined to answer me. Then, in September, I asked again what progress had rewarded your efforts, and I can tell the House that I have received an answer. The answer to the question as to what you intend doing to speed up the introduction of the European arrest warrant is ‘nothing’. On 1 January next year, there will be no European arrest warrant.</p>
<p class="contents">The area of security, freedom and justice is at the heart of European legal policy, a core policy of the European Union – as, indeed, you yourself said in your first statement to this House. I take the view that it would have been one of your tasks as President-in-Office of the Council to make this landmark a reality, for the fact is that the failure to introduce the European arrest warrant means that, from 1 January 2004 onwards, the position as regards criminal prosecutions in Europe will be worse than on 31 December 2003. The absence of the European arrest warrant will make it more difficult to prosecute criminals from 1 January 2004 onwards. Precisely whom this state of affairs is meant to benefit, Mr President-in-Office, I have no idea, but I know full well who is put at a disadvantage by it, namely the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to establish this area of security, freedom and justice, if we want to make Europe more secure, if we want to guarantee more efficient prosecution across frontiers, if we want to combat organised crime more effectively, then this landmark in the area of security, freedom and justice is what we need. I very much regret that. Back in September, I believed you were on the right track. Today, I have to say, with regret, that, on this issue – and let me repeat myself, we are talking here about the accelerated introduction of the arrest warrant, which was necessary in July – you have, lamentably, not only failed to do your homework, but have, in my opinion, proved yourself an outright failure.</p>

<p class="contents">There is, of course, one discordant note: the mechanism for giving the European Union a new formal constitution has jammed. At this moment we must pay particular attention to the sirens of the material constitution. We need time to reflect, because what emerged in the heat of the moment is certainly worrying. I will not mention those involved but rather the issues: a two-speed Europe, the emphasis on closer cooperation, a Europe made of concentric circles, in which all share the same policies but each group remains open to new associations – this is not the political scenario that the 25-Member Europe needs. We must not lose what lay at the heart of the Convention: the general interest of Europe, which gave rise to the decision to abolish national veto rights in most cases and proposals for a transparent and credible voting system. In the general interest of Europe we must make a fresh start and work with new formulas that we can create if we so wish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After dividing Europe by unleashing the war in Iraq, it has just prevented Europe from giving itself the constitution it needs to operate with 25 members, at the very moment when it was arresting Saddam Hussein. Over the last century, the only wall of freedom will have been the Wall of the Atlantic. Since then, we have had the Berlin wall and the Jerusalem wall. That is not the way to build peace. To those who added a brick to the wall of Atlanticism this weekend I want to say that the cement of peace, security and stability that our continent needs will not be built with walls like that.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1986, the European Union has experienced a divorce between the nature of its project and the institutions able to sustain it. Before now, we did not have the right to frame the question in those terms. But because enlargement reverses the numerical ratio, it forces us to raise the question of the institutions in such stark terms. And the Heads of State or Government are unable to deal with it because then they can only go back home with bad news and they do not have the double legitimacy of the nations and states. That double legitimacy existed in the Convention. That is why we reached an outcome that ought to have been validated by the Heads of State or Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Europe’s contribution to the world balance will not be consolidated on the blocking power some wanted to introduce this weekend. Do those who rejoice at this failure, imagining a hard core resigned to not having a working Europe of 25 and allowing this wall of Atlanticism to be built want to be the agents of division and of new rifts in our continent? Let us note those things where we can make progress, but let us not give <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> to those 82 points. Let us look at them one at a time and see what can be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Your Presidency’s conclusion, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, where national egotisms have carried the day, turns its back on the hopes that were born of the Convention. The mandate given to the Irish Presidency is not equal to what is at stake. Those who still want to provide our continent with the conditions for its stability must take up the flag again.</p>

On the contrary, under the Italian Presidency we were able to keep the basic ideas of the Convention virtually intact and agree jointly on 22 of the areas involved. Consensus was reached on an important issue relating to future security: the development of common European basic defence structures. When the IGC realised it should include the Convention’s original wording regarding the relation between the position of the non-aligned countries and security guarantees, Finland, Sweden and Austria were also able to become fully involved in security cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">A by-product of the summit was the way it also resolved disputes over where to locate EU agencies, wrangles that had long been a source of irritation. Italy can therefore go away happy to brag about Parma ham and prosciutto and we Finns on the other hand will monitor the situation from the Chemicals Agency and ensure that they do not use the wrong ingredients when they produce them.</p>
<p class="contents">The argument over how the voting rights of the countries in the Council should be allocated left everything that had already been agreed open. As President Chirac himself admitted, the failure of the Nice Summit was the reason for this. We cannot be biased and point an accusing finger at the country currently holding the presidency nor even at Poland or Spain. It is natural that Germany was unable to accept the Nice decision. It is just as natural, however, that it cannot dictate the solution; instead, we are now to have talks aimed at a balance, talks which take a balanced view of the status of small countries, and not just the large ones like Spain and Poland. A return to genuine double majority voting – half in respect of the population and half in respect of the countries – must certainly be one aspect of the solution which would also reassure the small countries that they are not going to be dictated to by the large countries in the future. It is important, however, that debates on matters that have already been agreed on are not reopened on account of a row that has not been settled. If that happened we could really say that the Brussels Summit and the IGC have failed.</p>

How, though, is such a strategy meant to be implemented if both the common political will for it and common institutions – such as a European foreign minister – are absent?</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have declared, and rightly, that we are in a very, very precarious position as regards competition with the United States of America and with Asia, and you also referred to the state of affairs in the Far East, which amounts almost to anarchy. You were right to do so; how are we to compete successfully with them without a common will and common institutions, if we do not join together as Europeans in, for example, ensuring that Kyoto is implemented as a whole? Already, I hear many European industrialists saying, ‘We cannot be the only ones to implement Kyoto, or we will lose our competitive edge.’ That is only possible provided that a minimum of social and human rights is enforced, along with protection for the environment, provided that this shared constitutional Europe comes into being. The capacity of common purpose to accomplish something has been demonstrated by the way in which the Americans have dispensed with steel tariffs. If Europe acts together and presents a united front, we too have the opportunity and the capacity to get things done together.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to agree wholeheartedly with Mr Poettering that we need a European constitution as a symbol and as an instrument if we are to make this common purpose a reality on the global stage too. It is for that reason that I do not see the creation, at this point in time, of a core Europe as a way out. I might add that it is generally not the core of a fruit that is interesting, but its pulp, so creating a smaller core Europe is not a way out. Instead, Europe must be great, and we must hold it in common. If a few are unwilling to join in, then we have to consider how we are to achieve this constitutional Europe, this Europe in which as many as possible can share and which is open to all.</p>
<p class="contents">What this means is that both the Italian and Irish Presidencies of the Council must now carry the message that we have to work in order to bring about a common Europe with a common constitution and with as many Member States as possible. We must not allow our vision to fade away, nor must we, under any circumstances, abandon a common Europe with a common constitution!</p>

If we do not, the public will lose confidence in us. If we do not, we will achieve neither integration nor consolidation. If we do not, we cannot discharge our responsibilities for our continent on the world stage, and mistakes can be made. They can be corrected, and they must be. What has happened, though, is not just a matter of mistakes being made; what I find lamentable is the lack of sufficient political will on the part of the Heads of State or Government who took part and hence the lack of European leaders, indeed of European statesmen. Will, courage, emotion, enthusiasm – all are wanting, and so, therefore, are credibility and confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Whenever the future of Europe depends on unanimous approval by the Council rather than on agreement between the Community institutions, crisis is in the air. It happened with the sanctions against Austria, it happened with the Iraq crisis, it happened with the Stability and Growth Pact. More and more frequently, we blame the Community objectives for problems at national level. So let me conclude by saying that the Convention has not failed, the Commission has not stood in the way, Parliament is not putting the brakes on a Europe that is more democratic, more transparent and closer to its citizens. We say a forthright ‘no’ to unanimity and ‘yes’ to a dual majority, which is democratically fair, ‘no’ to the apportionment of blame and ‘yes’ to shared responsibility in Europe, ‘no’ to a more nationalised internal policy and ratification process and ‘yes’ to their becoming more European, ‘no’ to the Intergovernmental Conference method and ‘yes’ to the Convention in which governments and parliaments are represented, ‘yes’ to a European Union of peoples and citizens, ‘no’ to an intergovernmental core Europe, ‘yes’ to shouldering our responsibilities within Europe and around the world, ‘no’ to a reduction of Member States’ contributions. We say ‘yes’ to the idea of summoning the Convention after Christmas in order to discuss the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference and in order to speedily implement all that came out of the Convention, or was agreed at the Intergovernmental Conference, and is feasible on the basis of current law.</p>

Otherwise, we would have to face working with a botch-up, like the Treaty of Nice, carrying out enlargement without deepening the Union, under bad conditions, and discussing the financial perspectives in a stifling political atmosphere.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of its content and the way it has been produced, the Convention’s draft Constitution is good for the citizens and today, following the failure of the Brussels Summit, even those who criticised certain specific aspects of it accept it as a good document. The Convention was a success and the Intergovernmental Conference is a failure.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certain obvious contributors to the failure of the Brussels Summit and, for me, as a Spaniard, it means a great deal to hear the praise of the Eurosceptics in this House for the President of my country’s government, he of the ‘letter of eight’ and of the last Brussels Summit. The process of producing a Constitution must continue and that European Constitution must be created during 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we do not want a Europe of varying speeds, nor pioneering groups. We want a politically united Europe, a Europe which is autonomous in its external actions, a Europe with competencies and resources to resolve the demands of the people and, therefore, we must strongly urge the Irish Presidency to call an Intergovernmental Conference in January in order to consolidate the 95% agreed and to resolve the outstanding issues in a negotiated and appropriate manner. Why not also call the Convention, which has legitimacy? And naturally the European Parliament must play its historical role as a driving force, in this case as the driving force for the European Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We may perhaps then come to the conclusion that we have, in recent years, not engaged very seriously with the question of whether the EU can be made both deeper and wider at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me put that question in very graphic terms. The reason why the Convention was so very successful was that this issue was the cement holding the whole thing together. It was because there was a common interest – on the part of the actors, but not on the part of the Member States – and hence it is now important that we give some thought to what really are the common interests of the 25 Member States that will be joined together in this European Union from 1 May onwards. That needs to be analysed in a very matter-of-fact way.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the tasks that we have to perform at the European level? What are the tools, what are the procedures, that we need in order to perform them? What kind of financial framework does this Europe need if it is to be able to perform the tasks allotted to it? Only when we have come up with serious answers to these questions will we be in a position to draw the necessary conclusions, and learn the necessary lessons, from what was completed at the weekend, and that means that we also have to ask ourselves whether, at the moment, a deeper EU is perhaps more important than its enlargement over and above the twenty-five – which will mean discussing what a Europe of 25 Member States has in common.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we must start by fulfilling the fourth Copenhagen criterion – that was indeed laid down at Copenhagen. We must be able to concentrate on what we have in common. What is within the EU must be made capable of sustaining enlargement. That is the task we have to tackle in the coming year, and with a great deal of commitment, and then we will be able to draw from it the helpful conclusions that we need.</p>

Not only are we disappointed, however, the overwhelming majority of European citizens, who are in favour of a European Constitution, are also disappointed and perplexed. Fortunately, and to the despair of the Eurosceptics, the European Constitution is a popular idea and one that mobilises the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The European project is the finest idea that the twenty-first century has inherited from the violent twentieth. Today, Europe stands at a turning point. Enlargement will bring change; we are creating another political entity. I am not indulging in political metaphysics here – this is the reality of the situation. Enlargement without a Constitution is something that can no longer be contemplated, less still accepted. This is something that the recalcitrant Member States must understand. Unfortunately there are a few States that attempt to counter the spirit of Europe with the old myths and delusions of grandeur or of national importance and still advocate the political fossil, albeit a recent one, that is the Treaty of Nice. Europe must be built, however, through a positive, not negative spirit. Some leaders act as if the Union gave them rights but no duties whatsoever. We cannot and must not fail in our confrontation with history. Europe urgently needs a Constitution and it is within our reach. Long live the Constitution! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was an expected disappointment, perhaps, – but no less disappointing for that – to find that a year’s work by our 105 members of the Convention could be called into question in a few hours for futile considerations of the respective weighting of the different member countries of our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is a lesson we can and must draw from that, it is that we cannot hope for any progress in an intergovernmental context towards the completion of European integration since, as Mr Pasqua rightly said, in that context the Heads of State can do no other than defend their national interests tooth and nail, even at the expense of the general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not share the view of those who imagine that, in the weeks ahead, the Irish Presidency will be able to reverse the trend that has now been set. We must therefore prepare ourselves, ladies and gentlemen, to ask the real questions that remain in the course of the forthcoming European election campaign. After all, it is an ill wind and it will give the campaign added interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, President-in-Office of the Council, you raised the general issue of security, which you rightly understand to be a major concern of our fellow citizens in Europe. In this connection, while welcoming the good intentions shown, I cannot help remembering the proverb that says that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. I therefore hope that Europe will go beyond mere words and commit itself, in reality and not just virtually, to constructing the instruments necessary for establishing its objectives and implementing its strategy in this field.</p>

I want to dwell on something correct which you said when, speaking of the statute of the European Central Bank, you pointed out that it was inferior to the statute of the Federal Reserve Bank, because it does not contain the objective of supporting economic activity as well as the objective of price stability. It is important that you are the first Prime Minister and President of the European Council to point out the shortcomings in the statute of the European Central Bank from such an official tribune and I thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that the Italian Presidency's proposal that the Council should have the facility to amend the statute of the European Central Bank by a qualified majority will be accepted and I hope that the statute of the European Central Bank will soon be amended along the lines you indicated, so that the European Central Bank can finally start to encourage investments, especially public-sector investments, instead of trying to strangle them at every step, as if they were illegitimate children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why we must continue to press forward in the spirit of the Convention and on the strength of the considerable results achieved through the Italian Presidency’s hard work, and in the certainty that the final objective can really be achieved. It is worth remembering that 95% of what was decided by the Convention was adopted by all those taking part in the IGC. It should also be highlighted that the Italian Presidency has remained faithful to the commitments made in this Chamber six months ago, starting with the decision not to put its name to a low-profile compromise that would be an affront to the work of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Another positive aspect has been the relationship with this Parliament, which has at last, for the first time, been truly involved as a major player in the work of the IGC and has been kept constantly informed about the Council’s work. The other decisions by the Italian Presidency that Mr Fiori has mentioned should therefore be judged favourably. Indeed, the work of these last six months cannot merely be assessed superficially, acrimoniously and in a partisan spirit or, worse still, with a concern just for the internal affairs of the countries of the Union. Mr Barón Crespo does not practise what he preaches when he talks of Community spirit, for he only seems concerned about the Spanish elections, and the same applies to Mr Watson, who often worries about Italian matters but loses sight of the interests of Europe. Some of the Members from my own country seeking visibility or lost consensus also seem to care little about European matters when they use this House to talk about local issues, and unconvincingly at that.</p>
<p class="contents">A word to Mr Schulz, who has raised the matter of the European arrest warrant for the umpteenth time. The Italian Presidency has, as is its duty, asked all the governments what progress had been made with their national legislative measures to adapt their laws to the decision on the European arrest warrant. The answer was clear: only three countries out of 15 will have taken the necessary measures by December; four others said they would need three or four months longer; the other eight countries are even further behind. Mr Schulz, you cannot really be asking the Italian Presidency or any Presidency to overrule the sovereign voice of the national parliaments – that would be unthinkable.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to make an appeal to get down to work involving all the countries, abandoning the idea that a few should move ahead and leave the rest behind, and looking towards a Europe of values that does not want to give up its Judaeo-Christian roots. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the second time in just a short while that the intergovernmental method has failed, and this time it had behind it a complete, widely supported draft prepared by the Convention. What is even more disconcerting is the lack of prospects that can be inferred from your terse statement handing over to the Irish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, there is a real risk of facing both the European elections and enlargement without a constitutional treaty, but it does not seem to worry you very much. If you would like to dwell a little on the prospects in your reply, I should be very grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">The end of a presidency period is also a time for weighing things up. In foreign policy, no attempt was made to secure an active political role for the European Union and the United Nations: there was coolness towards the important Middle East peace initiative at Geneva, which you did not even mention; the commitments made here were ignored, such as the acceptance of the arrest warrant and the moratorium on the death penalty. We welcome the growth initiative but it will not be enough because only control of the economy, at least in the euro zone, can ensure the recovery and quality of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President-in-Office, information. You are aware that, during the six months of your presidency, this Parliament decided to enhance the status of media freedom and multiplicity in Europe, particularly in Italy. The fact that the President of the Italian Republic sent back to parliament the dreadful, dangerous law on this issue that was presented by your government and voted for by a majority in it confirms these concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, apart from the quite commendable conclusion of certain dossiers mentioned by you and Mr Prodi, how would you describe what the six months of this Italian Presidency have meant? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berlusconi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I should like to thank you and all the Members who have spoken in the debate. You have, in general, shown your disappointment with the fact that, in the sixty days available to the Presidency of the Intergovernmental Conference, no concrete result has been forthcoming. In truth, everyone had said such a result would be a miracle and it has been clear for some weeks now that it was not going to be possible to achieve one.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that this disappointment should not lead us to adopt a pessimistic attitude towards the future. I believe that recriminations serve no purpose and that it is always necessary to be optimistic. I have never known a pessimist to achieve concrete results; only optimism, faith and willpower can lead to positive results. I also believe that Europe should not be divided into a first-class and a second-class Europe, which would be profoundly wrong and would only dampen that enthusiasm, passion and desire for Europe and for common action that I have witnessed over these months of close contact with the government leaders, and not only the leaders, of the ten countries preparing to become members of the European Union. They represent a large number of Europeans – a young, highly educated force – and a major market for us. I believe, therefore, that we should do everything we can to ensure that the old Europe is reinvigorated by the contribution of this new Europe, which, I repeat, is enthusiastically about to join us.</p>
<p class="contents">The considerable achievements of the Convention and of all the countries during these six months must be enhanced and maintained: let us not forget that the Intergovernmental Conference began on 5 October and went on until 13 December. I wish, in this respect, to reassure everyone who has spoken about what remains from the work of the Convention – work that we have always sought to praise and to improve upon – and the work of the Conference. Clearly the final decisions of the Conference that I inserted in the concluding statement approved unanimously by all members have not been examined carefully. I would like, therefore, to read you a paragraph, which might perhaps seem pointless, but I feel I must underscore it: ‘The Italian Presidency has conducted the Intergovernmental Conference with the intention of keeping as close as possible to the Convention’s draft, fruit of an in-depth, democratic debate, open also to examining in a constructive spirit the proposals of each Member State in order to consider legitimate needs’.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point: this hard work has led to the definition of a text on which the great majority of Member States have agreed and which will, from this point on, be considered an indisputable <span class="italic">acquis</span>, thus completing a significant step forward along the road to closer integration of the countries and citizens of the enlarged Union. This means that the States making up the Council have unanimously adopted a political commitment not to reopen those points – practically all of them – on which agreement did not exist previously. In response to Members’ questions, I would also like to point out that these points are all contained in the proposal presented by the Italian Presidency after the Naples Summit; this proposal is available on the Italian Presidency website along with the text of the European defence agreement reached in Brussels on the first day of the new meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">This is something specific, and on this basis work must now begin towards an agreement on majority decision-making, which is the fulcrum of the agreement to be reached, in order to have a Europe capable of making not only correct but also prompt decisions, in particular on the adoption of international positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Only in this way will we not only have a Europe capable of being a world leader alongside the other major powers, and of being a decisive factor in the development of commerce and increased well-being – as we have been committed to doing, and not least in the Millennium Declaration – but a Europe that can also be decisive in spreading democracy and exporting freedom all over the world; a Europe that, together with the other countries of the West, is committed to providing those in need with food, water, health and education. These are all assets that cannot be guaranteed if the primary asset giving rise to all the others is not guaranteed: this is the asset of freedom, which can only be guaranteed and maintained through democratic forms of government.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is the West’s duty and hence Europe’s duty, and I believe that Europe will be able to achieve this result only if it can endow itself with a decision-making method that is not based on unanimity: as we saw just two days ago in Brussels, you only need one country to oppose a decision for it not to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">I will respond to just one of the objections that have been raised: the fact that the Italian Presidency did not have formulas for a watered down compromise on the aforementioned majority decision method. The Italian Presidency held out for the system envisaged by the Convention: that of 50% of the States and 60% of the population. We tried everything to persuade the countries of this, but they would not hear of it. When we realised it would be impossible to reach an agreement, and since agreement on all the other points was possible, we resorted to temporary formulas, proposing that we should maintain the Treaty of Nice until 2014 and introduce the system envisaged by the Convention from 2015 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States said yes, others no. So we proposed another formula that was acceptable to the Member States that had previously proved less willing: the Treaty of Nice will be applied and tested for four years. At the end of 2008 we will decide by majority vote whether the Treaty of Nice has worked and should be maintained (if necessary, improvements will be made); or whether it is possible to go on to the double majority – of Member States and the citizens, or whether another voting system has to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not possible to reach agreement on these proposals, which are not either watered-down compromises or otherwise but are aimed exclusively at providing Europe with a new Constitutional Treaty straight away. Thus all participants have chosen to postpone making a decision. This is, therefore, not the conclusion of a debate but the continuation of a search for an agreement that I am sure will soon be reached – I hope under the Irish Presidency or the subsequent Dutch Presidency. Therefore, the Constitution project has not failed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude, Mr President, with a word of optimism. The desire of all our governments to achieve a constitutional treaty for Europe was strong and everyone felt responsible for the failure to reach a decision. Unfortunately we did not succeed, but I believe that if we could not do it, with all the patience and determination with which we pursued these decisions to the last, nobody else could have done it either. Everyone has granted me that. Nevertheless, we believe that a solution on the majority vote to replace more than 50 years of unanimous voting can still be found, and the desire to find one is unanimous.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a simple problem since, with the majority vote, Member States clearly give up their sovereignty on many matters, and that means it will be a very difficult birth. This birth will have to have the support of the various national parliaments and will probably also have to be put to a referendum in the various countries. I believe, however, that there is a unanimous desire to move in this direction. The Intergovernmental Conference’s sixty days of work were fruitful. The results, as I have said, are there and there is also the political commitment of the Council members to consider these results valid and they should no longer be open to discussion. Then there is the work to be done on the new majority voting method, and I am convinced that, in the end, Europe will be endowed with institutions and working methods that will allow it to play an important role for the well-being, peace, freedom and democracy of its citizens and the citizens of the world.</p>

We have not put out any other message, and I can assure you that Mrs de Palacio too is committed to the ratification of Kyoto. Naturally, the fact that Russia is hesitating and continually putting forward alternative strategies is a serious cause for concern for us.</p>
<p class="contents">A very brief observation, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen: I should like to thank you all for the debate we have had, especially because it has been directed more towards the future than towards recriminations for the past, more to solving our current concerns than to blaming one another. I should, however, like to make an observation that I think is of vital importance: be careful, ladies and gentlemen, not to throw away in a few minutes all the work done in preparation for the Brussels Intergovernmental Conference, by hastily describing proposals on which there is not yet agreement as an <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is true that a consensus seems to have emerged on many points, particularly at Naples, for instance on the Council presidencies, research policies and a great many other fundamental issues, this consensus does not actually exist. Let us not deceive ourselves: it does not exist. I refer above all to the large number of decisions on the return to unanimity, degrading not only the text of the Convention but also the Treaty of Nice; not to mention, ladies and gentlemen, the lesser role envisaged for the European Parliament in approving the budget procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the overall result of the negotiations and bilateral concessions does not mean total acceptance by everybody, not even if you look for agreement on the lowest common denominator. It is also clear that nothing is accepted until everything is accepted, and that the conditions for acceptance will depend on our future. Let us not, then, throw away any of the great work that has been done, but let us openly acknowledge the problems that exist. This is the best way to solve them, and for that reason the Convention text remains our constant point of reference.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is the last meeting before the fifth Christmas we will have spent together, and the last of this Parliament and this Commission. I should like to close by offering all of you and your families my best wishes for peace and happiness, and my thanks for your valuable collaboration.</p>

The inability to reach agreement was caused by the enormous contradictions between the largest European powers and their divergent interests. The uncompromising positions of France and Germany were unacceptable to Spain and Poland, who would have lost voting rights <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> Nice. It is obvious, however, that they had the more or less open support of other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the interests of neoliberal capitalism unite the right and social democrats in Europe, the interests of individual nations, international alliances and of various economic groups do not match Franco-German interests. One example is how the Bush Administration has shared out the contracts amongst its friends, allowing US and European companies to work in Iraq. Not everyone gets a fair share of the plunder.</p>
<p class="contents">We knew that we were at a particularly critical time for European integration, because of the increasingly centralised decision-making, the more aggressive form of capitalism, and the increasingly less democratic and dangerously militaristic approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the failure of the Brussels Summit has not solved the problems, but it has not made them any worse. This gives new hope for the battle that we must continue to fight in order to achieve a Europe of greater social justice, development, economic and social cohesion and of peace and cooperation with the peoples of the entire world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I urge the UK Government to make maximum use of this interval to review its position on key areas of concern to Scotland. The reference to marine biological resource conservation must be removed from the list of exclusive competences. Furthermore, assurances are still required in relation to the protection of Scotland's offshore oil and gas reserves and the need to ensure that control and licensing powers are not conferred upon the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The example set by many small nations, independently negotiating their own terms and conditions at the IGC, underlines the need for Scotland to regain her independence and therefore the full rights of participation and voting in all international negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has not come as a total surprise, nor is it a total disaster because for the time being, Europe can continue to function in the same ramshackle way as it has done so far. Unfortunately, though, it does illustrate once again that this way of decision-making, involving Heads of Government who have to reach consensus behind closed doors, does not work. It is also regrettable that these days, governments have to prove their worth at home by the extent to which they manage to prevent the rest of Europe from doing something. To my group, what remains paramount is that the Constitutional Treaty must culminate in one voting Commissioner per Member State, and in the election of the President of the European Commission by the European Parliament. This is what we defend in The Hague and in Strasbourg. The EU becomes more efficient to the extent that it becomes more democratic, and, in achieving this, it is crucial that there should be codecision across the board for the European Parliament and that the role of national parliaments should be greatly reinforced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
