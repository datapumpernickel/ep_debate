Mr Karas has done a remarkable job with this proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The sustainability of pensions will be one of the biggest challenges which our societies will have to face in the coming decades. Occupational retirement provisions will play an important role in this connection in many Member States. The question of whether the coverage of biometric risks should be made mandatory has been one of the biggest issues for Parliament. I will concentrate on that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out a few reasons why the coverage of biometric risks or guarantees should be kept optional. Firstly, beneficiaries in many Member States already have cover for these risks via separate insurance products. Citizens should not be forced to pay twice for cover they do not need. Secondly, biometric risk cover is expensive and this expense is passed on to the beneficiaries. Mandatory biometric risk cover will cost each citizen, at a conservative estimate, around 1-3% of annual returns per year. Compounded over a 40-year savings period this could significantly reduce overall scheme returns. Thirdly, mandatory biometric risk cover will also damage the level playing field by providing an advantage to insurance providers. The European citizen will benefit if he or she can choose from a wide variety of providers. Fourthly, I fully agree with some of the previous speakers. If we want to promote the second pillar we need to get employers excited about the new rules. If the rules are too restrictive and costly to the company they will probably have no voluntary supplementary scheme at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I say to Mr Kuckelkorn that we cannot secure something which does not exist. The worst case scenario for beneficiaries is that there are no flourishing second pillar pensions at all. Security can only come after that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ettl (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Karas, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank you, Mr Karas, very sincerely for your work, and in particular for essentially making bricks without straw. In the world of politics, we sometimes find ourselves dealing with "deceptive packaging". There is nothing new about that. In the field of consumer protection, the term "deceptive packaging" is used when the content is not what it says on the label. The Council – sometimes working in conjunction with the Commission – has recently adopted the image of a product counterfeiter. I am quite deliberately saying product counterfeiter, rather than refer to a peddler of phoney products, which sounds very harsh.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a similar story with the product assessment of occupational retirement provision systems, the second pillar of the pension system. They are trying to make the public believe that they are talking about a supplementary pension system, without having to meet the necessary quality criteria including the pension requirements that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs regards as necessary, for example, guaranteed payment of retirement provision until the end of the insured person's life, the payment of benefits to surviving dependants or the covering of risks in the case of disability.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these quality requirements, financial risk and collective agreements between the social partners, which thus give those insured a voice, at present also have a fairly significant part to play. An additional factor that still militates against the freedom of movement of employees, and above all against their mobility, is the rather uncoordinated tax policy of the European Union in this context. Particularly in the case of occupational pension schemes, employees who take advantage of the freedom of movement of persons within the EU and make the European ideal a reality by switching jobs to other Member States can lose out because of differences in taxation, including double taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the key features of a comprehensive second pillar in the pension system have scarcely been taken into account here. That is why the proposal for a directive before us should not be labelled "supplementary pension system – second pillar", but should rather be seen for what it really is, namely a financial services product which only covers one small part of the full range of the second pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">I say that because there is one thing we should not overlook in this context. Of all the measures relating to pension security, benefits and quality for the end consumer are a priority, whether we are talking about traditional state or adjustable contribution systems or about additional or supplementary pensions systems provided via the capital market. The Council seems to have forgotten about this in this particular context, even if we have to admit that the capital growth resulting from this product is generally to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that despite this there have been qualitative improvements in some areas of the proposal is no doubt something we owe to the rapporteur, who has tackled all the key issues very prudently. However, there is one thing we should be clear about, and that is that state pension systems can only be supplemented by good occupational pension systems or private pension funds and schemes, otherwise with increasing life expectancy we could sacrifice social symmetry. It is not difficult to imagine what that could mean. With these comments, I recommend that if the voting goes as promised earlier you should vote in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would particularly like to focus on two aspects which I think are missing. With regard to pensions, it is the issue of security which is crucial to people. There should at least be a value guarantee whereby the contributed capital can be paid out even if it does not grow or increase. For example, what happens if these pension funds become insolvent or bankrupt or cannot fulfil their commitments? The report does not contain a single word about this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is almost even stranger that another important aspect is missing. When we started discussing supplementary pensions, it was said that this was an important EU issue, as we have a common labour market and expect workers to move between the various European labour markets. In that case, they will face many problems with regard to pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is currently very difficult to accrue pension rights earned consecutively in different countries. How should this be done? No answer is given to this question. In many countries, long qualification periods are applied. How will this be handled in a mobile labour market? Many countries have regulations involving double taxation. How will this be solved? There are a number of such questions.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that we need a completely new proposal from the Commission which takes as its starting point the needs of employees and pensioners rather than simply dealing with the needs of the financial market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Out of anxiety about this Directive, France has even, in great haste, included a few small pension funds in the first pillar. In the corridors, it appears that Member States know very well that their pensions are not sustainable. But with the elections just around the corner, the P-word has become taboo. However, their citizens have known for a long time what the score is.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK, the Netherlands and Ireland consider the events that are unfolding in countries such as Germany, France and Italy with suspicion. According to the Treaty, we do not carry each other’s debts. A naïve thought. If three major Member States, due to huge budget shortages, lay claim to the lion’s share of the capital market, the interest rate will increase accordingly in the three Member States that have provided for old age, simply on the basis of the law of scarcity. Inflation will rise, our carefully saved pensions will melt away quickly, and in so far as they are welfare- and inflation-proof, they will get us into major difficulty.</p>
<p class="contents">Government leaders have put pensions on their agendas. Member States have followed suit and monitored each other. That is anything but sufficient. We must be far more critical of Member States which do not make sufficient provision within their national debts and budgets for dealing with demographic problems. Those problems will not only affect pensions, but will also dominate labour markets and the health and building sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I should like to ask you how long it will be before the generation of Europeans that work where work exists can have portable pensions? It is precisely those people that we need in order to moderate wages in the euro zone and maintain our export position accordingly. We must not penalise but reward these people for their mobility. Help has now been given to financial markets. All that remains is to help the people. What are your plans in that connection? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not be part of that majority. I believe that the Commission's proposal and also the report imply a continuation of the fundamental change in European retirement provision systems and also in social security in general. By that I mean a move away from legal systems based on solidarity and towards private capital-based systems.</p>
<p class="contents">My criticisms relate above all to two issues. The first is this: are occupational pension schemes in the EU to be subject to Community-wide competition? I have certainly learnt a great deal over the last ten years about competition and what it can achieve, but no one can convince me that an issue as fundamental as social security provision in old age should be subject to competition. There are three specific problems here. The first is that there are no binding rules governing the security of contributions paid in. Secondly, I believe that the supervisory arrangements are inadequate, and, thirdly, there is the fact that in your report, Mr Karas, there is the additional option of an occupational pension being paid out by way of a lump sum. That implies enormous risks in old age.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major problem is this one-sided orientation towards financial markets. Everything that can be said has already been said about that. As I see it, this has more to do with the present and future of Europe's capital markets than it has with the future of pensions. The scope for maintaining and updating legal pensions systems based on solidarity has not been used to the full in any Member State of the European Union. However, what we really need is European coordination of occupational pension systems, as is already the case with legal pension insurance systems. That problem has not been solved here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To this end, and with a view to removing any obstacles which could be raised by the Council, I have presented two amendments to resolve a problem, a Spanish problem, but one which also affects other nationalities. I will put it in Aristotelian terms. Major premise: in Spain there are funds without legal personality, established for the payment of retirement benefits. Minor premise: these funds are administrated by certain entities which do have legal personality. Conclusion: these entities must be subject to the same conditions and requirements as bodies which play identical roles in other countries and which do have legal personality. Mr Karas and I have prepared amendments which he will lay out tomorrow orally, which I hope will solve this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue I would like to refer to has been mentioned by some speakers; it relates to the fiscal problems raised by these funds. The proposal for a directive does not say a word about it, because that is not its purpose. There is a Commission communication of 19 April which deals with the problems caused by fiscal obstacles for crossborder pensions. The most important of these problems, which is in third place chronologically, relates to situations of double taxation or non-taxation when there are differences in the tax systems, as is the case within the European Union. The solution, according to the communication itself, is the harmonisation of rules on pensions; nevertheless, this committee desists from this audacious route and prefers to use the current rules, which – in my judgment – will be insufficient. I know that the Commissioner will ask me to approach the States, but I only have a voice in this Parliament and only he can be my interlocutor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To use arguments related to demography and what the report refers to as the ‘constantly increasing life expectancy in conjunction with low birth rates’ equates to deceit if the considerable increase in the profitability of work is also concealed.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that every worker is increasing their level of productivity, the same number of working people produces more than enough to improve their own standard of living and to guarantee a comfortable pension for three or four times as many pensioners as was possible 25 years ago. If this increase in production capacity were not entirely channeled into profits for the privileged few, society might be able to ensure that all pensioners were paid a full salary, without having to force them to work longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Your economy turns everything into goods, including the pensioners that you wish to hand over to the finance sharks but, in the same way, it is the working class pensioners who are worn out from working that you are turning into goods, and this is appalling. The inability to ensure that old people live a retirement that is free from material concerns is one of the most striking examples of a self-indulgent society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, we disagree not only with the proposal for a directive but also with the report itself, which seeks to reduce to a minimum the prudential rules liberalising the procedures and the investments of funds in more volatile financial instruments, thereby supporting risk capital, which, in the current climate of financial speculation, is a serious risk for workers’ rights. This situation is particularly serious for Portugal because it could undermine the Portuguese prudential rules, specifically the mandatory investment of 50% of professional pension funds in public stocks, as well as putting unacceptable pressure on the capitalisation funds of the public social security system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to congratulate Mr Karas and his team for the seriousness and quality of their work. Their work has been welcomed by many speakers tonight, a sign that his work is welcomed by almost everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Karas' report proposes many amendments to the Commission's proposal. It is quite unusual to have over 100 amendments to a proposal for a directive which contains only 20 articles. The average is five amendments per article. It is quite unusual and a sign of the complexity and sensitivity of the issue. It also confirms the importance which the European Parliament has attached to that matter. The hearing organised by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 6 February was certainly most helpful in that it collected the views of the beneficiaries, industry and supervisory authorities. I am particularly pleased to note that the European Parliament agrees with the basic philosophy of the Commission's proposal. That proposal seeks to achieve – as is well known – the twin objectives of, on the one hand, a high level of protection for beneficiaries and, on the other, the affordability of pensions. It establishes minimum, but nevertheless stringent prudential standards and proposes a qualitative approach to investment rules. That has been discussed by many Members in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">These common prudential standards would permit cross-border membership of pension funds and allow an institution in one Member State to manage company pension schemes in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I come to the specific amendments and give the Commission's opinion on them, I should like to reply to a question put to me by Mrs Peijs. It concerns the transferability, or portability, of pensions. Transferability must basically be governed at a national level. However, for the time being, some Member States do not regulate, allow or enable the transfer of pension rights between the various providers of second pillar provision, even within their own territories. The reasons for that state of affairs are related to very complex tax, social and legal provisions. This is a crucial element that needs to be addressed to facilitate the free movement of workers within an internal market. The Commission has therefore planned an initiative on the portability of pensions which we hope will be proposed before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to give the opinion of the Commission on the specific amendments. The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 7 (in part), 8, 10, 16, 17, 25 (in part), 28, 55, 63, 65, 66, 82, 84, 91 and 92. The Commission can also accept the spirit of Amendments Nos 15 (in part), 29, 33, 35 (in part), 36, 37 (in part), 38, 39, 40, 43, 46, 47, 52, 53, 54, 62, 67, 68, 69, 71, 72 (in part), 77, 78, 80, 85, 86, 87, 89, 93, 94, 95, 112 (in part), 118, 131 and 132. But the Commission is regrettably not in a position to accept the other amendments which, for the most part, aim at widening the objective of the directive. The directive which the Commission has proposed has a limited ambition, namely the creation of a prudential framework with stringent prudential standards to ensure security and affordability and allow for mutual recognition. The directive is not designed to interfere with the way in which Member States organise their pension systems, the extent to which they wish to rely on state pensions and encourage the use of funded pension schemes, as long as the Treaty rules are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">In that regard, and in accordance with the approach taken in most other Community legislation adopted in the financial services field, the directive cannot regulate the products offered by pension funds, nor can it define the precise arrangements for the payment of benefits which are often dependent on national tax, labour and social law. Cover of biometric risks, in particular of longevity, is an important aspect of the fight against poverty and insecurity among elderly people. But this directive should not stipulate how and to what extent benefits ought to be paid out or which biometric risks need to be covered by the institution.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the reasons why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 5, 11, 12, 18, 19, 20, 41, 48, 98, 106, 108, 114, 115, 121, 125 and 126. In the same spirit, the directive should not interfere with the way in which the Member States organise the governance of pension funds. Involvement of social partners in the management of a pension fund is an issue which is sometimes enshrined in national and social law. That is something that cannot be imposed in all Member States by means of a directive. Therefore the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 6, 21, 49, 50, 61 and 101.</p>
<p class="contents">Some amendments refer to the need to tackle fiscal barriers as a necessary complement to this directive. Indeed Mr García-Margallo y Marfil put a question to me on that aspect of the directive. As you know, the Commission has recently adopted a communication on the tax aspects which calls for the elimination of unduly restrictive or discriminatory tax rules. The tax and prudential aspects of the crossborder provision of pensions are complementary but need to be dealt with separately. That is why the Commission is not in a position to accept Amendments Nos 30, 31, 32 and 117.</p>
<p class="contents">The same comments could apply to the problems linked to the transferability and portability of pension rights to which I referred a little moment ago. That is a crucial aspect of the creation of an internal market for pensions and for cross-border labour mobility. I have said it before and I repeat it now. But it does entail very complex tax, social and legal considerations and that makes it impossible to cover this element under this directive. We will be speaking later on this year or early next year about the Commission initiative in this respect. The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments Nos 7 (in part), 26, 56, 57, 58 and 74.</p>
<p class="contents">The qualitative approach to investment and technical provisions is based on the assumption that Member States must keep the option to have more detailed rules. Supervisory practices and traditions widely vary from one Member State to another. This restricts the degree of prudential harmonisation that can be attained. Some flexibility must therefore be left to the Member States to introduce more detailed requirements at national level. That is especially true as regards the calculation of technical provisions and investment. The same argument applies to the way in which supervisory authorities organise their work, especially for the registration and authorisation procedures. That is why the Commission cannot accept the following amendments: Nos 22, 23, 24, 25 (in part), 27, 42, 44, 45, 51, 59, 60, 64, 72 (in part), 73, 75, 76, 79, 81, 83, 88, 99, 100, 102, 103, 104, 105, 109, 110, 111, 113, 116, 123, 124, 127, 128, 129 and 130.</p>
<p class="contents">A few amendments concern the scope of the directive. Institutions that already benefit from a single market framework should not be covered by this directive, with the exception of life assurance companies for which Member States must retain the option of applying this directive for their activities that are linked to pension provision. In the same way, and in order to facilitate supervision in those Member States with tens of thousands of institutions, it is important for them to keep the option of excluding them from the scope of the directive, and that is why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 9, 13, 14, 15 (in part), 34, 35 (in part), 37 (in part), 107, 119, 120 and 122.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the directive creates the right framework for the cross-border management of pension schemes. In the case of cross-border activity, the scheme must be run in conformity with the social and labour legislation of the country where the sponsoring company is established. Supervision of compliance with this law is carried out by the competent authority in the host country. Moreover, to make this mutual recognition effective, an effective system of exchange of information and correct enforcement of the directive must be put in place as recommended by Parliament. But this ought to be done at the initiative of the Commission. Those are the reasons why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 70, 90, 96, 97 and 133.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude with the following remarks. This proposal is an essential element of the whole strategy for the sustainability of our pension systems. It allows pension funds to take full advantage of both the euro and the single market and it makes sure that these funds operate as efficiently and as safely as possible. The ball is now in the Council's court. I hope that a political agreement in Ecofin is achieved in the not-too-distant future. That is essential to demonstrate our political will to respect the commitments made by the European Councils in Lisbon and Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">In concluding I would once again like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Karas, for the excellent work he has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
