<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cabrol </span> <span class="bold">(UPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin by briefly outlining the background to this matter. During its sitting of 11 March 1998, Parliament delivered its opinion at first reading on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision adopting a programme of Community action on pollution‐related illnesses. I would point out that the purpose of this programme is not to take direct action to combat the emission of pollutants, but to review existing knowledge by collecting all available data on pollution‐related diseases and to list the pollutants concerned with a view to planning preventive action. The programme is aimed at the Member States, which must collect the data, and at the people of the European Union so as to enable them to protect themselves as well as they can from pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of first reading, Parliament tabled a number of amendments which the Council considered before presenting a common position. The President of Parliament announced that he had received this at the sitting of 18 June 1998 and, on the whole, the Council"s common position seemed satisfactory. Nevertheless, Parliament adopted 14 amendments to that text. By letter of 18 December 1998, the Council announced that it could not approve all of Parliament"s amendments. Therefore, the President of the Council, in agreement with the President of Parliament, convened a meeting of the Conciliation Committee to be held on 4 February 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The conciliation procedure was relatively difficult because the Council did not show any particular interest in the programme. Nevertheless, following three sets of tripartite talks with the Austrian and German Presidencies, Parliament"s delegation was satisfied with many of its amendments, which we shall group together according to their objectives. As regards the three amendments on strengthening the follow‐up of the programme, two were accepted, guaranteeing the programme"s continual assessment, the drawing‐up of a Commission report during the final year of the programme, along with actions being planned for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The extension of the scope of the programme through a policy of prevention and increasing awareness of the risks was also accepted, as was the issue of complementarity with other health programmes, and an annual report on this subject must be provided by the Commission. Moreover, the Council approved the principle of public information, admittedly by means of professionals, but it included some very important points, such as the risk of pollution on foodstuffs. The conduct of epidemiological studies was approved and, finally, certain parts of the Council"s text which were incomprehensible were clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards comitology, a compromise made the recital more acceptable and easier to understand. Unfortunately, a number of amendments were not accepted, in particular, the amendment on the prevention programme for pollution‐related allergies. More importantly, Parliament"s delegation noted that the Council was unwilling to give way on the budget for the programme. We had asked for ECU 7 million instead of ECU 3.9 million. It became evident that, in view of the negotiations on Agenda 2000, several Council delegations had been instructed not to make any concessions on the budget. Whilst regretting this situation, Parliament"s delegation accepted the amount specified in the common position, subject to a joint declaration by the three institutions relating to the Commission proposal for the adoption of a new framework programme in the field of public health after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. The declaration reads as follows: ‘The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission declare that, among the priority issues to be addressed within the framework of the future programme on public health, they will pay particular attention to rare diseases and pollution‐related diseases and will duly take account of the budgetary implications."</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, our delegation welcomes the outcome of the conciliation procedure on this programme, which, along with that on rare diseases, is the latest in a series of public health programmes. As a result, we recommend that Parliament adopt the legislative decision in accordance with the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee.</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liese </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like, also on behalf of my group, to express my thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr Cabrol, for leading the negotiations. I believe this subject – the link between pollution and health – is an important one. It is also an issue which greatly concerns the people of Europe, and I do not believe that it is simply a question of exaggerated fears.</p>
<p class="contents">Pollution has repercussions for health, and we must focus more closely on this. This programme can make only a modest contribution, however. It cannot solve the problem of pollution‐related illnesses; it can merely develop strategies or help to develop strategies. For this reason, our group, unlike the Commission and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, agreed from the beginning that we immediately need an integrated programme that includes all aspects of public health and also this programme. At first reading we were therefore against a five‐year period and in favour of a three‐year period. However, we did not agree that funds should be cut in the way that was unfortunately proposed and ultimately implemented by the Council of Ministers, as with slightly greater resources we could have done more in the first three years, including preparing for a comprehensive health programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret especially that the specific measures such as in the area of allergies were deleted from the annex, and my group and I regret in particular the fact that self‐help groups were no longer expressly mentioned, as I believe that we would have genuine added value if the European Union supported self‐help groups and exchanges between them, but this is unfortunately no longer referred to in the programme. However, I would call upon the Commission, within the scope offered by the programme, to support those self‐help groups which are committed to pollution‐related illnesses and to combating these illnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important to me and to my group that this programme should not merely produce figures that are put to one side and forgotten, as it is all very well to collate data at European level but none of this is of any use if we do not take concrete action. The Commission and the Council of Ministers have in the past been too hesitant. For example, in terms of car exhaust emissions Parliament had to force through the introduction of strict standards and ensure that the ozone problem was really approached effectively in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must also take health aspects into account as part of the CO<span class="sub">2</span> question, as illnesses that have to date existed only in the tropics will appear in Europe as a result of global warming, and there will also be other problems. We must also take concrete action in the area of consumer health protection if this programme is to serve any purpose. We must include the recommendations that are developed from this in our legislation in other areas too.</p>
