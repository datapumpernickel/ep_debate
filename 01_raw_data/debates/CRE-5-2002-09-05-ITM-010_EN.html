The fact is that the situation there is getting worse and the European Union's actions to date have clearly been ineffective. They are not being pursued with sufficient determination or vigour. The European Union sends diplomatic missions to southern Africa but they come back empty handed and leave behind no impression that action against Zimbabwe is a high priority and a determining factor in the overall approach to southern Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear: the issue is not the rights of white farmers, it is the rights of all of the people of Zimbabwe. If you are not a card-carrying Zanu-PF member then you are subject to harassment, discrimination, assault, selective starvation policies and murder. How serious does it have to get before effective action is taken?</p>
<p class="contents">President Mugabe has just returned to Harare from Johannesburg claiming support for his land policies. This is a travesty. To quote the opposition MDC, 'Mugabe's land reform programme has resulted in massive environmental degradation, condemned hundreds of thousands to poverty and put six million people at risk of starvation'. That is the reality.</p>
<p class="contents">President Mugabe is a tyrant who has plundered the resources of his country for his own benefit and that of his cronies and who uses the apparatus of the state, including the police, to terrify and abuse his political opponents. Imagine our horror, therefore, when we discovered that Augustine Chihuri, the Zimbabwe police chief who is actually named on the European Union's prescribed list as being banned from travelling to EU countries, was nevertheless in France last week, at an Interpol meeting in Lyon. You might rightly ask what a person like Chihuri is doing as a vice-president of Interpol in the first place, but that is a different question. The fact is that he should not have been in France and the Council must now take vigorous and effective steps to close the loopholes and galvanise international moves against President Mugabe before the tragedy of Zimbabwe is again overshadowed by other international crises. Let us have some determined action for the sake of all the people of Zimbabwe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is running his country into the ground, the fields are bare, the economy is going downhill, the people are suffering shortages, there is hunger; he gags the press, he terrorises the opposition and his motive is to remain in power. Nevertheless, he still finds sympathy in black Africa. After all, Zimbabwe's neighbours do not want to go to war against her. The farm workers working on the white farms often have to live in unacceptable social conditions. The landless poor want to be given the chance to survive. There is therefore a need to redistribute the land, but this must be done according to legal and transparent procedures, without violence and without corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must therefore play its own role. We have too much respect for the people of Zimbabwe. We cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign country. Our sanctions must affect President Mugabe and his circle, but not the people of Zimbabwe. The people must know that we understand their desire to acquire land and that we want to provide financial support for a legal procedure for acquiring land. We must help Zimbabwe's neighbours to take care of refugees. If we do not do this, we will actually be providing them with an excuse to send the refugees back over the border, where they will once again fall prey to the repression.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the role that I hope this Parliament will support, and that is why we have submitted the amendments. I understand that some people will not support them, but I really do not want to be seen simply as the white man wagging an admonishing finger at Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In his speech in Johannesburg, Mr Mugabe made the unspeakable assertion that these events, which are totally contrary to constitutional law, are even contributing to sustainable development. That really takes the biscuit! It would be hard to top that comment for audacity. It would be good if there were some louder voices in black Africa exposing this for what it really is: a power struggle on the part of a man who has failed in the course of 20 years to push forward a process of land reform that could have been carried out constitutionally. He only took action on this when his personal position was threatened, and only resorted to these tactics when his hold on power was at risk. We must never forget that this action is only partly directed again white farmers. It is above all aimed at Zimbabwe's opposition, which managed, despite enormous repression in the parliamentary elections, to achieve a very remarkable result, and which of course has a great deal of backing amongst the public. That is the real background to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to quote some comments from the South African newspaper the <span class="italic">Daily Newspaper</span>, because it is one of the voices in a country which is, after all, our ally, which is important. It has criticised the way the Mugabe Government has carried out land reform as brutal, and as a means of bringing production to a standstill, which is futile. This paper has pointed out that Mr Mugabe is attempting to propagate a myth when he says he has the backing of all Zimbabweans. We know after all that there is a strong opposition and that it is not therefore legitimate, and I am quoting now, to talk about 'my Zimbabweans and my Zimbabwe', while ignoring his many opponents, and that Mr Mugabe is creating a false impression when he alleges that Zimbabwe is, as it were, his property. But as far as I understand he is in the process of selling off that property to his own family, so that the occupation of land is being misused to bestow gifts on his family members.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, the European Union should be willing to support a legal and constitutional process of land reform, but it should not support such machinations. We have to say that very clearly to our partner countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just listen to this: 'The game we are going to play needs music,' the Zimbabwean police agent told the 12-year-old girl at 10 o’clock at night. But when he threw a mattress on the ground, it became clear that he had something other than a game in mind. For the next four hours, the girl’s mother and her nine-year-old and seven-year-old sisters were forced to continuously sing the praises of Robert Mugabe and watch while the undernourished Dora was raped by a gang of five so-called ‘war veterans’ and the policeman behind the shack until 2.30 in the morning. 'This is the punishment for those who want to sell the country to Tony Blair and the whites,' they screamed at the terrified girl. Dora was abused because her absent father was an ordinary supporter of the opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the abovementioned tragedy (see the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span> of 25 August) was not an isolated incident. Dora is just one of hundreds of young girls raped as part of a state campaign of systematic political purging of the population. Not to mention the approximately 50 militia camps where President Mugabe’s opponents are locked up and tortured for ‘re-education’, but which are also increasingly being used as rape camps.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, President Mugabe does not seem to be in the least ashamed of this reign of terror. Quite the opposite. For example, take his outrageous performance at the UN Summit in Johannesburg, where this self-made pariah passed himself off as a victim of colonialism who wanted to free his ‘occupied country’ from ‘British colonialism’. The fact that he is allowing half of his 12 million compatriots to starve on account of this non-argument does not bother him in the least.</p>
<p class="contents">Namibian President Nujoma’s active support for President Mugabe and the deafening silence from President Mbeki, the great initiator of the NEPAD programme, which is all about rulers’ responsibilities towards the ruled, is worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to prevent the 'oil slick effect', I call on the Council and Commission to continue to give the crisis in Zimbabwe political priority. Because the fact that according to today’s <span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine</span>, only the US Secretary of State expressly criticised Mr Mugabe’s reign of terror in the plenary assembly at Johannesburg hurt me personally a great deal. Was Europe really silent on this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not he who has driven his own people to starvation, but the neo-liberal development model. It is not he who has crushed democracy, violently intimidated his political opponents and manipulated elections, but the neo-colonial powers in Europe. It is not he who attacks the independent media, but reprobates who are beyond his control. It is not he who allows his militia to rape women who oppose him, but total strangers. And it is not he who withholds food from his political opponents, but the enemies of Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">All this former freedom fighter's political actions now have just one goal: how to stay in power at any cost. No decent person objects to land reform, but every decent person objects to land reform as practised by President Mugabe. Farmers are deprived of everything without any compensation and are forced to flee. It is not the people of Zimbabwe who get the land they are entitled to, but Mr Mugabe’s political buddies. The President was allowed to unashamedly propound misleading political propaganda at the Johannesburg Summit. The so-called smart sanctions against the regime are not being particularly smartly enforced. The penalties must be applied more strictly and the target group must be expanded.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask Commissioner Patten what the position is regarding the promised investigation into the freezing of these men's assets in Europe. It is high time that new, honest elections were held in this country. President Mbeki of South Africa and other leaders in the region must ultimately accept their responsibility and must support the people of Zimbabwe and not a president who neglects his citizens because of his own hunger for power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I tend to get the impression that speeches of this kind are, unfortunately, infectious. I hope that the crass speech by Namibia's President Nujoma in Johannesburg on the same day will not have any political consequences in Namibia itself. Meanwhile, the politicisation of food aid in Zimbabwe is continuing, amongst other things. Maize is being specifically distributed to the party faithful, church food stores are being stormed by the so-called war veterans, and the church has been banned from distributing aid on the grounds that it is creating parallel structures.</p>
<p class="contents">What should we be doing? We should do what we have decided to do. To be precise, I expect that Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister will not be invited to the EU-SADEC meeting of Foreign Ministers in Copenhagen in November, and we should make it clear to our partners in southern Africa that European money is not intended to finance an African renaissance or a new NEPAD programme of African development for President Mugabe and his political allies. We should financially participate in the reconstruction of Zimbabwe and land reform there once Mr Mugabe has gone and within a proper constitutional framework – but not now. If Zimbabwe's neighbours exert pressure in their own interest, because they themselves are suffering from the impact of Mr Mugabe's policies – for example the flow of refugees into neighbouring countries – then we should support them in accommodating refugees, but certainly not now.</p>
<p class="contents">We should make our own policy perfectly clear and bring appropriate pressure to bear on our own Council of Ministers, because I really have the impression – as a number of Members have already said – that this is not really being given priority, and that no very clear statement was made about Mr Mugabe in Johannesburg. That is why I hope that we will at least take a hard line in relation to the meeting in November in Copenhagen. Our partners in southern Africa will then have to decide for themselves if they want to show solidarity with Mr Mugabe or with the people of Zimbabwe, and join us in the dialogue to put an end to this situation.</p>

It is an appalling litany of crimes against humanity. President Mugabe is bereft of principles, devoid of any sense of justice, his regime sinks to unimagined levels as each day passes. He has no respect for human rights, minority rights, international law or international opinion. He is a vile despot and we must cease all links with him and his regime.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Van Orden said, we must hit Mr Mugabe and his regime where it matters most, i.e. in the pocket. There must be an end to international trade and effective freezing of the bank accounts of Mr Mugabe and his entourage. Further financial and targeted sanctions must be vigorously imposed. At the same time, we must aid and support those African states which take similar punitive actions against the Mugabe regime.</p>
<p class="contents">The great sadness in all of this is the effect it is having on the citizens of Zimbabwe, whose only crime is to have Mr Mugabe as their president. Let us target Mr Mugabe, not the citizens of Zimbabwe, and let us ensure that our actions are effective and not merely international window-dressing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the pretext of land reform, and completely illegally, he is waging vandalism pure and simple, but also intimidation and the most brutal violence; atrocities are being perpetrated against white farmers, and against black farmers too, with whom they work and whose situation continues to deteriorate.</p>
<p class="contents">We already know what the outcome of the situation will be. President Mugabe’s militia, spurred on by envy and a taste for pillaging, are forcing white farmers into exile, at best. Their departure will spell the end of farms, famine for 12 million inhabitants of Zimbabwe and widespread poverty. But the icing on the cake is that even here there will be support for holding the West responsible for this situation and this poverty. We have already seen this happen in Congo, Algeria, Angola and Mozambique. This has happened in several African countries whose leaders very recently applauded Mr Mugabe in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this situation, I do not know whether we can do anything for the people of Zimbabwe, but we must at least have the honesty to say to the leaders of these countries that the primary cause of their underdevelopment is nothing to do with the western world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I was my own country's Overseas Development Minister in the 1980s I visited Zimbabwe frequently in the years after its independence. I recall the hope with which Zimbabwe set out on its own road as a sovereign country and how blessed it had been by the Almighty with food and other resources. I can remember, for example, during a famine in Mozambique, purchasing food aid in Zimbabwe for dispersal in Mozambique. Recalling all that it makes me even more sad when I look at the situation in Zimbabwe today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has, as Parliament knows, suspended official development assistance to Zimbabwe since early 2002. We remain deeply concerned regarding the grave deterioration of the human rights situation in the country. The International Crisis Group, which is an admirable organisation that reports regularly on trouble spots around the world, recently described Zimbabwe as a country in freefall. That is no exaggeration of the position. We, in the Commission, will contribute to support any peer pressure that Heads of State in Africa, and southern Africa in particular, may put on the Zimbabwe Government to respect the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement, such as human rights, the rule of law and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say in passing, and this is not irrelevant to the points made by Mr Van Orden, that I wish we had recently seen more evidence of that sort of peer pressure in southern Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The political situation in the run-up to the local elections due this September continues to be tense, and the deadline for eviction orders for 2 900 white farmers to leave their properties expired on 8 August 2002. The Commission is therefore continuing to contribute to projects which directly support the population in the field of democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law, and the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights includes Zimbabwe as a focal country.</p>
<p class="contents">The food crisis in Zimbabwe is the worst in southern Africa. There are credible reports of extensive politicisation of the Government of Zimbabwe’s own food supplies. I am sure many Members of Parliament will have seen reports of Zanu-PF supporters saying to the people of Zimbabwe that only fools starve. In other words, they have to subscribe to a set of political views in order to get fed. The Commission deplores this. The Commission, for its part, has responded with an estimated 110 000 tonnes of food aid, for a global allocation of about EUR 3.5 million. The food is largely being distributed through the World Food Programme and the NGOs, with extensive involvement of local communities to identify needy groups. An initial EUR 2 million was provided through our humanitarian organisation, ECHO, for vulnerable groups, particularly children and farm workers. A sizeable part of the humanitarian financing decision to be taken shortly for EUR 30 million for the region will go to respond to the emergency in Zimbabwe including monitoring needs and food aid distribution. An additional regional allocation of EUR 30 million within the 2002 programme of cooperation with the World Food Programme will provide food aid assistance in the region, in particular in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that SADC has a leading role to play in the resolution of the increasingly serious Zimbabwe crisis. The Union will seek to ensure an enhanced dialogue with SADC, in particular during the forthcoming Ministerial Conference in Copenhagen in November. It is planned to raise the issue of Zimbabwe as a specific point on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament will know of the targeted sanctions that we have introduced – sanctions which are focused on the leading members of this particularly nasty and deeply corrupt regime, on their travel and on their assets. It is important, as some Members have pointed out, that we should do everything possible to make those sanctions stick. I will certainly report the views of Parliament to Member States on this particular point.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw the attention of Parliament to the recent report of the Expert Panel established by the Security Council on the rape and pillage of the assets of the Democratic Republic of Congo and, in particular, to what is said there about Zimbabwe's role in that systematic pillage. The report itself makes extremely disturbing reading. The report is, in my judgement, something which the international community has to make plain that it intends to do something about.</p>
<p class="contents">President Mugabe and his cronies have wrecked a once prosperous and once stable country. Their record is a deplorable blot on the history of southern Africa. The sooner Zimbabwe is rid of them the better for that wonderful country and the better for its people.</p>
