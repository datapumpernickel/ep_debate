<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Whitehead (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, this is a moment of some importance for consumer protection in the European Union. The institutions of the Union have come together to set out the principles of food law in the shape of a new authority which can safeguard the food we eat and the way it is produced. You cannot have the one without the other.</p>
<p class="contents">To those who say we have gone too fast and that the Commission or the Council are urging us to move too quickly during this presidency, I would say simply that we are repairing the neglect of decades in which the very variety and self-sufficiency of our foodstuffs hid great disasters, from BSE, to dioxins, to some of the scourges of the present day.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the particular task of this Parliament to refine and specify the proposal from the Commission, that is, to remind citizens and stakeholders alike exactly what we are intending to do to safeguard all parts of the food chain, at whatever point we happen to be in it, from primary producers through to ultimate consumers. We all have a stake in the kind of food that is circulated in Europe, how it is produced, how it is prepared and ultimately how it is checked.</p>
<p class="contents">This authority is primarily concerned with food safety. That is why our committee strongly supported the change of title. We believe it is necessary because there must be clear but also limited and targeted ambitions for this authority. They must relate to what it is able to do in terms of its remit and also in terms of its budget, and not in terms of all of the other ambitions that might be piled upon it by those who wish it to do a variety of different things.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything has to be seen through this focus. I would say to some of my colleagues in the committee who moved a variety of amendments aimed at the further restyling of the title of this authority: the priorities are set out in the report as amended. If you want a proper reference to hygiene or to nutrition or to quality or to our affection for traditional foods, as some of the amendments have proposed, my answer would be: look in the report. They are all there in due measure. But they are not there in the title. They are not in themselves the primary function of this new authority.</p>
<p class="contents">I owe a great debt to my colleagues of all parties in the committee. The report was passed in the Committee on the Environment by 40 votes to 0 with 2 abstentions. The large number of amendments which we shall put forward today in blocked groups reflects the degree of consensus that we ourselves reached. Here I also owe a debt to the Commission for its help, to the Swedish Presidency, which has taken this through with a commendable sense of urgency, and most of all to my own parliamentary assistant, Michele Smyth who has laboured tirelessly on all of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to raise some of the salient points about which there will still be argument and upon which a number of the amendments have been based. Should the new authority be appointed on the basis of ability and merit, through a full process of scrutiny, or should it be by the old road of quiet nomination? We go for merit every time. We go for openness. We go for transparency. The Member States will play a full role through the continuum of the advisory forum. They do not need to be in a position where, proportionally, they plant their flags around every seat at the new authority's table.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not think that the authority should be responsible for the rapid alert system. We think ultimate responsibility must rest with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The authority should be financed entirely from the budget, on which this Parliament can share the decisions. The EUR 44 million envisaged is a fairly small sum, compared to other European agencies. It is only one third of the budget which the British Food Standards Agency had at its inception. There are amendments, including some from the Committee on Budgets, which I would support, suggesting that we take in hand the precise financing of this agency ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is about the site of the new authority. There are those who would like it to be determined by codecision involving this Parliament. There are those who think it should be decided ultimately by the Council on a proposal by the Commission with the assent of this Parliament. My own view is that we should have a free vote on this, because it seems to me that those in the House who wish to take the codecision route have a right to vote for it. My own scepticism remains. I think we should take the traditional route, on this issue at least.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend this report to the House. This is an idea which has not so much found its time as found us at precisely the right moment. I hope the House will support it in the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is what we have been telling each other repeatedly for many months now – adding for emphasis that it is high time, after the many scandals of the past, to restore the confidence of the people of Europe in their daily bread, from whatever source it reaches their tables. Every day that goes by without this new authority taking up its duties in the service of food safety is a day wasted, a missed opportunity to protect public health in the European Union. This is why we must expedite our preparatory work. We must ensure that the Food Authority is operational at the start of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for haste, however, must not impair the quality of the legislative groundwork. The European Food Authority requires stable legal foundations, so that it does not become the pawn of any special interests even before it begins its work. For this reason, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to vote with the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and leave the whole Regulation in the realm of the codecision procedure. The mechanism of restricting the European Parliament to a consultative role when it comes to deciding on the seat of the authority is a piece of shoddy workmanship. It also betrays the intention of prompting a bout of horse-trading between interested parties with widely differing motives, which can only be detrimental to our Food Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore put paid to the plans of Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, who has already let it be known through the press that he wants Luxembourg to be given the Food Authority as compensation for the loss of other European bodies. Please vote for Amendment No 215, which seeks to guarantee a uniform legal basis and to preclude the pursuit of extraneous objectives.</p>

We also note that it cannot be funded without a revision of the Financial Perspective or a reduction of other appropriations under heading 3. The amendment has its origins in the Committee on Budgets. It is important for us to make the point that everything we do must be affordable.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, the Environment Committee has chosen not to embrace several of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets. One of these was the time-honoured amendment that the Committee on Budgets keeps tabling for the inclusion of a recital emphasising the indispensability of transparency, scrutiny and compliance with budgetary procedure. Some agencies are still in a sorry state in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Environment Committee has also decided that the authority should be financed from the general budget alone. There is a desire to keep the authority independent. This may be a noble aim, but it is unrealistic. The fact is that we have agencies such as those on medicinal products and standardisation which are financed by means of contributions, and nobody would suggest that they have been infiltrated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets did, however, see a great deal of sense in the proposal that an examination be undertaken after three years to establish whether it would be possible and advisable to levy fees. This means, of course, that a decision to introduce fees was not taken. The proposal that contributions to staff pensions be entered on the receipts side of the Commission budget has also fallen by the wayside.</p>
<p class="contents">Another amendment that was not adopted is our proposed requirement that the Member State hosting the Food Authority should make a financial contribution or contribute some of the land for its headquarters. And the Authority is to present a draft budget each year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report was not straightforward because, although the Commission’s proposal is a good starting document and is full of good intentions, in addition to the enormous number of amendments tabled in it, it takes the wrong approach and contains many ambiguities.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, Article 5 should clearly define the objectives of food legislation and limit them to the protection of public and consumer health and food safety throughout the food chain, without hindering the free movement of agri-food products within the Community, as well as ensuring the competitiveness of the European agri-food industry within international markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Other objectives, such as the protection of the environment and the protection and welfare of animals and plants, are all very laudable, Commissioner, but if they do not affect food safety, there is other legislation which deals with them or which can potentially deal with them. We have just voted, for example, under the urgent procedure, on the welfare of pigs, with the sole objective of increasing the legislative initiatives of the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Authority’s work should focus on risk assessment and scientific advice, which is no small task of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you have said on many occasions that the new rapid alert system is part of crisis management, and that it would be the responsibility of the Commission. However, in its proposal, the Commission proposes that the Authority should have this responsibility, in recital 35, in Article 21(2), in Article 22(h), in Article 34 and in Article 49.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to risk assessment, it should be of a scientific and independent nature. This is the true task of the future Food Authority and I am pleased that Amendment No 123 gives priority to its scientific opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the communication of risk, this should be done by experts, because a communication which is inappropriate for public opinion may create social alarm, as has already happened, and cause significant losses and economic disasters for agri-food sectors throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I hope that the future decision on the headquarters of the European Food Authority will be preceded by a serious debate between our institutions and that it will finally be reached by co-decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Three times we have seen consumer confidence in food safety shattered, which is why this debate is absolutely topical and the decision to proceed immediately with the creation of a European Food Authority is absolutely the right decision.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just that consumer confidence was lost when these three successive crises occurred; we also watched as consumers restructured their consumer habits, we watched as numerous companies which never imagined they would be excluded from the market folded and we watched as several thousand people who were in no way to blame lost their jobs. So it is not just a question of the financial damage sustained by budgets which have to cope with destroying products and animals; there is also a social cost and we must take very fast, very serious action here.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to say that it is imperative that we take account in food legislation of the special nature of traditional products, which are typical of certain areas and places in Europe and which form part of our culture. Finally, the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in this area must be clearly and officially recognised, given that it is these enterprises that produce the high quality goods and create the jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has a major impact on the working conditions of businesses and thus forms the basis of the entire agricultural sector. On behalf of our committee I warmly thank Mr Whitehead for heading the preparation process so well that we other draftsmen were able to take part in the process. I would especially like to thank him for taking into account the amendments of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I would say he has expertly covered everything and even improved the wording of some of the amendments. He has done a great job.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would still like to focus attention on one particular point. The report proposes twelve representatives for the board of the new Food Authority, two of whom would be representatives of the food industry. As directed by the committee, I would like to propose a minor correction to this, namely that one of these representatives should come from the ranks of primary producers. This is addressed by Amendment No 208.</p>
<p class="contents">Without going any further into the numerous, perhaps slightly technical, details proposed by our committee, I would like to thank Mr Whitehead. I also hope that this legislative proposal is quickly adopted and implemented. One part of this is starting the work of the Food Authority. We can delay this no longer. The Gothenburg Summit must reach a quick decision on starting up this authority as otherwise the citizens’ faith in it will be undermined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst doing so I stress that it is imperative that the specific characteristics of the fisheries and the aquaculture sectors are taken into account. These sectors present quite different questions from the general food industry categories and the challenges raised by recent problems in fisheries, including infectious salmon anaemia, amnesic shellfish poisoning and dioxins, require industry-specific measures. Moreover, adequate consideration must be given to the special needs of the peripheral communities, such as those in Scotland and other fishing nations which fisheries support.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Committee on Fisheries supported my amendment introducing a new recital on traceability. The very nature of fisheries has implications for traceability. There are numerous potential difficulties which the Commission must ensure are catered for, taking into account different methods of catch, where fish are caught, where they are landed and also problems associated with black fish.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I felt it was essential that the composition of the management board ensures a balanced representation of expertise covering all relevant sectors involved in food production, distribution and animal feed and including, in particular, fisheries. It is regrettable that neither of these priorities were taken on board by the committee responsible. I would urge the Commissioner to take them into account. Please note that I am not suggesting increasing the size or changing the method of appointing the board, merely that the relevant expertise should be included.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome, however, amendments which follow the gist of my opinion, redefining the definitions of food unfit for human consumption and contaminated food in Amendments Nos 43 and 44, as they are more in line with the policy the Commission has pursued in the wake of the outbreak of infectious salmon anaemia.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Committee on Fisheries endorsed Amendments Nos 35 and 51, which take into account the distinct needs of the aquaculture sectors and, in particular, the amendments that address concerns which have been voiced about the development of genetically modified fish, to prevent them from entering the food chain through the back door via third-country imports. I would therefore urge the House to support these amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bowis (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, there are two key reasons for action in this field. Firstly, we are mutually dependent on each other for the safety of our food and drink. Food is a single market and food safety is a public health issue. Each country cannot send its food and farming police to sample the corn, chew the cattle and spot-check the vines in every other country. We rely on common standards upheld by consistent levels of inspection, assessment and enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the public has lost confidence in the old national and European food safety systems; after the scandals and scares about olive oil, wine, mineral water, beef, eggs, poultry, milk, e-coli, listeria, salmonella, dioxins, hormones and GM foods – and the list goes on. The public wants to be reassured that the long road from seed or stable to market, supermarket, processing plant, oven, fridge and table is as safe as can reasonably be expected. They want safety assessment that is neither conducted behind the closed doors of the Commission nor tainted by producer or pressure group interest.</p>
<p class="contents">So just as when my report, at the White Paper stage, demanded a system based on science and focused on safety, again we say right across this House: keep the food safety authority slim, transparent, independent and dedicated to assessment of food safety risk and to recommendations as to what action, if any, should be taken. Do not roam down the lanes of healthy eating or comparative diets, however important in health promotion work such routes may be. Keep the word safety in the title of the authority to give a clear signal as to its purpose and methodology. Be, and be seen to be, independent of any one Member State and of the Commission, so do not have a board that allows each country to have a place on it. Keep the number to 12. Do not place the EFSA in any building or venue that has close connections with the institutions of the European Union. Appoint the director of the board after open competition and a parliamentary hearing. Account to Parliament annually for the stewardship of the remit. Publish without delay the conclusions and any minority conclusions of the board on any assessed risk, and hold meetings of the board in public. Attach the food safety bodies of Member States to the authority through an advisory committee comprising the national directors of such bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend this report and I commend the rapporteur for a job well done, not least because of the inter-party and inter-country cooperation and discussion throughout. As a result the amendments in committee, which will in due course be largely subsumed in composite form, can nearly all be supported. To the Commission and the Council I would say: note the strength of unity in this Parliament on these key issues; cooperate with us in partnership and the beneficiaries will be the European consumers in every Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to emphasise the unanimity in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that food crises within the EU have meant that people are worried about what they are eating. At the same time this has led to a focus on food and agriculture policy. Now we have to quickly get this new system up and running – this is incredibly important. If we have open borders, which we are to have within the Union, and a free flow of goods, it is naturally important that food can also flow freely. However, this must <span class="italic">not </span>of course mean that illnesses and disease also flow freely. Naturally, a common system must not mean that regionally produced food is not permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the entire chain of measures, we can see that we will need scientific advice, risk assessment, risk management and control, including control of the control bodies in the Member States. Possibly in the future it will also be necessary to introduce sanctions. This new authority will not be able to achieve all this but it will, above all, provide new, increased strength at the beginning of the chain in terms of scientific advice and risk assessment. We already have the Food and Veterinary Office<span class="italic"> </span>in Dublin, which plays an important role in terms of risk management and control. It is now necessary for cooperation between these two authorities to be developed. In the long run I do not believe that the European Union will escape, we must have a sanction system at EU level. However, this can only be addressed by the Commission. It is important that we continue the work such that it becomes even more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an incredibly important step towards obtaining safer food, which we must take quickly. However, once this step is taken, the issue must not be forgotten. Instead we must develop it further and improve the system even more in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Whitehead has managed, in a balanced report, to expertly combine the many opinions which are around in our Parliament on the establishment of a food authority. I should like to thank him for this. I would thank him for his willingness to listen and his positive attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is based on a whole set of keywords. First of all, there is safety. The title has been made more specific: the European Food Authority is now the European Food Safety Authority. This immediately clarifies the key function of this new institution. Secondly, quality. The emphasis is placed on food production of higher quality. Not quantity, but quality must from now on be of primary concern. Thirdly, maintaining the cultural diversity of food within the European Union. Local and traditional production should not fall victim to European legislation. Fourthly, traceability, transparency of products and increasing producer liability. Fifthly, independence. That means that the European authority may only be financed by means of Community funding. Sixthly, the precautionary principle must apply to any discernible risk. The European Food Safety Authority will not become an unwieldy giant but will hopefully soon provide us with sound and reliable scientific advice. With regard to the Management Board, my group insists, however, that a minor increase from 12 to 16 members be permitted. Indeed, we are of the opinion that primary producers, farmers and fishermen, should be better represented on the Management Board. Finally, my group also supports the view that the ultimate responsibility of a rapid alert system should be with the Commission. After all, political responsibilities can never be shirked, as has unfortunately happened all too often in recent years, both within the EU and in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The BSE situation in particular demonstrates how important it is to be able to depend on independent research into food resources, research that is geared to the long-term acquisition of knowledge. Highly complex though the proposal for the creation of a Food Authority may be, the thing it lacks most is a wealth of ideas. I am convinced that the selection of tasks for the new authority from the many sound proposals can only be made in accordance with the latest research findings from the national establishments.</p>
<p class="contents">Current food legislation is undoubtedly complicated and will surely not improve if its refinement is entrusted to lawyers alone. For that reason, I believe that the necessary funds should be allocated to the budget on the basis of a scientific needs assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for the creation of a Food Authority already has a head start, because the bodies representing the farming community and the food industry accept the need for such an authority and support its creation, which undoubtedly augurs well for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who deal with livestock and the foodstuffs that are derived from them need a lobby which, in the context of the continuing globalisation of food markets, can make a convincing case for their products and, above all, can protect them from misguided policies. Satisfying the exacting demands that society makes of its food producers is crucial to their success or failure.</p>
<p class="contents">The consumption of meat and meat products is rising slowly, and their prices are developing in line with production costs. Consumers require comprehensive information about the processing and the nutritional value of meat and meat products. I am one of those who believe there is still a great deal of work to be done here, for there are many who have relapsed into a blinkered supply-and-demand view of food policy and are unable to look beyond the shop counter.</p>
<p class="contents">Meat will play a major role in the months and years ahead – and rightly so, in my opinion. The traditional planning of menus from a shopping basket of fruit, vegetables and meat provides a far greater volume of healthy nutrients than ready-made convenience foods.</p>
<p class="contents">But what is a fair price for healthy food? Two thousand years ago, Hippocrates said that food should be our medicine and medicine our food. I believe his precept holds good today, and I would answer my question by citing the need for prices to reflect quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues of ecology and ethics play a part in the production of foodstuffs. The ecological and ethical principles that will underlie the work of the Food Authority must be precisely defined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this regard I compliment Commissioner Byrne – who is responsible for this specific area – and Commissioner Fischler. I also extend my compliments to Mr Whitehead on the thoroughness of his report.</p>
<p class="contents">The publication of the Commission White Paper on food safety and the proposed establishment of a European Food Authority marks a new era in food production. From now on every link in the food chain will become an integral part of the production process. The end result should put beyond doubt the quality and safety of all food products, and provide the assurances consumers have been seeking and to which they are entitled. Europe has a rapidly growing food sector. The process of adding value to basic agricultural products is supplying consumers with a wide range of quality food. New research in this area will contribute significantly to its future development.</p>
<p class="contents">As employment in the processing sector continues to increase, this welcome development contrasts sharply with the serious decline in family farming and the reluctance of young people to take up farming as a career. You may say that this point is not relevant to this debate, but I put it to the House that unless we can ensure the conformity, viability and profitability of the production base of Europe's food sector, we are unlikely to reach the standards to which we aspire. In this regard the unique role of farmers as guarantors of food security and quality is far too often taken for granted. The Commission proposals concerning the development of food legislation and food safety are positive. In order to ensure food safety, the whole food chain must be flawless and its supervision comprehensive. I fully agree that food must be traceable through all stages of the food chain, from farm to table.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, in our anxiety to safeguard the consumer interest – our main objective – we must also ensure that agriculture is allowed to benefit from the advances in modern technology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as a result of recent food crises, the European consumer has lost faith in food. The key aim of setting up the European Food Authority is to regain that trust. In the Netherlands, roughly the same amount of meat is currently being consumed as in the period prior to the said crises, whilst Germany and France are still facing much lower levels of meat consumption. On the one hand, that illustrates that there is no such thing as a European consumer. On the other hand, we can conclude from this that the consumer’s trust is tied in more with national character than with the setting up of a European Food Authority. The fight over the location of the EFSA, which various Member States would like to host, makes me wonder whether this is primarily a matter of prestige. In this connection, I am not clear about the meaning of the criterion ‘tradition in food safety’.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the risk that the Food Authority might become a bribe to placate consumers, without offering any added scientific value for the national food safety authorities. That is why it is of great importance that a link be established between food production and food safety. As the problem lies with food production, that is where the solution should be found. The upshot will be that European agricultural policy will need a complete overhaul. An agricultural policy must be put in place which enables animal feed to be produced near the cattle reared for meat, so that animal feed and animals need not be transported over long distances. This also reduces the risk of infection. Such a policy ties in with the prevention principle and the proximity principle. Moreover, there is integration, since this policy also benefits the environment and animal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">A related problem which merits our attention is the export of food whereby lower standards are applied than those in the European Union. In practice, countries outside the European Union often cannot afford the luxury of aiming for the safest food levels. Needless to say, we should not simply export food which does not meet our safety standards to those countries. However, exports of a kind which increase food safety in those countries should be permitted. It would, of course, be ideal if, in the European Union and in third countries alike, food were supplied from within the countries’ own territories. Only in cases where this is really impossible should additional trade take place.</p>
<p class="contents">In the outlined policy, there will be no need for the destruction of large batches since, without international transport, the risk of infection is much smaller. In this context, the use of the holding’s own animal feed within the holding can be permitted. After all, a ban would imply the destruction of large quantities of usable food, whilst the chances of lowering the risk are hardly an issue, if at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that risk assessment is a task for the food authority. The political translation of risk assessment into risk management belongs with the European institutions. The Member States need to ensure that the rapid alert system is effective and that the European Commission is informed in good time. Under these conditions, there is no need for all Member States to be on the food authority’s Management Board.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only is a food authority being set up, extremely drastic measures are also being laid down in legislation. In my opinion, drafting new legislation is the wrong reaction to Member States’ not complying with existing legislation. For that reason, priority should be given to setting up independent inspectorates in the Member States which enforce the law locally. And on the basis of a reliable authority, all consumers can acquire confidence in European food. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cappato (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, while complimenting the rapporteur on his work I venture to raise some doubt about the approach whereby, whenever a problem turns up, the response is to create an agency, a body appointed to deal with it or resolve it. Unfortunately, that is the golden rule for the creation and proliferation of bureaucracies. Naturally, we hope it will not be the case of this Food Safety Authority, but every appropriate measure must be taken and great care is needed, because that is precisely the mechanism usually operating inside the European Union. As regards food safety, we know there are enormous political problems inside the Union, because we have seen them with our own eyes, particularly during the food crisis caused by mad cow disease, but not only then. These are political problems that call for political responses about possibilities of intervention and the relationship of powers between the Union and the Member States, and these political responses cannot be discharged simply by creating an authority appointed to provide them.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, let us at least make sure the decision to be taken allows the Authority to operate properly, and for it to operate properly – as others have already said – I believe its purpose must be very precise: it must be clearly defined as food safety. It seems to me less than prudent – and here I am referring to the speeches of some of my fellow Members – to start thinking about extending the purpose and scope of the Authority to include environmental issues and matters relating to traditional foods. These are issues to be dealt with by the market and the Member States. I am of the opinion that this Authority should first and foremost concern itself with issues of food safety and scientific opinions, not, as the text advocates, to avoid contrasting scientific opinions, but indeed, on the contrary, to ensure that all the different scientific opinions see the light of day and perhaps even to allow the democratic assemblies to consider, compare and debate the solutions proposed by science.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore be appropriate to consolidate Parliament’s influence and involvement, from membership of the board of directors to the actual decisions relating to the Authority, both now and indeed later, when the Authority is actually in place.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to comment now on an amendment contained in the report, which states that: ‘in order to encourage respect for EU law, it should only be located in a country within the top half of Member States in terms of the fewest cases outstanding in the ECJ for alleged breaches of EU law’. I think that is a real blunder, and a basic error in the interpretation of the Treaties as well. There are rules laid down for imposing sanctions and monitoring respect for European Union legislation in the Member States, and it would really be an improper use of the Treaties and European legislation to use the location of agency offices as merchandise to be traded between one country and another, with more going to ‘good’ countries and less to ‘bad’ countries with a large number of cases pending before the Court of Justice. The location of the Authority must be based on criteria relating to its activity – that is, the location should be the expression of an agricultural and food culture rooted in that territory – and to its scientific jurisdiction, which relates to foods and food products. In general, locating agencies as prizes to be given to this or that Member State is a dangerous mechanism which binds the agency to the Member State, diminishes its independence and, above all, is a perverted use of European legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was the White Paper on food safety which proposed the creation of the authority which we are discussing here today. Mr Whitehead’s report has the merit of pointing out a certain number of ambiguities contained in the draft regulation, but it does not propose how those ambiguities should be removed. The rapporteur, quite rightly, emphasises the need to draw a very precise distinction between the advisory role of the European authority and the risk-management role which falls to the Member States and the Commission. The rapid alert system should not, therefore, be placed under the control of the authority. Why, then, has the word ‘agency’ been replaced by ‘authority’, which causes confusion and appears to signify that this body plays an executive role, which should not be the case?</p>
<p class="contents">The report also emphasises, rightly, the need for networking between the European authority and the agencies of the Member States, but it remains silent on the subject of how this close cooperation is to be achieved. The consultative forum ought, in principle, to be the means of achieving this cooperation, but how will it work? No specific explanation has been given on this crucial point. We have a remarkable level of scientific competence on food safety available at national level, for example the British FSA or the French FSA. At all costs we must avoid creating a European structure which competes with these national bodies or is redundant in relation to them. The national bodies must continue to supply their input on the assessment side, since this is what will enable the European agency to play its coordinating role, since the European agency has certainly not been given any authority which is superior to those of the national agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the need to work actively to achieve the proposed consistency between the raised European standards and existing international standards, a problem which this report mentions almost as an aside, I also regret the fact that Parliament has not really discussed this vital point in any more detail so as to ensure that our initiatives do not have the effect of penalising European producers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This debate is clearly of major importance to the European citizen. Indeed, European consumers’ confidence in food safety must be restored, and the establishment of a European Food Authority is the first major step towards restoring that confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am referring to the proposals as being “long-awaited”. It is, after all, nearly two years since the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, announced, on taking up office, that restoring the consumer’s confidence in food safety was one of the key priorities. Only now, in June 2001, do we as Parliament get a chance to express our views on the plans. I hope that, despite this, the Food Authority will be able to commence its activities at the start of next year, anyway. The location in which the authority should be based is still to be indicated, in fact. I expect the EP to re-confirm my amendment on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that there has been such a time lapse between the legislative process and the original date when the proposals were submitted, is not down to today’s rapporteur, Mr Whitehead, nor to the rapporteur at the time, Mr Bowis. They have both acquitted themselves of their tasks marvellously.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to make a few observations about the content. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tightened up the proposal, with good reason. Allow me to focus on the powers of the authority first of all. A clear distinction should be drawn between its advisory role and its task of issuing regulations. It is the Authority’s task to outline the risks scientifically and to assess them. That also means, therefore, that it should be the European Commission that ultimately implements the rapid alert system</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the legislation and the package of tasks that is before us are only a first step. I would call for further development in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For many citizens, eating is not just nourishment, it is much more: a conscious choice, linked to quality of life, an act deeply rooted in the cultural and culinary traditions of the regions. The primary and absolute duty of the Union is assuredly to guarantee maximum food safety throughout every link of the production and distribution chains, but its duties also include the protection and promotion of typical regional products, as well as providing accurate information on foodstuffs present on the market, so that the consumer can exercise choice in full critical awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, I feel it is important to stress the major improvements made to the Commission’s proposal by the amendments adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. This applies both to the section on the general principles of the legislation and to that devoted to setting up the European Authority, highlighting the role small- and medium-sized enterprises should be able to play in the promotion of quality production.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to mention the choice of location for the future Authority. We all have our own idea of the perfect location, and drawing up a set of more or less binding criteria is certainly not going to help us resolve the problem, far less deciding on the basis of a league table of good environmental practice. After ensuring the independence and logistic accessibility of the Authority, I think it is important for the location to be chosen on the basis of closer consultation, following the approach used for the European City of Culture. In voting for Amendment No 215, therefore, we call for the co-decision procedure to be applied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in creating the Authority two precautions must be taken: first, bureaucratisation and centralising tendencies must be avoided; secondly, Europe has already been accused of wanting to wipe out typical and traditional products by applying rules on hygiene and health, processing and conservation, right up to the moment of consumption, which are unsuitable, rigid and excessive, valid for the sterile, standardised products of big business but not appropriate for quality products linked to a locality, like those of my own Aosta Valley and the rest of the Alps – cheese, sausages and so on.

<p class="contents">We must remember that this initiative is the result, unfortunately, of a series of repeated scandals connected, on the one hand, with the desire to increase agricultural productivity and, on the other, with the monopoly enjoyed by the major distributors, which have led to health-conscious, industrial farming but have not prevented the development of scandalous trends such as chicken containing dioxin, trafficking in veterinary products of all kinds, and in particular the fundamental crisis of BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">Putting all these things right is one of the main objectives of this agency, in order to safeguard the health and safety of the consumer all the way from the farm to the fork. It must play a double role, on the one hand ensuring safety along the whole length of the food chain, and on the other hand guaranteeing the quality of all products intended for the consumer. In order to do this, it will operate at an earlier stage in the process than the institutions, because every citizen must have the right to healthy, safe food. Moreover, like those in the industry itself, it must be aware of the rules that this implies and of the costs that it represents.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of next year, in order to apply the principles of transparency and completely independent monitoring, the Food Authority will have to propose the principles which this document correctly sets out. It must be able to provide analytical input on any product, including any genetically modified organisms, vaccinations and pesticides which might at any moment enter the food chain. The failure of public health awareness as the only reference criterion has been proved following the scandal of animal meal. Such an agency must be able to set out a list of measures constituting good practice, of labels for products having special local characteristics, and of farm-type qualities, rather than merely industrial standards which cannot prevent either salmonella or alarming epidemics. Its main mission is above all to serve as a coordinator for the national agencies, so as to ensure that they all recognise the same references and so that their role in providing scientific evaluation and preventing risks is sufficiently well publicised.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it will have to require the same controls and traceability rules for all the countries of the Union, whether for their exports, their imports or their own consumption. As for where it should be located, this is of little importance provided that transparency and traceability are observed by everyone concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I do have a few comments to make. I do not think we seriously appreciated just how complicated the circumstances culminating in the scandals which have resulted in today's debate on this new legislation were. We did not seriously evaluate the attitude towards events and developments on the part of senior politicians, technicians and technocrats and high-level departments in the Member States, with their silence, their cover-ups, their misunderstandings, their failure to act and their calculated recourse to free trade. Have we forgotten all this?</p>
<p class="contents">All this has been noted in Parliament's reports and we need to counter it with strong political intervention, with common objectives, common measures and a common policy. And in today's debate you are taking a few steps forward by adopting a few principles and introducing a service. This service is not an authority, it is a sort of intergovernmental consultancy service. Rather than the food "Interpol" which we wanted, all we shall have is advisors. It is not a bad thing, but it does not amount to much. In any event, it is in keeping with the intergovernmental nature of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when it comes to international trade and free trade, then the discussion becomes somewhat obscure. It is not just a question of what we export, it is also a question of what we import when it comes to food safety. We have not yet approved the convention on biosafety and cannot therefore legally counter free trade arguments by citing the principle of prevention without being under constant threat of being taken to the World Trade Organisation. Unless I am mistaken, we are shortly due to debate meat containing hormones from the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">So all this restricts the role of the service under discussion. Despite which, it will be a valuable service. But we need to ensure that it has an opinion, its own opinion, and that it is able to provide information and publish its opinion even when no-one asks for it, especially when it disagrees with those in charge of managing the risks. This could bring a breath of fresh air by improving discussion and public information and will, I think, make those who want a repeat performance of what happened during previous scandals think twice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have one reservation. What will this service be able to do in relation to its national counterparts and in relation to the action programmes introduced to deal – God forbid – with the next crisis which comes along? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The negligence of certain Member States has encouraged, if not aggravated, the impact of these disasters. How can we oppose the creation of a European food agency in the face of the growing concern on the part of consumers, a concern which is exacerbated by the sensation-seeking attitude of the media?</p>

<p class="contents">In this respect, it would be too easy to dismiss the Irish vote, because it is a sign of the aspirations of the people of Europe, and we must not forget that Europe, if it is to survive, must be constructed only with the assent of those people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From this angle, the establishment of a European Food Authority represents the base line, the first step towards bringing protection up to speed and responding to consumers’ demands and also their fears. To make that concrete, the European Food Authority’s operations and mission must cover real detailed knowledge of all the farms scattered across the European Union. Hence a close and positive link with appropriate structures inside the countries of the Union seems essential and fundamental. Furthermore, it is becoming hard to believe that animal health is in any way remote or separate from public health generally. Animal health is therefore a vital issue, but so are healthy vegetables, genetically modified organisms and, last but not least, labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is precisely through the action of the European Food Authority that the European concept of traceability must become reality, and a thread running through every link in the food chain: production, industrial processing and marketing. If we fail to impose this traceability in the service of the citizen, we will inevitably lose a great opportunity for transparency and political action to demonstrate that we are indeed responsive to the demands of our fellow European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What remains is the policy, which is what we have reserved for ourselves, and risk management, in which the European Commission and Parliament must join forces. There is a great deal yet to be done on that front. We must have clear European standards and European measuring methods. The Member States and the Union must have a common system that works. Crises have shown that that is not the case and that the Commission has far too little power on that score. I assume that we will get the Authority on track under the Belgian Presidency but, under that Presidency, we must also take a crucial step forward towards a truly common European policy on food safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have worked unstintingly and single-mindedly to present this marvellous document. I believe that, with this report, we have fired the starting signal for the enhancement of food safety in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur for the specific hygiene provisions, I could only proceed on the basis of clear and firm views, one of which is reflected in the fact that Parliament has never questioned the use of a regulation as the legal instrument. I lay particular emphasis on this, because there are different perceptions within the Council. That is why I wish to re-emphasise that a regulation is the only legal instrument for this and the other five sets of provisions. Nothing else would be acceptable to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulations naturally require extensive amendments to national food legislation, but that, I believe, is the only way to remove inconsistencies and close loopholes. The approach taken in the draft regulation, whereby food producers are to be made more responsible for the safety and quality of their products, is certainly right and proper, but to the same extent more onerous verification duties must be imposed on governments too. This applies not only to the scope and frequency of inspections but also to their quality. The professional competence and background knowledge of inspectors must be improved. This is no job for auxiliary staff, and recent cutbacks in this domain must be reversed.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Food Authority itself, I must stress the importance of a clear definition of its responsibilities. Food safety must be its main concern, and its role must be confined to risk analysis. For this reason we should not include in this regulation extraneous issues such as quality, nutritional value and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The seat of the authority has frequently been discussed. Parliament, whether or not it has codecision rights in this matter, has laid down clear criteria that should be applied, and let me say that we must not allow another dilemma to arise like the one in Dublin, a situation in which an authority cannot operate because the basic conditions are not right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This regulation setting up a European Food Authority will, I hope, help to restore the confidence of European consumers. It therefore seems to me to be extremely important that this authority, which should constitute the mainspring of the Union’s strategy on food safety, can become operational as rapidly as possible, and in any case by the beginning of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is right to emphasise the need to make a clear distinction between the tasks and responsibilities which will fall to the future authority and those which are the responsibility of the Commission. Thus it must be quite clear that, although the authority is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the rapid alert system, in other words that tool which is so essential in risk assessment, it is the Commission, in other words the political decision-making body, which has to retain the responsibility for risk management, in other words it must be in control of the measures to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, it is necessary to state that, although one of the characteristics of the authority must be the scientific competence and independence of its experts, it does not actually have any political legitimacy of its own. In this respect, there are perhaps good grounds for regretting the fact that the name ‘agency’ has been dropped, because it was a better name to describe such a structure, whose powers must be of a technical or scientific nature and must on no account become regulatory or executive. This is why it seems to me relevant, as the Commission proposes, to place this authority under the triple tutelage of the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and in spite of everything, I should like to emphasise, as other Members have done before me, that unless we rethink our options and our common policies concerning agriculture, no authority, however effective, will ever be able to stem the tide of major crises like those that we have experienced recently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today's proposal aims to clarify the EU-wide general principles of food law and I would like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Whitehead, both on his excellent report and on the consensual style with which he has carried out his duties in the Committee on the Environment. I also welcome Commissioner Byrne.</p>
<p class="contents">The integrity of a European food authority will be based on independence and strong scientific leadership in the field of food safety. We must be able to trust those who set out to advise us: Farmers, fishermen, food manufacturers, processors, retailers, government, consumer advisory groups, scientists and ultimately the food safety authority. We must be able to trust them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that we have a body of science as a reference point, whether we are consumers, policy-makers or even contributors to the food chain, and that we know what is an acceptable balance between risk prevention and informed consumer choice. It is all about balance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like briefly to refer to some of amendments that I have tabled to this Commission proposal and I hope they will be accepted here. When we talk about the requirements for food safety it is imperative that we also talk about the responsibility of food producers for this food chain. The Commission has omitted from the legislative text the key first link in the food chain: the farmer or the fisherman. I have tabled Amendment No 72 to Article 40 which deals with responsibility of farmers for food safety and adds a <span class="italic">force majeure</span> defence for phenomena over which farmers have no personal control, for example natural disasters and major environmental pollution. This is not, however, to diminish the primary role of farmers in ensuring the safety of their produce.</p>
<p class="contents">I also firmly believe that for the FA to have the confidence and backing of the people of Europe it is imperative that it operates and communicates in a wholly transparent and independent manner. Risk communication will be a key element of the FA. One only has to look at the BSE inquiry in the UK and the Lord Phillips report which stated that breakdown in risk communication was a major factor in exacerbating the crisis there. I have tabled Amendments Nos 147 and 148 to Article 39 in an effort to ensure that the authority explains its scientific risk assessments to this House, to consumers, to businesses and the academic community. The authority should also meet regularly with the Commission and the Council in order to explain the risk assessments to these bodies and help them make more informed risk management decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, in relation to risk management, the measured and proportionate use of the precautionary principle is a key principle when Europe deals with food scares. I welcome the Commission's balanced proposals on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to refer to two of the controversial issues of the Regulation: the procedure for the choice of headquarters and the criteria for it. The proposed regulation does not name any headquarters or any candidates. Article 63 lays down the criteria to be met by any nominee and also establishes a procedure for that choice. I believe that the rapporteur is right to propose that the decision on the headquarters of the authority should be taken by the Council after consultation with the Commission and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it seems to me inappropriate that, to the criteria of independence and integrity, scientific standards, adequate infrastructures and easy access, from a communication point of view, we should add the criterion that as an essential condition for election as the headquarters the number of outstanding cases of a Member State before the Court of Justice should be taken into account. I would like to know, Commissioner, what you think of this new criterion, which I believe to be discriminatory. It would rule out the candidatures of France, Italy and Barcelona from the outset. I believe that this new criterion makes no sense and is not in accordance with the objective of the future Food Authority which is, above all, health and consumer protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has continued along the wise line adopted by Mr Bowis in his own report. In their proposals the European Parliament has clearly taken its own share of responsibility for restoring the faith of the European consumer and guaranteeing food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important part of the regulation now under discussion concerns setting up the Food Safety Authority. I am particularly pleased that the Committee, on Mr Whitehead’s proposal, decided to repeat the criteria I initiated, which were accepted back in October last year during the reading of Mr Bowis’s report. It should have a long standing tradition in food safety in order to lend credibility to the authority in the eyes of over 300 million European consumers. It should not endanger the authority’s independence and integrity, it should provide a good scientific infrastructure and facilities in the field of food safety. It must have good transport and communications connections. This has a particularly great impact considering that even in October the Social Democratic Group was opposed to the setting of these criteria. Now, headed by Mr Whitehead, they too appear to understand that it is important to establish what we expect of a Food Authority and what kind of criteria we will set for its location. For the benefit of all the citizens of Europe we must hope that these criteria will also be met when the Council reaches its decision on the issue. According to the agreement already entered into by Parliament, proposed amendments which directly support a particular location will not be accepted. This policy should be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would finally like to express my deep regret that the Council does not appear able to reach a decision on this matter sufficiently quickly. This being the case, setting up the authority is at risk of being delayed compared with what was planned. Setting up the Food Authority is a matter in which the confidence of the citizens must not be any further shaken by creating political deals on solutions that have nothing in common or – even worse – by creating the impression that political horse trading is taking place in the Council, which should clearly be an area of politics belonging to the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Food must be of a certain quality, but it should first of all be safe. Consumers must be able to rely on the inspections being adequate. These days, confidence has increasingly become a matter of national concern, and that is, in my view, a step backwards. The internal market is a great good, but it can only function on the basis of common standards and rules, and today sees the laying of the foundations for this. Traceability, liability, responsibility, precaution; they are all essential principles. Producers must be responsible for the highest quality at every stage of the food chain. But responsibility should also be clearly defined. The rapid alert system must remain a political instrument. We must guarantee that food imported from third countries is just as safe as food produced over here, but food safety must not be a cover for protectionism. That requires sound and fair inspections, but also a common and global approach. Emotions can run high where food is concerned. Politicians cannot and may not ignore those emotions, but do need to weigh the facts. The European Food Authority must be a beacon of objectivity, and it must join forces with national authorities, that is obvious. But we should not render the European Authority powerless right from the outset. We do not want a stalemate between the national and European authorities. In the event of a difference of opinion with one or more national authorities, the European Authority must still produce unambiguous recommendations on scientific grounds. The general principles of foodstuffs legislation constitute the building blocks for quality, and that is what we will be further developing in the years to come. Animal welfare should also be brought into the equation, and the quality of our production methods must improve. We should have the courage to bring about true reform of our agricultural policy. Quality and food safety must occupy centre stage in that connection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report met with the unanimous approval of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, something on which I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, for it proves that he has managed to separate the main points and subordinate points convincingly. I should also like to congratulate the Commission, for it has put us on the right track with a very sound proposal. The stakes are therefore high. The objectives are to offer maximum guarantees of food safety and of fair play within the internal market and with regard to imports and exports and, as the previous speaker rightly pointed out, to restore consumer confidence in all products offered within the internal market. The consumer has lost a great deal of confidence. We owe it to the public to provide objective reasons why they should again have confidence. A major factor in that connection will be the authority which the Food Authority acquires, for we can easily call it an Authority but, in the final analysis, it will be up to that Authority to ensure that it can command authority in the eyes of consumers, producers and the national authorities. This must be facilitated by the structure of this establishment, its working methods, the quality of its staff and its independence, but also by its skill at establishing networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this project will be a success. I hope that the Belgian Presidency manages to complete it, as best it can, and I hope that we in Parliament will also have the courage to subject our amendments to the scientific test of this Food Authority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot expect it, however, to eradicate criminal practices, slackness and black sheep; that goes beyond its remit. I have sometimes had the impression in the course of the present discussion that the wheel is being reinvented in the realm of food safety. Not so; let me counter that view by putting it to you that no previous generation in our Member States has ever been able to choose from such a rich variety of good and safe foods.</p>
<p class="contents">Inspections cannot turn unsafe food into safe food. Safe food must be produced. That is why I am in favour of unequivocal and stringent measures. From producer to consumer, from byre to buyer, from pitchfork to table fork, if you like – every link in the food-production chain, be it the initial input by the farmers, the processing of farm produce by the food industry or retail food sales and the preparation and serving of food in restaurants and canteens, etc., should be subject to far stricter control. The traceability of foodstuffs must be guaranteed throughout the entire production chain.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning we are discussing the subject of the food inspectorate, and perhaps we shall be doing so again in the future. We are wondering whether it should be an agency or an authority, where its headquarters should be, where the line should be drawn between its sphere of responsibility and that of the national authorities or how the two can interact. Last but not least, we are discussing the powers of this new authority.</p>
<p class="contents">My constituents will be hoping that this is not just another paper tiger. Let us hope that the rich cultural diversity which is reflected in our European menus will manage to survive intact in conformity with the safety and hygiene rules. I truly wish success to this new institution; may it ensure that we are not caught empty-handed again in the not too distant future when the next scandal comes along. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hunger was, along with war and the plague, one of the three apocalyptic fears that had dotted the history of Europe since the Middle Ages. Times have changed dramatically where hunger is concerned, not for the whole world, unfortunately, but certainly for the Europe of the Fifteen. An abundance of food is one of the great achievements of modern times in Europe, as is much more hygienic food than was available until relatively recently. Nevertheless, the safety and quality of food have suddenly become one of the main causes for concern, fear and uncertainty amongst the sophisticated European consumers. Appalling incurable diseases, against which medicine is helpless, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, are a consequence of the indiscriminate industrialisation of food production, which goes against nature.</p>
<p class="contents">We must put an end to situations like this, mainly by making crucial and far-reaching changes to the European common agricultural policy. The legislation and the strategy that are adopted in the field of food safety are vital for the European Union and for its credibility. These must be one of its main political and legislative priorities. The proposal for a Regulation that we are now considering represents the main pillar of a legislative structure, which is designed to guarantee a high level of health protection and to restore consumer confidence. The most important aspect of this legislation consists of creating an operational European food authority with a high degree of scientific skill and considerable independence. In order to guarantee food safety, it is crucial that there are no weak links in any part of the food chain and that risks are detected in good time. It is crucial that there is rigorous monitoring, from the farm to the consumer’s table. Hence the need for a food safety authority which is prestigious and well respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposals are, admittedly, well formulated. They are positive, useful and well structured and simply require some clarification, as has already been said. We must adopt them as a matter of urgency. There is no sense in maintaining a divided approach, and nor would this do us any credit, for example, on the composition of the management board, on the appointment of the executive director or on its headquarters. Mr Whitehead’s report is balanced and sensible, which is why I shall be supporting it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to stress a different word in the title and that is the word "authority", because it is vital that this is a body to which the rest of the EU can look up. That is why I tabled an amendment in committee about the location of this new authority, saying that "in order to encourage respect for EU law, it should only be located in a country within the top half of Member States in terms of the fewest cases outstanding in the ECJ for alleged breaches of EU law". This went through committee without opposition and I am surprised and a little disappointed that some colleagues today should be upset about this amendment. The point is that certain countries vote for EU laws and then quite simply ignore them. This hypocrisy has to stop. By voting through this amendment now as part of Amendment No 188, Parliament would make clear that such Member States could not expect the benefits of hosting such new agencies if they are not prepared to exercise their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not proposed out of malice. This is not proposed out of mischief. It is proposed out of principle. European agencies are there to be upholders of EU law and to be an example to others, to command respect and inspire confidence. This role would be undermined if the Member States themselves are not seen to be champions of the EU laws they are supposed to uphold.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a chance today, and in the vote tomorrow, to give a very clear signal. What signal do we want to give? Do we want to say that upholding EU laws does not matter or do we want to say it actually matters a very great deal? I urge the House to give a very clear signal, a very positive signal, to vote "yes" to this amendment and for this vote to be clear and unambiguous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Philip Whitehead and the draftspersons Messrs Pesälä, Folias, Hudghton, Kuckelkorn, Pomés Ruiz and Mrs Gebhardt, and their committees for their report on the proposal for a general food law and the establishment of the European Food Authority. I appreciate the excellent work that has been done and would also like to thank all those involved, including my own staff, for the speed this complex proposal has been dealt with. I would also to thank the Members here this morning for their generous remarks in relation to the work undertaken by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is the cornerstone of the European food safety strategy, providing the basic principles, requirements, procedures and organisational structures for the future development of food law and, in particular, food safety. As you will have seen from the proposal, the Commission took careful account of the Bowis report from Parliament on the White Paper on food safety. The draft Whitehead report supports the Commission proposal in general, despite the great number of amendments. A significant number are editorial and do not change the overall meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on some important issues, the report does not support the Commission's objective in relation to the following: the scope of the Authority; the composition of the Management Board; the rapid alert system; procedures in case of diverging scientific opinion; amendments that could prove detrimental to the Community's ability to negotiate in international fora; and some amendments that deviate from the horizontal nature of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a large number of amendments, so without further delay I will address them. Of the 189 amendments in the report of the Environment Committee and the 26 tabled in plenary, the Commission is able to accept well over half fully or in principle. It would be impractical to give you a detailed analysis of each amendment, and so I will focus on the most important issues, particularly those on which the Commission cannot accept the proposed amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Article 95 legal basis for this proposal, which fully engages Parliament in the codecision procedure won my strong backing during the debates here, has received the full support of the Commission and Council's legal services. Hence the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 4 or 209 changing or expanding the legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments refer to food hygiene. We cannot accept these in this broad, horizontal context, which covers not just hygiene, but also contaminants, additives, materials in contact with food and much more. Similarly, Amendments Nos 59 and 72 are too detailed for a horizontal text. We cannot accept Amendment Nos 11 and 202 on concessions for SMEs, as consumers should enjoy the same protection as regards food from SMEs. Nor can we accept Amendments Nos 26, 40, 50 and 193, which extend the scope of the regulation to food quality. This is not the correct legal instrument and other work is being undertaken in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope of the regulation covers misleading and deceptive practices but not financial fraud between traders. Hence we can only partially accept Amendment No 49. We have kept food safety requirements apart from other consumer interests. Therefore we can accept in principle Amendment No 57 – not in Article 8 on consumer interests, but in Article 12, which covers the food safety requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept Amendment No 214 to Article 12, requiring that the calorific value and composition of a food become part of a safety assessment. We do not accept a range of amendments on definitions. Either the horizontal nature of the text is compromised, the proposed change is redundant or inaccurate in relation to the usage of the term in the text, or it is already contained in another definition. We can accept the part of Amendment No 38 introducing distribution, but not the part on placing in circulation. On Amendment No 45 we can accept the change to the definition of primary production, subject to editorial review.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of amendments which could prove detrimental to the Community's ability to negotiate in Codex Alimentarius or cannot be aligned with international agreements to which the Community is already committed. This is the case particularly with those amendments which attempt to rewrite internationally accepted definitions which we have fought to have accepted, or where changes are not in line with the Commission communication on the precautionary principle, as endorsed by the Council and Parliament. For example, Amendment No 53 attempts to rewrite what exists in WTO agreements on those instances warranting a full risk analysis. Neither can we accept Amendment No 54, which would oblige us to accept other international legitimate factors. There are no such factors at this time. Amendment No 52 is also unacceptable, owing to its impact on our international obligations; it is contrary to WTO rights and obligations. Although we can accept the concept in Amendment No 84, it needs to come under Article 5.</p>
<p class="contents">Similar problems are raised by Amendments Nos 55 and 56 on the precautionary principle. We cannot accept Amendment No 55, as it is appropriate to retain some discretion without a mandatory requirement to act and, perhaps, for no measures to be adopted as a satisfactory risk management action. This was part of the Commission's communication, as endorsed by Parliament and Council, and therefore contradicts positions adopted previously by this House. Although many of the points in Amendment No 56 reflect these positions, the text is too detailed and our legal advice is that this would cause problems in a legally binding regulation. We cannot accept Amendment No 63, which requires food control work and surveillance to be kept confidential. Any necessary confidentiality will be covered in the horizontal control text to be proposed in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several other amendments relating to general food law which we can accept in principle and, once reviewed, align with the general principles and orientation of the text. We can only accept the first part of Amendment 61, which makes the legal responsibilities of feed businesses more precise. In Amendment No 69 we can only accept the reference to transport. We can accept the concept in Amendment No 80 that dangerous foods and feeds should not be exported, but I will need to review how this should be drafted. This concept is also found in Amendment No 82, but we cannot accept the part of this amendment which refers to the supplier taking products back, as this confuses the legal meanings of import and export.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 70 and 75 on whistle-blowers are acceptable in principle, but we will consider a more appropriate text. We cannot accept Amendments Nos 48 and 189, which are inappropriate for the date of application of different parts of the text. As regards Amendment No 185, it would not be possible to have a report on the application of the principles of food law, as these will not have an impact for a significant period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept, in principle, Amendment No 47, by extending the definition of the status of production and distribution covered by Chapter II of the Regulation. We can accept, in principle, Amendments Nos 85 and 207 on transparency, while ensuring that the text is fully aligned with the Amsterdam Treaty Protocol on subsidiarity and proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the EFA's scope, Amendment No 87 and related Amendments Nos 88 and 187 are not acceptable, because they reduce the its remit to fields known to have an impact on food safety. A wide remit is necessary in order not to repeat the failure to identify BSE as a risk for humans at an early stage. However, Amendment No 86, which makes it clear that the primary mission of the Authority is food safety, is acceptable. I would like to stress here that the extent of the work of the Authority that is not linked directly or indirectly to food safety was circulated for the financial statement and, in fact, is less that 5%. This brings me to Amendment No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">At this time, we are not in a position to accept the proposed amendment to include the word 'safety'. However, given the strong views expressed in Parliament this morning, this is something that we are prepared to reflect on, reconsider and perhaps take on board.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept Amendment No 91 for operational reasons. Amendment No 195 is acceptable in principle, subject to changes in order to include the plant health issues in relation to harmful organisms in the Scientific Panel on plant protection products.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission now considers that it should remain responsible for operation of the rapid alert system, with the Authority acting as a member of the network, so we are not able to accept Amendments Nos 15, 89, 94, 158, 159, 161, 162, 163 and 169. Subject to editorial review, we can accept Amendments Nos 160, 164 and 166.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission maintains its original proposal, on the composition of the Management Board of the Authority, which very carefully laid down a balanced share of representatives from the European institutions: four from the Commission, four appointed by Parliament, four from the Council and four representing consumers and industry. Our main objective was, and is, to have a small, functional Board which, through the balance of its membership, can be seen to be independent, yet accountable to the Community institutions. For this reason we cannot accept Amendments Nos 17, 18, 101, 194, 208 and 213. Neither can we accept Amendment No 102, which removes the possibility of alternate Board members, or Amendment No 143, which insists that the Management Board shall meet only in public, since this should left to the Board's own discretion.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept Amendments Nos 103 and 105 on the Board. We can also accept Amendment 106, which enables the chair of the Scientific Committee to participate in Management Board meetings provided that the text reads 'may participate', in order to allow flexibility in the administration of the EFA.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 219, 221 and 222 in relation to the renewal of the mandates of the president of the Management Board and of the members of the Scientific Committee are not acceptable, because they are unnecessarily restrictive. Amendments Nos 107 and 220 on the open and transparent appointment of the Executive Director by the Management Board with a hearing in Parliament, is acceptable in principle. I must stress the need to be practical and to ensure that the parliamentary process does not cause delays. In addition, we can accept a number of amendments in principle, subject to editorial review and alignment with other articles. We can also accept the part of Amendment No 134 that makes public the list of scientific bodies competent to help the EFA in its work, although without the suggested deletion that requires the Member States to designate these bodies. The rest of Amendment No 134, which deals with EEA/EFTA countries is acceptable in principle, but should come under Article 48 on the participation of third countries. We can accept Amendment No 113 in part, but the Advisory Forum should not be compelled to meet six times a year. Amendment No 118 is not acceptable, as it removes the possibility for the Authority to refuse or modify requests for scientific opinions. Such flexibility is a critical operational requirement of the Authority. Amendment No 13 is unacceptable, since a request for a scientific opinion during the legislative process should be limited to justified cases – new scientific information – for example – in order to avoid repeated requests on the same topic.</p>
<p class="contents">Risk managers need to be clearly responsible for taking decisions and risk assessors for assessing the risks. For these reasons, Amendments Nos 21 and 212 are not acceptable. Amendment No 92 is, however, acceptable, if modified to ensure that the authority can make recommendations on management options at the request of the risk managers. Amendment No 93 would be acceptable with the deletion of 'for the measures necessary to be taken'. Amendment No 98 is acceptable, in making clear that the authority can express 'independently' its own conclusions and orientations. The rest of Amendment No 98 is covered by Amendment No 92. Finally, Amendment No 97 is not acceptable, since it would involve the authority in risk management.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 23, 153 and 157 are not acceptable, because they remove the possibility for the authority to receive fees. The Commission wants to review this within three years of operation, even though if we agree that it is inappropriate for the authority to charge fees at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 121, 122 and 123 are not acceptable. They remove the procedure applied in the event of a divergence between the Authority's scientific opinions and those of a national scientific body, thereby making the Authority the final arbitrator in science. This is a legal impossibility. In any event, the Article 29 procedure is designed to achieve a result through transparency, and the decision is the risk manager's. Subsequent failure by Member States to comply with any measure brought forward by the risk manager or the legislative authority will lead to infringement proceedings. That, in my view, provides the degree of clarity and sureness that Parliament requires.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept Amendments Nos 135 to 142, 144 and 206, which would improve the transparency of the Authority; however, we cannot accept Amendment No 145 for legal reasons. I cannot accept Amendment No 125, which removes the ability of the authority to collect food consumption data. This is a basic requirement, enabling scientists to assess the exposure of consumers to substances through their diet. Amendment No 126 is acceptable in principle, if changed to ensure that all biological risks that may have a direct or indirect impact on the food production chain are covered.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 174 is not acceptable, since the crisis unit will not be a permanent structure. Amendment No 24 on the emergencies procedure is not acceptable, as a 'serious risk' is the precondition for emergency measures in all existing Community legislation. However, Amendment No 178 is acceptable in principle, in that it takes into account the fact that food aid is already covered by the term 'food'.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments are not acceptable, because they are incompatible with existing Community procedures or important legal aspects, or because they are covered by other legal provisions either in this text or in other Community texts. For these reasons, only paragraphs 6a and 6b in Amendment No 154 are acceptable. Amendment No 155 is acceptable in relation to 'the recommendation from the Council', but not in relation to the discharge given to the Management Board. Amendment No 19 and the part of Amendment No 20 containing the word 'authorised' are not acceptable. Amendments Nos 172 and 173 propose involving Parliament in practical crisis management. This is not, in my view, compatible with its institutional role of control and supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 175, 179, 180, 181 and 182 are not compatible with the comitology procedure and therefore are not acceptable. Neither can we fully accept Amendments Nos 183 and 184. The evaluation commissioned by the Authority cannot address the whole regulation, as it can only be relevant to the Authority. Amendment No 205 is not acceptable, since it is already clear that the authority has right to change its own internal rules. I cannot accept Amendment No 191, as the delay that this may cause would be impractical and may have a detrimental effect on the start date. I cannot accept Amendment No 192, as the Food Authority will not affect the ceiling for heading three of the financial perspective and I draw your attention to the provisional draft budget for 2002, reference PDB 2002, currently under review in Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to address the question of the location of the Authority. Amendments Nos 188, 190, 216, 217, 218 and 223 are acceptable in part. The Commission can agree and accept that the location should be based on the following operational criteria: reasonably rapid and convenient physical access; effective contacts between the authority and the Commission services, especially during food safety crises; cost-effectiveness; and necessary social infrastructure for staff. The other criteria are not acceptable. Neither is the part of these amendments relating to the procedures for choosing the location acceptable. Amendment No 215 is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I conclude, I would like to say something very briefly about references made by a number of Members to traditional foods. This is an issue that I regard as being particularly important. It is dear to my own heart as well as to yours, and is addressed in the upcoming hygiene regulations, where specific reference is made to special treatment in relation to traditional foods.</p>
<p class="contents">So to conclude, I wish once again to thank especially Mr Whitehead for his excellent report and, indeed, for his support. In summary, the Commission cannot accept 100 amendments and they are 1, 4, 11 to 13, 15, 17 to 19, 21, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29, 32 to 34, 36, 37, 39 to 41, 43, 44, 46, 48, 50 to 56, 59, 63, 68, 72, 74, 77, 78, 81, 87 to 89, 91, 94, 95, 97, 99, 101, 102, 117, 118, 121 to 123, 125, 133, 143, 145 to 148, 153, 157 to 159, 161 to 163, 169, 172 to 175, 179 to 182, 185, 187, 189, 191 to 194, 202, 205, 208 to 215, 219, 221 and 222.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Commission can accept fully the following 44 amendments: Amendments Nos 3, 6 to 8, 14, 22, 25, 30, 31, 58, 64 to 66, 71, 79, 86, 90, 103 to 105, 109 to 111, 116, 119, 124, 127 to 130, 131, 135 to 142, 152, 164, 176, 186 and 206. The Commission can accept in part and/or principle 64 amendments, and they are Nos 2, 5, 10, 16, 20, 27, 35, 38, 42, 45, 47, 49, 57, 60 to 62, 67, 69, 70, 73, 75, 76, 80, 82 to 85, 92, 93, 96, 98, 106, 107, 108, 112 to 115, 120, 126, 132, 134, 144, 149, 150, 154 to 156, 160, 161, 170, 177, 178, 183, 184, 188, 190, 195, 207, 216, 217, 218, 220 and 223. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
