<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hatzidakis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking my fellow member, Mrs Isler Béguin, for her work as the initial rapporteur for this report, and to say that I am sorry she was unable to see the report through to the end and that, as chairman of the committee, I had to take over, because the final version of the report does not reflect the rapporteur's views.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject matter of this report is, as I am sure you realise, a real hot potato which has divided public opinion in numerous Member States of the European Union. Nuclear energy alone has divided the European Parliament on other occasions, for obvious reasons. I should like to make it clear from the start, however, that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism was quite right to choose not to use this report, on which it has been working for a very long time, since before the European elections, as a platform for discussing the question of principle, that is, the question of whether there should even be nuclear energy, and to focus purely and simply on the subject of the transport of radioactive material within the European Union. It was right to do so, if, for no other reason than, from a legal point of view, it is not up to the European Union to say whether or not nuclear energy should be used, it is up to the Member States. Rightly or wrongly, I do not intend to go into this now, but that is the fact of the matter. We in the Committee on Transport had no reason to extend the debate beyond our remit; the subject of the report is the transport of radioactive material and that is therefore what we were required to focus on.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said which, we know that, at international level, we have the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has been issuing recommendations on the safe transport of radioactive material – in the form of Safety Standard No 6 – since 1961 and that, although these standards are not binding, all Member States have incorporated them into their national legislation. The Agency's rules place the emphasis on the packages used in transporting the material, meaning that packages governed by the Agency's rules must be capable of ensuring confinement of the materials transported, both in normal circumstances and in the event of an accident, and guaranteeing the safety of those exposed to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, I agree that safety has absolute priority over profitability and supply and that the nuclear industry must strictly abide by international transport regulations. We must not overlook the fact that radioactive material is regularly transported over long distances, not only within the European Union but also to and from other continents. Without quoting specific examples, I need only say two particularly meaningful words, I need only refer to two particularly meaningful sites: La Hague in France and Sellafield in Great Britain, where radioactive material is processed.</p>
<p class="contents">There are four particularly important points in the report to which I should like to refer, as pointers, because we do not have as much time as we would like at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the report stresses that the European Union should make an effort to reduce the volume and distance that radioactive material is transported. This is the proximity principle and was the subject of a European Parliament resolution back in 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is most important, as this report makes quite clear, that we cooperate with the Central and Eastern European countries and that they comply with International Atomic Energy Agency regulations, irrespective of whether or not enlargement takes place quickly – as we all hope it will – because there are problems in these countries which could jeopardise the health and safety of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as the report stresses, everyone responsible for transporting radioactive material must comply with existing rules, specifications and standards. Having legislation is not enough; it must be complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we examined the question of information about convoys transporting radioactive materials and decided that regional and local authorities should be kept informed.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns protests by various groups in this area. We are all in favour of freedom of expression for all European citizens, but it is important to avoid violence. This, too, is highlighted in the report. I have to tell you that the report attracted a large majority in committee and that the two main political groups are in agreement, which is why I regret to tell the House that I am unable to accept individual amendments from my fellow members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The committee's opinion was originally adopted in April 1999, in the last Parliament, and was readopted by the committee in this Parliament by an overwhelming majority with the original wording. The draftsman, Mr Mombaur, noted that only two things had changed in the two years. I should like to quote his comments that: "First, the Federal German Government's policy of ending electricity production at nuclear power stations after a further 32 years has shown clearly that, at least in the case of the transport of spent fuel elements, safety problems do not exist. Secondly, it has been made clear that a change of government in one Member State does not provide a legal basis for terminating agreements concluded at intergovernmental level."</p>
<p class="contents">Six conclusions were adopted by the Industry Committee, largely of a technical nature, to emphasise the low levels of radioactivity and exposure involved, particularly in comparison with naturally occurring background radiation. I note conclusions 1 and 2 concerning the Standing Working Group on the safe transport of radioactive materials in the European Union, which was established in 1982 at Parliament's request, which call for its work to continue and for its proceedings to be made public.</p>
<p class="contents">I am intrigued to see Commissioner Lamy here this afternoon. Does this means the Commission is intending to extend the trade in nuclear materials beyond the boundaries of the European Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not an appropriate theme with which to score political points. Let me make it quite clear, the most dangerous aspect of the transport of radioactive material today are the demonstrators on the periphery who cut the railway lines in half, dig out railway embankments, and do other similar things. At the moment, some of them are staging a ‘lie-in’ on the railway tracks in Germany. That is far more dangerous than the transports themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication also makes it clear that in Europe, the vast majority of these movements consist of low-grade radioactive material which is being transported and used to benefit people, that is, as medical products. No one can possibly object to that. The Group of the European People's Party, and let me be quite clear on this, we will vote against all proposed amendments presented by fellow MEPs in Parliament, because we believe that in the Committee, we have worked out an excellent compromise which is worth defending at Parliamentary level as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress again, it is not the task of the European Union – as the rapporteur, my friend Konstantinos Hatzidakis, has also pointed out – to prescribe to individual Member States the type of primary energy sources they should use. If the majority of Member States continue to be committed to nuclear energy today, however, safe and appropriate procedures must be in place. I hope that the Member States will also genuinely fulfil their obligation to provide information, which is laid down in the communication. This will be the next test for Germany, when, at the end of March, reprocessed material is due to be transported from La Hague to its final storage site in Germany.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Simpson (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, today we must assess what this report is about, which is the safe transportation of radioactive materials. It is a response to the Commission's communication on recent changes to the International Atomic Energy Agency's transport regulations. I say that because there were times during the debate in the committee when the central issue of transportation of radioactive material seemed to get lost in the wider debate between the pro- and anti-nuclear lobbies.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, however, thank Mrs Isler Béguin for starting the work, and certainly our chairman Mr Hatzidakis for finishing it, so we can have that debate here today. The Commission takes the view that the risk associated with transportation of radioactive material is low but that efforts should be made to inform the public and the emergency services of the safety of the transportation process. A multi-annual plan should also be adopted by the Community. We broadly support this view.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, in the former rapporteur's report, she took a position which included all dangerous inherent radioactivity, went against reprocessing of radioactive material and recommended that the Euratom Treaty be withdrawn and the nuclear sector be covered by a chapter about energy in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the PSE felt, as I said earlier, that this was a report on the transportation of radioactive material and had nothing to do with the merits or demerits of the nuclear industry. That is why we made compromises and I feel at the moment that we have a balanced report we can all support.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the PSE, therefore, I can say that we will support the two amendments that we tabled down in the plenary but reject the majority of amendments which either defend the nuclear industry as if no problem exists, or damn it as some form of devil-incarnate industry.</p>
<p class="contents">My group believes that the report as it stands, while not perfect, is at least balanced, realistic, objective and addresses the issues that it is supposed to address, namely the transportation of radioactive material. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Isler Béguin (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the European Parliament has, once again, missed an opportunity to do some straight talking about nuclear energy. It has, once again, side-stepped a fundamental debate on the safe transport of dangerous materials, as if nuclear energy were still the domain of experts and the advocates of nuclear energy and that the debate will, by necessity, be passionate and controversial.</p>
<p class="contents">I attempted to open this debate at the public hearing on 21 January 2000 when I was the first rapporteur. The all-powerful nuclear lobby pulled strings again, however. Although the first report by Mr Maurice was never presented during the previous legislature, the report before us could have been a step forward but that will not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted a resolution, with the full support of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which reveals nothing of the concern about opinion on the extremely sensitive issues surrounding the transport of radioactive materials, whereas my original report was perfectly in tune with the changing views of European citizens on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This is indeed a dramatic turn of events, which gives us cause to condemn the subtle workings of the agreements between large political groups manipulated by the pro-nuclear lobby. So, despite the work we have done, the draft resolution before us runs counter to the original proposals and, as a Member of Parliament, I cannot agree to it appearing in a resolution; perhaps silence is tantamount to a crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Although on many points I had managed to achieve a fair number of compromises between Members who had worked on this matter and tabled amendments, all this work was smashed to pieces the day before the vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism when the main groups refused to vote in favour of our compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">The main issues surrounding the transport of radioactive materials, such as transparency, safety and, more importantly, ways of reducing these transports, have been curtailed in the report that was presented to you. The report adopted by the Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is nothing but a paean to the nuclear industry. As proof of the influence that the pro-nuclear lobby had in the drafting of this change, the amendments presented by the conservatives and the socialists are absolutely identical, word-for-word, as are the acknowledgements from the lobby to the Members, who have gone along with the whole thing. They want us to believe that the transport of radioactive materials is not a matter for the nuclear industry and that we, the Group of the Greens, are in the wrong debate. I should like to see an end to this hypocrisy!</p>
<p class="contents">Although most radioactive waste often takes the form of small packages to be used in laboratories and medicine, this is not the most dangerous material. In fact, the transport of radioactive waste presents the greatest risk due to the levels of radioactivity. To say the opposite would be a manipulation of the truth.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are not being in the least bit provocative in raising the issue of the treatment of these radioactive packages, since we are aware that the entire policy on the safe transport of radioactive materials is based on packaging, which would be guaranteed against all eventualities.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, we are aware that many radioactive products including the most toxic, such as plutonium, are being transported around Europe. Is it a crime of <span class="italic">lèse-majesté</span> to want to see an end to these bombs on wheels?</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I tried to provide answers to these issues and to raise the critical question about the origin of radioactive materials transportation. At this point, we reach the issue of the nuclear industry and of nuclear waste reprocessing in particular, since reprocessing in plants in The Hague and Sellafield is what actually causes most radioactive waste to be transported. If reprocessing did not take place, radioactive waste would not be transported.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the simplest solution and it is possible, because we are aware that reprocessing is an economic and ecological anomaly, given what we now know. The most recent development in the transport of highly radioactive materials is that waste from MOX-fuel processing plants is stored, quite illegally, in The Hague. This means, Mr President, that it has been illegally transported as well. There is no point in seeking to curtail the debate, as the report is trying to do. We might improve it, on the other hand, by voting in favour of the amendments that I have just presented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you are all aware, this is a matter of deep concern to the Irish people, who are particularly upset that there will be increased shipments of nuclear material through the Irish Sea in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Government has already stated that it is ready to restart the shipments of spent nuclear fuel to Cumbria, and the Dutch Government has overseen the transportation of two shipments of nuclear spent material to Sellafield in recent times. The Dutch Government intends to carry out 17 more shipments in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">Fighting British Nuclear Fuels and the British nuclear industry is never an easy task – I have been doing it for many years. That is why I am particularly pleased that the Greater London Assembly set up a committee last week to investigate safety concerns on the transportation of radioactive waste by rail through London. Trains loaded with spent nuclear fuel from three nuclear plants in the south-east of England regularly cross London bound for the BNFL plant at Sellafield. They pass through seven boroughs, including West Hampstead, Islington, Hackney, Hammersmith, Fulham, Wandsworth and Bromley. Cartloads of nuclear waste are regularly stored at marshalling yards in Willesden.</p>
<p class="contents">The setting up of this new Radioactive Trains Investigative Committee will hear evidence from British Nuclear Fuels and Railtrack, as well as from representatives from local community groups on this very issue. It is anticipated that this committee will report back to the Greater London Assembly by the summer. The committee's foundation comes only a few days after a train carrying spent nuclear fuel flasks derailed as it arrived at the Torness power plant in Scotland. I am pleased that the members of the Greater London Assembly are now equally concerned by the shipment of radioactive nuclear materials in England and, in particular, to the BNFL Sellafield plant in Cumbria.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that politicians and local authorities in Ireland can join forces with members of the Greater London Assembly and other groups in England to intensify the battle to see that BNFL close down the nuclear white elephant of the Sellafield plant.</p>
<p class="contents">A separate but related matter is that it is high time for a full environmental impact assessment to be carried out on the likely environmental damage that could arise from nuclear shipments across the Irish Sea. Once again, I call on the European Commissioner for the environment, Mrs Wallström, to invoke powers under the Euratom Treaty to force an independent evaluation of the environmental risks to be carried out for the shipment of nuclear materials in the Irish Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, on his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Like Mr Simpson, I speak for the north-west of England, where the nuclear industry is of huge significance – in Springfield, where the rods are manufactured, Sellafield, where they are changed back into something more useful, and Warrington, the headquarters of British Nuclear Fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">This industry is never complacent. It recognises the concerns of people in Britain and Europe about the transportation of nuclear material and takes huge trouble in testing what needs to be done. Its record in the transportation of dangerous goods is amongst the best. There has never been a fatality in the transportation of nuclear materials and, if the industry has its way, there never will be.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate referred to by Mr Fitzsimons was one that I saw when I was Northern Ireland Minister. It is tendentious and ill-informed. It is also an attack – in which, if I may say so, the Group of the Greens is also involved – upon my constituents in the north-west and everyone else who works in this most important and significant industry both in Britain and in other parts of the Union. This is not the time for a debate on nuclear power except to say that it is the future. It is one of the greenest ways of generating power anywhere in the world. The sooner we realise that the better.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that my amendments in committee were significant in changing the nature of this report. I have tabled some more for the vote tomorrow, along similar lines. I am proud to be associated with the rejection of the original report and, I hope, the passing of the report as amended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome that, and I would also like to thank the Committee Chairman who finished the work. No one would dispute that nuclear energy and the transport of nuclear waste fall within the competencies of the Member States. Of course, if agreements have been concluded, they must also be adhered to, especially as far as transport is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Transporting radioactive material is not a risk-free business, as the report points out. So I think that what the report says is important: firstly, the safety of people and the environment must have absolute priority; secondly, full information must be provided to the local authorities and community. Many people in Germany, in particular, are worried at present; they are upset about what lies ahead. Being able to voice their opinion and take part in demonstrations is part of that. We are united in our condemnation of violence against people and property, because it is counterproductive. For our part, let me say this: the proposal put forward in Germany by a politician by the name of Möllemann to carry out the Castor transports by airship must also be rejected. It would certainly be impossible to comply with safety requirements and would merely make the transport of radioactive waste even more hazardous.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Isler Béguin, you and I would probably phase out nuclear energy tomorrow, but we do not make up the majority in the world, or in this society. So we should concentrate on this communication so that in the immediate future, the transport of radioactive waste is as safe as possible. If we have then achieved what the German Government has set out to do, namely to agree on and complete the phasing-out of nuclear energy, the two of us might have attained our goal in a few years' time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Group of the Greens do not want to understand the undeniable environmental advantages of nuclear power. What a paradox! It is obvious, too, that the Group of the Greens’ position on nuclear power is based on the ideology of 1968, and they still refuse to engage in frank and honest discussion on the topic. Their opinions seem to be fixed beforehand, and the facts have no effect on them. The first version of the report was used as a chance for them to get on their hobbyhorse and oppose nuclear energy. What is remarkable is that there was no mention, whatsoever, in the report of the Commission’s action programme, which contains many sensible initiatives. Fortunately, after the amendments tabled in the committee, we have managed to return from a myopic position to one that goes to the core of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The transport of radioactive material is in compliance with the regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Commission has consulted a working party made up of experts – not politicians, note – from Member States. The working party considers that the modified regulations will give a considerable amount of additional protection, although the original ones were not regarded as in any way inadequate. The risks are considered to be small and, thanks to the stringent regulations in force, accidents have been avoided for almost half a century. This is so despite the fact that certain, though by no means all, opponents of nuclear power try, irresponsibly, to sabotage the transport operation, for example, by loosening rails. This makes one wonder who is responsible and who is putting public safety at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge everyone to keep to the facts. The Commission’s remark that the public ought to be told how good the situation is in the final analysis, is, therefore, more than justified. Because nuclear power increases prosperity and makes for a cleaner environment, it is an inevitable solution to the energy question. If the nuclear power plants in France were closed down right now, there would be a rush in this Chamber to look for candles.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the sensitive and emotional nature of the topic, the Liberal Group sets great store by a realistic account of the facts, for example by reporting the very diverse expert opinions on the subject of radiation limit values.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we believe it would be misleading to suggest that the nuclear industry act in a self-regulating capacity, especially when it comes to safety. The nuclear industry, too, is subject to internationally binding safety rules on the basis of which consistent standards have been established with which all actors must comply.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, recital e) is right to draw a distinction between, on the one hand, radioactive material which consists of isotopes for medical, industrial and research purposes – which makes up the lion’s share of such movements – and, on the other hand, radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuels intended for re-use. That is the most hazardous form of radioactive material, but, relatively speaking, it only makes up a very small proportion of the total. The distinction between specific nuclear material and radioactive material in more general terms, however, is not clarified elsewhere in the text.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission were to look into all transport movements of radioactive material, this would duplicate the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is soon to embark upon a similar enquiry. It would be useful if the Commission were to focus on the transport of nuclear material in the European Union, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, my group opposes the fact that the wider topic of the duty of consultation, with regard to the transport of all dangerous substances, is addressed in this report. This is not what the report is about. The liberals do believe, however, that the local authorities must be consulted on the transport of radioactive materials. The emphasis should then, however, be on compulsory prior notice of the transport of nuclear material.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we welcome the IAAE’s decision to evaluate its transport rules every two years and adapt them, if necessary. We would like to emphasise that, in the interests of a consistently high safety level, the rules will have to be implemented by all Member States at the beginning of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason I am representing the Commission here today is not that the issue of the transportation of nuclear materials has been transferred to the stealthy and all-embracing range of activities of the Commissioner responsible for external trade. It is actually a far more innocent exercise involving the temporary transportation of files between members of the Commission out of concern to lend a hand from time to time. I must specify that I shall not be stockpiling these files.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, then, the transportation of nuclear material, as you have just mentioned, is often approached in a rather emotional fashion, considering the context and the environment in which this industry operates. We, in the Commission, therefore, fully appreciate the difficult task that you have had in summarising positions which are often rather contradictory. We feel that the rapporteur, and also the Members of Parliament and the committee members who have participated in this, should be congratulated on this quite remarkable overview.</p>
<p class="contents">As several of you have pointed out in the course of the debate, the nuclear industry, like it or not, assumes a significant load in ensuring the security of our energy supply, and we must, therefore, accept the fact that this industry must undertake the transportation of radioactive material.</p>
<p class="contents">The key point we see in the report before you is the confirmation that the measures undertaken nationally and internationally provide a high level of safety in the transportation of this material. That being the case, there is quite clearly a crucial need for transparency in this matter, as in all matters affecting the nuclear sector. We acknowledge the need for precise and transparent information regarding the risks which the population at large could or can run. We support and are willing to promote this.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the difficulties arising due to the nature of the material and the limitations necessitated by security considerations, like you, we feel it is important to step up the provision of information. Obviously, this is an area that has never yet been optimised or perfected and, as Mr Piecyk mentioned, it is true that the States are first and foremost responsible for such matters, but that does not stop us working on measures to improve, for instance, the documents dealing with the transportation of such material.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not for us to deliver an opinion on the appropriateness of using reprocessing technology. This is an essentially industrial solution which must really be decided on the basis of technical and economic criteria and in terms of the need to reduce highly radioactive waste.</p>
<p class="contents">We can, on the other hand, give our support to the efforts made in research and development, and we intend to do so. Indeed this is what the Commission has proposed under the Sixth Framework Programme on Research and Development, giving priority to innovation in waste management.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also our responsibility to ensure that obligations under the Euratom Treaty, Chapter III on radiological protection, are fulfilled. Your report expresses the wish to incorporate a chapter on energy in the Union Treaty. We are all aware that this is an issue that has been discussed on several occasions within intergovernmental conferences, without any result to date.</p>
<p class="contents">As our Green Paper “Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply” emphasises, we feel that the Euratom Treaty fulfils its objectives in a whole range of areas. It is true that it does not include any specific reference to the transportation of radioactive material. We consider, nonetheless, that the provisions of this Treaty enable us to perform a supervisory role while maintaining the prime responsibility of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what the Commission wished to say on the subject of this report. Obviously, we are going to carefully examine all the suggestions made in the report along the lines I have just outlined, that is, with a view to improving our own action within the scope of our resources and our jurisdiction as conferred by the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said in my opening remark, we feel that this report makes a useful contribution. It makes it possible to issue an informed opinion to the citizens of Europe and, following the many debates between us on this issue of the transportation of radioactive materials, we feel that it contributes to a reasoned approach to this activity, which will doubtless motivate improvements in terms of transparency, and we therefore consider this report to be most welcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
