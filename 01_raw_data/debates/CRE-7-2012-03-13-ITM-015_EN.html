The first is the International Cocoa Agreement 2010, for which Parliament’s assent is being requested, and the second is a motion for a resolution on child labour in the cocoa sector. I am the rapporteur for the Committee on International Trade and the author of the resolution that the same committee is tabling before Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the former, the Committee on International Trade is unanimously proposing that Parliament authorise the Council to conclude the International Cocoa Agreement 2010 for three key reasons. Firstly, the agreement makes the International Cocoa Organisation (ICO) better able to take action in this sector. Secondly, the agreement confers greater clarity and transparency as regards how the ICO operates, and increases civil society participation in its work. Thirdly, the aforementioned agreement introduces new provisions intended to promote sound labour relations and a sustainable cocoa economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement requires the contracting parties to improve working conditions, in line with the internationally recognised rules and principles of the International Labour Organisation. It also encourages the contracting parties themselves to promote the sustainable development of the cocoa economy and to implement programmes and projects with a view to achieving these goals. As one of the major cocoa importers, the European Union has an increased responsibility to guarantee that production of, and trade in, cocoa are undertaken in the most transparent and sustainable way possible. The International Cocoa Agreement, which is, in fact, provisionally in force, is currently our best ally in taking up this responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the resolution that I mentioned, I believe the issue of child labour on cocoa plantations is too serious for us to ignore it when giving our consent to the International Cocoa Agreement. That is why I tabled, and the Committee on International Trade adopted, the motion for a resolution expressing our concerns about the continued use of child labour on cocoa plantations, particularly in western Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last 10 years, increasing awareness of this issue amongst consumers and producers, as well as amongst political decision makers, has been leading to the welcome mobilisation of the international cocoa industry to work together with all stakeholders, such as international institutions, trades unions and NGOs, to eliminate, at least, the worst forms of child labour in cocoa production. Nonetheless, much remains to be done. Children working in cocoa fields are exposed to serious health risks. There are no reliable data on the scale of the problem. The estimates range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Whatever its extent, it is enough for us to be concerned, and for us to stretch ourselves to breaking point to eradicate child labour in cocoa production, and its most serious forms in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of child labour should be dealt with comprehensively, involving political decision makers, stakeholders and, obviously, the EU institutions. I await the comments of the Commission, to which we would pose specific questions: we would like concrete and satisfactory answers on how it believes the EU should respond to this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andris Piebalgs, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Moreira and the Committee on International Trade for their proposal that this House consent to the conclusion of the International Cocoa Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with Parliament’s view that the new agreement is a good platform to promote international cooperation in the world cocoa sector and that it will contribute to the strengthening of the national cocoa economies. This agreement will enable the world markets to strive towards obtaining fair prices for both producers and consumers, while also leading to equitable economic returns and promoting a sustainable cocoa economy. All these elements are of paramount importance for cocoa producer countries, which also, in most cases, happen to be developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Being the world’s main importer and consumer of cocoa, the European Union has a clear role and a responsibility to promote the increased sustainability of a fair cocoa trade in these countries. With this responsibility in mind, we recognise that the question of child labour represents one of the most difficult challenges – the controversial aspect being that, in our view, the idea is abhorrent, while in some other traditions, it is an accepted practice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we agree with the ILO, ICCO and the World Cocoa Foundation that the agreement is a good starting point to address the issue of child labour in this particular sector. We could even go further on this issue by saying that the problem of child labour goes well beyond the cocoa sector and, unfortunately, affects nearly all our developing partners.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the rights of the child are enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is a priority for us to protect and promote these rights, and the Commission is deeply committed to this cause. The EU remains engaged in eradicating the worst forms of child labour at global level and in ensuring that a child’s education is not sacrificed to the need to work and that children’s physical and emotional development is not adversely affected. At international level, under Article 32 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, children have the right to be protected from economic exploitation and from child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission has repeatedly expressed its profound regret that, despite the efforts of the international community – including the near universal ratification of ILO Convention 182, which requires the complete eradication of this practice – an ever increasing number of children are engaged in activities that meet the ILO definition of child labour. I would like to point out that today, a shocking 124 million children are engaged in the worst forms of child labour and that the overall trend in sub-Saharan Africa is up by nearly 30%. This should give us all food for thought. I therefore really appreciate and welcome the interest that Mr Moreira and a large number of Members of this House attach to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">But the issue is complex. In developing countries, and in particular in the cocoa sector, the problem of child labour cannot be considered in isolation. An integrated approach must tackle other very relevant issues stemming from the root causes of poverty and the subsequent need for child labour and trafficking of children for this labour.</p>
<p class="contents">As the draft recommendation rightly acknowledges, 90% of cocoa farmers in West Africa are smallholders. These are family farms facing huge challenges. They are sometimes located 40 km down a dirt track and have extremely difficult access to infrastructure. In these circumstances, children will, of course, be working on the farm. In order to assist communities to provide the conditions where children will no longer need to be employed, the Commission is fully engaged through its development cooperation and its policies that we apply in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s engagement is outlined in the 2010 Commission staff working paper on child labour and the June 2010 Council conclusions. Policy coherence and coordination are essential components to this effort and, with this in mind, we have in place a coordinated EU approach, working with the relevant international organisations and bodies. This is coupled with helping West African countries to address the issues themselves, including through cooperation on improved infrastructure and farming methods and providing for more and better labour inspection and market organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to reaffirm my strong belief that a child’s place is at school and not in the fields or factories. Eradicating poverty is the first objective that we should try to achieve: tackling the root cause of child labour in Africa and in all developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore very grateful to the European Parliament, which has once again put this very important issue high on its agenda. The Commission, as usual, will address the issue in its work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this report and, most importantly, the accompanying resolution represent a very good compromise. It goes without saying that the new version of the International Cocoa Agreement is an important, long-term step in the positive collaboration between cocoa-producing and cocoa-consuming countries. Giving cocoa farmers and their families the security to plan ahead, creating food security, introducing general cooperation on development and combating exploitative child labour all make an important contribution to sustainable growth in the cocoa sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We are responsible for ensuring that producers can continue to develop their businesses in future under fair conditions. The fight against exploitative child labour, which I have just mentioned, is the subject of the resolution by the Committee on International Trade. As I have already said, we have been able to agree across all the groups on some basic points, including, most importantly, the definition of child labour, because not all child labour is equally exploitative and dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">This is reflected in the situation in the largest cocoa-producing countries. Cocoa is cultivated and harvested almost exclusively on family farms where the children help their parents. Important factors here are access to education and the general development of the children. We must focus our attention on exploitative child labour which harms children’s health and we must use all the resources at our disposal to combat it. I believe that this resolution highlights the concerns of the European Parliament in a targeted and, above all, balanced way. In my opinion, there is no need for any changes to the resolution and I will be pleased if the rapporteur can ensure that the positive and fruitful cooperation which we saw in the committee continues in plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This new International Cocoa Agreement, which we will vote on tomorrow, undoubtedly contains very timely measures that are an improvement on the previous one. There are measures to aid the development of the economies of the producing countries, for fair prices for both producers and consumers, and for a sustainable framework both in environmental and social terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the focus of the resolution is precisely within that social framework. This resolution accompanies the agreement and will also be voted on tomorrow. I think the fact that it is basically focused on eradicating child labour is a major step, as it is one of the problems we face. Also, as the Commissioner said, we have been fighting the cause for some time, but the figures that were provided, of 124 million working children in the world, do not fill us with joy.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I think it is a very difficult struggle and it is one of those struggles that needs to be tackled from different fronts. I would like to state three specific fronts, which I believe are of vital importance. The first would be to make it compulsory for all states to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The second, which I believe is important and has not been mentioned here, would involve the application of advances in research and development in cultivation and collection techniques so that child labour is not required. Lastly, the drafting of a European standard for traceability and sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it would be advisable for the Commission to try to study those proposals and I would also like to know the Commissioner’s opinion of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When Francesco Carletti, a Florentine trader who was the first to circumnavigate the Earth using merchant ships between the late 1500s and early 1600s, brought cocoa to Europe, he denounced a business in which the main financing for investments in this plant was derived from the slave trade. Ever since then, the inhumane nature of the cocoa trade has persisted.</p>
<p class="contents">If the product comes from Ghana or Côte d’Ivoire – which account for almost 60% of global output – then the use of children is a given, the majority of whom are less than 14 years old and often subject to genuine trafficking, which sees them taken away from their families in nearby countries and shut away in the plantations.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, I was in Côte d’Ivoire for an annual meeting of Euro-African liberal democrat members of parliament. There, I met the President of the main non-governmental organisation (NGO) that fights against the exploitation of children in cocoa plantations. The organisation is not without support, since even the wife of President Ouattara has come to its aid, opening the national surveillance committee against child exploitation and labour.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, we need to move away from depending on volunteers, good examples and harsh words, and instead imbue the markets with a sense of social responsibility that has so far been lacking in the cocoa plantations, with their distinctive non-intensive, non-mechanical culture, and the aggravating factor of the use of pesticides that are harmful to workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement that has been signed – for which I should like to thank Mr Moreira and the Commission – is a step in the right direction, making the chocolate supply chain more transparent, involving NGOs and promoting fairer prices around the world. Since the EU controls most of the votes of importer countries in international cocoa organisations, it has a special responsibility to put the agreement quickly into action and use it as a way to make the production of this popular treat more humane.</p>
<p class="contents">As significant as it is, however, this agreement alone will not suffice. We also need consumers to be more aware so that they can make ethical purchases, while also promoting the production and sale of fair trade chocolate, which guarantees prices for producers and that no children were exploited in the plantations of Africa during the process. The EU can do much more in this area, including by setting out regulations on (European) certification that has so far been a private initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are all aware of the many and numerous reports of child labour. It is a worrying matter. The European Union also has the biggest chocolate industry in the world. We therefore have a responsibility; we have to do something to address this state of affairs. We have to ensure good conditions, both economically and socially. And it is good that we are touching on child labour in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Moreira’s resolution is a good one. It highlights one of two ways in which we can prevent child labour. <span class="italic">One</span> of those two ways is ensuring greater cooperation, by exchanging know-how, by ensuring that everyone works closely together and, indeed, by ensuring that the distribution sector shuns any producers who use child labour, at any stage of the cocoa production process, without giving them a second chance.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the second method, ladies and gentlemen, is ensuring fair, good prices. And the International Cocoa Agreement ought to do more about that. It ought to have the clout and the teeth to do something about that because, let us face it, if we have good prices, adults can earn their own money. If prices are low, then we have poverty. Poverty leads to child labour, so ensuring fair prices is an absolute necessity and is a central plank of this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are in favour of this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in the Committee on International Trade, we had a shameful debate about whether we should condemn only forced child labour or also child labour under the terms of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p class="contents">In two areas, we may be forced to take a step backwards and, therefore, we need to resolve the issues involved. Mr Sturdy, recital E, which has been tabled by your group, gives the impression that the hard work done by children on the cocoa plantations is harmless. These children are being deprived of the opportunity to take part in education and their future is being taken away from them. We should delete this paragraph.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Köstinger and the other Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which tabled recital D, want Parliament to turn a blind eye to the fact that children are being abducted and sold in West Africa to do hard and dangerous forced labour on the cocoa plantations. This is the appalling reality in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana in particular, as has already been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I recommend that you watch the documentary ‘The Dark Side of Chocolate’, which reveals that a child costs EUR 230. The children are being abducted from Mali and the International Labour Organisation estimates that there are more than 12 000 children without relations working on the Ivorian plantations. The next time we eat chocolate, we should specifically ask ourselves how many children have suffered to give us this pleasure. We must take a much more decisive approach to combating this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result of the growing demand for chocolate from Asian countries, for example, more cocoa is needed and this, when combined with crop failures, could lead to a shortage of 1 million tonnes of cocoa within a few years. This is the total annual production of the largest producer country, Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the EU should not overlook the growing influence that the Ivorian Government is exerting on the domestic cocoa market. For example, because of the agricultural reform under way in the country, the 2012 to 2013 cocoa harvest was sold early in secret auctions. The millions of cocoa producers and the millions of workers who depend on chocolate production are, in many cases, working in inhumane conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the EU is making a commitment to introducing social improvements and bringing an end to child labour as part of this agreement, the concern is that the improvements will only take place on paper and that the EU, as the world’s largest consumer of chocolate, will simply be absolving itself of responsibility for the situation.

On the one hand, we are opposed to all child labour. I must make it quite clear that, as the father of four children, I feel quite ill at the thought of what other children have to do to enable my children to have a cup of a chocolate drink in the morning.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on the other hand, we cannot deny the fact that we need to put these countries in the position where they can introduce minimum social standards, find the funding for schools and education and establish social security systems. The dilemma we find ourselves in is that if we do not trade with these countries, then they will not earn the money to introduce all the developments that we would like to see. If we do trade with these countries, then we are faced with our current dilemma, which is intolerable. This is why I very much welcome this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to my fellow Members who have looked at this subject in detail in the committee. I am firmly convinced that this agreement is a move in the right direction. We are not afraid to express our criticisms, but we are not saying right from the outset: ‘We will not trade with you unless you put your house in order’. Instead, we are attempting to draw up a realistic, joint timetable to help these countries to resolve this dilemma. We have a joint interest not only in enjoying a good bar of chocolate or a cup of a chocolate drink, but, much more importantly, in ensuring a positive future for the children in these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since the European cocoa industry is the biggest in the world, we must urge our processing companies to commit to fighting the exploitation of children and for a sustainable and fair cocoa supply chain.

Millions of children work in conditions which put their health at risk by actually bringing them into contact with various harmful chemicals. In West Africa alone, more than 100 000 children toil under the harshest working conditions in the cocoa fields, with 10 000 children being victims of human trafficking. The low sale prices offered for cocoa force farmers to use child labour, which has far-reaching consequences for the children’s health and their schooling.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that access to education is a fundamental condition for reducing poverty and ending child exploitation. The EU has several necessary instruments available for putting an end to these practices.

Let us be clear, though: the responsibility for tackling this issue does not lie with the European Parliament or with consumers in Europe, but with the industry itself. Over the last 10 years, the industry has made EUR 700 billion. That is a phenomenal sum of money, and the industry spent precisely 0.0075% of that investing in its workers’ working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The industry has a responsibility to provide schools for the children that it exploits.

This is, above all, a sector on which the livelihoods of 50 million people around the world depend. I therefore consider it essential to adopt a transparent legal framework to ensure much more equitable conditions in the global chain – from producers, through intermediaries and exporters, to end users. Sustainable world trade in cocoa must be based at all stages of the chain on the principles of economic viability, and on respect for social and environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I firmly believe that a fair price for cocoa and the related fair revenues in particular for producers, who are often small farmers in developing countries, will help to resolve problems as well as issues relating to the unfair exploitation of child labour in this sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that we are now in Strasbourg, but we are often in Brussels, where many people like to buy Belgian chocolate and to give it as a gift. Most of them do not think about where the cocoa comes from, under what conditions it is cultivated, and how the chocolate is manufactured.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate has already made it clear that we must understand that the cocoa which we import has, in many cases, been produced using child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">As Ms Köstinger has said, this is not just about finding out whether the children are there with or without their families and whether or not forced labour is involved. We must also be aware that the conditions under which these children work are damaging to their health. Cocoa is produced under conditions which are extremely harmful to health, including that of children. We need to stop this from happening.</p>
<p class="contents">We must do everything we can to buy cocoa fairly from countries like Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire which are attempting to bring about better living conditions for their people. This has already been said on several occasions and, therefore, I think that introducing a quality mark would be the right approach to take. I am pleased that there is widespread agreement in Parliament on this subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that cocoa is a great product. It is also true that for many countries, such as Côte d’Ivoire, it is an important product for the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fair trade should be practised and a fair price should be paid for the product. It should also be the industry’s responsibility to ensure that the products they sell are not tainted and use sustainable labour practices. It is also important that we include all elements of the fight against poverty in the same package; that is what we are doing in Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire and other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">But further measures are needed to address the problem of child labour. I will just recall a couple of them: the European Union is conducting a lobbying campaign to support the ratification of ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour and two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p class="contents">Child protection with regard to child labour has been identified as an EU priority in a number of the human rights country strategies that the EU has been drawing up. This is a very important point because we are engaging in political dialogue with our developing partners. This is where we could and should address this issue, with the aim of ensuring that countries also see it as a clear priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also produced its Guide to Socially Responsible Procurement, which pays attention to labour practices. There are also relevant projects and programmes in development assistance. Some of these are specifically targeted at child labour; for example, the EUR 14 million TACKLE project on child labour and education which the ILO is carrying out in 14 ACP countries, and last year’s EUR 10 million call for proposals to combat child labour under the ‘Investing in People’ programme.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically in the cocoa sector, the EDF Cocoa Sector Support programme effectively contributed to improving the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and making cocoa production more sustainable in Ghana.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to assure all of you that the Commission is fully committed to maintaining policy coherence in all its initiatives related to trade, development, human rights and corporate social responsibility, bearing in mind that in developing countries, the problem of child labour cannot be just looked at in isolation as a separate problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking into account the importance of ensuring that trade agreements include effective provisions on poverty reduction and the promotion of decent work and safe working conditions, the Commission is concretely looking into the issue of traceability of goods produced using forced child labour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, I think it is important, first of all, to use our political clout to encourage these countries to ratify and actually to implement the International Labour Organisation agreements on child labour. Secondly, development programmes should be used to make gains regarding the sustainability of the cocoa sector. Thirdly, the idea of making cocoa traceable should be explored, so as to create a ‘child labour-free cocoa’ label, which could be a means of asserting the importance of this issue in cocoa production.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add one more thing: this matter cannot be absent from the EU’s international trade relations or from international trade agreements. I believe that this matter cannot be absent from discussions on economic partnership agreements with cocoa-producing countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. To this end, the EU has a huge array of means at its disposal that it cannot fail to use in a wide-ranging and holistic way. This includes one that we have omitted but which I do not want to fail to mention, which is corporate social responsibility, which the Commissioner also mentioned and which seems to me to be important, given that a significant proportion of the major players in this area are European companies.</p>

According to a recent study, however, the sector’s efforts in tackling child labour have been unfair and imperfect and nothing has happened in the case of 97% of farmers in Côte d’Ivoire. Unicef estimate that half a million children are engaged in labour on farms in Côte d’Ivoire, a country that produces 40% of the world’s cocoa. Some 80% of the EU’s cocoa comes from West Africa and the European cocoa industry is the world’s largest cocoa industry. Therefore, the EU has a duty to ensure the sustainability of the cocoa sector, and, morally and practically, issues in relation to child labour must be central to EU trade agreements. It is a positive aspect of the International Cocoa Agreement that Articles 42 and 43 of the agreement relate to child labour. However, the Commission must look at labelling that declares that products ‘free of child labour’ are being imported to ensure that the voluntary conventions in relation to putting an end to the worst kinds of child labour are being properly implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Overall, the agreement intends to bring more transparency and sustainability into a sector on which 50 million livelihoods depend throughout the world. In particular, it aims to create conditions for fairer and more sustainable global trade in cocoa by strengthening international cooperation. The EU imports over 80% of its cocoa from West Africa. The European chocolate industry is the largest worldwide. Over 90% of the world’s cocoa is cultivated by 5.5 million smallholders, with a further 14 million rural workers directly dependent on its production. I believe that this agreement could have a positive impact on all actors participating in the cocoa economy and I hope that it will translate into tangible long-term benefits for small-scale farmers. Unfortunately, the issue of child labour in the fields is widespread and, even though a lot of child labour is done within the family framework, the situation is worrying. Being the world’s main importer and consumer of cocoa, the EU should actively commit to resolve this problem as a matter of urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would remind you that cocoa is one of the primary materials most in demand internationally, after coffee and sugar, and most of the added value in the production chain goes to the countries of the North. Out of the overall production costs of a bar of chocolate, less than 5% goes to the countries of the South. The major chocolate manufacturers would therefore appear to have forgotten that they are wholly dependent on the millions of small-scale cocoa producers.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the International Labour Organisation estimates that 215 million children around the world are obliged to work, with over 250 000 of them working in West Africa’s cocoa plantations, while 15 000 have been reduced to a state of slavery. The reason is simple: as they are unable to make a profit from their activity, the producers are forced to look for cheap labour. We must therefore demand of the Commission effective legislation to combat the forced labour of children in the cocoa sector and to put pressure on all of the players in the supply chain to ensure that the farmers are able to obtain equitable returns from their activity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is highly unjust and also unwise because it permanently destroys the future prospects of the societies where it takes place. Responsible people have spoken out against it on numerous occasions by drawing attention to the scandalous conditions and bringing about improvements by means of legislation. As a result, child labour has been almost entirely eradicated in Europe. Therefore, bringing an end to child labour in other parts of the world is undoubtedly a legitimate goal, in particular, with regard to important everyday consumer products in Europe, such as the chocolate which is produced from cocoa. The condemnation of child labour in this sector which accompanies the recommendation on the Council decision concerning the cocoa agreement is therefore another important step in the right direction. It should act as an incentive for us to pay close attention to ensuring that child labour is outlawed in all the European Union’s trade relationships. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
