My view is that the European framework will make possible an easier and more efficient resolution because of the participation of the two countries in the European integration process.</p>

Its main theme was that public health can be promoted through political decision-making in all areas of life, and not just in the health sector. This is all the more true given that it is hard for national economies to postpone addressing health problems until they involve diseases for which they need to start finding cures.</p>
<p class="contents">This week, we are voting on reports on improving the ambient air quality. This is just the sort of preventive health work that needs to be undertaken in all policy areas. Our decisions in matters of transport, trade and industry policy, the environment, social planning and social policy always have an impact on public health. It is always best to invest in areas where health hazards can be averted. The European Union has a mandate under the Treaty to work towards this objective in all policy areas.</p>

<p class="contents">According to public opinion, Ilves was the overwhelming favourite of the Estonian population in the contest with the sitting president, but nevertheless the elections were close, due to the regulations of the electoral body. Both the media and the Estonian people feared that political manipulation, and not the popular will, would prevail. On Saturday, thousands of Estonians, myself included, gathered in the centre of the capital, Tallinn. Just as we did during the period of the restoration of Estonian independence at the end of the 1980s, we used music to express our support for Toomas Ilves as the representative of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad to be able to congratulate both Estonia and Europe. The electoral body’s decision corresponded to the expectations of the democratic majority of our society, and after the Estonian presidential elections that took place on 23 September, I can confirm that European democracy is alive and well in Estonia. I would also like to wish my good colleague and friend Toomas Ilves luck in his new position and in promoting more of Europe in Estonia and more Estonian ideas here.</p>

The Netherlands has been an EU Member State for many years, and I wonder whether it knew this stuff was being exported, whether approval for this was given, and, if it was, then subject to what conditions?

It appears that in this troubled area of the South Caucasus there are at least 10 confrontations every day involving the use of firearms.</p>
<p class="contents">The peace-keeping forces deployed there by Russia were supposed to guarantee peace for the local people and indeed for the whole of that area of the South Caucasus. According to the information provided to us by the Finnish head of the OSCE detachment, Major Lehtonen, the Russian peace-keeping forces are not, however, taking any steps to identify the underlying causes of these confrontations and if necessary pursue the individuals who are provoking them. I would therefore like to draw the attention of this House to the fact that it is unacceptable to allow such an important part of our continent to remain under the sole control of a single military peace-keeping force. We should strive to ensure that in future the European Union has greater influence over how the situation in South Ossetia is controlled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a time when technological advances occur at break-neck speed, the general public has reacted with surprise and great disappointment to the European Commission’s statement that the delay is due to technical problems related to the development and deployment of the SIS II database. The Schengen Treaty is a visible and tangible embodiment of the freedom of movement of persons and goods across the entire European Union; unfortunately, we are only paying lip service to this freedom. Therefore, I regard as unfair a situation where citizens of new EU Member States will have to wait beyond the end of the 2007 in order to travel without border checks.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the European Commission to consider any and all options that would enable the original deadline to be met or, alternatively, pending the deployment of the new system, to allow the new Member States to be temporarily linked to the current system, SIS I plus. Positive steps taken by the European Commission to meet the original deadline would help to strengthen the public’s faith in the European project as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A spokesperson for the Internal Affairs Commissioner has suggested that, for a number of technical and legal reasons, the second phase of the Schengen System is not ready. This is a system that should be, or should have been, launched in the autumn of next year. This is disturbing news for the whole of Europe, and also for the new Member States, which have invested a great deal of effort and money in order to be ready for next autumn. I should therefore like to call on the Commission to inform this House as to the technical and legal difficulties that have arisen, and who is responsible for this situation, because the preparations have thus far gone according to plan.

Unfortunately, Community VAT legislation currently in place in Poland is actually serving as an effective deterrent to potential donors.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a steady decline in the number of donors since the act on VAT was amended to bring Polish legislation into line with Community provisions. In the past, a taxpayer who made goods over to the needy free of charge had to calculate the tax due on their actual value. Now, however, he or she has to calculate the tax due on the purchase price. As a result, someone who makes a gift of a computer that is several years old has to pay the same amount of tax as if it were new, even though donated goods are worth much less when they are passed on than the price on the original invoice for their purchase. Indeed, it is often the case that the market price one could get for these goods is less than the tax that has to be paid when they are gifted.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision to tax gifts runs counter to the very notion of helping the needy. Often absurd situations arise, when people prefer to throw out food or items that are still usable rather than give them to the needy, because it is cheaper and safer to do so, and saves trouble with the Inland Revenue. If this repressive legislation is not amended and the state continues to penalise donors for their generosity, we shall witness growing indifference towards the most needy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I was not aware that the Commissioner was there on Thursday, but I heard of her visit Friday morning on local radio. Immediately I contacted the Commission Office in Dublin asking for some information about her itinerary. I thought that a bit of joined-up thinking and working at European level would be beneficial, naive as I was. The Commission Office in Dublin said that it could give me no information. After five phone calls to the Commissioner’s own office, I was told on Friday afternoon that even though this was a public visit, the information was private and unavailable. I had to wait until Saturday to read details of her visit in a national newspaper. So what was private on Friday was public on Saturday.</p>
<p class="contents">I was astounded. I could not believe that the public itinerary of a European Commissioner on a visit to Ireland could be classified as private. Is that what Plan D is about? Is that dialogue? Is this the same Commission that encourages us to inform citizens about the proposed Constitution?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as a first-time MEP, maybe I have it wrong. Maybe that is how the EU does its business. If it is, it is no wonder that citizens say no. If it is not, I would ask you to use your good offices to find out why a Commissioner has effectively cut the lines of communication with individual MEPs.</p>

What the Members present are saying is of course all very interesting, and the banners they have brought with them are very eye-catching, but I have made five unsuccessful attempts already at getting permission to speak. Perhaps it might be worth considering the possibility of giving other Members the floor in the right order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
