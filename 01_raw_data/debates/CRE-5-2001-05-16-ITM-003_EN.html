<p class="contents">Transatlantic relations are good. Today, we are working closely together within a number of areas, and our dialogue by and large comprises all the important issues. We have a shared responsibility to meet global challenges and contribute to a more peaceful and more democratic world as well as to work for a dynamic multilateral trade system. We also have differences of opinion in various areas but conduct a close dialogue on these.</p>
<p class="contents">Since our dialogue was formalised in 1990 with the adoption of the Transatlantic Declaration, it has been constantly deepened and broadened. In 1995, we also adopted the New Transatlantic Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting on Monday, the General Affairs Council welcomed the Commission’s report on how we can further strengthen the transatlantic dialogue and charged the Presidency and the Commission to ensure, together with the US, that the dialogue becomes more efficient and action oriented.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council would like to see the dialogue, which comprises regular summits, focusing on a number of strategic themes and prioritising the issues which are important for promoting continuity. The Council has particularly demanded that “the environment” and “climate” constitute one of these strategic themes.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Gothenburg Summit on 14 June, the EU and the US will jointly stake out a clear structure and focus for continued cooperation. At the Summit, all the issues which have been prioritised during the Swedish Presidency will be raised in one way or another.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the US have coordinated the initiatives designed to help Russia implement disarmament and non-proliferation agreements, particularly regarding the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme and the destruction of chemical weapons. We have also worked together within the framework of the EU’s Northern Dimension initiative. In close consultation with the forthcoming Belgian and Spanish Presidencies, we have begun multiannual cooperation on justice and home affairs, focusing on combating drugs, combating child pornography on the Internet and supporting Russia’s fight against organised crime and its consolidation of a society based on the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">We have worked together on issues related to the new economy. We have worked together on the fight against HIV/Aids and other infectious diseases in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of trade policy, the Swedish Presidency has given high priority to seeking unanimity between the EU and the US on a platform which will make it possible to launch new WTO negotiations in the autumn. In addition, we have emphasised the importance of concrete progress being made to solve the bilateral trade disputes which constitute a serious cause of irritation in our relationship. The theoretical solution to the banana dispute that was recently achieved is one example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as I said, there are also differences of opinion. The new administration’s stated opposition to the Kyoto Protocol is a source of great disappointment to us. It is highly worrying that the US, which is responsible for 25% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions, is choosing to stand aside from an international agreement negotiated over a decade. The new administration has justified its opposition to the Kyoto Protocol by the fact that it does not require the same undertakings of developing countries and is also damaging to the American economy. We do not accept these reasons, and above all we do not accept the US thereby distancing itself from the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s reaction to the actions of the US has been swift and powerful. Prime Minister Persson and Mr Prodi, President of the Commission, have criticised the decision in a letter. At the informal meeting of the environment ministers in Sweden, the Swedish chairman, Mr Larsson, stated that no individual country has the right officially to declare a multilateral agreement dead, and he expressed his hopes that the US would return and take part in the ongoing Kyoto Process.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Troika, headed by the Swedish Minister for the Environment Mr Larsson, travelled to Washington in April to continue nevertheless to attempt to maintain the dialogue with the US on the global problem of climate change. In these talks, it emerged that the US does not question the problem of climate change. The US admits the importance of finding global solutions to the problem. The EU considers that the solution is to be found within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol, while the US insists on the need to find alternative solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s goal is to make the Protocol ratifiable within the next year with or without the US. However, without the participation of the US, the Protocol will be considerably weaker. We therefore welcome the US attending the environment meeting in Bonn in July and hope to see a constructive dialogue with a fruitful exchange of views.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that both the EU and the US bear a heavy responsibility for global problems and challenges such as the threat posed by climate change. We will never get the countries of the Third World and developing countries to take action if no joint responsibility is taken by the EU and the US.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, a few words on the areas in which the EU and the US are taking, and have succeeded in taking, joint responsibility. In this context, I would particularly like to highlight our joint efforts to promote peace and stability in the Balkans, as well as our consultations on the situation in the Korean peninsula and the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Links between the EU and the US are vitally important in today’s world. It is only through cooperation and dialogue that we can meet global challenges and create the preconditions for a world of peace, democracy and economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore see with great satisfaction that the European Parliament is taking action to develop and strengthen the dialogue with the American Congress.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that a meaningful dialogue must also address issues on which the EU and the US disagree. Constructive dialogue is based on sincerity, and sincerity means not hesitating to voice criticism. This means that, in the future too, the EU will direct criticism at, for example, the US’s use of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I now look forward to hearing the opinions of the Members of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss transatlantic relations with the European Parliament. There is a lot of talk about EU-US cooperation. There are quite a few critical voices in that chorus and we read frequently about this or that cloud casting a shadow across the relationship. But in all this, I would argue, we fail to recognise the unique nature and the unique strength of the transatlantic bond, so this is an excellent opportunity to put the record straight.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate also gives me an opportunity to set out in a few words why the Commission recently presented a communication on reinforcing the transatlantic relationship and how we would hope to see that initiative followed up in Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1995 new transatlantic agenda shifted the focus of our relationship from one of consultation to joint action. Since then EU-US cooperation has broadened enormously and now embraces virtually every area of EU activity, and rightly so. We share so much with the US in terms of vision, history and values. With no one else do we have such a wide range of common interests and such a strong economic base to build on. We do not, as I shall go on to say, agree about everything, but the fact that we agree about so much means that there is always a distorting focus on the minority of issues where we do not see eye to eye.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to launch here into an inventory of EU-US cooperation. My point here is different. It is that we have an interest in virtually every area of activity of the Union to establish close and cooperative relations with the United States. I have no sympathy for anti-Americanism or anti-anyone-else-ism for that matter. I feel under no compunction to define my Europeanness in terms of my attitude to the United States of America. That sort of attitude betrays a terrible lack of self-confidence in what it means to be a European.</p>
<p class="contents">In my specific area of responsibility, the added value and positive results are obvious in our close partnership with the Balkans. The Minister also spoke, quite rightly, of the Middle East and Korea, and we could have continued like that and mentioned many other parts of the world. The European Union and the US are also principal partners in addressing the new cross-cutting issues on the international agenda. Communicable diseases, organised crime, drug and people trafficking, money laundering: all these manifestations of the dark side of globalisation require our concerted action and they get our joint attention. Access to medicines, for example, has been lifted to the top of the agenda in EU-US relations as well as in multilateral fora.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to another important point about the transatlantic partnership. It would be sad, serious and a terrible irony if the emergence of Europe as a global actor in a multilateral world coincided with the turning of some American minds towards unilateralism. I hope that will not happen. It would be the reversal of the trends of the last 50 years. I had been greatly encouraged by the new Administration's commitment to maintaining America's vital role in world affairs. President Bush chose to emphasise the point in his inaugural speech, when he said, and I quote "America remains engaged in the world by history and by choice". Obviously these hopes were somewhat deflated, as the Minister said, by the subsequent statement indicating that the Administration has no interest in implementing the Kyoto Protocol. This rightly met with dismay in Europe and elsewhere, including in parts of the United States, but clearly we must not let disappointment turn into fruitless confrontation. It is vital that we persuade the United States to embrace and maintain its multilateral commitments and we in the European Union can best help to do this, not by finger wagging and moralising, but by facing up to our own responsibilities and following through our own commitments with our financial assistance and other policy instruments. When the United States and the European Union work together, we set the international agenda. If we are divided, the opportunity for international progress is often lost.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be brief because I know there are some time constraints, but one could, of course, speak at length about security and defence cooperation as an important element of our partnership. The time has come for Europe to shoulder its fair share of the security burden. That is all we are seeking to do, to respond to American concerns that we have not been pulling our weight. As the Secretary-General of NATO, Lord Robertson, put it very succinctly last year, this is not about Europe going it alone, but about Europe doing more. A properly resourced and effective ESDP will allow the European Union to make a much larger contribution to transatlantic security. My main concern in this area is that we might fail to deliver, not that European success in delivering would antagonise the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me go back for a moment to the communication on reinforcing the transatlantic relationship, which we tabled before Easter. In many ways the method of working together which we devised in 1995 was ahead of its time, but we are not resting on our laurels and would certainly be discouraged from doing so by those who have added such an important parliamentary dimension to our relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be fair to say that over the years the machinery of cooperation has grown rather more complex than we intended. So we need to look over the structures and processes of cooperation, the architecture if you like, and the plumbing of our relations, in order to ensure that the whole machinery is geared as much as possible to action and the delivery of results.</p>
<p class="contents">The architecture is described in terms of strategic themes forming the core of the transatlantic agenda. It is a big core, because the relationship is so very wide-ranging. We identified eight such strategic themes, ranging from the emerging international security challenges, globalisation and the multilateral trading system, through energy issues and consumer protection, to the digital economy and the fight against crime.</p>
<p class="contents">These strategic themes should not be seen as a selection of priorities, but rather as overarching principles which will remain valid over several years and provide a framework for specific issues and priorities to be tackled over a shorter time period. The plumbing part of the communication looks at the so-called NTA structures and the multitude of meetings which take place within them at political and official level.</p>
<p class="contents">Our message is simple: fewer meetings, more substance and more political leadership. The first two are related to the latter, but we want political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic to set the priorities and challenges their respective administrations should meet and to set deadlines for meeting those challenges as well. This will only happen if there is real business to be done and that will only be the case if we make the meetings more focussed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an ambitious goal. The new transatlantic agenda process is like a supertanker, or maybe it is better to call it a mixed-bulk carrier. It can carry a large and varied cargo all at once. We need to ensure its design is streamlined, simple and robust to ensure smooth passage and minimum maintenance. As the honourable Members can tell, I have been thinking much about the Korean shipbuilding industry recently and its impact on global trade. At the helm you should not spin the wheel widely from side-to-side, but adjust the course with small, but well-measured turns.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end where I started. The transatlantic link in my view is our most important relationship. It is important for the European Union and for the United States and indeed for the world. Of course, we will not always agree on everything. I am not thinking just of trade issues, which should always be put in the wider perspective of the colossal trade flows, more than a USD 1 billion a day, which benefit both our regions, but also of more fundamental issues like environmental protection, on which the minister spoke, and capital punishment. There are no easy answers, no magic wands to make our differences disappear. However, on the larger range of issues, where the United States and the European Union work together, we do set between us the international agenda. By working together across the Atlantic we can advance our interests, those of our countries and their citizens, and contribute to global security more generally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So where are we today? We have a timely communication before us, which points to the breadth and growth of the transatlantic relationship from the declaration in 1990 to the new transatlantic agenda in 1995. The number of subjects it covers will continue to grow and we will probably see a consolidation of ideas on the monetary dialogue and other aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the communication contains ideas on how to make the process more effective. Thirdly, it underlines the importance of engaging civil society and building parliamentary links. But I think it is wise for us to ask whether these perspectives are really sufficient for the next five years. Common economic interests and concerns are increasingly global and not bilateral, while regionalisation is increasingly seen as an alternative to the WTO and multilateralism.</p>
<p class="contents">US security interests are shifting towards the Pacific, even if NATO and EU enlargements will demand transatlantic political management in the months ahead. It is difficult to focus together on defining common strategic interests like, for example, the Ukraine. In view of these aspects, my group considers this communication a disappointing one. It is more a stocktaking exercise than one that will encourage a broader transatlantic partnership. In other words, it does not match up to the requirements of the developing transatlantic partnership in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, for example, have fewer summits if there are going to be more rather than fewer issues to discuss? How do you prioritise the agenda if you have already set eight strategic themes? How do you include the US Congress and the European Parliament in the framework without setting out any ideas for its inclusion? The communication refers to an Interparliamentary Assembly. That is not what it is. It is a delegation which has converted itself into the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">So we need broader thinking to develop the transatlantic partnership before 2004. It is time to get away from the humdrum bulk-carrier idea; something rather more visionary, I suspect, would be required at this stage. First, we should stake out the ground for a broader transatlantic partnership. Why not make sure we can re-energise the transatlantic business dialogue? It is in some difficulty. Why not think of an annual Atlantic Summit, which would bring together the EU, the US and NATO, because politics, economics and security policy are increasingly interlinked.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should follow the ideas of the Houston Declaration of the US Congress and the European Parliament and involve the parliamentary community more in the summit process. Last and not least, we should use the summit with George W. Bush to draw up an agenda for the period until 2004, to establish a deeper transatlantic partnership and to fulfil the aims that both the Council and the Commission have said they want to achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE). </span></span>  –<span class="italic"> (ES) </span>Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ever since the end of the Second World War the transatlantic relationship has been of crucial importance. It has proved essential for peace and stability in Europe and the wider world.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand President Bush will be attending the Gothenburg Summit. Together with my group I hope Mr Bush will be made aware that obviously, we believe our relationship should be one of equals. Our dialogue must be frank and sincere. We need not be brutal, but we do have to make our concerns clear, as they have been outlined in both speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">In a world where globalisation in constantly increasing, it is worrying that the Bush Administration is glorying in unilateralism. The first sign of this was the United States’ decision not to ratify the Kyoto Agreement on climate change. There have been other more recent moves such as the threat made by the United States to withdraw from the OECDs common actions regarding tax havens. In our view, this type of policy runs counter to the quest for a stable and secure international order.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I also believe that we must convey our disquiet at the level of unilateralism currently demonstrated with regard to certain issues which concern us both. These include the peace process in the Middle East, and also the way in which America has put the brakes on the process of detente between North and South Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on the missile defence shield plan, a product of the Star Wars programme. This is extremely worrying as it could affect our security. I think that we must tell our American colleagues quite clearly that the way to increase global security is to combat poverty and combat instability in poor countries. We must not build new barriers between the rich and the poor. The creation of a missile defence shield will only lead to an increase in the number of missiles. This would go against all the efforts made since the ABM Treaty to reduce the number of missiles in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another issue we feel we should discuss with our United States’ allies. We believe we should act together in relation to the UN, not adopt unilateral measures. In the specific case of the Human Rights Commission, we should start from the premise that all countries stand for election. Sometimes one is chosen, sometimes another. There is no scope for the introduction of retaliatory measures such as the suspension of a debt which has already expired and been unilaterally reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to say that a fortnight ago I had the opportunity of leading a visit by my group to Congress in Washington. We feel we need to make direct contact, regardless of what we are told. It was a very positive visit; we were able to address the House of Representatives’ Sub-Committee on European Affairs. The dialogue was as it should be: frank, direct and sometimes tough. Nonetheless, we believe that this should become part of our future. I would therefore like to conclude saying that my group regrets that at the eleventh hour the authorities in the United States have been unable to confirm a meeting that is important both for establishing and for maintaining mutual trust. This affects you, Mr President, as rapporteur for the Echelon Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I listened with great interest to the long and sustained shipping metaphor of the Commissioner, who can now lay claim to be a master mariner of sorts. Whether it is his bulk carrier or the speedboat version that is commended by Mr Elles, I certainly think that the Commissioner's focus on deepening the relationship and on being more strategic – even if there is argument on detail – is, in broad terms very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">My group subscribes to the broad detail of the resolution, so I will not rehearse the issues. I agree with the observations of colleagues about fears of a drift in certain cases towards unilateralism, some of the points about bilateral versus multilateral trade and issues about Kyoto, the Echelon Committee, the death penalty, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to speak a little about what our role as parliamentarians should be. We have developed both informally and formally a considerable dialogue with aspects of the legislative process in the US, but as a parliamentary process it remains sub-optimal. We need to do a lot more work on that. Our unique contribution as parliamentarians to the quality of this dialogue will be in establishing a better quality of relationship, in particular with our counterparts in the US Congress. It seems to me that our mission in this regard is, both in Washington DC and in Strasbourg and Brussels, to create the playing field in which the Lamys and Zellecks – or others, depending on whether we are dealing with security and defence, or whatever – can actually play. Because it is clear, certainly in the case of Congress, that they are a major influence on the role of the US executive, and we here are a growing influence on the executive, although we still regret the pillar system that marginalises us in areas of foreign policy or in fighting crime, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is a role here, and we need to do more work on that as a unique parliamentary contribution to the playing field in which executives can deliver the goods. In that sense, I would like to pledge my group and my time to working on that.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to mention concerns globalisation: we have noted the sclerotic effect of either Congress or ourselves legislating first and discovering that the ends do not match. We need in the global context to insist on appropriate regulation, but to try to discover as parliamentarians what it is. Is it soft law or hard law? Self-regulation or co-regulation? We need now to look for some degree of legislative creativity, so that there is no sclerotic dysfunction: wanting to do the right thing, but by chance arriving at another dispute.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should put disputes in perspective, as the Commissioner has sought to do. Even bananas, Boeing, beef, etc. represent no more than 2% of the flow of transatlantic trade. Of course, they have a high priority, but they are not the whole story and we must focus on the whole story. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, we could even speak of a sort of crisis. I welcomed Mrs Lindh’s suggestion that we can also express criticism when there is cause to do so. We can undoubtedly learn from the United States some other time, when there is occasion to do so, so this is not a question of anti-Americanism, but one of factual discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">It would seem to me that what unites the European Union and the United States above all is the fact that together we are responsible, to a considerable extent, for global development, as together we make up the world’s largest trading blocs. I believe that in future, transatlantic relations should ensure that solutions to problems that are caused by the social inequality in the world are evolved and that together we seek the right tools to promote sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard the Council and the Commission are also to be praised for the fact that during the Stockholm Summit Prime Minister Persson and President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, sent a letter to the President of the United States that emphasised the importance of the Kyoto Protocol and stated in particular that its policy on climate is an essential ingredient in our understanding of transatlantic relations, and no minor issue. This is my free interpretation of the matter at least.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner’s excellent comparison with a super-tanker is something I would like to take up on more or less the same lines. I might imagine that this tanker of ours ought to have the world’s best environmentally friendly technology, and, as Mr Cox said, it should at least have a double bottom, its engine should be very powerful and its fuel as clean as possible – preferably solar energy, if possible, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that if the United States wishes to become the world’s last open-air museum of old technology – and I stress the word ‘old’- as it is refusing to start developing climate-friendly solutions, something we cannot do anything about, the European Union must, despite that, become the world’s leading region in this regard, and we can nevertheless invite the United States to join us in implementing this climate policy, which is one that also makes for good business.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to say a few words about security policy. My group is very concerned that in the United States there is an intention to use global resources for a missile defence system. We think that is likely to increase the threat to peace worldwide and that the European Union should have no part in it. Instead, try and convince the USA that security in the world is to be furthered by means of solutions based on the worldwide promotion of socially and ecologically sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First there is the legacy of the Clinton era. Even if we leave aside the serious trade differences, the emblematic banana dispute, the beef hormone dispute, the GMO dispute and a dozen others that are being or have already been examined by the WTO, we can see that in recent years, Washington had already shown growing signs of unilateralism, one of the stigmata of the superpower complex.</p>
<p class="contents">Opposition to the Treaty banning anti-personnel mines, opposition to the Charter on the Rights of the Child, opposition to the establishment of an International Criminal Court that might, one day, have to judge an American citizen, a casual approach to politics and financial blackmail of the United Nations, an economic blockade, in fact a military operation that violates international law, the Echelon affair, the Colombia plan – the list is endless. Moreover, we have hardly had a chance to hold a dialogue with our transatlantic interlocutors about certain decisions that Europeans regard as shocking in a civilised society, such as the death penalty and the refusal to grant universal access to medicines to combat AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we have to admit that the Bush Administration’s first decisions have a more serious impact than anything we have ever seen so far. We were concerned enough when we heard the new President’s advisor on security, Mrs Condoleezza Rice, describe her vision of the new distribution of labour between Americans and Europeans for the maintenance of peace in the Balkans, when she pointed out with as much perspicacity as elegance that it was not the GIs’ job to take children to nursery school.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, we can only describe the refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol and the promotion of the missile defence shield as irresponsible, not only towards Europe but towards mankind as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this escalation, are we condemned to <span class="italic">pro forma</span> protests before settling for realism? I think not. A Europe that is open to dialogue but adheres firmly to the principles of a civilised and responsible international community will find allies among the public opinion of the five continents and even in the US Congress and among a number of states.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, of course we are not trying to promote a sense of anti-Americanism or indulge in aggressive rhetoric towards a partner who is indispensable in today's world. We simply want to set out the clear political resolve of the Fifteen and their united front towards objectives that could meet the expectations not only of Europeans but of all those, in whatever part of the world, who wish to free themselves from the unipolar system in which they are increasingly being confined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is to be expected, since elections there have put a new president and a new administration into office and our obligation is to closely observe the signs reaching us from across the Atlantic. The basic feature that, I think, distinguishes the present administration from the previous one, in terms of foreign policy, centres on a return to the priority of consolidating and developing systems of alliances with those countries that show a desire to act in harmony with the Americans. This replaces the previous model, which consisted of acting on the basis of a multilateral approach sustained through a process of ongoing negotiations, intended to establish and define multilateral and universal rules, standards and values, taking the lead, of course, from the American institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the right time to analyse the practical military, diplomatic and economic consequences that this return to more traditional geopolitical concepts by the United States may involve. We should, however, bear in mind that the concept of democratic administration led to a proactive type of action, one consequence of which was the U.S. administration taking greater responsibility for and greater involvement in the details of almost daily crisis management in some part of the world. This is a concept which we feel is being abandoned. Now that this interventionist approach is being reviewed, we are beginning to agree with the Commission and the strategic direction of its document “New impulse for EU-US Relations”. What the European Union must now do is take advantage of the arrival in office of a new US administration to review the way in which transatlantic relations are conducted and to set strict priorities to ensure that the new transatlantic agenda is more productive and constructive in terms of achieving practical results. Just like the Commission, we also feel that the Union’s leaders must reach agreement on a limited number of strategic themes. They must also ensure a high level of political engagement, in order to prevent the relationship’s processes becoming too bureaucratic and cumbersome. It is amazing how often holding frequent meetings and summits with heavily laden agendas has achieved nothing but the dilution of interests and a lack of vision and clear objectives. Let us commit ourselves, then, to a renewed transatlantic cooperation, in which the European Union and the United States are able to work effectively, together and to their mutual benefit, on the various global challenges that we inevitably have to face. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not thinking only of the spiral of violence that American society feeds on and of which the string of capital punishments is only one symptom among others. In fact this society, which is based on genocide and whose values constantly give way to the law of the jungle that has been christened ‘liberalism’, can only survive by violence; that, in the end, is something that does not concern us.</p>
<p class="contents">What does concern us, however, is the custom of American policy to do what it wants where it wants in the world and to disregard all the international rules, including those it imposes on others. I am thinking here of the Kyoto agreements. Nor should we forget Washington's refusal to sign the agreement on nuclear testing, which the United States regards as applying to all states except itself, and a whole range of other agreements that show that Washington wants to tie down every state in the world without being bound in any way itself. Let us also remember the scandalous Echelon affair, which shows that Big Brother intends to keep watch over the entire planet while not accepting any right of inspection itself, as proved also by the insolent and scandalous reception recently given to our committee of inquiry into the network that brought his imperial highness to power. Worst of all, we are behaving like a rabbit fascinated by the boa constrictor or snake about to bite it and we are obeying this imperial policy; my last hope is that France will resist this general tendency of the world to grovel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is much more to unite us than to divide us. Clearly, however, our opinions do differ in a number of areas. Both the Commission and the Council recognise this. The purpose of the Transatlantic Dialogue is precisely to provide an opportunity to tackle these.</p>
<p class="contents">We must discuss the Kyoto Protocol, and also the missile shield, which will affect our finances as well as our security. We ought to talk about the death penalty, and consider the issue of drugs too. In tackling this problem we must assume shared responsibility and comply with international law. We must also consider the subject of globalisation, as the Commissioner has mentioned. I think it is incumbent upon the United States and Europe to ensure that the outcome of these discussions proves positive rather than negative. We should also stress the importance of developing trade. We must welcome the initiative taken by the US at the Quebec Summit with a view to creating a free trade area for the Americas. We should be delighted that they reached the conclusion that this trade initiative should have a democratic basis. We have enshrined this in our cooperation agreements with third countries. As was made clear yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs in Mr Patten’s presence, these agreements include a democratic clause and have already been in existence for ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to pose one single question, and that is whether the Bush Administration is going to continue the Clinton Administration’s practice of exempting European companies from the application of Article III of the Helms-Burton law.

It is important to stress the scale of the economic relationship currently worth USD 2 billion a day, but where there is competition there will inevitably be some areas of conflict and friction, and part of the nature of the relationship is to try and contain that friction. I would like to quote from a Commission document about how to avoid or minimise new trade disputes. It says that we should consult before legislating, negotiate before litigating, compensate before retaliating and comply at any rate. That might be a lofty target but one worth aiming for.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to comment too on Commissioner Patten's very welcome statement that he did not see any connection between being European and anti-Americanism. He is absolutely right. To be European is also to encompass a generous inclusivity about people's notions very different from our own. There are of course important outstanding trade disputes, the foreign sales tax one in particular, and it was worrying, to say the least, that President Clinton's last speech before he left office contained some barely veiled threats about the future of the Airbus deal and a possible dispute.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I want to commend the part of the resolution that welcomes the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue on which this Parliament has set such great store, and I very much hope we want that to continue and be strengthened as part of a constructive and good-tempered dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So I welcome the strong language in our compromise resolution on this. But we need more than words. We want the Commission to look at possible EU actions in response to a continued US refusal to respond to climate change, including action at the WTO, on the grounds that by not internalising its external energy costs, US goods are receiving an unfair government subsidy, which is against the rules of world trade.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is not just Kyoto. Let us look as well at this intent to tear up the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. This "Son of Star Wars" system threatens a massive new arms race. Asking the US to consult before proceeding is not enough. We need to state very clearly that the EU calls on the US to give up this initiative and pledges itself and its Member States not to take part in this project on any level.</p>
<p class="contents">If the US spent just a fraction of the resources it currently spends on missile defence on defending itself against climate change instead, the world would be a much safer place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that we should take up this offer and start looking at trade policy as a way of broadening transatlantic relations as a whole. We all know that NATO will still need to play a major role in the collective defence of Europe for a long time to come.</p>
<p class="contents">We seem, understandably, to have lost all awareness of common security since 1990, which is why we need to ensure that relations between the United States of America and Europe are strengthened in every other political field. We should take up this offer by the US Administration.</p>
<p class="contents">In doing so, we should also further the opportunity for relations between our House and the American Congress, provided that we can make our contribution here. You only need look at the difficulties we have experienced with data protection over recent years, because we have no jointly agreed legislation for global economic areas, to see just how far the transatlantic legislators' dialogue needs to go.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, if I may, to address one last point: the United States are now the only superpower in the world and they approach foreign policy problems as such. Their relations with Russia are predicated on this global position, while Europe defines its position from a regional standpoint and sees it in the context of the enlargement process. But that should not mean that we pass up the opportunity to pursue a joint strategic approach in this region. I have a feeling that we have not pursued a joint policy in connection with Ukraine over recent weeks. Now that the westward looking government has been ousted and Chernomyrdin has taken over as governor with the title ambassador to Kiev, it is obvious that we have made strategic blunders which we must not underestimate and which – to my chagrin – we have not discussed even once in the General Council this week.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, our Socialist group is concerned about, and opposed to, the unilateral plans of President Bush to invest trillions in the high-tech weapons industry via a missile defence system, hence both jeopardising the ABM Treaty and possibly provoking a new arms race. It is of fundamental importance that we should oppose the arms race. We want multilateral cooperation and agreements, and support for a reformed UN. We want Europe and America to work together to that end. Unilateral action by either Europe or the US is an anachronism in an age when we are jointly responsible in our global village. It is precisely that joint responsibility which will lead us in Europe to share and take responsibility within NATO, via the rapid intervention force, via the payment of some 80% of the costs of reconstruction in the Balkans. Conversely we therefore ask the US to cooperate in conflict prevention and development aid, and to pay its contributions to the UN, because as Social-Democrats we see that some 100 conflicts in our global village are being caused by poverty, underdevelopment and ethnicity. The best security shield is the battle against poverty. That battle is the best guarantee of security against fundamentalist terror of an ethnic or religious nature, warlords and rogue states. We need a new, wide-ranging attitude to security and we hope that at the forthcoming meeting in Gothenburg, the Commission and the Council will make that attitude a central item on the agenda, in the open, frank, free and confident dialogue with President Bush. That is the route we should like to take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are each other’s largest trading partners and by cooperating the EU and the US can play a decisive role in tackling international trade issues. Now that Europe is on its way towards greater unanimity in the foreign and security field too, the necessity of working together will grow even greater. In fields like environmental protection and limiting CO2 emissions cooperation will be decisive.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Dutch press, there was an appeal to President Bush in letter form from what the author himself called “the profitable part of American industry” asking the president not to listen only to inefficient companies when environmental decisions were involved. Robust environmental legislation makes companies more innovative, more technology-oriented and more efficient. At yesterday’s Kangaroo Group lunch, Mr Zoellic said that in his view and that of his government not every problem in the private sector needs to be solved by the government. If I combine both things, it may be possible to reach new agreements with the US. Whether an agreement is called Kyoto or New York is a matter of supreme indifference to us. But we must get down to work together.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns parliamentary relations. For some years, we have been enjoying better relations. The Legislators Dialogue has gained momentum and has begun to bear fruit. However, since a new Congress has taken office with all the changes in personnel that that involves, it seems difficult to make real contacts. The collective memory on the US side appears to have been erased. We are starting completely from scratch. That is all the more regrettable since our trade disputes could have been effectively prevented by the “early warning” system within the TABD and the Legislators Dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is still too early to express real concern. See my observation as part of a European “early warning” system. A light is on, but it is not yet red. But what will happen in a world where the word of a superpower is no longer worth the paper it is written on? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is cause for concern over the EU-US partnership in this particular area. I appreciate the clarity with which the Swedish Presidency addressed these issues in the introduction.</p>
<p class="contents">Experts are increasingly unanimous on the problems of global warming and its consequences. In addition, it is clearly the responsibility of the richer countries to reach an international agreement by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. The US has particular responsibility, as the country has by far the largest emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is how we react. Should our reaction lead to a strong anti-American position? No, of course not. However, we should continue adopting a clear and frank stance in our dialogue with the US on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the US has not undertaken ratification must not prevent us in the EU from making progress. We have to take the lead in the world with regard to ratification and continue the dialogue with the US in order to bring the country on board in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">That must be our position. The Summit in Gothenburg is an excellent opportunity to bring up the issues – in addition to the visit by President Bush, the Gothenburg Summit also has sustainable development as its main theme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our primary objective must be to adopt reasonable harmonised provisions in order to develop a transatlantic transport market – be it in air or sea transport – and to work towards global regulations based on harmonised regulations between the USA and Europe, for example in the area of air traffic noise. We do not want to end up at loggerheads with the Americans again over hushkitted aeroplanes; on the contrary, we must endeavour to regulate environmental protection and safety standards in advance, jointly and proactively.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just a task for the Commission and the US Administration. We must try, as part of the transatlantic parliamentary dialogue, to organise specialist debates between transport experts in the American congress and the European Parliament so as to avoid political pressure between the administrations or, as the result of pressure from lobbyists, by the administrations. We must fight together for greater environmental protection and greater safety. This will greatly benefit our people, avoid conflicts between the USA and Europe and could form the basis for an overall joint solution.</p>

I need not remind Members how crucial this dialogue is with a view to achieving cooperation between equal partners, between the United States of America and the European Union. The dialogue allows us to deal with our differences and to settle some of our old trade disputes; here I am thinking in particular of bananas, an issue we finally resolved a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise the importance of the question of European defence, an issue I regard as extremely important, in particular now that we are dealing with a new American Administration that has already openly advertised its defence projects. It is quite clear that President Bush's Administration is far more distrustful of the ESDP than President Clinton's was, but that does not surprise me. It took the Union several years to explain its objectives, define its means and convince its American ally that a European defence system could be developed alongside NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we must at all costs protect this achievement of the transatlantic dialogue. The concept of an ally must not be a one-way road. I believe that the Union has shown itself to be entirely transparent in the way it has presented the CESP, followed by the ESDP, to the United States and I think it should make it just as clear that the United States must consult its allies on all major projects, of which the anti-missile shield project is one.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding European defence policy as such, we must continue to state firmly what we want, as we always have done, and not systematically look at every European defence question in terms of NATO's reaction. The Union has always emphasised the importance of complementarity between European action and Alliance action, especially in relation to the Petersberg tasks. The issue here is neither competition nor disengagement, but simply a united approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
