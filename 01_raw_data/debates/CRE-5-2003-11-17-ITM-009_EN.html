That directive includes some aspects of the commercial diesel proposal and notably it gives Member States the possibility to apply differential tax rates to commercial diesel and non-commercial diesel.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the energy tax directive is still based on the principle of minimum rates only. Hence, it does not remedy the problem of distortion of competition on road haulage markets, which stems from the significant differences in diesel taxation in the Member States. Only harmonisation, or at least a greater approximation, of commercial diesel taxation will put an end to those distortions of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Three parliamentary committees, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have broadly supported the Commission's proposals for that reason.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the debates in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have also shown that there is wide recognition of the existence of such distortions. However, that committee does not share the views of the Commission on the need and the means to reduce those distortions of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I recall that, according to Article 93 of the Treaty, provisions for the harmonisation of legislation concerning excise duties must be adopted to the extent that such harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and proper functioning of the internal market. It is clear that the distortions of competition resulting from the very significant differences in excise duties applied to diesel by the Member States are a threat to the functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the Commission reacted positively to many amendments contemplated by the rapporteur of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and other Members of Parliament. In particular, the Commission could in principle have accepted the following three items. Firstly, the creation of an indexed fluctuation band for excise duties applicable to commercial diesel. Such a fluctuation band could be considered a 'second best' if a harmonised rate for commercial diesel cannot be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The second item is the alignment of the present proposal with the terms of the energy tax directive, in particular as far as the definition of commercial diesel and tax rates are concerned. Third, there is the issue of the implementation of a refund system, as a practical tool for differentiating duties for commercial and non-commercial diesel.</p>
<p class="contents">To my surprise, it appeared that these amendments were subsequently not considered by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to be sufficient to allow support for the Commission's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Council, according to the minutes concerning the adoption of the energy tax directive, is clearly committed to pursuing its work on the commercial diesel proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">For the reasons I have given, the Commission is still convinced of the merits of this proposal. I would invite Members of Parliament to consider their position on this issue very carefully before the vote on it this week. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kauppi (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately I cannot share the Commission’s view that the time is ripe for this proposal, which aims at full harmonisation of excise duties for commercial diesel. My criticism mainly concerns the following matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I will start with the reasoning behind the proposal: is there really a problem? The Commission mentions two primary reasons for its proposal: protection of the environment and fair competition in the Internal Market. Whilst being a staunch supporter of both these aspects, I have my doubts as to whether the proposal as drafted will have the desired effects.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the environmental effects should be seen in a wider context. It is questionable whether the proposal will have any environmental benefit worth mentioning. The Commission, citing evidence which can best be described as anecdotal, contends that trucks make unnecessary detours to fill up their sizeable tanks in countries where excise duties, and hence prices at the pump, are lower. The proposal contains a reference to a 1997 OECD report, which concluded that ‘gasoline tourism’ accounted for 20% of sales in Switzerland, for example. Even if one accepted this figure, there is no way of knowing whether this is a real substitution – that truckers are not filling up before departing from the country of origin – or whether this is a result of drivers making detours in order to fill up in certain countries. I wonder whether this really is a problem of such magnitude as to merit such a far-reaching measure, total harmonisation, as proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither am I at all convinced that it is even desirable to eliminate differences in excise duty between Member States. I am of the opinion that an element of tax competition is very healthy, especially as the proposed harmonisation drive would result in higher taxes in most Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, coming as I do from a peripheral region of the Union, I would say that I consider that regional aspects must also be taken into account. Scandinavian truckers are unlikely to be affected by gasoline tourism in the same way as German or Belgian haulage companies allegedly are in the congested regions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this proposal has been tabled outside its proper context. Although there are a number of references to the ongoing debate on a new transport policy framework and the proposal to introduce a charge on infrastructure use, there has been no real discussion of the interaction between these two initiatives. The Commission has presented concrete proposals on infrastructure charges and taxes, so it would have been better if these measures had been proposed simultaneously. Otherwise, there is a clear risk that an excessive burden will be placed on the transport sector in the form of increased diesel taxes and raised infrastructure charges. While it is true that the proposed Article 8(e) makes reference to this problem, it only applies during the transitional period, and only to trucks weighing less than 16 tonnes.</p>
<p class="contents">How, moreover, will this proposal affect the new Member States, some of which at present apply taxes that are significantly lower than those in force in the EU at the moment? Is it, as the Commission suggests, realistic to expect a harmonised tax rate to apply to all 25 Member States by 2012? I fear that massive price hikes in several new Member States would place such tremendous burdens on them – quite apart from increasing inflation at a time when they are striving to bring down their inflation levels to qualify for EMU membership – that this development is not politically possible. Besides, the candidate countries have already done a lot to adapt to the current minimum tax rate and already the relatively modest increase foreseen in the Directive on energy tax may pose difficulties for some countries.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the Commission’s reasons for tabling this rather complex proposal is to bring the tax rate for passenger cars rapidly in line with the rate for unleaded petrol. The Commission justifies this sort of tax treatment from the environmental point of view. We have to consider what impact the harmonisation of these tax rates would have, for example, on R&amp;D for diesel engines. We must also bear in mind that at the moment, in a competitive market, European manufacturers are market leaders in the area of diesel technology. We must also consider what impact this will have on the petroleum industry and oil refineries as, with the proposal, diesel consumption is likely to decline.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that before the summer recess I tried to make some amendments to this proposal, to make it possible for Parliament to adopt it. I only received verbal assurances from the Commission, however, that the change Parliament desires will in fact be what the Commission pushes for in the Council. It is very unsatisfactory that the consultation procedure in Parliament will either have to reject the proposal or give the Commission <span class="italic">carte blanche </span>in its negotiations with the Council. I therefore hope that in future a new constitutional agreement will allow the use of the codecision procedure and qualified majority decision-making in matters of taxation, making it much easier for Parliament to adopt a Commission proposal with certain amendments and return to the issue at second reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be shortsighted to try to attain the Kyoto targets at the expense of those who create employment, if no previous attempt had been made to exploit all the opportunities which transport affords for reducing emissions. The EU has already concluded agreements, for example with European car manufacturers, concerning production of cars which are cleaner and perform better in terms of fuel economy. The directive now before us is important for efforts to achieve the same end from the demand side by making costs visible to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is just a pity that the Commission proposal comes on its own. For it to be adopted, it ought to be discussed in a broad context: within a decade it is proposed to establish a European tax system comprising charges for vehicle registration and use, an intelligent pricing system for infrastructure, and harmonised fuel taxes. As it is not possible to adopt such a comprehensive approach now, and as this directive fixes the level of fuel taxes for quite a long time, a decision seems unlikely.</p>
<p class="contents">A comprehensive review would be in the interests of consumers and would ensure balanced development of transport in sparsely populated regions where no public transport is available. In rural and remote regions, people are more dependent on private cars, and the external costs of transport are lower than elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">People have a tendency to reconsider their choices only when a major change occurs, such as when moving house, transferring to a new place of employment or buying a new car; they may not even realise substantial developments in public services have been made. Accordingly, big changes in immediately perceptible costs, such as fuel prices or road pricing, are important initiators of choice processes. In that sense, a linear model for increasing excise on fuel may be too slow and gradual to spur consumers genuinely to perceive the situation in such a way as to change their consumption patterns. At all events, it is important from the outset to stress in public information the ultimate objective of internalising the external costs of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Diesel vehicles consume less fuel and produce fewer carbon dioxide emissions. It must, however, be remembered that they emit more nitrogen oxides and particulates, which are a serious threat to public health. It may be considered a justified objective, therefore, to align the rates of excise duty on diesel and petrol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I naturally respect the fact that many are opposed to tax harmonisation on principle. There is of course a value in countries’ determining their own taxes because these fund a significant proportion of welfare provision which, as is known, differs from one Member State to another. Even if it is important as a matter of principle to stand up for the right of individual nations to determine their taxes, this principle should not, however, be honoured to the point at which it becomes counterproductive. In certain areas, common tax rates have a clear added value. Diesel fuel tax is one such area. There are a number of drawbacks to having different tax rates on diesel fuel in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, different tax rates militate against fair competition between EU companies, for which it costs more in one country than in another to transport their products. It creates an imbalance in competition between companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this difference encourages what is known as fuel tourism. I have myself worked in the transport industry, driving heavy lorries. I know that drivers travel hundreds of extra kilometres to buy cheap diesel fuel. Not only that, but they attach additional tanks to their lorries so as to be able to fill up with enough fuel to make their journeys that much more profitable. Naturally, this fuel tourism also contributes to further destroying the environment. We work an unnecessary number of hours on the roads, and the number of accidents is increasing. That is the price we have to pay for the large discrepancies that currently prevail in the tax area.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this situation, involving big differences in taxation, creates scope for social dumping. The gap between different transport costs in different countries is widening, and this makes room for social dumping. The environment, road safety, employees’ conditions and fair conditions of competition will be the overall losers if we retain an arrangement within the EU involving large differences in fuel costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Kauppi, you are quite right to say that the Commission proposal leaves room for improvement, but I cannot be satisfied with the outcome of the vote in the lead committee, which rejected it. With this proposal for harmonising the taxation of diesel fuel used for commercial purposes, the Commission has taken a courageous step in the right direction, one in which the lead committee was not prepared to join it, thus ignoring the recommendations in its favour in the opinions of the advisory committees.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, the Commission proposal has two ends in mind. It envisages disentangling the tax rules on fuels, for commercial purposes on the one hand and for private use on the other, and, secondly, duties on diesel fuel in commercial use are to be harmonised, the object being to avoid distortions of competition. Competition, though, is distorted not only when rates of duty are not harmonised, but also because drivers work and drive for different periods of time. That should not, however, be a reason to reject the proposal, but rather a reason for improving it. After all, Parliament has always encouraged and endorsed measures aimed at opening up markets and making competition fair. Harmonisation is, moreover, intended to avoid the customary detours and the damage to the environment that results from them. It cannot be denied that ‘gasoline tourism’ is commonplace nowadays, and it is partly responsible for the damage to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">So how do things now stand with the outcome? Firstly, it does not get to grips with the alignment of competition conditions in the transport business, which is so urgently needed. Secondly, this decision amounts to a retrograde step in terms of environmental policy as well. This is lamentable, and it is my belief that it would have made sense, particularly at the present time, for the Commission to improve its proposal in order to tackle the deplorable state of affairs to which I have referred. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have not rejected the proposal or said that the whole thing is preposterous. There are very many approaches, and they are all right, but, if we are thinking in terms of the whole picture, there are still very many questions left to be resolved. I think that the harmonisation of fuel excise duties makes sense, but does that achieve its purpose if we retain differences in taxation, tolls, road pricing and vehicle taxes?</p>
<p class="contents">If we are in favour of an internal market, we also have to think about the effects on the environment. Does it really make ecological sense for us, in this directive, to favour heavy goods vehicles by separating the diesel and excise duty rates for the commercial and private sectors? Are diesel cars not urgently needed to bring about a reduction in CO2 emissions? We therefore cannot see any justification for aligning the excise duty rates for diesel and petrol. Are there not circumstances under which this uncontrolled abundance of divergent diesel tax rates might result in abuses, and lead to an abuse of the trust of all those who took on board higher acquisition costs when they changed over to diesel?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude, then, by saying that something remains to be done about tax in relation to the internal market, but many issues still have to be resolved before we can describe the cost-benefit equation as balanced. I am, therefore, rather surprised that, on page 24 of tomorrow’s communication by the Commission to the European Parliament, it is stated in the working programme for 2004 that this directive is already to be transposed, even though we are today discussing the need for the Commission to submit a new proposal. Only if the new Commission proposal is quick in coming will we be able to achieve the working programme’s objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are dealing here, of course, with a typical case for mainstreaming. I very much wish the traditional transport sector were as keen on proper Europe-wide regulation as it is on combating distortions of competition. It is simply that certain things have to be considered as a whole; I mention this just by way of introduction.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamentally speaking, Commissioner, I do of course share the Commission’s view that harmonising indirect taxes makes sense as a means of guaranteeing the proper functioning of the internal market. Arguments based on fair competition and the protection of the environment always go down well with the public. In this instance, though, the subject matter has to be seen in a more nuanced light. On the one hand, we are dealing with what I would almost call the Commission’s inability to fashion a more comprehensive policy for the public in the transport sector, and, on the other hand, the finance ministers want to raise more money by increasing duties on diesel fuel.</p>
<p class="contents">The way in which road and rail interact demonstrates a policy of isolation rather than one of integration. In the same way that we need a comprehensive transport concept for Europe, so we also need an overall concept for all taxes on motor vehicles, tolls and the transport infrastructure costs directive. It has to be seen as a whole, as a single package. Only in this context would the alignment of diesel tax be sensible and feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">In the proposal for a directive, the Commission has also referred to the sharp increase in the number of privately owned diesel cars and regretted the revenue lost to the Member States’ budgets. It describes this as an error in need of correction. It is regrettable that it had nothing further to say about the owners of these vehicles, which are as a rule cheaper and use less fuel, who have, up until now, been able to drive more economically with diesel. It is worth examining more closely the question of who drives these vehicles. As a rule, their drivers are workers who are obliged to travel to work by car every day because no other options are available. In some states, these vehicles make up over 50% of private cars.</p>
<p class="contents">European tax policy meant that it was precisely this factor that had a decisive effect on the car market, and environmental concerns have eventually resulted in improved technology in this sector. It is, I believe, precisely in this context that this issue needs to be considered more fully. I do not think that the underlying thinking is wrong or bad, but simply that the proposal needs to be revised or reworked. As it stands at present, it is not exactly in line with our thinking. My group recommends that the Commission should submit a new proposal, and advocates the rejection of the one put before us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We see this from the many vicissitudes that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has gone through since we dealt for the first time with the issue of tax on diesel fuel. Of course, the debate in the House this evening also indicates this.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank my fellow MEP, Mrs Kauppi, for the typically assiduous and ambitious work she has done. This time – this once, I hope – I must however inform you that the majority of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party do not share her conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, we can agree that the Commission proposal entails problems, difficult issues and delicate considerations. My conclusion, nonetheless, is that it is a pity that the committee’s majority could not have built upon what was good about the proposal and improved it instead of rejecting it in its entirety, something now proposed by both the big political groups. I therefore share Mr Bolkestein’s opinion on this matter, and I shall explain why.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the ELDR Group’s amendment is about tax coordination, not harmonisation. We propose allowing taxes to vary and fluctuate within a broad tax band, providing scope for the Member States’ own judgments without dispensing with what is good about the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission proposal is of course about improving the environment. I certainly think that a number of the arguments sound like just a lot of excuses. Tax competition may, I agree, be a good thing, but not if the environment suffers as a result. Environmental and energy taxes are the taxes I believe can be decided at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the big differences between the Member States damage the internal market. To maintain, as Mrs Kauppi does, that there is no diesel fuel tourism is, in actual fact, to put one’s head in the sand – or possibly in the tank – and not see what is actually going on.</p>
<p class="contents">A modified Commission proposal would be good for the environment, strengthen the internal market and improve competition. That is something to which opposition in this House should be impossible on the part either of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats or on the part of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. Let us not end up recoiling in fear or engaging in exaggerated rhetoric every time we debate a proposal containing the word ‘tax’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before I presented my comments I re-read the Commission proposal, the document of 24 July, and, both personally and on behalf of my group, I find the proposal made by your services to be of a very high quality, because it gives a very positive diagnosis and clearly explains the impact that we can expect from this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to once again stress to my fellow Members that the Commission made an extremely progressive proposal, which can be expected to have an impact in 2010-2012 for the candidate countries. It begins with an extremely weak central rate, which is the simple indexation of the rate that was in force as early as 1992 and, it is true, this means that some States will have to raise these rates.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the comment from fellow Members, to the effect that an overall package should be proposed, is nothing more than a ploy to sidestep the issue; in other words, agreement will not be reached on the entirety of the measures proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say – and in my view this is one of the reasons why this proposal was rejected by the main political groups – that you are obviously stressing the issue of distortion of competition but, if you carefully read the Commission proposal, you will clearly see that it seeks not, for example, to increase the overall tax burden of the States, it involves reorganising the national tax systems. For example, one proposal, which we support, is to reduce taxes on transport infrastructure and instead, to favour taxation according to use, which is the same index as that of the ‘polluter-pays’. It is clear that States do not want interference in the tax systems, but they are wrong. I would also like to say that, as regards the plan for sustainable development, the Commission paper stresses, according to the European Environment Agency that the external cost of transport represents 8% of GNP. I think that the Commission is right to stress that if the Council wants to respect the objectives, in particular regarding reducing pollutant emissions for private cars, then it must follow your proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bolkestein, you have the full support of my group, but I know that this will be insufficient. Nevertheless, we continue to battle on together; we will get there one day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As befits a true Dutchman, I always fill up there, paying Luxembourg prices. Normally, I fill up in the Netherlands, but if I travel through Luxembourg on my way to Strasbourg anyway, it does work out as more cost-effective.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission’s explanatory note to the harmonisation proposal, countless drivers drive extra miles to fill up cheaper elsewhere. This strikes me as illogical and certainly not a reason for tabling a far-reaching proposal for harmonisation. I therefore find this proposal very worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">My first objection is that the proposal is not in keeping with other proposals for tackling environmental problems as a result of mobility and transport. In addition, I regard the proposed harmonisation of excise duty on fuel as an undesirable measure in view of the Member States’ sovereignty in the area of taxation. Mrs Kauppi is right to note that any taxation competition is healthy as it is.</p>
<p class="contents">I have therefore joined with Mrs Lulling and Mrs Villiers in proposing in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to reject the proposal, and we have been backed by a large majority. I urge my fellow MEPs to follow our position and reject the proposal for harmonisation.</p>

The average tax rate in Europe already stands at over 40%, which is markedly higher than in Japan and the USA, and with its consequences we are all familiar. We have to contend with rising unemployment, fewer enterprises being set up, and declining levels of investment. The Commission is aware of these facts, yet it nevertheless advocates the introduction of tax increases, taking away the dirty work from the Member States’ finance ministers, who increase the taxes and shuffle off responsibility onto the EU. Doing this would be simple if we were to jointly commit ourselves to making the internal market a reality and were to ensure that the competition rules were not cut back. As the Member States would have to commit themselves to slimmed-down structures, this would automatically reduce their administrative obstacles and taxes. If we do not seize this opportunity, Europe will become an ever-expanding giant, but one enfeebled and dried out. It could also mean a great idea running into the buffers.

Over and above that, it seeks to completely harmonise duties on diesel for commercial purposes by 2010, which would end up amounting, for most Member States, to a tax increase and therefore an increase in the price of diesel.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, moreover, proposed – without considering the devastating effects on diesel technology – to raise the tax rate on diesel to the level of that on unleaded petrol. As our rapporteur has already described, that is completely absurd. Faced with the Commission’s regrettably uncompromising attitude towards the amendments proposed in a spirit of goodwill by our rapporteur Mrs Kauppi, the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, of whom I am one, voted by a massive majority – of twenty-three votes and two abstentions – to reject the Commission proposal in its entirety, and it did so for the many good reasons to which reference has already been made.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of the Commission proposal would be a complicated system of rebates, one that would be bureaucratic, expensive and practically unworkable. It would leave us wide open to further tax fraud, with which we are already familiar in the context of VAT, and I personally agree with what our rapporteur has already said, namely that healthy fiscal competition is desirable and helpful in terms of stimulating economic growth; I certainly do not believe that it distorts competition in the internal market. What is the point of imposing even higher taxes on our businesses at a time when the economic environment has for some years been characterised by stagnation and unemployment? Such a thing is absurd, and I hope that the Commission will listen to our rapporteur and will put before us a complete and properly thought-out package to coordinate, among other things, the tax treatment of fuel and charges for the use of infrastructures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are justified because they constitute an essential factor for the smooth operation of the internal market, by attempting to eliminate or alleviate the anomalous situation of vehicle and fuel markets that are enormously segmented. These initiatives are to be welcomed because they systematically prioritise an approach that takes account of the environmental impact of traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">Transport and mobility are, today, crucial factors for the pricing of goods and services and it is, therefore, crucial that in no way do they constitute breaches of competition. This does not mean, however, that there can now be complete harmonisation of fuel taxation even if this is spread over time. A degree of competition in taxation is, of course, perfectly acceptable if it leads to tangible benefits for consumers. The ultimate aim of all Community initiatives and proposals for initiatives must be to meet the needs of Europe’s citizens, either by making goods available and guaranteeing their quality, by ensuring the environmental sustainability of societies or by gradually reducing the costs of accessing this type of goods.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, in this specific wording, does not look as though it will help to achieve significant results in the field of environmental protection and could even lead to pressure to raise prices. Furthermore, an initiative of this nature can only be accepted by the Council if it is integrated and coordinated with the directive on the taxation of energy products and with the proposal for a framework directive on infrastructure charging.</p>
<p class="contents">The political complexity of this issue and the difficulties in managing, in the context of this directive, the administrative aspects of its implementation, specifically those concerning the distinction between fuel used for commercial purposes and fuel for private use, and the consequent return or refund of duties, justify the reserved standpoint of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The Commission must view the possible rejection of this proposal, however, as a spur for drawing up a new draft that takes account of the suggestions and proposals made in the European Parliament, respecting the immediate interest of the citizens and contributing to overcoming the inevitable resistance of some Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The English text says that 'the Council shall establish measures'. The word 'shall' indicates that the Council has no choice but to harmonise the excise duties insofar as they are an obstacle to the internal market. So do not tell the Commission that this is anything to do with fiscal sovereignty. Article 93 of the Treaty says that the Council must harmonise excise taxes if they are an obstacle to the proper functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is then raised as to whether there is an obstacle to the proper functioning of the internal market. Mr Blokland said that he did not think it logical for lorries and cars to go out of their way to go to Luxembourg to fill up with diesel. Let me give you some figures. These figures pertain to diesel sales per head of population. They run as follows: 610 litres for Belgium, 531 for Denmark, 424 for Spain and 536 for France. These figures are all in the area of 400 to 500 to 600 litres per head of population. Then there is Luxembourg. Where the amounts in all other Member States do not go over 640 – this is the figure for Austria – in Luxembourg the figure is 3 106.</p>
<p class="contents">Now why should that be the case? It is quite simply because the excise duties in Luxembourg are dreadfully low, and therefore it is an open and shut case that there is a distortion of the internal market here. There is not a shadow of a doubt about that. If Mr Blokland says that is not very logical then I am afraid I cannot follow the logic of Mr Blokland. In my view it is perfectly logical that lorries and cars go out of their way to line up in Luxembourg. If you travel to Luxembourg you will see the long line of lorries all trying to fill up with that cheap diesel. So there is no doubt that there is a distortion of the internal market here. That is one of the reasons why the Commission is making this proposal, which is to be considered by the Council after Parliament has given its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason – and Mr Jonckheer was very eloquent in pointing this out – is that the implementation of this proposal will lead to a general reduction in emissions of pollutants, such as NOx, volatile organic compounds, SO2 and particulates. There will also be a reduction in CO2 emissions. That is the reason that the environmental NGOs support this proposal. Mr Jonckheer is quite right in pointing this out to his colleagues. He ended his speech by saying that his support will probably not be sufficient. I am not so pessimistic. I think that after this debate many Members of Parliament will realise that there is a distortion of competition, that harmonising excise duties on diesel is good for the environment, and that Article 93 lays the obligation – not the choice – on the Council to do it. That is also what the Commission is trying to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is far from the intention of the Commission to go for an increase in taxes. That is the last thing the Commission would like to do. Member States are perfectly free to cut their taxes elsewhere if they have to increase the excise taxes on diesel. So do not think that the Commission wants to do that. It is certainly not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the situation of the future Member States, may I stress that during the enlargement negotiations, all the future Member States agreed to apply the current minimum rates on motor fuels as of 1 May 2004, the date on which they will become Member States. Most of them, except the Baltic States, are already at levels above those rates.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blokland asked me what my reaction would be if Parliament were to reject this proposal. Once again, this is not something I expect. However, if that were the case, then, in accordance with the arrangements between Parliament and the Commission, I shall raise the issue in the College of Commissioners in order to consider carefully the Commission's position under those circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the amendments, as I have already said, the Commission could accept the creation of an indexed fluctuation band for excise duties applicable to commercial diesel as a second-best solution. It could also accept the alignment of the present proposal with the terms of the energy tax directive, in particular as far as the definition of commercial diesel and tax rates are concerned. Therefore, the Commission agrees in principle with Amendments 1, 3 to 12 and 14 to 16. Amendments 2 and 13 are acceptable in part, subject to some rewording when they refer to establishing a connection between this directive and the directive on infrastructure charging. The Commission does not support Amendment 17 because the proposed rates are not consistent with the energy tax directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal may look complicated but it is dead simple. It is beneficial to the environment. It goes against the distortion of the internal market as it has to in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not know how good Commissioner Bolkestein was at geography in primary school, but I have to point out that Luxembourg just happens to be where it is, and when Mr Blokland travels from Holland to Strasbourg, he is not indulging in ‘gasoline tourism’ if he does so by way of Luxembourg. That is the easiest way to get here, and it just so happens that he has to fill up his tank <span class="italic">en route</span>. That, after all, is one of the common market’s freedoms – free movement of goods, of capital, of people, and so on – and it is one of these fundamental freedoms, the free movement of goods and services, that the Commission is now seeking to jeopardise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that, every day, 100 000 people cross the border into Luxembourg every day to work, coming from Belgium, Germany and France. They are entitled to fill up their tanks there. We are creating jobs for 100 000 commuters across national borders, who would otherwise be hanging around on the street in France and in Belgium. Your arguments, Commissioner, do not hold water, and I find it regrettable that you have presumed to adduce them.</p>
