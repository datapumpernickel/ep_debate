<p class="contents">This new proposal by the Commission for a directive on market access to port services meets the requirements already identified by the Commission back in 2001 when it adopted its first proposal on the matter. The proposal we are debating was presented by my predecessor, Mrs de Palacio. It pursues the same objectives as the previous proposal, namely to ensure that port services are freely provided, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty – as confirmed by the European Council via the Lisbon Agenda – the completion of the internal market in the port sector and the implementation of the conclusions of the 2001 White Paper on transport, which put forward solutions designed to reduce congestion on the road network and to increase cohesion with the peripheral regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, all of this should be done in complete accordance with the regulations in force relating not only to the environment – the regulation on maritime safety and security – but, above all, to social employment and to social protection. Furthermore, the text stipulates that the Commission shall adopt guidelines on state aid for ports and that the ports concerned must comply with the provisions of the Commission directive on financial transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to underline the importance of having efficient ports: ports are a vital link in the transport chain and in the development of the motorways of the sea. Ninety percent of our external traffic passes through our ports. We need a clear framework of rules that promote investment in our ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has made the changes it felt were necessary in relation to the text that was rejected in 2003. I am nonetheless aware of your reservations about this new text and, for that very reason, I wish to listen closely to the debate due to take place, the main motivation for which I have pointed out: the modernisation of our ports with a view to further developing the port sector in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for listening. Mr President, you emphasised the number of speakers. I believe that this debate will, in any case, be very enlightening for the Commission. I therefore thank in advance all those who are due to take the floor and once again express my thanks to the committee and its rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me remind the House of the fact that all the arguments for or against a directive on sea ports have been the subject of intensive debate for months, and that there are two things that were determined as long ago as the Committee on Transport and Tourism’s hearing last June. One is that everyone involved in what goes on in ports – from the port companies to the shipping lines – is in favour of unambiguous rules on transparency to create fair competition between sea ports. The same can be said of all the groups in this House, and I might mention that none of them, in the course of the Transport Committee’s deliberations, have tabled any substantial amendments to the provisions on transparency in the Commission proposal, and so I find it quite incomprehensible that four groups should move that the Commission proposal be rejected outright, for in so doing they are preventing the introduction of the rules on transparency. It follows that, if you are in favour of transparency and fair competition, you cannot under any circumstances throw out that part of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the issue of market access, it was clear from the hearing that there are very divergent interests at stake here. The providers of port services, in other words the businesses currently operating in ports – container terminals, watermen, lightermen and so on – do not, of course want these things regulated at European level; they would like to see them remain in the national sphere. Those who use port services, for example shippers and the business sectors that produce and ship goods, believe – and I think they are right to do so – that market access requires a European regulation. That is why I believe that the right, laid down quite clearly in the EC Treaty, to establish oneself and offer services, must apply in sea ports as much as anywhere else and that we need to bring in fair and unambiguous regulations to make sure that it does.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now proceed to set out, in brief, just five arguments in favour of European regulation of market access.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is to the benefit of new service providers that market access should be facilitated in the first place by means of regular invitations to tender for public leased areas, in the absence of which no new provider of port services will ever have a chance to get into the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is to the benefit of existing businesses handling goods in ports that these transitional provisions are intended to secure public leases, in theory at least for a period of up to 46 years. What we are proposing does not, then, do anything to jeopardise any business or put even one single job at risk; on the contrary, the long transition periods make it possible for existing businesses to continue operating.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposals are the right ones in terms of the interests of the port workers, since we want to delete self-handling from the directive. We take the view that there is no need for European rules on self-handling, since it is not even possible in container traffic, which is the typical activity of a modern harbour. The fact is that there is not one single container vessel that possesses the loading gear that would enable its own crew to load or unload containers.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already explained how the long transitional provisions secure the port workers’ jobs, and, at the end of the day, there will be no danger of social dumping or of any deterioration in working conditions, for it is stated quite explicitly in this directive that it does not interfere with Member States’ social security arrangements or with free collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, our proposals are the right ones when it comes to securing the interests of shippers and of the businesses that use them, since, if new businesses come into the market, they can make their choice among the most efficient and best-value service providers and will not – as they currently do in some ports – have to contend with a monopoly situation in which they have to take what is put in front of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the directive, as amended, is right from the economic and consumer point of view, since it is vital to exports and imports, and of benefit to our consumers, that all ports be regulated even more efficiently and economically.</p>
<p class="contents">I do therefore believe that fair market access combined with protection for jobs and of the existing businesses’ interests is the best solution. You have before you 140 amendments to that effect, and I urge you to vote on their substance rather than turning away from making a decision based on facts. If you throw out the Commission proposal lock, stock and barrel – that is to say, not just the part that deals with competition, but also the part covering transparency – then there will be no European regulation, and, in its absence, nobody will have the certainty needed to plan ahead or any certainty as to what the law is.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not let yourselves be swayed by yesterday’s strikes. I thought it inconceivable that it could have been the trade unions that, by the use of false arguments, induced these people to come here. Let us not allow the flares fired off by some of the demonstrators to show port workers in general in a bad light. Let us come to a fair decision in this matter – that is my plea to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I too regret the violence that we saw yesterday, but we must understand the frustration that the dockers are feeling at the moment. This is a most ill-informed proposal from the Commission. It is an absolute insult to Parliament that it was brought back in virtually the same form within 18 months of its initial rejection. It is a real insult to the only directly-elected democratic institution at European level. The Commission should have thought very carefully after that initial rejection.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As was the case with the Services Directive, there is some really flawed thinking at the centre of this directive. The idea of self-handling is ludicrous. It is a recipe for disaster and a health and safety nightmare. What we need in the loading and unloading of cargo is a dedicated, trained, experienced set of people, not an onboard workforce which would be exposed to the dangers of hurriedly loading and unloading cargo.</p>
<p class="contents">Pilotage was included in this proposal. I represent Teesport in the north-east of England, which is one of the busiest ports in Europe and serves a massive chemical industrial complex. Highly volatile cargoes enter and leave that port every day. The notion that you can tender for piloting services for ships of that description in order to secure the lowest price is, again, ludicrous. It would put in danger not only the workers involved but also the entire population of my region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should have done the sensible thing: it should have revised this proposal completely before it brought it forward. I hope that it will readily withdraw it when we reject it tomorrow, as I am sure we will.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission has had the nerve to table a proposal which shows, as Mr Hughes rightly pointed out, that it ignores the voice of Parliament. We would have appreciated a little more respect, but the Commission seems to have considered our input somewhat superfluous. It could deal with this on its own. The Commission has road-tested self-handling and tomorrow, we will see that this can go wrong. Self-handling is, of course, not the only problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group, too, believes that this proposal – of which we are highly critical – is probably heading for a rejection, and we realise that the rapporteur, who most definitely deserves our respect, has not, despite persistent efforts on his part but as a result of all these circumstances, managed to find a majority for an acceptable, useful and viable solution on the basis of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">If this does not kill off the port package or the port package journey altogether, then we know that we have to change tack and opt for a totally different approach. We need an approach that focuses on solving the real problems, an approach that gives due consideration not only to investment goods, but also to people. We need one that offers legal certainty to everyone, and for that calm consideration is vital. Down with the confrontation model. Long live the consultation model.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps, Commissioner, on behalf of the Commission, you will be so kind as to tell us whether, when you table fresh proposals, you intend to take your time conferring with all parties involved beforehand.</p>

By all means protest and demonstrate, but violence and vandalism are out – they cannot be allowed and must be denounced.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the matter in hand. In the past, we talked about clean waters and clean ports and campaigned for them. We enacted legislation on the subject, one example being the November 2000 directive on port waste facilities. If the port package belongs anywhere, that is where it belongs, in amongst the port’s waste; that is the right place for it. That being so, Social Democrats and many others will, tomorrow, reject this ‘port package II’ directive. Why is this so? The answer is quite simple. The Commission’s draft takes no account whatever of the realities of life in most of Europe’s ports; its intention of interfering in functioning, economically successful structures and using an enormous and expensive bureaucracy to impose on ports a competition that already exists in almost all of them, is intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, the most important thing is that what is at stake is a lot of skilled jobs; families and livelihoods are at risk, and that is what this is all about. I have not, so far, heard a single reason to justify putting these jobs at risk and needlessly jeopardising social harmony in Europe’s ports. There is no reason to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that the fundamental freedoms – which are constantly invoked – are not guaranteed in ports. There may be a few ports like that in Europe, but unremitting competition is a fact of life in most of them. It is only natural that there is limited space in most ports for those who want to provide port services, and by no means will every one of them get their chance at once, but that is far from saying that any one of them is discriminated against.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give, as an example, a pedestrian area in the smartest part of a city. Not everyone gets the chance to practise his profession there either, but does the Commission want to do something like stipulate a tendering process in future, simply because a German hairdresser is unable to rent a salon on the Ramblas in Barcelona just when he chooses to? That is simply not on.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just about Europe as a location for maritime business but also about how we Europeans measure up against the other continents. If we want to maintain our European social model, we cannot go presenting Asian businesses with European ports on a silver platter – and, by the way, our European ports are in any case much more efficient than Asian ones these days.</p>
<p class="contents">You, Commissioner, inherited this questionable package from your predecessor, Mrs de Palacio. Knowing that you are not the sort to go hunting for legacies, we suggest that you rid yourself of this one – we will help you do it. The sort of proposal we want from you is one that cannot, in essence, be seen as anything other than European. What is needed is a European policy on ports, and fair competition between them, along with a proper policy on the ports’ hinterlands. We have to get European ports to compete properly with the rest of the world. If that is the sort of policy you want, Commissioner, then we are right behind you and will gladly work together with you in producing one.</p>

Jensen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group. </span><span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, almost 50 years since the Community was founded, there is now still no specific legislative framework for port services. The ports sector is the only transport sector in which problems involving the free movement of services have to be solved one by one by the Commission and via the Court of Justice. Of course, port services come under the fundamental freedoms listed by the EC Treaty – that is to say, freedom of movement and the right of establishment, as mentioned by yourself, Commissioner – and the general principles of the Treaty do not take full account of the special conditions that apply in ports. That is why a legislative framework is needed for the ports sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are, then, in favour of a ports directive, albeit not in the form presented in the Commission’s proposal. Indeed, very few people support a directive in that form. We have supported the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, in his efforts to transform this directive into something more sensible. In the light of the developments reflected in Mr Jarzembowski’s efforts, I have been surprised at the violent demonstrations against the Commission’s proposal, which does not, of course, have an earthly chance of being adopted in its present form. Mr Jarzembowski is to remove self-handling from the proposal in order to make it less controversial. That said, we have to listen to bizarre and untrue assertions about Filipino dockworkers poised to take over the jobs of port workers. Meanwhile, the port workers have repaid the good will that exists by staging disturbances in front of our Parliament building and smashing a large number of windows in the facade. I think this shows a lack of understanding of, and indeed contempt for, the democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a ports directive that can establish the framework for free competition between service providers in ports and also for such freer competition between ports as will provide a safeguard against state aid that distorts competition. The Commission’s very point of departure is that, by putting an end to the monopolies, we could obtain more efficient and better run ports. We should then see more goods transported by ship, something that would reduce the burden on both the roads and the environment. This objective has, however, been completely lost sight of in the debate. It has to be recognised that the Commission’s proposal contains a number of weaknesses. We think that better account needs to be taken of the ability of service providers to pay interest on, and write off, the often very large investments they have to make. There must be better transitional rules when new service providers take over from old ones.</p>
<p class="contents">If the directive ends up being rejected – as many of us believe, but do not hope, it will be – the document should be used in future work involving a new impact analysis of legislation in this area. Given the chaotic nature of developments so far, it is understandable that many should want the Commission to withdraw the proposal. I have to say that my own group does not have a unanimous view on the approach we should adopt to this issue. Precisely in view of the chaotic way things have gone, there are many who will simply vote against the proposal, but we continue to be interested in a ports directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were all, of course, able to witness what happened yesterday, namely, as Mr Piecyk stated a moment ago, that the port workers, sadly only a minority, went way beyond what is acceptable and tried to shoot themselves in the foot. This was a rather absurd thing to do since it was directed towards the only European institution that has defended the interests of the port workers in the past and is apparently doing so again now. This absurd action should not, though, detract from the port workers’ main, and constantly-stated, objection, namely that if an unchanged Commission proposal is adopted, there is a considerable risk that well-trained, experienced people will be replaced by cheap, badly trained ships’ crews, and that is not something we should be encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">What is striking, of course, is that it was not only the trade unions that displayed their dismay. Port services and port employers in numerous European ports also appealed with us not to introduce any more red tape relating to new rules. If you read the impact studies that have been carried out, then the conclusion is that if this directive is adopted unchanged, it will result in uncertainty and fewer investments, and will have an adverse effect on the quality of port services.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add a third argument for the Commission’s attention. Why is it that whilst your Commission, in the person of its President, has always claimed that Europe should only draft legislation if it is necessary, if it adds something and if it cannot be done at national level, it has now tabled a proposal that tries to solve a problem in a number of ports in southern Europe by saddling all European ports with uniform rules?</p>
<p class="contents">My group’s conclusion is that we should reject this proposal. I would urge the Commission to stop tabling proposals of this kind and instead to bring proposals which will meet with support in Parliament. We should really clamp down on proposals for state aid. I urge you to try to solve the problems in southern European ports in a different manner.</p>

For the people working in the ports, this port directive only causes them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has opened up the possibility of self-handling, as a result of which trained specialists, who know how to move cargo safely and accurately, could well be replaced by cheap ships’ crews from outside of Europe. Even if this Member State obligation is taken out of the directive, it still remains detrimental to ports where governments own the port’s inner harbours, the quays and adjacent industrial sites.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of compulsory periodic tendering for operators, the people who work there could lose their jobs when the contract expires. Continuity will then remain possible only in private ports, provided, that is, that they do not go into receivership or are not bought by the competition.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal has met with huge opposition, starting in 2003, when it was eventually rejected at third reading, only for Commissioner De Palacio, just before her departure in 2004, to leave the repeat of this proposal behind like a ticking time bomb. An important underlying motive may well have been that there were interested parties outside of ports that wanted to make transport by sea even cheaper. That is astonishing, given that the rates in Europe are lower than those in Asia or America and also because they are only a negligible part of the production costs for industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner De Palacio’s official main argument was to promote shipping between Spain and Italy as an alternative to the huge stream of lorries that drive along the southern coast of France. Even without a port directive, this short-distance sea transport appears to have skyrocketed already in recent years. Moreover, it is reported that the impact on the German, Dutch, Belgian and French ports along the North Sea and the Channel with their major common hinterland would create chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">As long ago as 1998, this House took the view that a possible port directive should focus on putting investments paid with taxpayers’ money in the public domain and that it should also focus on the extent to which the rates included cover the costs. The Commission’s two subsequent proposals did nothing of the kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, whilst up to a week ago, the Christian Democrats and Liberals, half of this House in other words, were backing this proposal, now, virtually nobody seems to believe in it anymore. We can defuse this time bomb in tomorrow’s vote once and for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the current legal context, maritime transport yields good results. In 2000, 41% of the bulk consignments transferred within Europe were transported via maritime transport, compared with 43% transported via road transport. Yet, do we need this port services directive in order to promote this effective mode of transport?</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this new proposal is to overcome the failure of the first package on port services, which was rejected by this very Parliament. This new proposal takes up the main points contained in the first arrangement. The scope remains the same, the list of services is identical and the promotion of competition remains excessive. The few changes affecting this text do nothing to improve it. The authorisations issued to the providers of port services genuinely give rise to suspicion. The burden of new procedures will give rise to a whole host of disputes, and the management costs will increase as a result of legal uncertainty. The authorisation periods do not take account of the long period of time required to justify significant investment decisions. This succession of patch-up jobs belies an impulsive move made without any serious impact study.</p>
<p class="contents">The study published by the British Transport Ministry on 26 August 2005 even falls under the heading of aggravating circumstances: an increase in the ticket granting entry into the market and an allowance granted to large suppliers at the expense of small companies. Changes affecting self-handling are re-igniting criticism of social dumping. This crucial issue shows just how central the Bolkestein Directive continues to be to all of the Union’s arrangements. Therefore, despite Article 4 and the exclusion of transport services from the ‘Services’ Directive, we know that these are the kinds of ploys we are used to in this House.</p>

Yes, this directive is primarily designed to disguise a new and obvious failure on the part of the Union’s institutions.

Therefore, however much the rapporteur tries to find a compromise on this draft directive, it is clear that doing so will be very difficult. Unfortunately, it may be that the organisers of the violent demonstration and various supporters of that demonstration on the left wing of this Parliament will tomorrow celebrate a victory.

It follows a chaotic vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism when there was real doubt about the correct result. Britain, may I remind you, is an island with over 100 commercial ports and the biggest, Southampton, is in my constituency. It adds over GBP 2 billion to the British economy every year and the local economy enjoys another GBP 200 million from the cruise industry alone. These are big numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">As a global trading nation, the United Kingdom handles more international freight than any other EU country and port management there is driven by free enterprise and market forces. There is no public ownership, no state subsidy, so expansion in the development of facilities and services in British ports depends on retaining the confidence of private investors and high standards of service and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive will undermine confidence in those standards because it interferes in freely negotiated commercial contracts. It imposes controls that are neither necessary nor desirable. It seeks to solve problems in state-run ports that simply do not exist in Britain. The port authorities know, suppliers of services and facilities know, customers know: the only people who do not appear to know are those in the Commission. Even ship pilots’ proper concerns over safety have met with indifference. Do we really want novices piloting the biggest container ships in the world up narrow tidal waterways and trying to berth them safely?</p>
<p class="contents">Whenever the EU starts talking about creating a level playing field it reveals a fundamental ignorance of enterprise. British ports use their initiative and investors’ money to create competitive advantage: the very opposite of a level playing field. If passed, this directive will cost without yielding benefit and will slow down growth and confidence. The House should throw it out.</p>

<p class="contents">We should therefore be attentive to its multilateral parameters and, at the same time, more efficient in the objectives we wish to serve, by which I mean economic development, competitiveness and convergence between the areas of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we welcome the Commission initiative to propose a regulatory framework which is missing from the European Union more than fifty years after the establishment of the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have before us the option of acquiring a regulatory framework which will lend transparency to the operation of services and relations with government and other authorities and which will also give greater competitiveness to our ports, not only in the major ports of Europe, which are losing ground against Asian ports, but also in other secondary ports, which will have the possibility, on equal terms from the point of view of competition, to develop so that they can also address the explosion in international trade and the advantages which will emerge from the European Union policy on short-haul maritime transport or sea buses.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be ready to reap the benefits of these policies. However, we would like to see an impact study, in advance, before we reach a final result; this is something we do not have today and relates to the lack of transparency and the lack of a regulatory framework in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must try, at both European Union level and Member State level, to have such a study and we would also like this proposal for a directive to be integrated into the framework of a broader port policy, because competition is not just a regulatory framework, it also relates to services that give access and efficacy in general to the functioning of ports and transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It remains astonishing how the Commission, less than a year after the previous port directive was rejected, launched a fresh proposal without consulting the sector, or Parliament for that matter, knowing full well how sensitive this issue is. I would like to make a point of saying this because I am convinced things could have gone differently had there been a willingness early on to enter into dialogue with the parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I do know, however, that Mr Barrot is not particularly happy with this dossier either, and my comments are therefore not meant for him personally, but they need expressing nevertheless. He knows, as well as I do, that it is not only the methodology, but also the content, of the text that meets with major opposition in the sector. The trade unions are obviously concerned about the extent of self-handling, but the proposal has also come under heavy criticism from ports, port companies, pilots and even ship owners.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Jarzembowski deserves credit for making an attempt to save the day despite all this, but I beg to differ with him as far as content is concerned. Given the way in which this dossier was submitted and subsequently received by the sector, we have no choice but to reject it comprehensively and to ask the Commission to go back to the drawing board.</p>
<p class="contents">Approval would be an act of bad governance, certainly because we have no idea whatsoever what the outcome of the vote could be. If you want to build a house, but know that the foundations are inadequate, you have no choice but to stop the building work and start again. Rejection means that the ports will simply be able to continue working, as they have done for the past 40 to 50 years with spectacular growth figures in many cases.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean, of course, that we can afford to sit back. The Commission should take its time, mull things over, enter into a discussion with the sector and study what there is in ports that really requires a European approach. A fresh Green Paper or White Paper, as is suggested by some, strikes me as a good approach and the Commission can, meanwhile, focus on what is needed across the sector, namely clear rules on transparency with regard to government investments. We need to reject this proposal first, though. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposal is similar and the rapporteur is the same person; I say this with respect and affection for my colleague, Mr Jarzembowski, but I believe that this proposal will also be rejected by a majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Being generally in favour of the liberalisation of the markets and also of port services, I cannot support the present proposal; firstly, because the intention is purely to deal with services provided within each port, with the healthy intention of promoting free competition, but not to deal with the very real practices that breach the rules on competition amongst different European ports.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that numerous aspects of the normal practices in many ports need to be changed. I believe that some of the abuses and forms of contracting imposed on service providers are unacceptable. Nevertheless, I believe that changes cannot be proposed in such an aggressive way. We must promote an ordered transition and, on the one hand, guarantee safety and efficiency in port operations and, on the other, safeguard the rights of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that companies have the right to choose workers freely but they should firstly take on those workers who have already been doing certain jobs and whose employment contracts are still in force. As has happened in other economic sectors in crisis, if there is a surplus of workers, we will have to negotiate a suitable restructuring plan between the trade unions, companies and the administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe and this Parliament must not be seen by the citizens as an instrument for unbridled capitalism. Proposals such as this, which we are discussing today and which I hope we will reject, have contributed to the Dutch and French ‘No’s to the Constitutional Treaty. We must modernise our economy, but with the necessary coverage and protection for the people affected, which is the main objective of any political action. In that way we will have greater moral authority when it comes to condemning the use of violence that we witnessed here yesterday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It looks bad to reintroduce, almost unchanged, a directive that Parliament has already rejected and, so to speak, throw it down before your successor and the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Opposition to the port package comes from almost all the Member States; it has been rejected by the conservative government in Holland, the Labour government in Great Britain, and both the former red-green and the present conservative and social democrat coalition governments in Germany. There is a justifiable fear of an economic backlash brought on by the need for investments to pay off over shorter periods of time, by the expensive growth in bureaucracy and by the fact that competition is already in place. Costs in EU ports are very low; half of what they are in the USA and one-third of what they are in Asia. The dockers are justified in going on strike, for they fear wage dumping. There is no place in a social market economy for a social freeze policy of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Opposition to the port package comes from an immense coalition of conservatives, socialists and greens.

The new version of this directive on ports, despite misleading claims of transparency, guarantees and so forth, is even worse than the one voted down by the European Parliament on 23 November 2003.</p>

Although the European Parliament rejected the directive in question, although the new version of it was rejected in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and although the rapporteur's proposal was voted down in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the Commission has insisted that it be brought before the European Parliament, demonstrating once again the correlation between the will of the Members of the European Parliament and the workers employed in this sensitive area.</p>
<p class="contents">The new version of the directive includes selling off ports to the private sector, together with the entire range of port services: loading and unloading, stevedoring and storage.</p>

Neither management nor staff have shown any encouragement for this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, a Parliament spokesman said that the protests had caused considerable damage, but what will be the damage in British ports if this directive is applied? New investment of over EUR 400 million by the management of my local ports of Felixstowe and Harwich may be jeopardised if they have to open the services to other companies. Our British system has worked extremely well for decades, so why should British ports be disrupted when, clearly, this form of legislation is aimed at certain ports on the continent?</p>
<p class="contents">It is said that there is a need for greater competition in this sector to promote growth and job creation, but if this directive is applied, at what expense? Dockers could lose their jobs, the security systems could break down and the safety issue would be jeopardised.

If, however, such a directive has to be adopted at any cost, for the sake of opening up the market to competition and creating a legal framework to harmonise port management procedures and to make them transparent, then it should at least be fair and rational.</p>
<p class="contents">The current proposal creates a series of distortions and will have consequences that are certainly undesirable, such as a decline in qualifications, with obvious repercussions on overall safety levels. In particular, it grants the pilotage service alone certain prerogatives associated with safeguarding the safety of shipping, as well as specific public service obligations. These, however, are characteristics of all technical maritime services, including mooring services, which should therefore be expressly protected and not exposed to free-market rules.</p>

However, not only do I dislike the content of the proposals, which I will come back to shortly, but I also find it unacceptable that the Commission seems unable to take no for an answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years ago, along with many colleagues, I found myself sitting in this very Chamber, having this very same debate, where a very similar proposal was rejected. Commissioner Barrot, why do I find myself in the same position again today? At a time when we hear that the Commission is about to repeal or will not proceed with over-regulatory legislation, we are faced with the proposals we are now debating.</p>
<p class="contents">For the United Kingdom, the content of the proposal has been met with disbelief by the industry. There is not one port that welcomes the proposals. Should they be adopted, businesses which have worked hard to become the best performing and most competitive in Europe would be compromised and threatened. Within the proposals, authorisation periods and tendering are thought to be market-orientated measures that will increase services and competition. They do nothing of the sort. Services will be reduced as potential competitors cherry-pick only the profitable areas of business, meaning less development in the sector. Financial institutions will also be less forthcoming with capital investment as returns will be minimal and not guaranteed, leading to exactly the opposite of what is intended.</p>
<p class="contents">I am all for the free market and can support any proposal that is market-orientated. However, that is not the case with this proposal. If the EU wants to see a market-orientated approach, I suggest that it follows what we already have in the UK: a tried and tested system.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on this House to reject the proposal in its entirety and send a simple message to the Commission: ‘no’ means ‘no’ in whatever language one speaks, except ‘Euro-ese’ where it appears to mean exactly the opposite.</p>

We will therefore have to give our verdict on the raw text, that is to say on Mrs de Palacio’s ‘legacy’ text – the poisoned chalice she bestowed on the European Commission. Personally, I will be voting against it, not because – as everyone can confirm – I am particularly radical, but for three reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I will be voting against the text because we do not have to accept a denial of parliamentary democracy. We cannot encourage the Commission to reproduce the same texts every time Parliament has voted against them, nor can we encourage it not to listen or to hear anything and to proceed on the basis of a mystical form of ultraliberalism that flouts everyone’s opinions, including those of the professionals.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I will be voting against it because this text is socially unacceptable and dangerous. It comes down to legalising the same kind of serfdom in the ports that is rife on the seas. Through self-handling by onboard personnel, it comes down to encouraging our ports to employ Filipinos and Malays in order to be competitive. In reality, it comes down to admitting that <span class="italic">Irish Ferries </span>was right in June.</p>
<p class="contents">It is politically irresponsible because we withdrew a directive on crews, which was a social directive, and we are keeping the port services directive; because, in the context of the ‘better lawmaking’ initiative, we withdrew 60 European Parliament texts in the course of proceedings, yet we are keeping the port services directive; and because, in actual fact, this text gives food for thought and proves all the card-carrying Eurosceptics and those most fervently opposed to Europe, right. As someone who fought to see Europe exist, I, for my part, believe that this is an insult to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I know what your feelings are and I think that the problems related to Europe’s ports are problems to do with the excessive concentration in the North Sea, with saturation, with the disorganisation of road traffic flows on the continent, with the security of the straits – one can see what took place again in the Pas-de-Calais – and with national and regional development. A port is primarily a site. It is a strategic site; it is not a free-for-all service; it is not a supermarket. You need to think along these lines in future when you design the new initiative.</p>

In reality, the directive would not open up the market, but instead would increase bureaucracy, reduce the productivity of ports and reduce competition too.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal makes little sense. The rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, has certainly done an excellent job and tabled some relevant amendments, but it has to be said that even he cannot accomplish miracles. If the proposal is unworkable, it will not be made to work here in Parliament. Europe does not need more poor administration: instead, Europe and we need to ensure the quality of the work done at ports, the safety of employees and their rights and see to it that ports operate flexibly.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must focus on the essential, and the intention behind the Commission’s simplification strategy is, or at least is said to be, to do away with needless regulation. In this case at least it has not succeeded. I hope that the Commission will also apply the principles which it articulates to the directive on port services and everything it does. This directive will have to be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consideration should therefore be given to the people who work in the ports, the dockworkers, who are at risk of losing their jobs, whilst freight should be handled safely and efficiently. Due account should also be given to the pilots who guide the ships safely into the ports and ensure that minor or major environmental disasters are prevented.

<p class="contents">This House is very definitely united, and I do believe that you could do yourself and the Commission a favour by taking the opportunity of your closing speech to announce that you are withdrawing this proposal, thereby pre-empting Parliament’s call on you to do just that. You accept that the interested parties do not want this directive and that your idea of what is good democratic practice is not the only one, and so you stand a chance of bringing in a new directive, one dealing exclusively with transparency and with the aid that ports need.

Adopting a number of amendments will not change this fundamental issue either. Given, to some extent, the growing resistance to the implications of this proposal among those involved, I would ask you to reconsider whether this measure is needed at this moment in time. In my view, this proposal is not the right action at the right time despite the imminent arrival of the services directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Sectoral legislation for ports is welcome, and rules on state aid in ports are necessary. This proposal, however, is not equal to the task of standing up to existing problems without imposing excessively administrative and organisational burdens. I would therefore urge my fellow Members to reject this proposal and would ask the Commission to table a fresh, more focused proposal, together with a proposal for the regularisation of state aid in ports.

It should not, of course, have come to this, had the Commission had the wisdom two years ago to quietly bury its catastrophic port directive.</p>
<p class="contents">For years, it has been evident that in the general public opinion and in the European ports in particular, there is no democratic support for this anti-social and ideological package of measures that has not been inspired by political common sense. Even a young child would know that this – what has now become notorious – self-handling leads to unemployment, social unrest and unsafe situations in the ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission went ahead. Based on purely doctrinarian considerations, a proposal is now being put before us virtually identical to that rejected by a majority in this Parliament two years ago, without much respect for this Parliament, against their better judgement, and against the will of the large majority of European dockworkers. The same applies, to some extent, to the Bolkestein directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It should come as no surprise that the citizens in France and the Netherlands, as others will do elsewhere tomorrow, turn their backs on this kind of Europe.

<p class="contents">The European Parliament is faced today with a dilemma: either we move forward with the creation of a genuine internal market or we remain in a state of stagnation. Personally, I have decided to support a proposal whose fundamental principles and objectives are laid down in the Lisbon programme and in the Transport White Paper. Improving competition amongst port service providers will increase competitiveness and efficiency in ports and contribute to developing goods transport by sea, which is ultimately the main objective of our support for maritime transport in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the fundamental elements of the proposal, but one which has given rise to the most controversy, is the express inclusion of self-handling. It is fundamental for the Member States to guarantee the recognition of a method for the provision of port services that contributes to the genuine development of short-distance sea transport, which, by its very nature, requires efficiency and speed not just in customs operations, but also, in particular, in loading and unloading.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in response to the fears of those people who believe that the approval of this directive will lead to a deterioration in the working conditions of workers, we must make it clear that the directive does not just respect the Member States’ legislation on working conditions, training and professional qualifications, but also those that relate to health, safety in the workplace, maritime safety and protection of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the transfer of loading to ports will increase the volume of operations in them, which in turn will lead to an increase in employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why it is essential from an economic point of view that we have modern, efficient and well-managed ports, since they must be competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">Spanish ports are self-supplying and self-funding compared to other ports; that is why it is necessary definitively to assess the issue of subsidies to ports, that is, state aid. From a social point of view too, we have well-trained workers, with quality jobs and full employment rights, which is not always the case in maritime law. Finally, from an environmental point of view, many of the services being talked about are fundamental to safety and to environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">This new proposal has achieved an unusual degree of unanimity, since even those people in my country who identified aspects that were useful for resolving certain bottlenecks and obsolete practices that persist in our ports, have preferred, and prefer, to reject it today.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on my conviction, therefore, that this Parliament will do what it has to do and reject this proposal, which has amply demonstrated its inadequacy in terms of the current needs of European ports, I would ask the Commissioner to be sensitive, as he has shown himself to be in other areas of transport, and, because the global situation requires it, as soon as possible to prepare an updated, necessary and courageous consultation process which deals openly and thoroughly with all of the necessary aspects of European ports. In that way, within a reasonable space of time, we will be able to find the solutions to making European ports the centres of economic, social, technological and environmental development that Europe requires and, in view of the global framework, they will thereby contribute to better producing a more cohesive Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say to them that I have heard Member of Parliament after Member of Parliament line up and put forward arguments which are in the interests of the people of Europe, and Member of Parliament after Member of Parliament expressing sympathies with the underlying arguments that they are presenting. Rather than standing and attacking this House, they should take a step back, listen to what is being said in this debate and give their support to this House. That is my appeal to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, this House will be considering a proposal that it effectively rejected in November 2003. It is a project that the Commissioner has tried to distance himself from entirely and a process that is democratically deficient, owing to a failure to consider, consult or compromise with those at its heart.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that this proposal was designed with continental ports in mind, with the desire to liberalise the port services market, which is, for the most part, still nationalised. That is a welcome and necessary step, but it needs to be done in the right way.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the United Kingdom ports industry has set itself apart from its continental counterparts. Our ports are privately owned. They receive no financial assistance from the government and capital for new investment is raised within the market. Owing to the large number of thriving ports, the industry already enjoys the healthy competition that this proposal seeks to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">The move to impose such a landlord model on United Kingdom ports will be enormously damaging. The threat of a trend towards a non-permanent workforce will lead to a lack of job security, lower skills levels, lower wages, a deterioration in working conditions, and will have a detrimental impact on the surrounding communities.</p>
<p class="contents">My constituency, in the north-west of England, has a long and proud history in the maritime industry, with ports such as Liverpool, Manchester and Heysham numbering among some of the largest on the United Kingdom coastline. At its heart is Liverpool, the home of the United Kingdom’s first commercial dry dock. Under this directive, Liverpool’s communities, which are already among the most deprived in Europe, will witness hard-grafting dockers being put out of work. All this with a compensation package on the table insufficient to comply with United Kingdom law, let alone the European Convention on Human Rights. It is neither desirable nor practical for this House to try to amend this proposal, which is fundamentally flawed. It is for all these reasons that we must vote this proposal down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This proposal for a directive forms part of the so-called ‘Lisbon Strategy’ aimed at speeding up liberalisations, leading to a ferocious onslaught against the public sector and on public services. Quite apart from the crucial questions of national sovereignty that this strategic sector raises, this proposal, if adopted, would lead to unemployment, precarious working situations and work insecurity, especially via what is known as self-handling.

Our basic view is that Swedish rules should apply on Swedish territory.</p>

The European Parliament rejected an identical proposal by the Commission barely a year ago. Thirdly, the players who would be affected by this directive do not think very much of it. There is currently efficient competition between European ports. The ports directive would lead to a distortion of competition because the ship owners’ own staff would take over the job of loading and unloading.</p>

This directive, though, is not suited to that task and so I suggest that you withdraw it. You must have realised, in the course of this debate, what agreement, across the party boundaries, you have prompted in this House on this subject. You must surely realise that this draft directive, lacking as it does sufficient underpinning, is ill-prepared for debate. Even though Mr Jarzembowski has done a splendid job, there is little chance of this House improving a bad directive when one is put before it. The Commission also needs to get used to the idea that this House cannot be used as a repair workshop for bad directives.</p>
<p class="contents">What makes this draft directive scarcely fit for consideration is the fact that important aspects of it are unclear; its definition of markets certainly is. Is it meant to mean competition within ports, among the ports themselves or something that involves both the ports and the traffic that they share in their hinterland? No impact assessment has been carried out, nor is it at all clear what benefit the consumer is supposed to derive from all this.</p>
<p class="contents">More competition ought, by rights, to reduce handling costs, yet, from what we know, handling costs in Europe are less than half what they are in Singapore or Dubai anyway, which adds up to a good deal lower. The intention is that they should stay that way, yet this proposal opens the door to the possibility of their being increased. Will this directive really get more service providers into ports?

The directive does not achieve that aim and, at a time of profound European political crisis, that is a bad or, rather, a shocking sign of the gap between the institutions and the actual needs of the interests at stake in a globalised world. All these many interests can no longer be reconciled along old lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Inappropriate signs like these have to be eliminated. What we need is a vision of a common port system, a common policy, and transparent guidelines for investments and state aid. Such guidelines must not confine themselves to prioritising competition among ports, but must be able to prevent the competitive disadvantages of some of these ports from weakening the whole system. We need protection for skilled labour that will eliminate social dumping and instead encourage joint training. We need to protect the efficiency of public services and to recognise their requirements in the areas of safety, quality and accessibility. Lastly, we need to assess the impact of liberalising the sector, because what we find most worrying at this point in time is the current trend towards concentrating production and logistics in certain ports around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the new challenges, and the directive does not meet them. What has happened between the first proposal in 2001 and this second one is not a good example of European politics. I repeat, however, that a directive and rules are needed, and achieving them will require a major political commitment that does not shrink from laying down common rules, notwithstanding the autonomy of the ports…</p>

What is worse, it only serves the financial interests of the large transnational freight companies, to the detriment of all the actors in the port sector, from the port worker to the small businessman. Its only aims are those of demolishing the statutes and social protection measures and dragging salaries down in order to make a minority rich, and this to the detriment of people’s safety and the environment. This directive’s social model is as good as the law of the jungle; self-handling is slavery reborn.</p>
<p class="contents">All the technical-nautical professions and all the European trade unions unanimously reject this Bolkestein-style directive for the ports. Yesterday, I joined the 10 000 port workers from all over Europe in demonstrating before Parliament. I can bear witness to their determination to stand in the way of this monstrous directive. I can assure you that voting in favour of a directive such as this means taking responsibility for many of the Union’s ports being blocked by hard-line strikes, with all the economic consequences that such action entails.</p>
<p class="contents">I, like others, would point out to the Commission that we, as the representatives of the nations of Europe, had already rejected this directive. To propose another, almost identical, version of it constitutes a political affront to Parliament and to the port authorities as a whole. For the sake of the construction of another Europe seeking a high level of social and democratic integration, we call for this directive to be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is, though, an unfortunate fact that the slogans and truncheons conceal the real alternatives. What this is all about, in essence, is not fundamental issues such as liberalisation, transparency and the like, but rather, as always, the details of the practical arrangements. That is why, in this debate on how to take this directive further, I am right alongside Mr Jarzembowski, the rapporteur, in his desire to improve the Commission proposal, which, it has to be admitted, was not a good one. Nor am I greatly heartened by the slogan, ‘Back to the Start’; if we were to do that, we would simply be wasting a lot of time. The fact that people are calling for White Papers or even Green Papers is evidence of a desire in this House for five years’ rest from being Europe’s legislator.</p>
<p class="contents">I see this debate as running parallel not only to the debate on the services directive that we are going to be having next month, but also to the debate on the constitution. There, too, the issue is not about whether Europe should or should not be ‘social’, but, in essence, about hundreds of details that go to make up a workable, better, shared Europe. The only thing is that there is no willingness to talk through these hundreds of details, no willingness to make the effort to seek and find consensus; instead, people would rather resort to slogans. They may attract the attention of the media, but they help nobody in this Europe in which we share to find their way to better and workable solutions.</p>

We hear of the significant resistance it is meeting, and Mr Barrot now has an opportunity to show that the EU is in step with our citizens by withdrawing this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there are three arguments for doing so. First and foremost, we do not need the directive. Many European ports are thriving, as I know is the case in, for example, my own country, Sweden. Ports are being developed, and there are many flexible solutions. What we need instead is a directive on competition between ports, as we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have also pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal by the Commission is for a piece of centralised European regulation. It is not about deregulation within the ports, as is being made out. It is a piece of centralised European regulation that we do not need because it would not lead to ports being developed. On the contrary, it might hinder their development. Unfortunately, it is not, then, out of concern for the ports and transportation that the European Commission has put forward this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Such centralised regulations would make it more difficult for ports to carry on their activities. It would become more difficult to develop ports and transport systems because ports are transport hubs and combined terminals that have to be efficient if the whole transport system is also to be so. What would be best is to allow regional and local players to develop the ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this ports directive would be bad for port workers. It is they who would have to pay the price for the centralised regulation proposed by the Commission. Many job opportunities would probably be lost, and a lot of activities transferred to the lease-in industry, the result being poorer conditions and less security for workers. It is for many good reasons, then, that I propose that Parliament reject this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The news of this last aspect still does not seem to have got through to the trade union movement, or to some Members of this House for that matter. Sadly, battle and emotion appear to have prevailed over a sound discussion on content and, Commissioner, it is not what you say, it is the way you say it<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">It all stems from the Commission, your predecessor in fact, who started a flawed discussion. Why do you not withdraw this directive? I would like you to explain this for me in a moment, for that would be the best solution all round. However, today’s political reality is that there is insufficient support for the hefty package of amendment proposals by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, where it enjoyed a narrow majority.

Yet it did not consult, it would not listen and it decided to ignore this democratic parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be very clear about the damage that this law, if adopted, would inflict on ports, including the east coast ports which I represent in this Parliament. Replacing highly skilled, trained staff with ships’ crew able to load and unload is a recipe for accidents, injury and, possibly, deaths. Compare that with the port of Tilbury, which achieved a 50% reduction in accidents in 2005, or Great Yarmouth, which has seen no reportable accidents for two years.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say to Mr Jarzembowski that this law would be devastating for jobs. Port owners tell me that over 600 new jobs at Felixstowe and over 750 new jobs at Harwich would all be threatened. Not one of 650 jobs at the port of Tilbury would be safe. That is what the port owners say themselves and these port owners would see their incentive for vital new investments destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">Already two new investment projects at Tilbury have been put on hold because of the uncertainty created by this directive. Port expansion at Bathside Bay, so recently approved at Harwich, and the positive decision we very much hope for this week for the Felixstowe South expansion, are both in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to the UK Independence Party, that represents GBP 1 billion of expenditure, if you check your figures; and we would not even have to be here now but for the fact that your members voted for this legislation in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">On investment again, in Great Yarmouth a campaign for more than a decade to build an outer harbour would see this put in competition with the existing inner harbour, substituting existing jobs rather than expanding jobs and services in an area recognised as a priority to tackle unemployment in the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Make no mistake, it is skilled dock workers who would suffer most – people like Steven Drew from Yarmouth, sitting in the Public Gallery listening to this debate, who, together with his father Frank before him, have given 55 years’ combined service to the ports industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition is needed between ports, not within them. The European Union should now do what it should have done before: consult ports, trade unions and shipping lines from scratch, starting with a blank sheet of paper, and on this proposal it should admit defeat. This European Parliament, having sought to reject this proposal once and for all, should now vote ‘no’ for a second time and never again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards the latter, I should like to state that we understand their protest but do not accept their violent methods. That said, the two committees called upon to give their opinions both declared their opposition to the proposal for a directive, thereby further securing its political fate.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of the port sector, Mr President, needs no added emphasis. We all know that almost all external trade in the EU is conducted through its ports and that the ports employ some 350 000 people directly, not to mention those employed indirectly in the sector. What is more, techniques for moving cargo and equipment are constantly evolving and this requires constant investment and renewal.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions that arise are therefore the following:</p>
<p class="contents">Is the proposal for a directive conducive to investment, competition and access to the market? Does it respect the rights acquired as regards current operators? Does it violate the principle of subsidiarity? Is it fair as regards compensation in the event of replacing providers? Does it affect the labour market and the social rights of workers in the sector? In a word, does it achieve the objectives of greater efficiency, better competition, more internal market and better services?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Jarzembowski sought to find even-handed answers to these questions, and I therefore wish to congratulate him. It does strike me, however, that this proposal needs to be looked at again, in light of the conditions under which it has been presented by the Commission. What is needed is a political strategy which genuinely stimulates the development of Europe’s ports, as the rapporteur himself points out and amends, which takes account of the current state of affairs in the market and which involves all interested parties, naturally including Parliament. It is for you, Commissioner, to provide the answer. As far as we are concerned, it will obviously be much easier to make a decision in line with the stated objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This does not represent a conflict between labour and capital because port owners, users and workers in different European countries regard the proposal as harmful, and not of any use. Competition for competition’s sake should be rejected and there needs to be greater focus on quality and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive will definitely not increase competition: on the contrary, it may even harm it. For example, the authorisation system will increase bureaucracy. An ILO Convention guarantees to give registered professional port workers priority for this kind of work, and in Finland this is reinforced in a collective bargaining agreement. The key factor is safety: would it be in the interests of health and safety at work if, after a hard day’s work, seafarers had to attend to the handling of yet another load in a foreign port? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is about whether competition would cause matters to become worse for consumers, employees and businesses. To hear some of the debaters, one would think that the existence of competition and more companies is bad for the whole of society.</p>
<p class="contents">We can, in fact, see how those European societies that have opened the doors to competition and new enterprise have seen services and businesses develop, with lower prices and better service for the consumer. We have seen this within area after area, including the telecommunications and aviation areas, and have heard the same cautionary arguments before deregulation has been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember how, when telecommunications deregulation was, at one stage, debated, it was maintained in all seriousness that telephone calls would be a thing of the past and that those who worked within the industry would lose their jobs. In actual fact, there have been more jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to ports, which are so crucial to trade and development within the EU, it is obvious that the dynamic entailed in increased market access and in competition between and within ports will lead to a development of services. These things are crucial not only for enabling the ports industry as such to operate better but also because shipping, transport and trade will be more efficient. What is at issue here is not only the whole flow of goods in Europe, but also opportunities for new regions to develop – new ports and new structures in our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to see competition, we shall also get to see new developments and change. Anyone who maintains that everything is already perfect and that our ports throughout Europe operate exactly as they should need not be afraid of competition. If we obtain new enterprise and new opportunities, things will happen. That is why the basic issue is that of whether we want, as I myself do, to see a more dynamic flow of goods in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not talking here about containers; we are talking here about people, about my colleagues. This discussion is about a directive which, justifiably, the European Transport Workers Federation is calling unnecessary, provocative and unbalanced, and the port authorities and the industry also agree about this. It contains the worst elements of another proposal which this Parliament has already rejected. After that vote, instead of forgetting all about it or at least coming up with a decent proposal, the Commission took an even worse position. My vote will be against this directive because it undermines the rights which this category of workers, port workers, acquired with much difficulty in the course of a long period of time. I am going to vote against this directive because it opens the door for abuses in the way that certain workers are treated, as well as putting workers against each other. I am going to vote against this directive because it reduces the health and safety in such delicate areas as ports. When we boast so much here about health and safety, how can we do something which undermines it? I am going to vote against this directive because I believe in balanced competition where everybody gives his share, and not where it is always the workers and the lower paid who have to pay. I believe that even those who are in favour of liberalisation of port services should vote to reject this directive. This is because a vote in favour would be opening the way for an original directive which even our colleagues seem to agree that it has a lot of shortcomings. Let us give a strong signal that we are building a social Europe and not a system without a conscience. The vote on the ports directive is a golden opportunity to give hope and direction to the many who are waiting for a move from an institution like ours. I am proud that the Maltese Labour Party and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are responding in a consistent way to this call. To the millions of European workers, among them hundreds of Maltese workers represented by the General Workers Union, and who are also here today and who are affected by this directive, we want to let them know that we are solidly behind them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, it seems that this proposal does not take account of the Green Paper being prepared by the Commissioner for Transport, Mr Barrot.</p>
<p class="contents">We should take the opportunity offered by this initiative to examine the new supply of services from the countries that have recently joined, and we should compare the national legal requirements on costs to be borne by the goods, so that free-market conditions can effectively prevail. It seems to me that the directive before us runs absolutely counter to competition and market rules, in that it allows the large companies operating in northern European ports to set up oligopolies, in contrast to the different situation in Mediterranean ports, and above all it leaves us open to attack from the major East Asian companies, which are invading our port system.</p>
<p class="contents">We must certainly compare the effects of state aid policies on competition and clarify the concept and practical applicability of such aid, particularly as regards concessionary leases and other means of allowing a provider of services to provide them as a public service subject to public rules. Above all, this directive includes no comparison of the environmental protection rules for carrying out new infrastructure works, or of waste disposal policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to clarify the rules on competitiveness in view of the risk of unfair competition from the East and, even more importantly, we must reaffirm the environmental guarantees for the Mediterranean, which is under attack by operators who do not respect Community environmental legislation. Self-handling is a very serious threat to the small and medium-sized enterprises operating within our ports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today's proposal for a directive is basically no different from the previous one. It maintains the provision of self-service, which is out of keeping with the modern working conditions needed in European ports in the sectors of hygiene, safety and quality of port services.</p>
<p class="contents">Where, in truth, are the proposals for the proper layout of ports? Where are the proposals for modernising the overall functioning of ports? We have not heard the old call for exemption from the scope of the directive for pilot services, which are not a commercial activity but constitute a public service, the objective of which is the safety of shipping and the protection of ports and the marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor did we hear about the efforts made by the members of the committee in order to improve the proposal of the European Commission, despite Mr Jarzembowski's honourable efforts. The lack of policy will result in a long period of uncertainty and, of course, there will be no investment climate. The best proposal is to withdraw it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal for a directive, however, has been framed in a similar way to the one that was rejected in the House in November 2003, and does not take account of Parliament’s recommendations. It is therefore unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there are legal inconsistencies in the proposed directive in relation to the international and Community regulatory framework. Firstly, it fails to guarantee compatibility with the ongoing proposed review of Regulation (EEC) No 1191 of the Council concerning the obligations inherent in the concept of a public service. It also fails to take into account the specific characteristics of each individual port, not least ports in the outermost regions, where public services are vital to the survival of communities and where forced liberalisation can lead to socially and economically unacceptable monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive before us is already unacceptable, but the report makes matters worse by increasing deregulation and by creating problems relating to security, to guarantees of public services, to the efficient operation of port services, and to the safeguarding of social rights, arising from the proposal to extend self-handling without any regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe, Commissioner, that this proposal for a directive should be withdrawn and subsequently replaced by another that takes account of Parliament’s recommendations …</p>

The implementation of the Port Services Directive would not lead to big changes for us.

<p class="contents">The directive proposed by the European Commission broadly interferes in details, such as the licensing process and the duration of contracts, while leaving responsibility in important areas to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Uniform and clear standards concerning quality, environment and safety would be more useful for improving competition in the internal market than detailed regulations.

<p class="contents">Firstly, it is useful to point out the background to this proposal, which in fact came from the previous Commission and from my predecessor. Nevertheless, I can understand that Parliament might have been surprised, Mr President, that this proposal was presented to it again and I can understand that this move might have shocked some of you. I would simply like to raise some points that – without justifying it – also explain the reason why this proposal is back on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is because, despite everything, we feel the need <span class="bold"></span> which some of you have highlighted <span class="bold"></span> to have a clear legal framework in order to promote port investments. Ninety percent of our European exports pass through our ports. We need efficient and modern ports. Secondly, this proposal was re-presented with very strict limits on self-handling, which had undoubtedly been the subject of the most serious criticism at the time of first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as someone who has exercised social responsibilities, I cannot all the same let it be said that this proposal would violate all the social rights existing in the port sector. It was not the Commission’s intention to reduce the social rights of workers in this sector. The Commission has even included in its proposal an obligation for all the providers of port services to receive an authorisation forcing them to comply with the minimum rules of Community social law. Furthermore, Article 4 of the proposal constitutes a safeguard by stipulating that the directive will in no way affect the application of national legislation on the employment of personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">I will put it very simply, ladies and gentlemen: I would never have re-presented this proposal if I, personally, had felt it presented such serious risks as some of you believed it did. In all honesty, I would not have done so.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I must say that the debate has all the same been useful and it has shed some light on all the aspects of a port policy which cannot, in fact, be merely reduced to the subject of this text. Many of you pointed out that other problems were very important. These include greater transparency with regard to the costs of services, the introduction of fairer competition between our ports and the need to boost investments in order to further increase the capacities of our ports. I am therefore well aware that a port policy cannot be reduced to a text of this type and, in this regard, the debate has been very useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing the debate has done is to highlight the very diverse situations of Europe’s ports, even though I had already become aware of that state of affairs in this, my first year as Commissioner for Transport. In this regard, we are also coming up against a problem. Some of you rightly emphasised that it was impossible to deal with the fact that situations differ so greatly from one port to the next by focusing too much on centralisation, and I admit that you are right. We are also faced with the high-speed development of the technologies used in the ports, which also brings a factor into play not present in the situation that prevailed when this proposal for a directive was devised.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say both that the debate was useful and that your committee has done a really good job. It is true that I will give my full agreement in advance if Parliament goes as far as to discuss the amendments tabled by its committee. I am in favour of extending the expiry dates for the authorisations. I am in favour of the transitional measures, Mr Jarzembowski. I am also in favour of the compromise amendments on the protection of investments made prior to the entry into force of the directive, provided, of course, that the stated aims, that is to say non-discriminatory and fair market access for all, are observed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear – and here we are faced with a paradox – that the Commissioner addressing you had hoped that you would reach a verdict on the text amended by your committee. The paradox is that you are going to have to reach a verdict on the initial text. Well, you will not criticise me for having faith in Parliament when I say that, in this area and with regard to this text, I believed that the improvements made by Parliament were excellent and in fact made it possible to respond to a number of valid criticisms.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the situation, however. I am aware that there are two schools of thought among you. There are those who say that the initial text is not amendable, and then there are those who say that it could be corrected. That is your rapporteur’s theory. Mr President, my task is a difficult one. I want to affirm my respect for Parliament: on the one hand, I have to respect the work done by your committee and, on the other hand, I also have to respect the opinion that will be expressed during a vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it not in fact sensible to wait for the vote so that I can draw all the necessary conclusions? It seems to me that, in a healthy democracy, there can be the opportunity to vote. That is what I believe, and I am not offending Parliament when I tell it to reach a verdict, while I perhaps regret the fact that this procedure does not allow it to reach a verdict on a text that has been improved – I have no hesitation in saying this – by the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, Mr President – and I say this somewhat solemnly – on having listened carefully to this entire debate, it is quite clear that I will draw all the necessary conclusions from tomorrow’s vote by Parliament. I believe that doing so is a way of respecting Parliament and I acknowledge the strength of a number of arguments, which will enable me, I might add, to better devise an overall port policy for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and, once again, I undertake to do only one thing: to draw the necessary conclusions from your votes, once they have been cast.</p>
