<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Edit Bauer</span></span>  , <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(HU)</span> The proposal put forward is intended to amend Directive 2002/15/EC in connection with social protection. The Commission’s proposal touches on three issues: the exemption of self-employed hauliers from the scope of the law, the provision of a more precise definition for night work and support for the application of the law. The directive itself and, hence, its amendment, are supplementary in nature and only apply to vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, like other laws applicable to road transport activities. Therefore, it could not extend to drivers of smaller commercial vehicles. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs voted against the amendment (30 to 19 votes).</p>
<p class="contents">Several misapprehensions arose while the law was being drafted. I would like to address a few of those which may have influenced MEPs. First of all, experts have reached the unanimous conclusion that if the Commission’s proposal is rejected, resulting in the directive’s scope being extended to also include self-employed hauliers, it will not improve road safety. Available statistical data and studies on accidents show that only 6% of accidents are caused by the fault of lorry drivers, and fatigue is cited as a reason in only 0.06% of cases. Also, driving time, which has a real effect on road safety, is regulated by a different act of law, Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, which also applies to self-employed hauliers. Loading time is of a supplementary nature and cannot be regarded as a significant part of working time, as the law does not apply, for instance, to journeys under 100 km. Secondly, trade unions fear that self-employed hauliers could even work up to 86 hours if they are not regulated.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation includes stringent rules on driving time. It is capped at 45 hours per week for any two consecutive weeks, not to exceed 56 hours in any single week. This is accurately recorded by digital tachographs and the regulation also includes detailed rules on rest periods. Therefore, the claim of a possible 86-hour working week is an assumption not supported by any statistical data, study or survey. Thirdly, the Commission’s proposal would limit the scope of the directive to employees and false self-employed hauliers. So far, there has been no law regulating the working time of self-employed entrepreneurs. Working time restriction is an important means for the social protection of employees. However, in the case of self-employed hauliers, the employer and the employee are the same person, and protecting private transporters from themselves is an extreme measure. Fourthly, when the arguments run out, the real reason is revealed: social dumping. Do not be confused by the term, because self-employed hauliers and small enterprises can also be unpleasant competitors on the market, just like self-employed hauliers arriving from new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">My experience is, unfortunately, that the case of the phantom Polish plumber has returned to haunt us. I would like to move on to talk about a common labour market phenomenon that should not be dealt with, and indeed cannot be dealt with exclusively in the field of road transport. This is the issue of false self-employed entrepreneurs, which is a real European problem with adverse effects on competition and the labour market. This is the issue that needs to be addressed, and this expectation was stated clearly in the proposed amendment.</p>

The question is whether or not entrepreneurs who are self-employed drivers should be covered by the directive on the working time of mobile workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion of entrepreneurs would be a precedent and a clear deviation from the general Working Time Directive. This directive only regulates the working time of employed workers, not of entrepreneurs. Discussions about the inclusion of self-employed drivers have been going on for a long time. Firstly, consultations between social partners in the 1990s did not yield any result. Then, the legislator could not reach a conclusion after four years of discussion – between 1998 and 2002 – and therefore asked the Commission for a thorough impact study. The Commission has now carried out studies and made an impact assessment which clearly demonstrates that this directive is not the right tool to address transport policy issues such as road safety or competition conditions, but that enforcement in respect of the non self-employed is a real issue. This is also the sense of the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I wish to express my deep respect for your rapporteur, Mrs Bauer, who has done an excellent job. I am very glad to see that the rapporteur shares the Commission’s concern over the weak enforcement of the rules and the general problem of false self-employment, and I appreciate Mrs Bauer’s constructive proposals. I believe that the rapporteur’s proposed amendments have the potential to protect employees even better against possible exploitation by employers.</p>
<p class="contents">Where Europe definitely needs action is in respect of so-called false self-employed drivers – that is, those drivers who are formally independent but, in practice, are employed by a single company which gives them orders and pays them. Both the Commission proposal and the amendments proposed by the rapporteur give a clear message to industry: the phenomenon of false self-employment will not be tolerated and the legislator will be vigilant in putting this rule into practice throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards road safety, let me stress that working time must not be mistaken for driving time. The situation regarding the latter has radically changed since 1998. As you know, this House, together with the Council, adopted new driving time rules, introduced modern, reliable digital recording equipment and adopted a specific directive on enforcement. Today’s debate is not on road safety. The statistics and the studies that the Commission has made available to Parliament give absolutely no indication that the inclusion of self-employed drivers would improve road safety.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we hope to begin to recover from the economic crisis, it would not be a good move to impose an additional administrative and financial burden on small and fragile undertakings which have managed to survive the economic recession. Instead of imposing red tape on entrepreneurs, Europe needs a working time directive which will really ensure protection to those employed and dependent drivers who need that protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fundamental issue is whether or not the working hours of self-employed workers in the transport sector should be regulated for the first time. The Commission says not, nearly all the Member States say not, and the majority of my group also says not. If we were to include self-employed drivers in the directive, it would only serve the interests of big business. We need to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, however.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to tell those who cite shortcomings in road safety as justification for including self-employed workers that the rules on driving hours and rest times have long since been tightened up. All drivers – whether self-employed or employees – must take a minimum of 11 hours rest over a 24-hour period. That is why we have digital tachographs that automatically record driving hours, and the authorities monitor compliance with this.</p>
<p class="contents">I was the European Parliament’s rapporteur on tachographs at the time. I am grateful to Mrs Bauer for preventing the regulation being extended to vehicles weighing less than 3.5 tonnes. Digital EU control devices in all commercial vehicles would have resulted in time-consuming and expensive documentation obligations. We want to reduce bureaucracy, not increase it.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore recommend that this House support the compromise that the rapporteur has reached with other groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We remain convinced that that needs to be the case, and I very much hope therefore that the proposal to reject the Commission’s proposal will be agreed in the vote tomorrow, just as it was in plenary last spring and in the Employment Committee this March.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much regret the confusion the rapporteur appears to have encountered in discharging her mandate. Rather than reflecting and promoting the clear majority views of members of the European Parliament’s Employment Committee, she has actively worked to promote the view of the Commission and Council. The other institutions, as Mme Berès has said, have shown not one gram of loyal cooperation but instead have gone out of their way to subvert the very clear Employment Committee recommendation to the plenary: the rejection of the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, a tired driver is a dangerous driver, irrespective of employment status; we should not make road travel any more of a gamble than it already is. Once again this morning, the rapporteur has shown confusion between the notions of driving time and working time. It is quite possible under the existing regime for a self-employed, a ‘false’ self-employed, driver, to drive between 86 and 95 hours per week; perhaps not every week, but one week is enough of a danger in itself. If the Commissioner doubts that figure, he can come to see me any time he likes; I have the figures from the people working in the sector. This is a fact. We must reject the Commission’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The core issue we are dealing with here in this report is whether to include, or exclude, self-employed drivers from the Working Time Directive. It is crucial to remember that all drivers, employed or self-employed, come under the 2006 driving time regulations which regulate their driving time, their break times and their rest periods. Therefore, road safety matters are dealt with adequately under that directive, and, if anybody believes that they are not, then we need to look at the Driving Time Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no data relating accidents to the working time of professional drivers and no data distinguishing between employed and self-employed drivers. Therefore, we have no data on a decision to include self-employed drivers. Legislation must be based on sound reliable data and all the scaremongering about self-employed drivers working 86 hours per week and causing accidents is just that: it is scaremongering and is not based on any reliable data.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation, if it includes self-employed, will be virtually unenforceable. Are we to have an army of inspectors looking over the shoulders of self-employed workers to see if they are performing general administrative duties or administration relating to the job under way? According to the legislation, working time includes when a self-employed person is at their work station. This is defined in the legislation as the main place of business of the undertaking, together with its various subsidiary places of business. Will the office located in the small bedroom or the attic of the self-employed driver’s home be defined as his work station, and who will police and enforce the legislation? Yes, there are issues relating to competition for self-employed, but this legislation will not deal with those matters. In fact, in my own country, we deal very effectively with this matter through the tax system.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if we reject the Commission proposal, we will end up with bad law. It is disproportionate and will not achieve its aims, and it will pile further red tape and bureaucracy on already struggling SMEs in most countries and particularly in my own country, Ireland. It is unenforceable, and that makes an ass of the law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Or will we allow the market and the laws of chance to reign in a transport industry that is coming more and more under pressure? For us in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs here in Parliament, there is no doubt at all. We want self-employed drivers to be included in the Working Time Directive. Thus, we reject the Commission’s proposal to exclude self-employed drivers, for the following three reasons. Firstly, self-employed drivers need to be covered by working time regulations so that we can ensure traffic safety in Europe. With a lorry weighing a tonne behind them, it is absolutely essential to put a limit on their working time to avoid tired drivers and accidents. Secondly, we want to ensure fair competition within the transport industry. In recent years, we have seen an enormous growth in the number of ‘false’ self-employed drivers. This has been the industry’s solution to avoid the working time regulations. As legislators, we must not create incentives for there to be more self-employed drivers in Europe. Instead, we must ensure that there are uniform rules so that we create a level playing field. Thirdly, we want to ensure a good working environment for everyone. From EU studies, we know that self-employed drivers are sick more often and are more stressed than employed drivers. Is this a reasonable state of affairs from the point of view of health and safety? We do not think so.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal has been said about this directive, and many incorrect things have been said. I would like to dispel two myths. Firstly, there is the myth concerning administrative work. Office work does not form part of the regulation, and it is very important to establish that fact. We should bury this myth. Secondly, there is the myth concerning enforcement. I have heard my fellow Members say that it would not be possible to enforce this directive. To these Members, I would simply say that we have a digital tachograph that can provide the measurements. It currently does this for employed drivers, so clearly it can also do so for self-employed drivers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just like to say a few words to Mrs Bauer. As shadow rapporteur for the Greens, I have been very disappointed in how the process has been carried out recently. Mrs Bauer broke all the good rules of negotiation, she broke the ‘code of conduct’ of this House and now she is presenting what she calls a compromise. As far as I am concerned, this is her responsibility – it is not a compromise that is valid for Parliament. It is her filthy proposal that she has produced with the Council by skirting all of the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by saying that this is not about Mrs Bauer’s negotiation methods; it is about people and it is about whether we want to ensure decent conditions in an increasingly pressurised transport industry. This is something that I hope everyone in Parliament will support when we vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s insistence since October 2008 on changing the 2002 directive is unacceptable. The Commission now wants it to cease to apply to so-called self-employed drivers, which would aggravate everyone’s working conditions, particularly due to the possibility that working hours will be increased to intolerable levels simply to allow greater profits for the major employers in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">As an example, so-called self-employed drivers could end up working up to 86 hours per week over the whole year. This would not only jeopardise their health and safety, but would also present a danger to the safety of all other road users. It would also encourage social dumping and the deregulation of employment due to the increased numbers of drivers who falsely state that they are self-employed.</p>
<p class="contents">Being receptive to arguments and studies that demonstrate the dangers of approving such a proposal, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has already rejected it twice, but unfortunately, the rapporteur, with the support of the Commission and the Council, has insisted on pursuing negotiations on the directive alone, as though the decision by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs had never been made.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are now in this very serious situation. This issue needs to be clearly opposed by a majority in Parliament, but this has already been jeopardised by the Commissioner. We advocate rejecting the proposal, so as to prevent the continuation of this grave threat to workers’ rights and the safety of all road users in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call for the rejection of the Commission’s proposal and compliance with the 2002 directive which, since 2009, should be being applied to self-employed drivers in order to combat social dumping, protect the right to health and rest for workers in the sector, and improve road safety conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are misleading because safety is already guaranteed under the 2006 regulation, and detrimental because the competitiveness of thousands of small independent businesses, which have already been sorely tested by the economic crisis, is at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let us not pretend to be unaware of the fact that the legal and technical disputes regarding the directive actually conceal yet another power struggle between European statists, who are ready to place a new, dangerous burden on businesses, and the supporters of the human face of Europe, who are in touch with our citizens’ real needs.</p>
<p class="contents">By intervening to legislate on the organisation of self-employed drivers’ working time, Parliament would be setting a dangerous precedent, authorising a European-branded takeover of entrepreneurship and free enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to put our words into practice. Let us stop exploiting small and medium-sized enterprises for our own ends. It is all too easy to praise widespread entrepreneurship when the aim is to come up with effective strategies to combat the crisis, and then to sacrifice these when EU bureaucracy wants to reassert its strength. I oppose the utopian war of principles with practicality.

This report introduces the practice of unfair competition and will allow it to develop with the growth in the number of false self-employed drivers.</p>

It is true, as Mrs Figueiredo said, that this is a directive that was intended to be aimed at employees. That is correct. However, there are also self-employed people who are not classed as employees.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for people in Europe to be able to decide how they want to work – whether as an employee or as a self-employed worker. That is only right. Naturally, the self-employed also have to play by certain rules. Digital tachographs are already present in all heavy goods vehicles and the equivalent vehicles that we are talking about here. If we were now to include self-employed workers in this directive, it would unduly restrict their freedom of choice. That is why my group is in favour of excluding the self-employed from this directive at all costs. We consider Mrs Bauer’s proposal, and the proposal from the Commission, to be right. That should be taken into account. We want to protect small and medium-sized businesses, and in this case, we can do so by adopting the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am beginning to wonder what the next argument will be to try to show that everything we have been debating for months is complete nonsense. The latest argument is that we have to change something urgently so that nothing changes. Mrs Bauer, can you not see how absurd this argument has become – how riddled it is with lies and half-truths?</p>
<p class="contents">What we are debating here is nothing other than extending the working hours of self-employed workers. However, for more than 150 years, it has been a principle of legislation on working hours that people are protected from working excessively long hours. That applies to the self-employed just as much as to those in employment. It makes no difference whether it is a self-employed worker who is pushing himself too hard or an employer that is pushing an employee driver too hard. It is about protecting people from themselves and from excessively long working hours, as well as in part from employers and others who commission work.</p>
<p class="contents">As a second point, on the matter of road safety, it has been asserted here that nothing can be done in this respect. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not amateurs or volunteers! We cannot pass laws on the basis of ‘Let’s see what happens’. Everyone knows that working excessive hours increases the risk of accidents, particularly in road transport, where the consequences are so serious.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is to ask who would police this proposed differentiated regulation on our roads? Our judges already find it difficult to decide whether someone is self-employed or only ostensibly self-employed without long study of the evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us abandon this nonsense. This is about fair competition. It is not about setting a precedent this morning for future debate on extending working hours. Do not play games like that with this House! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Self-employed drivers would not then be included in these provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a road safety issue. All drivers are limited to driving times and associated work monitored by the tachograph. Including the self-employed drivers will penalise them, especially those who do not use an agency. Company drivers have their schedule provided, but true independents spend time preparing their own schedules and bidding for new business. If included in these provisions, those tasks will be part of their working week so they will have less time to drive, load, unload and cater for passengers, as compared to the commercially employed drivers. Thus, business will be lost and unemployment caused in the small business sector. The bigger operator will take up the slack and we will have another example of the EU promoting big business at the expense of the SMEs who employ half the workforce.</p>

Clearly, everybody agrees that we should support SMEs and, by rights, everybody ought to be concerned about issues regarding, at one and the same time, safety, workers, road users and the conditions for free and undistorted competition.</p>
<p class="contents">However, after Parliament rejected this text in spring 2009, that summer, your predecessor, Commissioner Tajani, then canvassing his government for his re-appointment as Commissioner, told us that he would have some new proposals to make. Those new proposals were never referred to the relevant parliamentary committee for its consideration. Moreover, Mrs Bauer’s report was rejected by more members of that committee than had rejected the previous report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Bauer had no mandate to negotiate, on behalf of this Parliament, a first-reading agreement with the Council. The Commission and the Council have knowingly flouted the operating rules between the institutions. Mrs Bauer has flouted the code of conduct of this institution. This Parliament questions at times the nature of a first-reading agreement because it reduces our ability to negotiate. Now, in this instance, if Mrs Bauer’s amendments are approved, there will be a first-reading agreement that has not been examined by the bodies of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we are seeing a balance being restored between the institutions thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, this Parliament is turning its back on using its collective intelligence. I request, as a minimum, that Mrs Bauer’s proposals, which have never been examined in committee, be referred back to committee for consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Self-employed workers organise their own working hours, and that is the way it should stay. There is a difference between self-employed and employed workers, and that is only right and proper. This has nothing to do with road safety, as driving times and rest periods are identical whether the worker is self-employed or employed. These are monitored by a tachograph, which is intended for that and no other purpose. We do not look beyond this to monitor the road safety situation of employed and self-employed workers.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point relates to something I consider very problematic in the proposals by those who advocate including self-employed workers in the scope: how on earth are you going to monitor this? How do you propose to drop in on self-employed workers and ask when, where and how much they have worked? This kind of monitoring system would not be feasible and would subsequently be considered unacceptable. We should not be making such legislation; we should not be including self-employed workers in the scope of the directive concerning employed workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not need, will not tolerate and will not put up with extra restrictions on self-employed drivers. I am glad that the Estonian Commissioner, who is familiar with conditions in the northern countries, knows this, and that also applies to the Slovakian rapporteur. I want to thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important question of principle. We cannot place restrictions on small business that apply to Europe as a whole. This may be a precedent and it is very dangerous. How does Europe think it will achieve growth and employment if its administrative decisions destroy employment and the preconditions for growth and kill them off?</p>
<p class="contents">I am on the side of Finnish owner drivers and in this case, that also means on the side of small business entrepreneurs all over Europe.

<p class="contents">The matter of road safety is addressed by restricting driving times and having compulsory rest periods, for which there is the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council pertaining to road transport and driving times and rest periods in force, and that applies to all – yes all – lorry and bus drivers, including self-employed ones. A much better option to prevent accidents through tiredness would be more effective monitoring of the driving times and rest periods in force rather than artificially restricting the working times of the self-employed.</p>
<p class="contents">Now there is a move to include such jobs as cleaning the vehicle, technical maintenance and completing consignment sheets in the restrictions on the working hours of self-employed drivers. How can we check whether a self-employed driver is washing his wife’s car or his truck in his own backyard? This is quite incomprehensible, because there are no restrictions on the working hours of other entrepreneurs. It would be a serious precedent if we went down that route.</p>
<p class="contents">As the previous speaker rightly said, in the Nordic countries, like my country, Finland, the transport sector is dominated by small business entrepreneurs and mainly consists of firms with just one or two vehicles. Restrictions on the working hours of entrepreneurs would favour large, supranational transport companies and would make it difficult for new transport firms to start up in business. The sector will certainly not be of interest to the young if we start to restrict artificially the potential to make a living. It would mean a dearth of capacity and increased costs. Already, logistical costs are, on average, higher in the Nordic countries than in the rest of Europe on account of our northern location and sparse population.</p>

A reminder that the scope has covered all self-employed drivers since March of last year would certainly not go amiss. That is the present state of affairs; that is the point of departure the rapporteur should have taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, this is not the precedent the Commissioner claimed it to be. A more pragmatic approach should have been possible, namely including self-employed workers within the scope but, at the same time, taking account of the specific nature of self-employed drivers and keeping red tape to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur from the Committee on Transport and Tourism knows, I had drawn up a number of proposals. I proposed, for example, that the digital tachograph measure not only driving times and rest periods but also loading and unloading operations, supplemented by a kind of unmonitored fixed time for a number of other activities, such as administrative tasks and also cleaning and similar operations. She also knows quite well that activities such as customer contact are neither subject to monitoring nor counted as working time in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I regret that neither the Commission nor the rapporteur was willing to take account of this in any way whatsoever. The proposal to let Member States decide for themselves whether or not self-employed workers should fall within the scope does not strike me as a good one. The objective must be to arrive at common, uniform ground rules at European level so that the same rules apply to all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This optional arrangement is unacceptable and in conflict with EU competition rules. By giving Member States freedom of choice, self-employed drivers in some countries that have already transposed the previous Directive 2002/15/EC would find themselves exposed to direct competition from those of their EU counterparts who are not subject to the same rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Self-employed workers could go to a country with different legislation in force and be subject to fewer checks, which would cause a serious dumping problem and hence, a serious distortion of competition. Businesses could, in fact, use self-employed workers more, as they are able to offer their services on a more flexible basis and at a lower cost. It goes without saying that low costs often equal a reduction in quality and, above all, in safety, which, in the transport sector, results in a serious increase in road traffic risks.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, I believe that the proposal is unacceptable and that it contravenes one of its legal bases, namely Article 153 of the treaty, since it neither improves the working environment nor protects workers’ health and safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are the words of the Commission itself when the directive was introduced on 23 March 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, the Commission has done a U-turn and submitted a proposal that excludes self-employed workers. That sets a precedent and I cannot defend such a policy. There are various reasons not to support the proposal which, in my eyes, represents a step backward socially, a reduction in road safety and an incentive for unfair competition. Neither has the proposal been designed to support small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">To me, this U-turn demonstrates an inability to implement European policy. Despite being twice rejected by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and once in plenary, contrary to a European Economic Area report as well as a judgment by the European Court of Justice, the directive – European law – is simply being amended and steered towards a point where economic interests are the only thing that count. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is obvious that what we are debating today is not the provisions on driving hours and rest times, which impact on road safety and are applicable to all professional drivers, be they employed or self-employed; rather, it is about the regulation of working hours. It is primarily a regulation for the protection of employees – in other words, it is solely for the social protection of drivers and in no way serves road safety. There is no need to protect the self-employed from themselves. How would we check the hours worked by self-employed HGV and bus drivers without a huge amount of bureaucracy, and on what basis would we be checking this anyway?</p>
<p class="contents">Restricting the permissible working hours of self-employed professional drivers in this way – and perhaps, in future, also those of self-employed tradesmen, architects or Members of Parliament – would send out the wrong signal. Instead, the Member States should be working to combat the problem of ostensible self-employment among drivers. I am in favour of the proposal put by the European Commission and Mrs Bauer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is window-dressed to protect employees’ rights and therefore has no place in a self-employed framework. It is also unenforceable without infringing people’s liberties by carrying out checks in their homes.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a matter of road safety. Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 already covers driving time and is applicable to large companies, small businesses and the self-employed. You still need an operator’s licence to work if you are self-employed and would therefore be the registered holder of that licence. Anything which may jeopardise the licence would therefore jeopardise the licence holder’s whole livelihood. With this in mind, it is safe to assume that there is just cause for self-employed drivers to be even more fastidious than big firms. Everything directly related to the service would be considered part of working time; for example, paperwork, maintenance and general administration. In large firms, people are employed to do this; therefore, administration time has no impact on driving time. Self-employed doing their own administration would find, under the directive’s conditions, little time left to do the driving itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As an aside, I believe the Commission also proposed a relaxation of restrictions over night work by introducing a two-hour qualifying period before night-time restrictions apply. I rarely agree with the Commission but this would also be a welcome amendment. I fully support the rapporteur, Ms Bauer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How can a growth in the numbers of small and medium-sized enterprises be stimulated? How, for example, can economic activity be stimulated, if this place – the European Parliament – is going to be a place where we bring in new legislation which restricts that entrepreneurship? After all, if people want to start up on their own in business, including the transport business, they should have the right to do so. We must not treat them, on the one hand, as businesspeople and, on the other, say that they have to comply with criteria designed for employees. We could do the same to people who run a restaurant, on their own and with their family, or for people who run a shop. We must not confuse these two things.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a certain excess of legislation, and the European Parliament also contributes to this. I know that, in Poland, we had the best regulations on economic activity at the beginning of the 1990s. Now we have increased the number of these regulatory burdens, and the result is that this is meeting with criticism. From whom? From the people who are running a business.</p>

It is entirely unnecessary to burden the self-employed with yet more bureaucracy and paperwork. Quite simply, if we are to be able to ensure social security in Europe, then it is very important that we increase productivity and competitiveness. Consequently, the driving times and rest times currently guaranteed by tachographs are entirely sufficient.

I listened with great interest to all your contributions. There is a great temptation to go into detail and to have a debate on the details of this discussion, but I would like only to say that I still confirm the Commission position, which is built on facts. We do not have the studies mentioned here that self-employed drivers are regularly working 90 hours per week, and we think that the Driving Time Regulation, which we would like to enforce, will harmonise practices between Member States and will fulfil this task to ensure and improve road safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Road safety has improved very largely due to the use of the Driving Time Directive. We do not have the information that they are more sick, and why do we sometimes think that small and medium-sized enterprises are behaving irresponsibly, that they do not care about road safety or about their own health, so they must be more regulated than others?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot support legislation which limits the freedom of entrepreneurs in the road transport sector to organise their working time, while in other sectors, entrepreneurs are not subject to similar working time restrictions. However, if the vote in this House confirms the rejection of the Commission proposal, then the Commission will review all possible options, including withdrawal of the proposal, and if Parliament decides to include self-employed drivers in this directive, we will enforce your will. We will immediately inquire with Member States how they apply the working time rules on self-employed drivers and how they monitor compliance with these rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Rules of Procedure. I have studied the Rules of Procedure carefully, and as far as I know, MEPs have full discretion to carry out their mandate and therefore they can consult whoever they want. According to the Rules of Procedure, the parliamentary committee does not require MEPs to voice the committee’s position. It is the plenary session’s position that is binding. That is exactly what the Rules of Procedure say. I do not question, either, the grounds on which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament submitted its proposed amendment, nor who it consulted.</p>
<p class="contents">In agreement with the shadow rapporteurs, I also had informal discussions with representatives of the Commission and the Council when I thought it was important. I agree that the issue of false self-employed entrepreneurs is a real European problem, and we incorporated it in the proposal, in cooperation with the fellow Members who considered the exclusion of self-employed entrepreneurs important. This issue must be addressed, but it is not a sector-specific problem.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a misconception that has been stated repeatedly here, namely, that compliance with this law can be monitored at an international level. This law requires monitoring at a national level. Let me add that at a 4% rate, inspection would be more expensive than moving the European Parliament from Brussels to Strasbourg. I would like to ask my fellow Members to take this into consideration as well. If we reject this proposal, I would also like to say to my fellow Members that we are creating an advantage for third country hauliers. I would like to ask my fellow Members to bear in mind that this is the proposal which the Commission approved. To reject the proposal of the Commission, that is, of the European Commission, is to make it pointless, expensive and impossible to implement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to stress that the Commission’s proposal to remove self-employed drivers from the scope of the directive would represent a significant step backwards in EU social policy and in the area of transport. I would like to draw attention to the fact that ‘false’ self-employed drivers weaken the overall labour market, and the main problem is that in practice, it is difficult to prove ‘false’ self-employment. If we fail to take concrete action and legal measures, then false self-employed work by drivers will become one of the labour market’s greatest problems and we will be unable to avoid unfair competition. In order to improve the working conditions of all drivers and ensure their social rights and guarantees and in order to improve road safety, as well as avoid unfair competition in the European road transport market, we cannot adopt the Commission’s proposal such as it stands today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very sensitive issue, as it concerns our jobs both today and in the future. It is a matter of road safety and of fair competition between companies in the Member States. I would not accept social dumping within our Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Could an independent driver work 14 hours a day, 84 hours a week, and not be a risk on the roads? Compared with a company-employed driver, this is unfair competition. This also leads some companies to suggest to their employees that they declare themselves self-employed. We must protect our fellow citizens and our companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore invite the European Commission to withdraw its proposal and, failing that, I call on MEPs, during tomorrow’s vote in plenary, to vote in favour of keeping self-employed workers within the scope of working time legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Outsourcing and, as a consequence, employers evading their responsibilities, are growing problems. The way to solve the problem that has been suggested, that is, that self­employed drivers should be included in the directive, however, is wrong. The right way to resolve the problems associated with phoney self­employment would be to agree on a definition for self­employment between worker and employer organisations at EU level. At present, the innocent have to suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this issue, we should proceed in accordance with the compromise which, among others, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, Vice­Chair of the centre­right European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), was building. Under this, freelance drivers remain outside the scope of the directive, but Member States may, if they wish, apply the regulation of full-time working hours to freelance drivers in their own country. The suggestion would probably mean that Parliament and the Council would reach agreement on the directive at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity that Parliament is not allowing any opportunities for a compromise. While we should be focusing more on improving the status of entrepreneurs, instead there is the possibility that the working hours of genuine entrepreneurs will be restricted. This is worrying, because the opportunities for small entrepreneurs to earn a living generally depend solely on the work they put in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
