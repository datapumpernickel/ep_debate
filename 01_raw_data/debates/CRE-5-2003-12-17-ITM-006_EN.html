<p class="contents">The conciliation procedure for the Costa report on lorries in transit through Austria was extremely difficult and demoralising, if you like, for all of us who were involved, because this is an arrangement which concerns a specific Member State, namely Austria. There were Members, Austrian members, who – quite understandably in my opinion – had every reason to have an acute awareness of the issues we were debating, because the Austrian people had, and continue to have, a particular awareness of this specific issue, which was why, moreover, the relevant protocol was drawn up when Austria acceded to the European Union in 1995. However, these provisions have expired, which is why the European Parliament took the view even at first reading that 2006 should be the last year during which there should be specific arrangements for Austria, especially as there has been an improvement as regards environmental protection, which has also been recorded in the statistics given to us by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, there were differences of opinion between Parliament and the Council. On the one hand, Parliament maintained that the measures granting Austria beneficial treatment should be limited solely to the Alpine area, while on the other hand the Council maintained that they should apply to the whole of Austria. And then, as regards the lorries which should or should not pass through, Parliament again took the view that more lorries should pass through.</p>
<p class="contents">The views of the two institutions moved closer together during the conciliation procedure. We accepted the Council's view that the special measures should apply to the whole of the Austrian state, while the Council moved closer to Parliament's view, meaning that some of the lorries which the Council proposed should not pass through or should pass through with quotas, will now pass through freely; this was the logic behind Parliament's proposals and it only concerns some, not all, of the lorries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there was one issue, in that the number of lorries subject to quotas was limited, that is, how many eco-points should be available, and on this point Parliament, in a demonstration of solidarity with Austria and our honourable Austrian friends, called for the total number of eco-points to be limited by a considerable percentage. Finally, this opinion on the part of Parliament was accepted by the Council and that is how we arrived at the result of the conciliation. Our honourable Austrian friends voted against it because they considered the measures excessively strict for Austria, while there were other honourable Members, such as Mr Ferber from Bavaria, who considered that the result of the conciliation was excessively lenient for Austria and he therefore voted against it as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, both as a member of the conciliation committee and as representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that the result was balanced, the agreement which we reached was ultimately a good agreement and this is, if you like, also proven by the fact that the various directly interested parties voted against it, some because they considered the measures lenient and others because they considered them strict.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, after such protracted and difficult negotiations, I cannot but recommend today to all the honourable Members, Mr President, that they vote in favour of the result which we achieved in the conciliation procedure, because these measures must apply until the cut-off date in 2006. If, in the meantime, there is progress on the Eurovignette, the relevant agreement will also apply in the case of Austria. Anyway, from 2006 onwards, the same will also apply to Austria as applies to the other European countries, the basic reason being that, according to the statistics at least, there has been an improvement in the environmental indicators, to which improvements in the lorry fleet have made a decisive contribution. So there has been progress in the environmental performance of the lorries which pass through Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we the Group of the European People's Party will vote by a large majority in favour of the result of the conciliation procedure. I am, of course, aware that some members are not happy. To our honourable Austrian friends in particular, I want to say that we took very serious account of their comments and of the comments of the Austrian Government, which fought a very hard battle to support the Austrian positions. However, we could go no further. The same applies to the honourable Members from the other political groups. We could not move any closer to the Austrian positions, because then we would have had problems with Members from other representations. So we have a good result, as good as it could be and, for that reason, I think that it will be approved at the vote by a large majority of Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like in particular to thank Mr Imbeni and the rapporteur, Mr Costa, as well as the Council, for the efforts they have made over all this time in order to find a solution to the problem, holding discussions with the Council in order to reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say very clearly, so that there may be no doubt, that the Commission supports this compromise. I know that the Austrian authorities and Members believe it to be insufficient, and I understand that there may be particular sensitivity, since it is true that we are talking about transit via Austria. But I would like to say once again, ladies and gentlemen, that this compromise improves the conditions for traffic via Austria, for the simple reason that Protocol 9 of the Act of Accession of Austria to the European Union lays down, in Article 11(5), that, at the end of a series of extensions – all of which have been completed – the Community acquis in its entirety will be applicable.</p>
<p class="contents">The last of these extensions has already been adopted and expires on the 31st of this month. Therefore, if this compromise is not approved, the principles of free movement would dictate that all the lorries which travel within the rest of the European Union would also be able to travel within Austria. We are all aware of the special sensitivity of this issue and we have all made an effort to achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would insist once again that I believe that the Austrian authorities, Members of Parliament, and also, very possibly, citizens – since this is an issue which the whole of Austria is very sensitive to – would have liked even greater protection, but I believe that by means of this transitional system we are managing to maintain, despite everything, a situation of privilege – let us make this very clear – for the sake of Austria’s environmental protection. Effectively, we are prohibiting the transit of the most polluting lorries through that country; lorries which, nevertheless, can travel – and are going to continue to travel – throughout the rest of the European Union. In other words, we are diverting the most polluting lorries to other routes and only allowing the cleanest lorries to cross Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this is an example of European solidarity which, although it may seem to you insufficient, I would insist is a very important step, because we are continuing to maintain the system of points which, as well as removing the most polluting lorries, also restricts the traffic of lorries with an intermediate level of pollution, so that only the most modern and efficient lorries can travel freely through Austria. I would therefore insist that all the most polluting and least efficient lorries will be travelling throughout the rest of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that Parliament votes for it today, since the current system expires on 31 December. Nevertheless, operators will stop having ecopoints from 1 January 2004 and it is therefore necessary to adopt a decision with regard to the immediate application of the future provisional points system and allow the circulation of lorries in transit through Austria in a clear and decisive manner, with those limitations which, once again, I am pointing out. I am well aware that this is not the solution; that the solution must be sought by means of the extremely urgent adoption of the Eurovignette system.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have adopted the system of electronic road tolls, which comprises the technical elements which will facilitate the establishment of a Eurovignette system and, if we all manage to agree and show flexibility, we could adopt the Eurovignette over the next three or four months, with this same Parliament and this same Commission, during the Irish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Commission are going to make every necessary effort to achieve this objective, and I hope that Mr Cocilovo and this Parliament will continue working as it has done up till now in order to achieve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Taking on board the difficulties – which we understand although we cannot justify the demands – of the Austrian people, we have decided to grant another privilege – because that is what it is, as the Commissioner said – and extend it to a particularly sensitive area such as the Alpine region and to the entire Austrian territory – making it a twofold privilege – and, rather than limiting it to 2004 and then maybe seeing what to do in 2005-2006, we have automatically extended it to 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the subject of the agreement that we are now ready to support, fully aware that we are going beyond the call of duty. We also believe, however, that, for the good and the preservation of the very sense of European Community, it is right that we make this sacrifice. Any other objections would therefore be inappropriate. Overall, a compromise has been achieved, which is excellent and the best compromise possible for it strikes a balance between the right to mobility and respect for the environment: it takes a gradual approach, it punishes what might be called the improper behaviour of those who fail to renew their HGV fleets while rewarding those who do behave properly, with due respect for the specific conditions and sensitivity of a region.</p>
<p class="contents">If anyone wants to pull out of<span class="bold"> </span>this compromise, they are free to do so, but they would, without a doubt, be making a mistake: this is the best decision that could have been made and it must therefore be supported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was a difficult task in that we were working on a temporary basis with a Council that was often careless, heedless and given to putting off addressing or resolving issues until the last minute. In conciliation, a balance was struck which made sense to all the institutions. It is a balance between two requirements, which I would like to set out: on the one hand, the need to ensure the free movement of goods and compliance with Treaty, and, on the other – something to which Parliament, just like Austria, attaches great importance – the need to protect the environment and people’s health. That means striving for sustainable development which, to address the problem earlier on in the process of pollution, must be achieved through intermodality, the development of rail tunnels and favouring rail transport over lorries.</p>
<p class="contents">In its wisdom, Parliament steered clear of simplistic solutions which certain elements with extreme views advocated in the debate: those defending carriers, on the one hand, and those defending the environment and health, on the other. That is not the way things are as Mr Lisi said too. The conciliation conclusions appear to highlight a number of points which give great consideration to the needs of Austria, first and foremost the fact that the last extension, which was set to end definitively at 31 December 2003, has been superseded by another extension which will take us up to the end of 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner pointed out that, while the most polluting lorries will continue to circulate throughout Europe, Austria will be preserved from a <span class="italic">de facto</span> situation which other countries continue to suffer. As Austria has requested, the application of this regulation and of the ecopoint system has been extended to the whole of the country of Austria, not just the Alpine passes; above all, the option of quotas, decided on at the proposal of the Commission, which has done an excellent job, is the option which comes closest to meeting Austria’s demands.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is to be commended for its work and Parliament is to be commended for the balance it has displayed in performing this difficult task. We are told that Austria wishes to stop benefiting from the exception made for it thus far. We hope that this does not happen and that due consideration is given to the excellent quality of Parliament’s work. For these reasons, after two years of work, I can inform you that our group will vote for the conclusions reached in conciliation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank my fellow MEP, Mr Costa, for his efforts in this area and also his predecessor as Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Caveri, who has also worked hard on this. Indeed, a great deal of energy went into striking a compromise and into changing the transitional system that was put in place upon Austria’s accession, to a more general system. No matter how much I appreciate Austria’s specific problems and the way in which that country is trying to find an answer to them, I do believe that it is impossible for any one Member State to have a permanent derogation in this field. It is clear, though, that there should be a balance between general environmental problems and the geographic situation in Austria on the one hand, and the free movement of goods, on the other. I do not believe that the balance between those two elements is easy. We could peddle very fine theories on this subject, but in practice, after all, tough decisions sometimes need to be taken. I think it extremely important that we should also take a long-term view and try to draft a regulation for traffic across the Alps in general. We should also examine this problem in the context of the Cocilovo report on the Eurovignette. In any case, we regard the agreement that was reached in conciliation as an acceptable one. My group will endorse it. I am slightly worried, though, by the statements that the Austrian minister made following conciliation. I think that statements of that kind are more likely to complicate matters than to contribute to a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am speaking on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left. The group is opposed to this compromise because it would mean a general deterioration of the environment. As I myself read the proposal, however, it is a useful compromise in which Parliament has had a very large proportion of its wishes met. An acceptable balance has been found between consideration for the environment and respect for the free exchange of goods. The proposal means that the ecopoint system can continue throughout 2004, with the option of extending it both in 2005 and 2006. By that time, we shall hopefully at long last have achieved an overall system of road tolls for the whole of the EU. Before we reach that point, however, there are still a number of problems of which both opponents and supporters of the compromise are required to take account with regard to Austria. If we are finally to get to grips with the problem of pollution, we have to think along different, and new, lines. We must move transported goods off the roads and onto the railways. As matters appear right now, there is not much to indicate that there is sufficient will to increase capacity but, as with everything else in the world, you do not get something for nothing. This means that the Austrians are obliged to concentrate upon railway capacity through Austria. As I say, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is opposed to the proposal by the Conciliation Committee, but I personally shall vote in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say to the fellow MEP of mine who put on a demonstration in this House that I think it splendid that he has already begun his election campaign, but he would do better to conduct his demonstration at home in Austria instead of here in Parliament, in which case he and his vacuous demonstration would not, of course, be photographed, however. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There can be no talk of electioneering here. I believe we could fill the empty chairs in this room thousands of times over today with people wanting to tell you of their anger and consternation. It is the first time in the Union’s legal history that the vital interests of a Member State have been treated in this way. Many of you speak of forbearance – think about the word: Austria is treated with forbearance, privileges are granted, prerogatives are extended. Many of you who speak in such terms seem to believe we built the Alps out of spite and we filled our countryside with the continent’s most sensitive plants so that we can stir up national hysteria.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What people in Austria feel is that there is a tremendous danger, and it does not involve only Austrian interests. It is the danger that the right to the free movement of goods, with which we all agree, is becoming a religious right violating the human right to health and protection of the environment and that we are only taking accompanying measures but not guaranteeing people their basic right to health and environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not comment further on this never-ending story with its pitiful outcome. But what you are doing today, Mr President, is raising a question of legal policy. You are turning an environmental conflict, an ecological disaster, into a legal conflict that is unique in history. Austria does not want that solution. Nobody wants it. Do you really want to force this regulation on us against this country’s will, a regulation that is eyewash, camouflage, and which Austria will not enforce? Is that really your intention?</p>

On 31 December next, the exceptional ecopoints agreement expires. Much of our time this year has been taken up by the question of whether, and if so, how, this system should be followed up.</p>
<p class="contents">The report at first and second reading clearly addressed this issue. Parliament wanted nothing but a transitional system from the current ecopoints system to a situation in which foreign lorries would also gain free transit through Austria. This, however, did not appear to be what Austria had in mind. The Council initially went along with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we have reached the end of conciliation, it looks like the Council and Parliament are essentially in agreement after all. The compromise embraces a regime in which the most polluting vehicles are barred and clean ones encouraged, while the available number of points are deducted annually. This is a realistic balance in the light of the conflict between the need to protect the Alpine region – which is indeed vulnerable – and the principle of the free movement of goods – which is, after all, a reality in the European Union. That is why we were bitterly disappointed when Austria announced its intention to abolish the ecopoints system as of 1 January 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">In this debate, I should like to make three appeals. First of all, to Austria, that it may realise the long-standing mutual hostilities its attitude could possibly bring about. Unnecessary internal irritation is far from constructive.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to urge the Commission to carefully monitor the admissibility of potential Austrian actions which may jeopardise the free movement of goods.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I should like to call on my fellow MEPs to review the Eurovignette directive without delay. In its new form, it could provide an answer to the current gridlock. I am pleased with the compromise that has been struck with the Council, and we therefore warmly support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The outcome of the Conciliation Committee is that far more ecopoints are available for vehicles remaining in the ecopoint system than are actually required. The upshot is that this system in effect no longer sets any limits on transit traffic through Austria and is quite simply pointless. Moreover, Austria is required to introduce an expensive counting system that is virtually unfeasible technically and brings only expense and no ecological benefits. In view of this, the fact that the arrangement will apply for three years and not only for the Alpine passes but for the whole of Austria is completely irrelevant.</p>
<p class="contents">To agree to this arrangement would be sheer and utter nonsense and in the end will damage the standing of this House. I therefore ask you to reject the report tomorrow. It would land on the list of senseless decisions and that list is already long enough.

Our country and its citizens are being ridden over roughshod in the most literal sense of the word, regardless. But it is not a black day only for Austria; with this subject the European Parliament, too, is playing with its reputation and is gambling it away here as a representative of citizens and environmental interests, playing into the hands of the noise and exhaust lobby. It was after all the European Parliament that amended the Commission’s original legislative proposal by a large majority and pushed its position through.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of the conciliation procedure is that there are no more controls on transit traffic through Austria. There are no more limits on the environmental damage and no more protection for the local people. ‘Road clear for free lorries’ is the order of the day. If, as some have said, that is a concession for Austria, I can only say: God save us from friends like that! Under these circumstances, there is no question but that the Austrians will reject this proposed regulation. We ask those of our fellow Members who are concerned for the European Parliament’s reputation as an institution that is close to the citizens and friendly to the environment to support us in this.</p>
<p class="contents">However the vote goes, the problems will not be solved. The Republic of Austria sees great difficulties in implementing what is to apply in future and the citizens will find the new rules hard to live with.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see one positive aspect to this whole development: next year we shall be debating the infrastructure charging directive here. It will apply for the whole of Austria. It will no longer be about special favours for one country and its citizens. Then we shall see how this Parliament and its Members will vote: as friends of the citizens and the environment or the way the noise and exhaust lobby wants. Europe’s voters will express their gratitude on 13 June. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Perhaps we have sometimes presented the transit rules as an Austrian privilege or a special arrangement for Austria. It was a special arrangement, but one with a particular pioneering function for Europe as a whole. This transit rule has brought about a change in the heavy goods vehicle fleet in the whole of Europe. It has been modernised, it has been made, if you like, more ecological, that is more friendly to the environment. That is the very thing that is now being prematurely ended. The rapporteur, who is unfortunately not present – it is interesting that this is the second time we have discussed the ecopoint system here without the rapporteur present; his predecessor was not present either; which shows how seriously it is sometimes taken – at least at one stage made a proposal that still gave an incentive to change. But then it disappeared again. The ‘transitional system’ we now have no longer contains any incentive to change over from more environmentally harmful to more environmentally friendly lorries. And that is the greatest drawback, the biggest problem we in Austria have with this system.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference is always being made to the infrastructure charging directive. But I can already hear the arguments over that directive. If we look at Mr Cocilovo’s proposal, it is clear that he does not even want what the Commission is proposing. We are put off from one proposal to the next. Rather than do that, we should make a general rule. I am grateful for the rule, but I do not think it is sufficient. But when this Parliament and certain groups and certain Members in particular cut it back even more and do not want even to accept the Commission’s proposal for a minor diversion from road to rail, then in my opinion there is no longer much point to it. That is my position.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I am asking my fellow Members to reject it tomorrow because it is a sham. I ask my fellow Members to really think again and to say No to a solution that is only pretending to be one. Austria needs a real solution and that is not what we have here. I hope we shall get more support over the infrastructure charging directive than we have had in this case.</p>

<p class="contents">It is for this reason that Austria regards the regulation as unacceptable. Austria has consequently noted that, in the next couple of years, partly caused by the accession countries, transport through Austria could well double, if not quadruple. Ultimately, it decided unilaterally to abolish the ecopoints system on 31 December. As this confronts us with the question of what we will do next, I would ask the Commissioner how she sees things developing in the Council on 22 December. After all, if Austria stands by its view, I do not know what we should do with this decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our esteemed fellow Member, Mr Swoboda, just said that Austria wants more. All my sympathies are with the Austrians but, ladies and gentlemen, we are not in Vienna, in the Austrian parliament: we are in the European Parliament!</p>
<p class="contents">Can we ask ourselves the question as to whether Europe wants more? Of course we can. If I had been born in a valley in Austria the problem would look just like it does from your point of view. But if we look at Europe as a whole, goods nevertheless travel between southern Europe and northern Europe. If they do not go the direct route, and if they do not go the cheapest possible route, they find their own route going some other way. Journeys become longer, there is more wear and tear to the roads, and there is more pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to accept that within the EU we must adhere to common rules, although it might be trendy – and I fully understand this – to hide protectionism behind ecopoints, but we must see the wood and not just the trees. We must see the bigger picture, as the saying goes, because if we transport goods in Europe the expensive way, so that pollution increases, who will pay? It is always the end consumer that pays, that European earning just EUR 1 000 a month.</p>
<p class="contents">What should the solution be? A switch to lorries that generate as little pollution as possible, and obviously, if possible, increased used of the railways. We know in practice that they do not have sufficient capacity, but we shall do our best. We should have tax concessions to switch to the most modern lorries, but it is not appropriate to go one’s own way when we are building a common Europe. We must see that the overall benefit is one the private European citizen can share. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because we were faced with the task of finding a solution for a country that has not itself played a constructive part in the process. We have known what Austria does not want since the first reading here in the European Parliament on the Council decisions. To this day I do not know what Austria does want. I only know that again they do not want the compromise. So I ask for your understanding when I say that we have dealt with the matter quite seriously. How can we find a continuation of the ecopoint system that does justice to Austria’s legitimate interests if Austria does not take part in the decision-making process? I can only say that I and my group agree with this compromise, even if the newspapers and the Parliament’s Minutes and press releases said I voted against it – I only voted against the number of points because I thought 6.9 million was rather too low. The Commission also had other calculations, but I was unable to get my way in the parliamentary delegation. I am therefore naturally for the compromise that was reached.</p>
<p class="contents">When Mr Swoboda says we succeeded in introducing modern technology into Europe, he is right except for one country. I would like to reiterate that here at this point: because of the ecopoint system the lorries on the roads in southern Germany and northern Italy are more modern than the ones the Republic of Austria itself has licensed in its own country because it does not use the ecopoint system. Austria could have set a good example here with national rules. The directive on the introduction of Euro 3 and Euro 4 made provision for this, for using tax incentives to encourage modernisation of the HGV fleet. Then much of what has been said to us so emotionally today would have been easier to believe. I hope that the compromise will be given a large majority here tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the conciliation conclusions must be welcomed as restoring the balance in a situation whereby an instrument is being applied in Austria that holds back HGVs, which can travel freely everywhere else, including in the Alpine regions of France and Italy, without being subject to environmental tolls. I repeat: including in the Alpine regions, and here, I am addressing the Austrian Member who talked as if the Alps were an exclusively Austrian concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet our problems are the same as those of which Austria complains and the environmental damage is the same. We are all in favour of protecting our mountains and countries from an excessive amount of HGV traffic, but it is not by moving the cause of pollution elsewhere that the problem can be solved. Nor is it any consolation that the environmental damage is paid for by extremely high tolls, the effect of which is to bring transport companies, especially the smallest and weakest, to their knees. Indeed, the amount of damage does not change, irrespective of the tolls. I agree with Mr Lisi: this solution is the best possible compromise and it ought to satisfy Austria too. It may be, however, that Austria had become too used to the situation, or, perhaps, not used to it enough, depending on which way you look at it.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, should we do at this juncture? We need to start work resolutely on the trans-European networks, first and foremost the Brenner base tunnel and the high-speed four-track update of the Munich-Verona rail corridor, in order to provide a genuine rail alternative to road transport. However, we need to make things very clear to the companies managing intermodality. It is true that intermodality is currently being implemented in a fairly satisfactory way, but its prices, timetables and services need to be genuinely competitive and attractive – or rather, convincing – so as to draw all the traffic from the roads onto the railways. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Upon accepting membership, Austria obtained a derogation which was due to lapse on 31 December of this year. By way of exception to the derogation, the Council and Parliament agreed in the conciliation meeting to extend the arrangement until the end of 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background of the principle of free movement, this is not a wise decision. However, given the circumstances in Austria, I consider it to be an acceptable compromise between the principle of free movement and the protection of environmental interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, I support the idea that there should always be room for sustainable transport. During the most recent conciliation meeting, Austria’s Transport Minister dampened my delight at the agreement. I consider refusing to carry out a freshly taken democratic decision to be wrong. Meanwhile, judging from the press reports with regard to last weekend’s European Council, this emotional statement appears to have become the Austrian Government’s position. Although I urge acceptance of the compromise that has been reached, I wonder what will be the implications of this decision, which is to be taken democratically.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to hear from the Commission in what way free transit through Austria can be guaranteed within the provisions of the agreement reached in the compromise on environmental pollution, if the Austrian Government chooses to ignore this agreement and assumes it can regulate the issue as it sees fit. Does the Commission see any scope for convincing the Austrian Government at this stage of the benefit of the agreement reached, one that, in any event, encourages the use of cleaner vehicles for transit? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I look at the Austrian Member who spoke of a basic right to health that we are all trampling under foot, yes, ladies and gentlemen, then I would like to call for an immediate stop to night journeys by freight trains, because people’s health is affected when railway trains travel through cities and villages at night making a tremendous amount of noise. Or I would call on the Austrians to close all their skiing areas, because I can assure you I can find enough experts to show you that what you are doing in tourism in skiing areas is bad for human health and the environment. You must be careful not to exaggerate with what you say.</p>
<p class="contents">We are always looking at balanced legal situations where there is one legal asset and another legal asset and we have to find a balance between them. I believe that this compromise, which we have reached after long discussions, is a balanced solution. Because the compromise bans the transit of the dirtiest lorries; if the compromise is not adopted, then not only Greek lorries, which funnily enough you want to allow and which are the dirtiest on the road, but all dirty lorries will be able to drive through Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">That is just an example to say, firstly, that your own position is not as glorious as it seems and, secondly, that this compromise does have advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment is that one must always be careful what high horse one gets up on. Remember that in 1994 the Heads of State or Government called for the construction of the Brenner base tunnel as one of the 14 priority projects. Up until a year ago, your own Austrian planning envisaged that the Brenner base tunnel should be completed in 2021. And in response to pressure from this Parliament and others, Austria has now decided to bring forward the construction of the Brenner base tunnel to 2012. People who claim justice is on their side should be careful and consider whether they are really the saints they think they are.</p>
