<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Whitehead (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the reason for this question and for its urgency. Essentially it concerns the pace at which we will be able to open a full and proper debate on the standards for a single MHP, were we to have one. The Commissioner will, I think, be saying in his reply today when the necessary standards are going to be introduced and published.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for the urgency is that this subject also relates very much to the ongoing debate about media concentration and to development in the field of broadband communications, particularly in the light of what is happening in television and broadcasting at the moment. In my own Member State we have had ambitious plans, aiming to have the most competitive broadband system in the developed world by 2005. However, there have been stumbles along the way to the intended creation of a real competitive market for digital broadcasting and towards a measured advanced analogue switch-off. That serves as a warning to many of us – certainly those in the Committee on Culture, which is unanimous in the view that I am expressing – that the consumer and the citizen need to benefit from an open and wide debate, taking some account of the problems we have had in past attempts at regulation, as well as of those that we face now.</p>
<p class="contents">There need to be clear markers on the ways in which a system of non-discriminatory interconnection and oversight of the gateways of broadband broadcasting and other systems can be operated in the public interest. I am painfully aware of the fact that one of the first attempts to set standards for early satellite broadcasting came adrift because the most powerful broadcasters in the field at the time – and they are still there today, but stronger and more powerful – deliberately decided to bypass these standards and to go their own way. With effective use of the market and less advanced technology, they were able effectively to end that first attempt at common standards. We do not want to make that mistake again, and I believe that in this situation we want to know how we are proceeding.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commissioner to indicate how the European Union as a whole can take an active role, so that the operators of APIs are encouraged and helped to come together. He must know of the suspicions in this regard and precisely where they originate. The APIs are likely to be repeating in some ways what happened in the debate about conditional access and the gateways for satellite broadcasting. Many – particularly in my country would say that you do not need to have a single mandated standard, and that it would be better to encourage the APIs to come together. For the sceptics who believe that it would be very much against some of their interests to do so, and it has to be acknowledged that we would then be gambling everything on a strategy which some of the big operators, once again, would not want to cooperate with.</p>
<p class="contents">How would the Commissioner square the need for competition that guarantees plurality with the technical advances which – according to those who operate it and profit by it – will come from the unregulated market? I do not believe that we can take this matter further without a proper consideration not just of the technical debate but also of the way in which monopolies are currently developing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rocard's questions, I hope, will take the debate further and I will at least be able to listen to the Commissioner in the time available to me. I do apologise again for the fact that I have to leave before the conclusion of this debate, which I am taking part in, as you can see, at very short notice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, the honourable Member’s question relates to the interoperability of interactive television services and the role of the MHP standard. The question contained five points, which I will respond to individually.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on the first point, I can acknowledge that the adoption of the framework directive in the field of communications represents a powerful signal both for operators in the digital television market and for consumers. The directives which will come within this framework will allow us to achieve three important objectives. Firstly, to give broadcasters access to the networks and to connected equipment such as electronic guides and programmes. Next, to prevent excessive regulation through the application of proportional access solutions and finally to benefit the consumer by contributing to the provision of a wide range of services.</p>
<p class="contents">If we consider the legal position established in Article 18 of the framework directive for electronic communication services and networks, the Member States must encourage openness in relation to the provision of an application programming interface (API). No particular API technology or single API will be laid down. The MHP standard satisfies the needs of interoperability and openness in this field. This is why we are encouraging the voluntary application of this standard by the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point relates the date of publication of the standards applicable in the field of MHP. My reply is that the list of standards will be published after the meeting of the committee responsible for communications on 2 October.</p>
<p class="contents">Third point; the use of a non-standardised API technology may give a company power on the market. The directive in question lays down specific solutions which may be used by national regulation bodies to control the power of certain companies on the market. Since it guarantees interoperability and offers users greater freedom of choice, standardisation will certainly contribute to preventing the appearance of monopolies. However, in itself competition is not a measure of fair competition. Dominant players may appear, even when there are open standards.</p>
<p class="contents">On the fourth, as I said in the reply to the first point of the question, the objectives of the regulation are openness and interoperability. The MHP standard meets the needs of interoperability and openness in this field. This is why we are providing political support for the voluntary application of this standard by the sector. However, the sector also wishes to hold a dialogue on interoperability, particularly on migration. We have therefore launched a debate and sectoral investigation into interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the fifth point, in its declaration to the plenum on 12 December 2001, the Commission committed itself to publishing the relevant MHP standards in a list of standards to be published in the Official Journal, in accordance with Article 17 of the framework directive. Pursuant to this directive, the Member States must encourage the application of the standards contained on the list. Secondly, the Commission is committed to examining, a year after the entry into force of the directive, whether interoperability and freedom of choice for users have reached a satisfactory level in the Member States. If that is not the case, the Commission will be able to propose making the use of these standards obligatory. In accordance with our commitments, we will provide a list of standards after the meeting of the competent committee on 2 October, as I have just said. They are scheduled to be examined between now and July 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 18 of the framework directive demands that Member States encourage the use of an open API. The Commission will therefore hold a dialogue with the Member States and national regulation bodies, by means of the committee. The MHP will certainly be amongst the subjects discussed within the framework of this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The widespread adoption of the MHP seems to be the most obvious means of achieving interoperability. Businesses must take the initiative in terms of creating migration strategies since migration itself raises many technical and commercial problems. We are pleased with the sustained efforts of the sector to resolve these problems and reach agreements, at national or European level, in view of the transfer to MHP. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How can we achieve this objective? No further debate is needed, we held our debate when we passed a resolution on the telecommunications package and, more particularly, on the framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, and this is why we asked the question, we wanted the Commission to tell us what it can do to help implement the resolutions we passed then. And I am grateful because I think the Commission's statements have pointed to a constructive way forward here.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to reiterate that we have three basic resolutions. First, open interfaces, so-called APIs are not enough; these open interfaces need to be widely accessible, i.e. they must be interoperable. That is the objective we decided on together in the framework directive. Secondly, we decided that the Member States should promote the introduction of interoperable technology. Thirdly, we decided that we had until July 2004 for this voluntary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is pushing for action in order to bring about a voluntary, user-friendly solution which also guarantees real freedom of choice and pluralism. For that, as you announced today, Commissioner, we need the technology, the standards which meet these requirements, to be published. There is a standard which has already been licensed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, which is responsible for the standards, namely MHP, which is why Parliament's demand is perfectly clear in the resolution we are voting on today. What we want to do is promote the technology that incontrovertibly meets the requirements. Hence the demand and the call in the resolution for the Member States to submit an action plan as quickly as possible – we are saying by the end of this year – as to how this objective can be achieved, so that we have real results by July 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">So, as you see – and my thanks here to all my honourable friends in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy who helped here – we refer to the resolution and voluntary implementation of this resolution, but in the time specified and for the purpose specified. That is the point of this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust that we have the agreement and support of the Commission and the Member States, in the interest of our citizens.</p>

We have not raised the question of comprehensive interoperability in the telecommunications directive, but we know that it is of huge importance to Europe, which sets standards in media policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the regulators, like the European Parliament, were not perhaps decisive enough in the early days. But we are now, because time is running out. The summer of 2004 will be here before we know it. Let us call it guidance that we need in this voluntary procedure; what our institutions are waiting for and what we are jointly calling for is a clear media policy message.</p>
<p class="contents">We have mentioned a single standard. We have consistently avoided the word simple. We do not want to jump the gun. But this is not jumping the gun, it is being logical. As my honourable friend, Mrs Hieronymi said, we could have set one standard that speaks this common language, a single language, in the MHP. We need more clear political signals here. We opted for a single system for mobile telephones and we should do the same here and now. Before the industry invests any more and we have various other APIs which cannot talk to each other as we would like, because the more economic facts, figures and data there are on the table, the harder it will be for politicians to intervene directly here. This common voluntary procedure needs clear signals from us. Again I read a quotation in a technical journal recently in which you pointed out that the Commission can lay down binding European standards here if appropriate freedom of choice for our citizens and interoperability are not achieved by 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think it will come to that. We should be able to find a joint solution before then. We need to meet each other half way. A large majority of market players are in favour of MHP and we should say so clearly. I think that is the answer expected of us.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Harbour (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I am very pleased to be participating in this debate, not as a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport but as one of the rapporteurs on the electronic communications package and a member both of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to say to colleagues from the Committee on Culture who are present that this is not an issue for that committee alone. It would be good if they encouraged more participation in their work within Parliament. This question was developed entirely within their committee. I am glad to have been able to work with many colleagues and to make a contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is a much wider range of issues at stake here. Firstly, I sense a perception that this whole idea about a multimedia home platform (MHP) is somehow a silver bullet, a magic cure that will, in one sweep, create universal accessibility for digital television. Mrs Echerer gave us a hint of that just now. That is far from the reality. It is not like mobile telephony; it is not like introducing a GSM standard, because we already have digital television systems in the market, delivering services that consumers want to quite a high interactive standard. In my own country nine million people already have systems operating under other standards than MHP. Indeed, the final standard – the full interactive standard – for MHPs has not even been published, and yet colleagues here want to rush ahead and standardise it. That is not realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find a lack of realism about the whole idea that somehow we want to impose a particular business model on broadcasting. This resolution contains a rather unnecessary attack on vertical organisation and my group, and I hope Parliament, will reject that element.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner said earlier, this is an issue on which I and other Members have worked in connection with the electronics communications package. We have put competitive instruments in place to stop vertical operators from abusing their dominant position in the marketplace. There are also must-carry obligations that we expect member governments to enforce. The first thing we should be saying to the Commission is that we want them to be enforced. They are critical. It is not up to us to enforce a particular business model. We are not there to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of application interfaces and the technology, the key word is 'interoperability'. It is not a single standard, and just having a single standard does not mean you automatically get simple authoring or interoperability. We have three mediums in the United Kingdom already – cable, terrestrial digital – a powerful access for people to get onto the digital system – and satellite. Each of those has a different interface. The Commission needs to encourage what I call a toolkit for digital authors. That will allow digital authors to come on and have a common set of principles within which they can develop programmes for any platform. That is the sort of practical thing the Commission needs to work on. It certainly needs to monitor how MHP is developing and to see whether that needs further encouragement. However, we are already well down the road to the digital revolution already, and the sort of interference that is being implied by some colleagues here – I am pleased to say not in the resolution – will not help the way forward. We must be realistic about what is going on in the market-place and what consumers are buying now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Posselt (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, as the representative of a thriving but also highly endangered media centre – namely Munich – I welcome this question by the Committee on Culture and today's debate. I must make one thing quite clear: the European Parliament has a very long tradition in media policy, especially on television issues in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It dates back to the beginning of the 1980s with the highly prophetic report on European television by the former Culture Minister of Baden-Würtemberg, Professor Hahn, who was MEP for Heidelberg at the time. It was way ahead of its time, even if some of the proposals made then have long since been overtaken by events. But in the intervening years, this House has lobbied consistency for European television, through to the telecommunications directive and the Television Without Frontiers directive.</p>
<p class="contents">What were the two core elements? First, we have stated quite clearly that we want to prevent this necessary, proper and important technology from being abused, by setting unequivocal ethical standards. And secondly, we have constantly reiterated that this is a question of competition, and not just competition within Europe, but the competitiveness of Europe per se. Today we can see that this European market stands in increasing danger from non-European suppliers and non-European monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore take the view that we really do have to go the way proposed today, namely the way of voluntary convergence and harmonisation, but that this should not be used as an excuse for doing nothing. I therefore emphatically support what Mrs Hieronymi has said. We really do need a deadline. We know from the Member States – of which there are presently fifteen but of which there will soon be twenty-five or thirty – that they are not exactly quick off the mark when it comes to action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Having come down in favour of voluntary action, we really should set this deadline for the Member States by the end of this year, as far as submitting action plans is concerned. Otherwise we will have to come up at the beginning of next year with ways of speeding up the process. I share the view expressed by Mrs Echerer, that hopefully there will be no need for the Commission to step in with binding proposals and standards, but I fear it may come to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to again urge the Member States to submit their action plans by the end of the year. We need to make it quite clear that we are as concerned about the competitiveness of Europe per se as we are about cultural diversity in Europe, the cultural diversity that makes Europe what it is and – and this too is an important point in this resolution – the potential of small and medium-sized enterprises. And the challenge here is for small and medium-sized enterprises. We in the European Parliament see ourselves as the champions of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are perhaps still shying away from a great deal in the dimension facing us.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, thank you for your clear and detailed reply, but may I say quite unequivocally that, if the Member States fail to submit their action plans by the end of the year, we shall have to meet again in January in order to discuss how the European Union is to proceed.</p>

And if I am not from Cologne itself, then neither is Mr Posselt from Munich itself; however, as a Rheinlander like Mrs Hieronymi, I have a regional connection just like Mr Posselt.</p>
<p class="contents">And the only reason I am standing here talking on cultural policy issues is because I have had to jump into the breach and replace my honourable friend Karin Junker who is ill and whose illness is too serious for her to be here. So, Mr President, if you hear me making a speech that is completely off the mark, attacking my honourable Christian Democrat friends in the usual battle of principles between left and right, it is because I am not the expert in this particular field that I consider myself to be in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Murmurs)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your friendly show of agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Junker has instructed me to say the following on her behalf: the audiovisual sector is a growth market and a powerful economic factor. Mr Harbour made it perfectly clear in his speech that this is not just a question of the configuration of the market, it is a question of who on the market is exercising what influence and where. To give you a statistic: EUR 65 billion is the estimated turnover in the audiovisual sector alone this year in terms of gross domestic product. And the audiovisual industry is an employment sector, employing 950,000 people. It is this sector that will regulate access to information for the broad mass of people in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The average person, so Karin Junker tells me, watches 206 minutes' television a day and listens to the radio for 3.5 hours. I do not qualify as an average person.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The objective we must work towards, as several honourable Members have explained, is that of a single European API or Application Programming Interface, to give it is proper name. So just as we have a single mobile telephone system, the so-called GSM system, we need one API and not 15 different APIs in the European Union. If we want a competitive market, then we need a single system. Which is why the difference between us and Mr Harbour is easy to explain, because what Mr Harbour has said is precisely the position of someone who insists that isolationism, of an insular nature, will obstruct the creation of this API.</p>
<p class="contents">MHP is the only open, interoperable standard which meets the requirements which need to be imposed on this system. The European Commission should, as the Commissioner has already explained in detail in his reply to the five questions put by Mr Rocard, quickly take the initiative and introduce this standard. I share Mr Posselt's view: if the Member States fail to make a move on this issue in time, then we must take the initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The comment that television is the number one source of information does not just hold true for viewers during election broadcasts on the eve of elections in the Federal Republic of Germany; access to television, access to this democratic, pluralistic information system is a fundamental democratic right of all European citizens and needs to be anchored in the plurality of democracy. Access must be guaranteed, irrespective of the form of television on offer in the future. And if the future of television is digital, then access to this digital television system is a basic question of democratic rights, plurality and the freedom of self-determination of our citizens on information matters.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the only way of guaranteeing in future that, on the one hand, market suppliers will be able to offer all consumers a complete range and, on the other hand, our citizens the consumers will be able to make use of what is on offer with the greatest possible freedom of choice. We European Socialists here in this Chamber would like to remind Commissioner Liikanen that he promised to implement a single standard by 2004. If the media sector cannot agree on a uniform approach, then we shall go one step further. As Mr Posselt said and as Mrs Echerer said.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the European Socialists in this Chamber therefore call on you to act as quickly as possible so that we can make progress on one of the fundamental questions for the future of a European information society as quickly as possible, but also in as pluralistic and democratic a manner and, my dear Mr Harbour, as uniformly as possible.</p>

<p class="contents">I agree fully with the European Parliament that digital television as such, including interactive television, has tremendous potential for extending the reach of the information society. The Commission is already actively involved in advancing the role of digital television and promoting interoperability. In particular I would like to mention the eEurope 2005 action plan. This fully recognises the role of digital television in helping to achieve the Lisbon agenda for instance, as an alternative platform for citizens to receive on-line public services. Member States are asked to publish switch-over intentions by the end of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year, the Commission also intends to adopt a communication on digital switch-over. Another communication, on which we are working now and which should be discussed at the Copenhagen European Council later this year, will analyse remaining barriers to open platforms in digital television and 3D mobile communications.</p>
<p class="contents">The answers I have just provided to various parliamentary questions have outlined all the steps we are currently taking regarding interoperability in interactive television. It is important that interoperability evolves hand-in-hand with the development of the interactive television market.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that interoperability in the field of interactive television is covered by the Electronic Communications Framework Directive we should avoid duplicating regulations by also covering this in the Television Without Frontiers Directive. Together with my colleague, Viviane Reding, we will ensure that complementarity and coherence are maintained between the electronic communications package, dealing with transmission and access issues, and the regulation of contents – for objectives of general interest covered by the Television Without Frontiers Directive, which will be the subject of a review next year.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission welcomes the resolution and calls for the development of digital television and the availability of digital television to the public at large to become a top priority on the political agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
