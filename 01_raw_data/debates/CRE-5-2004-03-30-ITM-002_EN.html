I had the opportunity to work on these dossiers with both the Italian and the Irish Presidencies, to which I am grateful for an outstanding and comradely piece of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">What is it all about? The four regulations we have before us are an important part of the measures to improve food safety in the European Union. They were drawn up with the aim of replacing 17 directives and making the law more coherent and more science- and risk-based. Do the texts produced by the Commission, Council and Parliament meet those requirements? I believe they do. I believe we have created an excellent legal base. The effects may be described as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is greater legal certainty. The proposals build on tried and tested practices with additional measures for greater food safety, but the crucial thing is that they are a new legislative concept. The choice of a regulation, which means that the same text applies everywhere in the European Union, was a decisive step for greater coherency and less bureaucracy. That the Commission, Council and Parliament have agreed to expand the mandatory parts of all requirements is very much to be welcomed. This will enable firms involved to act with greater legal certainty. When requirements are constantly changing, that is of immense importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s efforts to limit the scope for amending the annexes in the comitology procedure must also be seen as part of this approach for stability and legal certainty. We have found a more or less acceptable arrangement. I can, however, also assure you that we shall be watching the use of comitology for amending the annexes very critically. Legal certainty must be the main concern. We do of course need flexibility as well to be able to respond to new dangers and new situations. I believe we have that, too.</p>
<p class="contents">The second principle behind the new food safety rules is in the interests of all concerned. The introduction of the ‘from farm to table’ principle, self-inspection by businesses with the use of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) principle and of guides, and the greater attention paid to scientific findings are the essence of the new approach. Everyone concerned is brought into the system. However, the new system also takes account of the type of production process and the guarantees offered by the food business operator. That is why the new approach is also marked by greater flexibility. The fact that exemptions and variations are possible is not inconsistent with the aim of improving food safety. They are, however, only permitted for traditional production methods in difficult remote areas, that is, in places where remoteness of location or the mountainous nature of the region brings its own problems, and of course where local markets are supplied. The great variety of means of production in the European Union can be taken into account. I believe that making this dependent on the competent authority’s risk assessment was a wise approach. I will mention only in passing that the Council and Commission have slightly watered down the ‘from farm to table’ principle in as much as the HACCP procedure will not be mandatory in primary production. I believe we have managed to find a wise solution here, too, in leaving the arrangements to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with this ‘low requirements for low risk’ approach, however, we should give small businesses the assurance that evidence of the results of the HACCP principle can be provided in a form acceptable to the firm. I am referring here to recital 15 of Common Position No 1 on the food hygiene regulation, according to which good hygienic practices can replace monitoring of critical control points. I consider this arrangement especially suitable for artisanal small businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The official veterinarian is central to the proposed system of official supervision of meat production.</p>
<p class="contents">He performs audits and inspections so that the requirements of the relevant provisions can be observed by all concerned. The official veterinarian must have the statutory means to enforce the requirements. This also means that the legal texts must lay down clear criteria for his decisions. That is why it is important that Parliament has included the basic tasks of official controls in Article 3.</p>
<p class="contents">The veterinarian and official specialised assistants must also show evidence of a high level of expertise. I believe this is right. In some Member States, however – and that is already evident – this will require a change to veterinary training. The authorities in the Member States should also act quickly to ensure that enough personnel are available to be able to comply with the wide-ranging regulations. So far as I am aware, only a few countries currently have the staff to perform such tasks as the rule we have adopted about the conditional approval of establishments. Let me make this clear: with their current staffing levels the authorities will not be able to check three times in six months that an establishment meets the approval requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing required of the competent authority is the integration of controls. It is no longer enough to concentrate on the enforcement of statutory provisions. The involvement of businesses in food safety matters also requires greater flexibility on the competent authority’s part. The business operator should see himself as a partner and be seen as one. That cannot be legislated for by statute, but the foundations for greater food safety through cooperation have been laid.</p>
<p class="contents">One point was a matter of dispute for a long time: the involvement of slaughterhouse staff in official controls. I am aware – and I am speaking here as a parliamentary rapporteur – that the compromise that has been reached may not meet with this House’s approval. There are a number of reasons for this. Some say, for example, that this rule will not help us in what we have always been trying to do, that is, to improve food safety indeed, that it will have quite the opposite effect. The regulation on official controls of feed and foodstuffs requires those carrying out official controls to act independently. The establishment’s staff are dependent on the head of the establishment. Staff training restricts the veterinarian and therefore hampers his ability to make controls. There remains the question of costs. Does the operator really save inspection costs? I do not believe so. All the calculations show the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, gentlemen of the Council, that we should agree here to come back to this and try to clarify it in perhaps two or three years’ time. Since this regulation brings much that is new to the Member States and will require a lot of adjustment by all concerned, we should first apply it for two or three years and then concentrate on this question again. I think we should use the existing outcome and adopt these regulations in this legislative period without further discussion. They are an important foundation for food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has now arrived, I would like to repeat what I said at the beginning: my sincere thanks to you and your colleagues for your extraordinarily close cooperation in working on the texts of these regulations. I think it is a good piece of work and we will come much closer to our objective of improving food safety in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, may I first express my thanks for all the hard work done by members of the committees concerned with the proposals on food hygiene. Almost four years have gone by since the Commission presented this package. I would therefore like to remind you of the objectives that were envisaged when we put forward this recast of the hygiene rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, we are pursuing four objectives. The first objective is to adapt hygiene legislation to the general principles of food law set out in the White Paper on food safety. The second objective is to make the existing rules more science- and risk-based. The third objective is to define the role of the competent authorities; and the fourth objective is to consolidate and simplify the regulatory environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions on the package have taken a long time, both in Council and in Parliament. This is not surprising, taking into account the wide interests covered by the proposals and their highly technical nature. This long period gave ample time to reflect on the proposals and the time is now ripe to conclude the debate and adopt the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council's common position is, in the Commission's view, a fair compromise that clearly reflects the views of Parliament. I was pleased to hear that the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs have recognised this fact. Nevertheless, a number of amendments were tabled for the second reading. With a view to addressing the points set out in these amendments, the Commission has contributed to the establishment of a compromise between the Council's position and that of Parliament. Discussions on such a compromise were successfully completed and Coreper has already endorsed it. Amendments reflecting this compromise package have also been tabled for the vote later today.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned, however, lest there be a desire to cherry-pick the compromise negotiated with the Council. A compromise requires that all parties make concessions. This relates in particular to the involvement of slaughterhouse staff in meat inspection for veal and pigs. The common position, approved unanimously by the Council, foresees the possibility of slaughterhouse staff carrying out some inspection tasks. The Commission believes this is appropriate. It is not, as some say, a privatisation of meat inspection. It only allows the slaughterhouse staff to assist the official veterinarian. There is no general authorisation for involving slaughterhouse staff in meat inspection. Subsidiarity is the guiding principle here. The decision as to whether to apply the system will be taken by the Member States on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the proposed regulation contains a number of very strict rules that guarantee the independence of the controls. These include in particular that the slaughterhouse staff involved in meat inspection must be independent from production staff and must report directly to the official veterinarian. Slaughterhouses that wish to involve their staff in meat inspection must be specifically authorised for that purpose by the competent authority. I would like to stress that the system has already functioned satisfactorily for more than ten years for poultry meat and rabbit meat in most Member States. No complaints have been registered and no misuse has been reported on this. Taking account of these elements, the proposal to extend the system to veal and fattening pigs is proportionate and fully in line with the objectives of the proposed legislation I outlined to you a couple of minutes ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is willing to go along with the compromise proposal put forward by the Council that would defer the entry into force of the system for another three years. This is reflected in Amendment No 21 to the proposal on official controls. The Commission cannot, however, support Amendments Nos 9 and 14, which the rapporteur is recommending that Parliament support. Should these amendments be adopted, conciliation would appear inevitable. This would be a pity, particularly having regard to the length of time – since July 2000 – that these proposals have been under consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to reiterate my gratitude to all those who have contributed to reaching this stage. The Commission can accept all amendments to the common position that are part of the compromise package negotiated with the Council. The Commission cannot support amendments falling outside this package. A full listing setting out the details on this will be made available to Parliament's secretariat<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that with the results before us today we have taken a step towards greater food safety in Europe. It is also important, when food comes over the border, that we should be able to tell the citizens they can rely on that food being safe and that there are no health risks.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, however, also managed – at any rate better than in the Commission’s original proposal – to make the proposals practicable. I would like to draw attention to one particular point in the first Schnellhardt report on general food hygiene. The HACCP plan is a very good plan for large businesses. Large businesses that employ a large number of people, possibly in several Member States, have to keep accurate records of who has handled a product when. From the outset, I found it difficult to transfer this concept to very small businesses, because if a restaurant or confectioner’s employs only two or three people, we do not need any written documentation to know who has handled the product and where harm may have occurred. In such cases, verbal information is enough and that is why, in the negotiations, we pressed very hard for the documentation requirement for small businesses to be toned down in line with the risk associated with this type of production. We do not think documentation is necessary at all for very small businesses. It would be practicable then. It would not be detrimental to consumer protection, but we would ensure that small businesses in particular are able to apply the rules appropriately.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome is not exactly what we would have wanted. We have, however, reached compromises on many points, especially in the first report, and we are therefore able to back the reports with a clear conscience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much as I, of course, appreciate Mr Schnellhardt’s work and efforts, I am, to be honest, somewhat disappointed with the way in which he has gone about things. It is not very upright to negotiate with the Council on your own initiative and to take only your own amendments into consideration. Personally, I think that it does not reflect well on Parliament to agree on a compromise with the Council and at the same time to want to adopt the original amendments. That is not a credible working method.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I should like to take a brief look at five years of food safety and on nearly three years of food hygiene. When it comes to general food legislation, we have jointly decided that food producers shoulder the main responsibility for the safety of their products and that the way in which they do this should be monitored by the government. We are now on the verge of turning back the clock. I do not agree with this, but this is where I am not speaking on behalf of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">How did we get into this situation? I think that first of all, we should search our own hearts. The food hygiene dossier is complex and contains hundreds of amendments about all kinds of details. As a result of this, only a few spokesmen are involved in this dossier and it is very easy for outsiders to spread misinformation.</p>
<p class="contents">What is it all about? What is crucial is who monitors the food producers. In the light of general food legislation, this question seems straightforward to answer. The producers ensure that their products are up to scratch and the government monitors the final inspection. The Commission, in agreement with the guiding principle that was established for meat producers, particularly pork and veal companies, under the watchful eye of the government, wants to offer the opportunity of accepting their responsibility and of carrying out the monitoring activities themselves. Part of the meat sector also wants to carry this responsibility and call an end to cases of abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much opposition to the idea that butchers should inspect their own meat, and rightly so, for the government should have a monitoring role and has a clear task in the inspection. However, giving butchers more responsibility is a positive step. A majority of our group has rejected the idea of the meat sector taking on the responsibility itself. According to them, the staff at meat companies are not capable of monitoring quality, or in a position, to do so. I have a different opinion personally. I think we should move away from authoritarian companies who do not tolerate any criticism from their staff with regard to the quality of their products. I do not think that Parliament should regard the workers in the meat sector as frightened and uninformed people incapable of forming their own opinions. As long as the government has its monitoring role, companies can carry the responsibility themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge everyone to support the compromise that we have reached with the Council and to prevent us from adopting the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for that is not the right way to go about things. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Schnellhardt’s recommendations constitute a very important part of these efforts because they affect the issue of how matters should in practice look in restaurants, shops, abattoirs and cutting plants, irrespective of whether they are large or small.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I am not without certain views to the effect that the matter has taken an eternity. It has been tough. Mr Schnellhardt and I have, of course, had different views on certain technical issues when it comes to both his and my reports, which have a lot in common with each other in certain areas. Nonetheless, I have to say that, in the last analysis, Mr Schnellhardt has done a very constructive and skilful job. There is no doubt about that. I wish to thank him for his cooperation. We shall support the compromise, if not wholeheartedly. There are a couple of small aspects about which I am extremely concerned, for example when it comes to the definition of cutting plants. The definition does not expressly state that the rules in actual fact apply to all establishments that cut and otherwise deal with raw meat. I regret that, because we know how dangerous such plants are for, even if feed producers, farmers, hauliers and abattoirs behave perfectly correctly, hygiene can still be completely ruined at the very last stage.</p>
<p class="contents">A compromise depends, however, upon both give and take by the parties concerned. The ELDR Group, to which I belong, will not get exactly what it wants, otherwise, we should of course be in a dictatorship rather than in a democratic assembly. I am concerned about the cutting plants. I hope that the European meat industry will go to court if the definition is not interpreted as best it can be.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, we support these recommendations and are very pleased that we have reached this agreement. I should like to state that those of us who have worked on it have, in general, done some skilful and persistent work to make food safer. I should also like to mention Mrs Corbey and Mr Whitehead. It is perhaps we who have been most industrious in these matters. Thank you for your cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council's common position has taken on board the majority of Parliament's amendments from first reading, but there remain differences mainly concerning the following points. How far can hazard analysis and critical control points – HACCP – be implemented in primary production on farms? What flexibility is going to be granted to Member States? Will it be a general clause for comitology, or a more specific rule which allows comitology only within a set of fixed aims, as it would appear the rapporteur prefers? Will we see the self-control of the meat industry by employees working as meat inspectors? Would the flexibility foreseen for small artisanal slaughterhouses be defined by marketing only regionally as a result of requiring the presence of official veterinarians during every slaughter process?</p>
<p class="contents">The key issues for my Group at the first reading were basically the direct marketing of food on the farm or at local retailers and flexibility for the processing of traditional products. These are mainly covered by the Council's common position which we very much welcome, because we feel it is important that there be some flexibility for the processing of traditional products and also in relation to artisanal production.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem for my Group with the compromise package now proposed by the Council is where the latter insists on extending controls by slaughterhouse employees to include pigs and calves. My Group – and as far as I know the rapporteur – strongly objects to this self-control. It would allow self-policing and it could end up with a blind eye being turned in certain circumstances, depending on how productive some of the slaughterhouses are: so this is not a good idea. It is not in the interests of what we are trying to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want this point accepted. That is the key issue for us as regards this report. We are pleased that the issues of artisanal and local production of traditional products have been taken into account in the common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an absolute priority, given the ‘poor hygiene’ episodes that have occurred in recent years and also in view of the backlash that many primary sector activities have suffered as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the compromise position proposed by the Commission, the Council’s response and Parliament’s own position, it is clear that, as with all compromise and mediation positions, everyone would always like something extra. I believe, however, that this is a very sensible compromise position because it is a compromise between the demands of producers and those of consumers, between good business and safeguarding the basic right of citizens to safe, healthy food and produce.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three considerations I should like to make. We should have preferred it, of course, if the regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs provided for a perhaps more forceful implementation of the HACCP system and probably referred more closely to the <span class="italic">Codex alimentarius</span>. We should probably also have liked greater insistence on the ‘from farm to table’ principle, a principle that is very attractive to consumers but which needs to be made much clearer and involves additional costs to the farming sector. Lastly, we should have liked to underline more strongly the fact that we consider it essential that regulations approved in the Community should be equally valid in all the Member States; it would therefore be appropriate to restrict the possibility of approving changes and to authorise them only to give greater protection to an individual country’s traditional products, without ever relaxing food standards and safety.</p>

It has been something of a marathon and a lot of hard work, but he has done a very good job. We now have a package of measures that is going to ensure the health and safety of the European public and the quality and safety of the European meat supply for the foreseeable future. These measures, when put in place, are ones in which we can have confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the issues have been more difficult than others. We all recognise that the system should not be overburdened with too much bureaucracy, and we have acknowledged the need – certainly in some sectors – for self-inspection or inspection with a light touch. In the areas of poultry and rabbit production, there is clearly a demonstrable need for that and there is no serious problem of public health.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is a need for an independent inspectorate to keep a close eye on certain sectors, such as the work in abattoirs and slaughterhouses across Europe, where there is a lot of time pressure and pressure to perform and where there is evidence to suggest a potential public health risk – most notably in the red-meat sector. Whilst I do not know anyone who eats raw rabbit or raw poultry, I know many people – some are Members of the European Parliament – who eat red meat that is either raw or close to raw. Consequently, there is a greater and more serious health risk in that sector than in meats that are cooked before being consumed by the public. For that reason, I consider the compromise arrived at by the Council – regarding the possible extension of self-inspection to areas such as pork and veal – to be a dangerous one. I feel it is one that we should not be stepping into at this moment: it crosses the species barrier and it opens up the possibility of self-inspection in the red-meat sector in the future. I cannot support that. All of us realise the importance of these public health measures: we need only recall the terrible food poisoning incident that took place in Scotland owing to the contamination of red meat only a few years ago. We have got to protect public health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we are presented with a good opportunity of completing the whole food legislation package, namely the assessment of safety right down to the last step.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are discussing today makes possible the repeal of a huge number of directives. We will be able to tie up all the loose ends with regard to the issue of the verifiability of food production, the integral chain approach, or in other words the stable-to-table approach.</p>
<p class="contents">There are quite a few snags in the compromise package that the Council and the Commission have tabled and which was rubberstamped by Parliament. However, everything is at risk of falling somewhat into disarray at the last minute because there seem to be a few misunderstandings. I am also addressing Mr Bowe when saying this.</p>
<p class="contents">What is it about? It is about defending the compromise that the Council has tabled. What is at issue is that it should be possible for companies where food is produced to take on some additional responsibility, that a thorough check is carried out into what is wrong with the meat and that we subsequently, under the final responsibility of the official veterinary and the government that has appointed the veterinary, state whether we think the meat is up to scratch or not. In the Netherlands, this system has been functioning to everyone's satisfaction for some years now. Mr Bowe stated a moment ago that a few years ago, there was a problem in Scotland involving red meat, but I should like to point out that a different system is used over there.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have to do is to ensure that the responsibility is laid on those shoulders that can unreservedly carry it. That means that the system needs flexibility and that red tape should be reduced to a minimum, but that, however, guarantees must be in place such that the consumer can count on being given food that is safe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge the House to support the Council's compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue has been raised, not only by the Consumers' Association, but also by the UK trade union Unison, which represents meat inspectors. The feeling is that the Commission's proposal would allow privatisation through the back door by placing the responsibility for hygiene in abattoirs on the meat plants themselves. Therefore the independence of meat inspectors would be compromised, as those paying their wages would then be the companies they are in charge of inspecting.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumer protection should be our Number One priority and no consumer should be put at risk of consuming unsafe meat. Just last week we saw the issue of chicken on sale which, according to the Consumers' Association, had incorrect sell-by dates on the packets. On top of this we have the backdrop of BSE, the tragedy of foot-and-mouth, and E.coli scares. In fact, the situation that happened many years ago to which Mr Bowe referred involved the butchers my family used in Wishaw in Scotland. There has never been such a need to reassure consumers that the meat they are consuming is safe to eat. It is in the interest of the consumer, but it should also be in the interest of the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">When visiting a meat plant some months ago I was reassured that the quality of meat was of the highest standard and that the meat inspectors played an important role in securing quality and safety. We should not put at risk the independence of the meat inspectorate. There are 1200 independent meat inspectors in the United Kingdom and I hope they will be able to continue the work that reassures us as consumers that the meat we eat is safe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support him in his urge that we should limit the degree to which the annexes here can be altered by comitology. The devil is in the details. We do not want the disease to be in the details as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We have cause for concern in all circumstances where food of animal origin is being packaged and identified. The Commissioner knows from my own correspondence with him of the difficulties we have had in the East Midlands with the Denby scandal and others where meat was wrongly identified and sold when it should not have been. The extension of inspection by ancillary staff in the case of red meat causes us special concern. We do not want to see this extended to fattening pigs and calves.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner said that this is perfectly safe and it has worked very well with white meat. I am not so sure it has, and if he sees the Consumers' Association survey of the conditions in which chicken is being packaged and sold, he will see that there is room for doubt and concern even here. It is not a reflection on the hard work and dedication of the staff who are employed in slaughterhouses. It is only to establish that they are not put under intolerable pressure and that every possible safety means is employed. I personally salute Unison, the trade union, for campaigning on this issue. On this and this alone I believe that we have reason to go beyond the common position for safety's sake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course I accept that controls are put in place from farm to plate, but surely it makes sense to retain those parts of the chain which are successful, and to add in controls in areas where improvement is seen to be required. For that reason I will be opposing the parts of this package which would dismantle or privatise the independent meat inspection service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
