<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">David Martin, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, the EU has historically given one-sided preferences to our ACP partners. That was challenged in the WTO and we had a WTO waiver until 2007 which allowed us to continue to give those one-sided preferences. That should have expired if all EPAs (Economic Partnership Agreements) had been signed, but they had not so we had then to pass the Market Access Regulation 1528/2007 to provide a bridging solution and this has since allowed duty-free and quota-free access for the 36 ACP countries that have initialled EPAs but not yet signed or ratified them.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission now believes that this temporary solution should come to an end and their proposal is to remove this preferential access on 1 January 2014. In my view, Mr President, the Commission is half correct. It is true that the regulation was a temporary solution and it is therefore reasonable that an end date should be set. It is also fair to the other developing countries outside the ACP who see countries at a similar economic level to them getting benefits that they are denied.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that we have to see this proposal in the context of the current climate of economic partnership agreement negotiations. We must not create the perception, fair or otherwise, that we are bullying African countries into signing and ratifying EPAs without giving them enough time for careful consideration. That is why the Trade Committee has put forward the deadline of 1 January 2016 which gives due notice to the ACP countries that their preferences must come to an end but also, in my view, gives a realistic timescale to complete negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Now some colleagues have said to me in the course of the debate that this is yet another extension of the deadline. Colleagues, it is not, because we have never had a deadline until now, so this is the first proposal for a deadline and if passed it is important to understand that it will be set in stone, because no change to this deadline could take place without a further Commission proposal and without the agreement of both Parliament and Council; and I suggest that it is unlikely that the Commission would bring forward another proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the 2014 deadline would give momentum to the EPA negotiations. I have to say, having spoken to colleagues in many of the countries that are affected, I believe the opposite to be the truth. Most of them regard 2014 as an unreasonable target. If we were to vote for 2014 we are, in my opinion, excluding 17 countries from the scheme. They would simply not be able to meet that 2014 deadline, whereas 2016 sets a firm but achievable target.</p>
<p class="contents">So for organisational reasons, for political reasons and for reasons of economics, I think 2016 is a workable and achievable deadline, and I hope even at this stage we can persuade the Commission that this is a good target to set. They get their objective of a firm end date to the preferences but we also give our partners a reasonable negotiating timetable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What you are not being told is the following. Up until the end of the 1990s, the EU was granting African, Caribbean and Pacific countries special unilateral tariff preferences that were more generous than the Generalised System of Preferences. Other trade partners attacked us over this in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">Under WTO rules, special preferences cannot discriminate between countries in a similar economic situation except by waiver, which we were granted for the last time between 2000 and 2007. In the mean time we were expected to bring our trade relationship into line with WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2000 the EU and ACP countries signed the Cotonou Agreement wherein they agreed without coercion to modernise their trade and aid relations. Let us not forget that until then, even these very generous preferences were not enough to improve ACP exports to Europe. Indeed, between 1967 and 1999 the ACP’s share in total EU imports fell from 7.7 % to 2.8 %, so we agreed in Cotonou – specifically in Article 16 of the Treaty – to conclude new bilateral trade agreements that would be WTO-compatible.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a proposal that made economic sense because of the poor experience with unilateral tariff preferences. But it was also one that matched the political moods at the time. The international community at large had finally understood that development policies which do not sustain good governance are simply not sustainable. EU trade policy had to reflect this too. I have said this before and I will say it again: the political value of bilateral trade agreements is that they create flanking policies and institutions to manage the implementation of commercial commitments. Besides stimulating the two-way flow of trade, lowering customs tariffs reduces the potential for poor governance, in particular corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me try once again to explain what this regulation is about. In 2007, by the time we had conducted and concluded EPA negotiations with about half of the ACP countries, the EU, acting in good faith, passed the Market Access Regulation to allow our EPA partners continued market access to the EU on a duty-free, quota-free basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We did so on the understanding that our EPA partners would formalise their commitment to these agreements within a year or two by signing and ratifying them. Most EPA partners proved us right and did take the necessary steps. Eighteen had not until last year. But a few months later Zimbabwe ratified its interim EPA. Nine of the countries left are least developed countries and will continue to enjoy duty-free, quota-free status because they continue to be eligible for ‘everything but arms’ benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">That leaves us with only eight countries actually affected by the proposal we are discussing today. To be even clearer, we are talking about Botswana, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Fiji, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia and Swaziland, which makes me wonder why these particular eight countries need more time to adjust to a situation that was already required 12 years ago, when 87 countries and territories are adjusting to our 2011 GSP proposal in less than three years.</p>
<p class="contents">The broader picture on EPAs is really something to be proud of. We are continuing negotiations for comprehensive EPAs with practically all the EPA regions and I have a small set of outstanding issues left with the East African Community, with Western Africa and with EPA partners in the Southern Africa Development Community, the SADC. Furthermore we are implementing agreements concluded back in 2007 with the Caribbean, Papua New Guinea and four Eastern and Southern African countries. Some of them are also continuing negotiations to get to comprehensive regional agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">What this agreement is about is the past: EPAs initialled by the end of 2007. So it is not about negotiations on comprehensive EPAs, the argument invoked by some to justify an extended deadline. This is an agreement about doing away with the past, it is not about the future.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is such heavy resistance today from those who would prefer to extend the status quo, I cannot help but ask a question. Are we not letting down a promising entrepreneurial class in eight ACP countries if the 2014 deadline is extended? Why should a Kenyan, an Ivorian or a Namibian business person who has an innovative idea, finds a niche market and wishes to develop a product with the assistance of good European machinery, continue to have to pay very heavy import duties for the next two, four or even seven years? How can that business idea grow if inputs are expensive? How many new jobs could be created if tariff barriers were removed? Why do we continue to see Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific as not being capable of exporting much more than basic agricultural commodities? That is so far from present-day realities and needs. Sometimes wanting to do good is actually the enemy of the good.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, as Trade Commissioner-designate, I took a pledge before this Parliament in February 2010 to uphold and further strengthen the multilateral trading system. At the time I also understand my ambition is to bring EPA negotiations to a successful conclusion provided the results are WTO-compatible and can foster development.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Commissioner I am also bound by EU law. For these reasons, as well as my conviction that free trade deals serve poor countries better, I continue to support the Commission proposal to amend the Market Access Regulation with legal effect on 1 January 2014 and I very much hope that this wisdom will also convince Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is because our old trade agreement with the ACP countries, that is to say the countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, was declared illegal. It discriminated against other poor countries. We therefore decided to opt for the approach we are now taking of negotiating economic partnership agreements with the ACP countries. It has taken a long time – an unacceptably long time. It is in all of our interests for these agreements to be in place as soon as possible, as it is only once we have these agreements that we will be able to achieve any real development in poor countries, along with investments and better governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The only reason we have had these temporary trade preferences is to bridge the gap between our old, illegal agreements and these new economic partnership agreements. They were just temporary, however.</p>
<p class="contents">The entire debate here today is actually about how long we mean by ‘temporary’. Those on the left in this House say that temporary means forever, or at least until 2019. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament say that temporary is probably up to 2016. I get the feeling that temporary means anytime except right now. It has now been more than 12 years, however – and that is more than just temporary. Why is that? It is because the temporary customs facilities are essentially unfair – they are unfair to other poor countries that do not belong to Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. They are unfair in particular to those ACP countries that respected the fact that they were temporary and negotiated and entered into partnership agreements with us. We therefore have a responsibility to set an ultimate limit for this temporary scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us continue to be honest and admit that we will never have any economic partnership agreements if we say that the temporary scheme is to last forever. What should we say to the other poor countries, to those countries that at one time accused us of not caring about fairness or about World Trade Organisation regulations? Therefore, we must support this proposal and bring this temporary scheme to an end. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) therefore believe that the Commission’s proposal should be approved.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it would be good if we could try to agree to conduct a first reading of this in order to get the rules in place as soon as possible. I therefore think the best thing to do would be to vote on all of the amendments and then postpone the final vote so that we can initiate negotiations with the Council. After all, it is only a date that separates us, a date that is very significant, but it is something on which I believe we could reach an agreement. I would therefore call on both the President and the rapporteur to consider whether we should initiate negotiations with the Council and try to achieve a first reading agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have the European Union on one side with a strong Commissioner and a large team of officials, sitting across the negotiating table from young countries with little capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">To this extent it is more than right and proper to allow these countries more time and opportunity for negotiations. We should not give the impression that we are putting pressure on these countries by abruptly ending market access opportunities.

We believe a very reasonable balance has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">On one hand, we have a firm date, a deadline. I would ask you all to consider how absurd it would be to reject the committee’s proposal while we have obligations in the World Trade Organisation that we have to fulfil. On the other hand, we are allowing a couple of years more, thereby at least partly meeting the demands of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this debate needs to be kept in proportion. After all, as the Commissioner pointed out in his speech as well, we are talking about an extremely limited volume of trade, although the decision we make tomorrow will be very important to some ACP capitals. There is a kind of asymmetry between the significance that we attach to what is at stake and how certain ACP countries perceive it.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that setting such a tight deadline – which might almost seem like an imposition, at least in the eyes of some ACP countries – is an effective way of bringing the negotiations on economic partnership agreements to a swifter conclusion. We do want these agreements. However, these partnership agreements need to be concluded in the best possible way, through persuasion and trying to win the other side round.</p>
<p class="contents">These two extra years, if they are indeed both necessary, could be an opportunity for us to step up our negotiating efforts, not least by expanding the range of people we talk to in addition to just the governments. The general public in these countries remains somewhat wary, so we must also focus on the members of the national parliaments, who often do not ratify agreements but do carry political weight and influence in the debate in their countries and complain that they are not given enough information.</p>
<p class="contents">As I proposed during our ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Horsens, it may perhaps be necessary to organise public seminars with the media and non-governmental organisations to explain our position properly.

This runs completely contrary to the EU’s objective of reducing poverty and organising all external political instruments in line with this principle. Countries like Cameroon, Ivory Cost and Namibia would be very hard hit by this restriction. Regional integration projects, such as those in South East Africa, would collapse if Kenya were to consent to such an agreement. South-south cooperation would be at an end. We cannot broadcast the message of free trade to the world with the simple intention that other countries should please buy our products.

While our partners are still engaged in negotiations with the Commission, you are looking to put a gun to their heads, forcing them to capitulate under the threat of exclusion from the European market. Your approach has completely discredited the European Union as a partner in negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Ambassadors from all the relevant countries have vividly described to me what is at stake for them and their population. The Committee on Development, armed with excellent and reliable barometers of mood in the African partner states, has recognised this and has therefore completely rejected the Commission’s proposal in the statement from my colleague and group chair Gabi Zimmer. My group is strongly supportive of this position, even in view of the trade-related aspects. I would call on all Members of this House, including my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade, to take this development policy perspective to heart and not to risk decades of close cooperation because of a short-sighted unilateral decision by the Commissioner for Trade. We will have a roll-call vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner De Gucht, your regulation would be devastating for the East African community. You risk isolating Kenya from the other Member States or causing this association of states to wave goodbye to Europe as its most important partner. A number of trading nations around the world would be happy at this development. You have made an unjust accusation against the Africans. You are seeking to punish a delay for which you yourself are responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, for example, is the Commission insisting on abolishing export taxes? Namibia only levies such taxes on raw materials exports. If primary processing takes place in Namibia itself, no taxes are payable. I see this as smart and legitimate economic policy, pointing the way for an industrial policy that is completely in line with the objectives of EU development policy.

The main question is: should the EU withdraw unilateral trade preferences, which the African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries temporarily enjoy, from those countries in the group that do not negotiate and ratify economic partnership agreements with the European Union in accordance with the Cotonou Agreement? The follow-up question is: how long should we give the countries concerned to negotiate and conclude the agreements in question since, unfortunately, the 2007 regulation contained no deadline?</p>
<p class="contents">The answer to the first question can only be a definite yes. Firstly, the 2007 regulation was clearly temporary; secondly, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) waiver expired in 2007, and therefore the trade preferences in question are illegal and violate the EU’s obligations to the WTO; thirdly, maintaining these unilateral trade preferences would be unfair, both to non-ACP least developed countries, which do not enjoy the same preferential treatment, and to those ACP countries that have concluded economic partnership agreements with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the time period, the Committee on International Trade was not convinced by the Commission and decided to extend the deadline proposed by the Commission by two years, from 1 January 2014 to 1 January 2016. In principle it is a more balanced and reasonable solution. In contrast, proposals to extend this period even further no longer deserve support, as they prolong the current illegal and unfair situation excessively. In brief, this Parliament should fully approve Mr Martin’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is called blackmail. According to the NGO Comhlamh the loss of DFQF market access could effectively close the European market for some sectors and will be disastrous for the economies of the countries concerned. For Namibia, for example, the duties levied on beef exports alone would amount to almost EUR 60 million, around 30 % of their exports.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the position of the rapporteur when he suggests that the main reason behind the Commission’s proposal is to increase pressure on these states to sign up to economic partnership agreements. Opposition to EPAs is growing in the region among trade unions, civil society organisations and now the Commission has responded by attempting to bully these countries into responding to these agreements which are not in the interests of working people and small farmers in their country. But that is why I do not share the rapporteur’s opinion that we should simply give them more time. The Commission’s proposal must be rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EPA must effectively address some of the most fundamental challenges many ACP countries are facing, for example regional integration, and Europe is well placed to know that that integration takes time.</p>
<p class="contents">As Chair of the Delegation for relations with South Africa, I am particularly concerned that a satisfactory agreement for all is found on the SADC EPA.

<p class="contents">I therefore fully support David Martin’s recommendation for a 2016 deadline as I believe this is a fair compromise for all parties, especially in this year which will be a litmus test for relations between the EU and its African and Pacific partners as we are also reviewing the Cotonou Agreement, the European Development Fund and the Development Cooperation Instrument.

My feeling is that this has indeed been the case with this issue. On the one hand, it is not hard to see that only 18 of the 36 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries which have embarked on or signed an EPA have ratified it. The remainder are therefore encouraged to conclude and implement an agreement quickly, if they do not want to see their negotiation efforts ruined by, for example, the deadline of 2014. On the other hand, we have all known, since 2007, that this regulation was merely temporary, being incompatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, I could give you one minute of my speaking time, for example, provided of course that you are not going to interrupt me afterwards!</p>
<p class="contents">I understand a number of the remarks that have been made but I would urge you to stay with the facts as they are. What this is really about is that a number of countries have not yet signed and/or ratified an agreement they concluded in 2007. That is the reality.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is about the past. The idea that we want to force them to conclude and ratify a definite and final economic partnership agreement is not correct. I have mentioned the eight countries – a limited number of countries – that could be affected in one way or another by what we are proposing. I will read them out again: Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Fiji, Ghana, Kenya and Swaziland – which are lower middle-income countries – and Botswana and Namibia, which are higher middle-income countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not, in any way you could imagine, affect a developing country. In the developing countries you have two separate categories: the least developed countries (LDCs) who benefit from Everything But Arms – and that continues – and the other ones that benefit from the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) or the GSP+. So it is not about those countries. What it is really about is countries – albeit a limited number of countries, but in a much bigger category if you look at it worldwide – where, if we do not put an end to the market access regulation in the form it exists, which is always considered to be temporary, unilateral access to the European markets would be created, with those countries exporting duty-free and quota-free products other than arms. That is what you would create.</p>
<p class="contents">So in fact you would create inequality between the eight that I have mentioned and – I do not know how many but I would estimate – 50 or 60 worldwide that are in a different position.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, are we forcing anybody to do this? No. We are not. If they do not want to ratify the agreement that they themselves concluded in 2007, then they do not do have to do so. Even then, our door is open to negotiating a new agreement with them. But I cannot see how we would be unfair or bullying or blackmailing (and a lot of similar words have been used here) in asking somebody who concluded an agreement in 2007 – that means five years ago, with a further three or four years of negotiations, and especially given that they should have adapted their system already – to now ratify what they signed, initialled and promised to ratify. Do it!</p>
<p class="contents">They have already had five to seven years, depending on the starting point, and we are giving them an additional year-and-a-half just to ratify, not to negotiate a new agreement but to ratify. Is this unfair? Is this blackmailing? Is this jeopardising our position with respect to Africa? Really, I do not believe so.</p>
<p class="contents">Bernd Lange spoke of a confrontation between a strong Commission and weak states. That is what I heard you say. First of all, thank you for calling us strong: that is not bad. Some of these states are weak but I did not mention the weakest, the ones that are in debt, the LDCs and the developing countries. We are talking here about lower and middle income countries. That is what we are talking about. The question is not whether they are weak or strong. The only thing we ask of them is to ratify what they negotiated and concluded in the past. We are not bullying them about anything other than living up to the commitments that they made quite some time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a remark to Mr Keller, who said the policy would be contrary to my statement, which is also in the communication, that trade can promote development. That is not true because you can currently see, with the existing schemes, that the trade volume is going down drastically. Why so? Because trade is about more than just exporting something to another market. It is a means engaging with that market and having trade movements in both directions. It is about aid for trade and about establishing a vibrant marketplace that can export products to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would warmly welcome their doing that to a much greater extent than they have done in the past. Personally I am very sad about the fact that the trade volume with Africa is going down. It should be going up. I am ready to be very flexible in the economic partnership agreements (EPAs) that we still have to negotiate with a number of regional entities. I have no problem at all with asymmetry. I hope the countries concerned can export much more to the European Union. We are ready to help them with aid for trade. We are ready to help them with trade facilitation – my colleague, Andris Piebalgs is in complete agreement with me about that – but they should live up to their commitments so that we can proceed and establish a sure legal system, legal obligations and legal rights in a negotiated framework. That is what we are asking for and that is also why I stand by the proposal that we have made.</p>
<p class="contents">I really hope that tomorrow when you vote you take this into account. This proposal is not against developing countries and it is not against Africa. On the contrary, it is for the good of having mature trade relations with countries that should develop and should take off. Most of the countries that have not yet taken off are in Sub-Saharan Africa, and that is no accident. We should do something about this. It is our moral duty to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Take Kenya: if it was looking after its own economic interests, Kenya would ratify an EPA, but if Kenya ratified an EPA unilaterally it would break its relationship with the East Africans. And we put them in this position where either they break the relationship with East Africa or they suffer economic costs. Their cut flower industry is vital to them; that industry will face massive tariffs if they do not sign up for an EPA and we pass this regulation. At the same time this Commission and probably this Parliament are going to pass the Colombia Free Trade Agreement which is going to give trade preferences on cut flowers to their biggest rival, Colombia. So it is a double whammy against Kenya. We are not asking them to give them protection in perpetuity but we are at least saying give them two or three years in order to find a solution that encompasses both their objective of signing an EPA and staying within their East African regional partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">I have not got time to go into the others but South Africa is the same; Botswana and Namibia have the same pressure in terms of their relationship with South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, my view is simple. You want 2014 because you think this gives momentum to the negotiations. I do not want 2014 because I think it does exactly the opposite. Firstly it will sour the mood in terms of our relationship with the ACP countries and secondly I think it is an impossible deadline to meet.</p>
<p class="contents">So all we are saying as a House to you is, let us not rush this, let us set a deadline. And I will repeat what I said at the beginning: that deadline would be set in concrete. It is not a flexible deadline; it is not one that is moveable once we pass the legislation. 2016 is not unreasonable; it gives African countries time to come into line and at the same time makes us, I hope, look a bit more reasonable and a bit less impatient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
