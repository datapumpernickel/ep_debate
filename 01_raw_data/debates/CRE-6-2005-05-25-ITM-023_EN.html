<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ieke van den Burg (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the author</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, I will avoid making this a purely Dutch discussion, and speak in English so that others can participate directly in this interesting debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The possibility of a takeover of the London Stock Exchange by Deutsche Börse or Euronext has ignited debates in the European Parliament over whether such a takeover can be assessed at national level alone. At present, the two cases are being dealt with by the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission in the UK. Legally speaking, the takeover of the LSE may be the responsibility of the relevant Member State’s competition authorities, since European competition rules do not apply as long as the national regulators deem the relevant markets to be their respective Member States and the turnover level to be below the thresholds set for European competition rules to apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has tabled this oral question to the Commission to ask it to play a more proactive role. We would like the Commission to consider the different scenarios that might arise and assess the effects that they might bring to competition in, and the pricing of, listing services, trading services, information services and, not least, important post<span class="bold">– </span>trade services, clearing and settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of the detailed studies undertaken by the Competition Commission in the UK, prepared by the British Office of Fair Trading. The standpoint of that assessment is, however, primarily or maybe even exclusively the impact for the UK markets, and we would like to see that broadened in the Commission’s assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">You may remember the shock caused in 2002<span class="bold">–</span>2003 when some traders in Dutch blue<span class="bold">– </span>chip equities challenged Euronext Amsterdam to lower prices and to providing improvements in services, by looking for an alternative trading venue with Deutsche Börse and the LSE. This showed that competition really makes a difference. This characterises the situation we have at present of an open integrated European market with crossborder competition. The question is whether different scenarios increase this competitive tendency, or go in the opposite direction and tend to create monopolies <span class="bold">– </span>situations for which, by the way, <span class="italic">ex ante</span> competition regulation might be a more appropriate answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Another related issue is the aspect of regulation and supervision. From the moment the possible take<span class="bold">–</span>over of the LSE appeared on the pages of the financial papers, speculation started as to where the headquarters of the merged entity would be based and which regulator would get the power to supervise it. That was more than speculation. I tend to believe there was truth in the stories that the issue of the regulatory regime was a major subject in the merger talks. Who knows, it might even have been part of the background of the rebellion against the Deutsche Börse leadership, which you in Germany have such nice nicknames for.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur of subsequent reports on prudential supervision and the FSAP, I would not dare to express my preferences for one or other national regulatory regimes. My far greater concern is that there will be counterproductive competition between national regimes, instead of further coordination and cooperation. That is one of my strongest arguments for a European level supervisor. In the reports I prepared in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and which were adopted in the previous plenary sitting, this is again stressed as an option for the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a European level supervisor should execute the application of the European regulatory framework of the FSAP developed in previous years. As regards the part of the financial market which is already supranational and operates crossborder and often cross<span class="bold">–</span>sector, one of our main messages is to create real convergence in the implementation of the European directives and real convergence of supervisory practice, thereby avoiding regulatory arbitrage and possible competition on other factors for establishment such as fiscal and cost aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the possible effects of the Commission’s ambitions as regards integration of the financial markets and the regulation and supervision of different scenarios should also be part of the assessment we are asking for. In that context I would ask you to focus your attention on scenarios in which merger activity is not restricted to EU countries alone. There may also be conceivable scenarios in which the New York stock exchange and a newly formed one joint with the LSE or, on the other hand Euronext and Deutsche Börse might get together. There might then be a disintegration rather than a further convergence of European regulations. This should also be taken into account in your assessment and expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that this debate is being held at such a late hour, but I thank the Commissioners for being here and wish Mr McCreevy, who was supposed to be here, all the best with his health. I also hope, of course, that we can continue the debate in the committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Neelie Kroes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, the Commission thanks the honourable Member for her question. I am really pleased, even if it is late, that we can talk about this very important item.</p>
<p class="contents">I should have started with the apologies of my colleague, Commissioner McCreevy. He was very sorry that he was unable to here, but you can be assured that his thoughts are with us in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the ongoing projects and discussions in this area and is monitoring all the developments. National and also, as Mrs van den Burg has already mentioned, pan<span class="bold">–</span>European consolidation and restructuring in this sector is market led.</p>
<p class="contents">A merger of two or three EU stock exchanges would necessarily have an important impact on the structure of the market for EU equities trading and post<span class="bold">–</span>trading. The Commission intends to maintain its leadership role in driving towards an integrated EU financial services market. The Commission also favours the combined intervention of market forces and public authorities to ensure fair competition between all forms of securities trading venue, including exchanges in regulated markets, as well as newer trading devices, such as multilateral trading facilities and the internationalisation of orders in investment firms.</p>
<p class="contents">Mergers in this sector are subject to normal regulatory and competition authority oversight. Concerning the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004, the merger regulation, as well as the competition rules more generally, the Commission would like to recall that these rules apply to all industry sectors equally.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the current provisions of the merger regulation allow for efficient and appropriate assessment procedures. We are confident in the capacity of the national competition authorities to carry out the assessments. Commission services are in contact with the competition authorities concerned and have met with a number of interested parties, including the potential bidders. Usually, the more you can decentralise, the better it is, because those national competition authorities are very able to do their jobs. Therefore, I am usually in favour of the national competition authorities doing their jobs. There is a lot of contact and discussion within the network, so it is not a matter of them being on their own, but of doing it together.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member was concerned that a merger could lead to upwards pressure on trading prices. This is certainly being examined. One of the central issues in the investigations being conducted by the competition authorities is to ensure that a merged entity includes mechanisms to ensure that competition rules are respected, also for the medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">Also noteworthy is the increased competition that is likely to come from the MiFID, from internationalisation and multilateral trading facilities in particular and the fact that capital markets are increasingly global. We should not forget the potential of mergers to lead to increased innovation in terms of the products and services that are offered to investors. The Commission cannot take a position on an individual corporate decision made by the New York Stock Exchange and its future strategies. Mrs van den Burg touched upon that issue. In case of any prospective future merger, normal provisions would apply and, to the extent that there may be any regulatory concerns, this should be for the SEC to deal with. In this respect, the Commission notes that <span class="italic">many</span> of the important exchanges in Europe, including all the parties involved in the LSE merger discussions, are already listed as regulated markets in the EU. In Europe we have found ways of ensuring that regulatory functions are kept at a sufficient remove from the commercial interests of exchange, and there is no reason to suspect that this will not be the case in other developed markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs van den Burg for mentioning this issue. As the honourable Member is aware, the Office of Fair Trading has referred the cases to the Competition Commission, and this is the equivalent of what we would call a phase 2 investigation at European level. The national competition authorities are clearly taking this issue most seriously and the Commission is confident that they are examining all aspects which could potentially impact on competition. This is illustrated – to answer the point Mrs van den Burg has touched upon – by the questions raised in their issues paper.</p>
<p class="contents">That would, of course, cover post<span class="bold">–</span>trading activities, as explicitly mentioned in the FTA’s decision in the cases referred to the Competition Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just one more point to make. You mentioned the Dutch situation concerning blue<span class="bold">– </span>chip equities, which is something of which we are both aware. In my opinion it did not work; it was not successful. However, it was possible that it could have worked; there was potential. There is competition. It depends on what the market is doing. We always keep an eye on situations like that. Such things can sometimes be successful or sometimes fail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
