<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes Mira,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the Commission has today adopted a communication on the rationalisation of the coordination of economic and employment policies. This coordination, at Union level, creates a framework within which the Member States define their own policies. It also contributes to progress on the ambitious Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the general coordination framework has become an increasingly more complex framework. Too often new elements have been added as they became necessary and this situation has helped neither the coherence of the guidelines for the different policies nor the understanding of them. You, as Parliament, have presented us with various proposals to improve the situation and, while working on the basis of existing legislation, we have tried to take them into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Rationalising coordination is not restricted simply to improving timetables and organisation, as it may seem at first sight. We have tried to fundamentally change the coherence of policies and the evaluation of their implementation, thereby contributing to progress in the increase in growth potential, the creation of more and better jobs, an improvement in social cohesion and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">With all of this in mind, the Commission makes concrete proposals in its communication to increase efficiency and coordination, to improve coherence and complementarity amongst the different processes and instruments, to stimulate our commitments and our ‘ownership’ in relation to a greater involvement by Parliament and social partners, and increase the transparency and understanding of policy coordination and therefore its visibility and effects. These important political improvements will increase the Union’s capacity to achieve its ambitious economic and employment objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention two key points: firstly, the Commission proposes a better structure for the cycle of policy coordination based on three points: execution, political orientations and guidelines. These will be the key points which will make the coordination cycle more transparent and improve its effects.</p>
<p class="contents">The cycle will begin with the preparation of the spring European Council. At the beginning of each year the Commission will present a package on the evaluation of implementation which will accompany the spring report and that package will present both the development of progress in the various areas involving the implementation of the broad guidelines of economic policy and the draft joint report on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The spring report will therefore focus on the points on which progress must be speeded up and will propose key political guidelines for the spring European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, in the middle of March the spring European Council will produce some general political guidelines and at the beginning of April the Commission, with these guidelines in mind, will present its guidelines which will include both the broad guidelines of economic policy and the employment guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the competent departments of the Commission will adopt this raft of guidelines once they have obtained the support of the European Council in June.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key point of the proposals presented today by the Commission is improving the efficiency of coordination. In this respect, we suggest that we focus more on the medium term when it comes to drawing up guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The raft of guidelines will adopt a more differentiated medium-term perspective and will be reviewed in their entirety just once every three years. In the intervening years the changes will be restricted to those necessary to take account of the most significant events during that period. The more strategic approach will give stability to the guidelines on the different policies and allow them to be better monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, coherence will be improved by greater clarity in the contents of the respective instruments and their synchronisation. This better complementarity will strengthen the basic political messages.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission suggests that this rationalisation be implemented quickly and the first raft of new guidelines should be updated at the spring European Council of 2003, with the Commission presenting its first implementation assessment package at the beginning of 2004. Consequently, the new cycle will be completely under way before the elections to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these improvements which will begin to operate by the 2003 cycle, the Commission has proposed a series of amendments relating to the law currently in force in the Treaties, aimed at the coordination of economic policies. I am not going to get into this issue today; I simply wish to point out, as I said at the beginning of my speech, that these issues are linked to the process of streamlining we are discussing today, since, as I said, we are working on the basis of existing legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by stressing that the Commission appreciates Parliament’s contribution of policy coordination and we eagerly await your suggestions on the guidelines we are going to propose and on this rationalisation process. Your contributions and participation are a sign of your commitment to the common guidelines for the different policies and to an improvement in economic and social results.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague Anna Diamantopoulou will comment on certain further elements relating to this coordination process which we have both presented jointly today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during last year's debate on the employment package, Parliament made a clear demand for procedures to be streamlined. The Barcelona Council tabled the same demand. So, it seems to me that this communication responds to the demands of both Parliament and the Council for more up-to-date procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Solbes Mira quite rightly said, this is not simply a technical arrangement. It is not simply better timing. There really is an ambitious political objective in terms of better defined policies, better governance and greater efficiency. We are forging ahead with modernisation, with this new common procedure, we are applying our experience from ten years of economic guidelines since Maastricht, five years of the Employment Strategy in action and, of course, the whole Lisbon framework, and that is important.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a few comments on the European Employment Strategy in particular. First, both strategies will clearly be strengthened and will have a higher profile within the Lisbon framework. Secondly, we now have a medium-term time frame and that is important. Rather than annual guidelines or annual recommendations, we have a medium-term time frame. We aim to issue new guidelines up to 2010, with a mid-term review in 2006, as requested in Barcelona. So there will be a mid-term review, when we set objectives and guidelines, together with annual controls and annual cooperation in monitoring policies and it is this that will maintain the momentum of the strategy. The third point is that this exercise has a clear objective: to achieve greater cohesion between the two policies. Obviously there is a division of roles between the two policies. The economic guidelines provide the general framework, the framework within which the employment guidelines move, but it is the employment guidelines that define the more detailed framework and objectives and propose individual strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">My next point concerns better governance of economic and social policies, which is also one of the items on the agenda of the Convention set up to revise the Treaty. What we want to show is that, while we respect the autonomy of each policy as defined in the Treaty, we also have the facility to set a single economic framework for the Union. I think that, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, things will be much clearer and much more transparent because both dossiers will take account of all the basic aspects of economic and structural policy in practice, at a given time and in a coordinated manner. I should also like to assure you that our efficient consultations with Parliament will continue; they have merely been moved from the autumn to the spring. Our aim is to ensure that, with this new framework, we can cooperate efficiently with Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do, however, remain concerned about two points. The Lisbon Summit foresaw a key coordinating role for the European Council itself. Although it remained unspoken, one of the main reasons for that was to avoid the whole procedure being dominated by Ecofin. In the procedure in this communication there is a fundamental breakdown, following the June Council. We then have the separate competitiveness, employment and Ecofin Councils making the final decisions in their respective areas. It is at that point that Ecofin will become dominant and will hamstring the other two Councils. That is a fundamental flaw in the whole procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">My second concern is that the first and last mention of Parliament is in May, in relation to the employment guidelines. If the Commission as an institution is serious about the involvement of Parliament, it should be joining with us in calling for an interinstitutional agreement to give Parliament a formal say in the preparations for the spring Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was brief, as it presumably needs to be in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">I should nonetheless like to address two more matters. First of all, it would be interesting to know more about the way in which the European Parliament and the national parliaments are to be able to arrive at a joint position. Mr Hughes has already addressed this matter, but it is important for it to be clarified. The point might be made that it is at present quite unclear how the European Parliament and the national parliaments are to participate in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">The second matter I want to mention is the processes. I support the idea of these processes needing to be coordinated. Two processes are discussed, but I believe that three processes need to be talked about, namely the economic process, the employment process and the process of social inclusion. All three have their particular value and something special to contribute. It is therefore extremely important for these distinctive features to be retained when the processes are coordinated. Otherwise, there will be a decline in their overall value. I wonder therefore what thought has been given to the way in which, when the processes are coordinated, it might be possible to retain the special character of each particular one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On a number of occasions – most recently during the informal Council of Ministers in Kolding – we have, on behalf of Parliament and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, made the point that we would welcome coordination of the employment and social policy cycles. We want this to happen for a reason: because it is very clearly stated in the Treaty that employment policy guidelines must to some extent be aligned with economic guidelines. I hope that we will see interaction between these two elements. That we do not focus exclusively on employment. That we do not concern ourselves merely with the quantity of jobs, but also with their quality. That we do not think just about jobs and phrases like labour market flexibility, but that we also give some thought to security on the labour market and the social implications of this. In other words, all the elements that could contribute to interaction, and my question is whether that is the intention of this entire policy mix event. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, is there a split in relation to Lisbon and is there a lack of coordination in terms of the decision making at the spring Council? I believe that there is not; I believe that the situation is precisely the opposite. In fact, we will go to the spring Council with a position on guidelines for the different processes. The Lisbon Council will take this decision – which of course must be consistent in all the guidelines – and subsequent Councils will then have to work on that basis. Therefore, what we are achieving is the opposite: that the various Councils work in a direction which has already been previously defined. Not only are we acting coherently with Lisbon, but I believe we are going further than what had initially been foreseen.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, something which concerns many of you: what is the role of Parliaments – European and national – in the process? From the point of view of the broad guidelines for economic policy, we are working with existing laws, as I said before. We are not therefore talking about a modification of the Treaties or other aspects which can be raised in the Convention. Nevertheless, we believe that the new procedure allows Parliament to take two types of action. Firstly, the debate on the report on implementation of the broad guidelines for economic policy. Parliament will have much more time than it did previously to hold that debate, and will also have more opportunity to take its own positions on the broad guidelines of economic policy, as we have been introducing into practice over recent years. In this respect, we believe that the situation is clearly improving.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of national parliaments must be decided by each Member State, although the Commission advocates the idea that, both in the broad guidelines for economic policy, and in issues relating to the stability programmes, the national Parliaments should be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is true that there is basic coordination between the broad guidelines of economic policy and employment, but also with the Cardiff Process and the other processes which can affect economic policy. These are the essential issues I wanted to comment on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Τhe first concerns distinct policies and whether we can achieve them. Without doubt, this proposal sets specific objectives, together with procedures and dates for achieving them. One clear objective, as I said, is that these two policies should be independent. So that we have clear, specific guidelines on employment, within the framework of the general guidelines, with objectives and procedures attached to them. I do not know if anyone can say for sure that we shall achieve this objective. But one thing is clear and that is that the political will is there and that the procedures are being designed so that we can move in this direction. I think that we now all have a political responsibility to achieve this both for political reasons and because we need distinct employment policies in the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question concerns Mr Bouwman's position on employment, which of course means more than just job numbers. Within the framework of the guidelines and in Parliament we have said time and again that we need to include directions and guidelines on the quality of employment and this is what we are working towards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot ask for better coordination of the Member States’ economic policies without also calling for an improvement in the coordination process for economic, social and sustainable development policies at European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that all processes relating to the BGEP, namely the Luxembourg, Cardiff, Cologne, Lisbon and Stockholm processes, and any others, for that matter, need to be rationalised. The experts are beginning to lose the thread, and the citizens are completely lost. Rationalisation is therefore required, provided, of course, that the European Parliament and the national parliaments are involved in the said processes. If I have understood Mr Solbes correctly, in future we will have coordination for the medium term, with a complete review every three years. Three years is a long time, however, for a Parliament with a five-year mandate and a Commission that also has a life expectancy of five years. Some legislatures would, therefore, only hold one major debate on the broad guidelines. In addition to this, three years is a very long time in economic terms. Three years ago, Mr President, the world stock markets were all bullish. Two years ago, however, the bubble burst, causing substantial collateral damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, and this is my question, can you envisage not adapting the guidelines to the development of the economy and of life in society? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In his introduction Commissioner Solbes talked about sustainable growth, which is not the same as sustainable development – some growth can destroy the environment and jobs and is not particularly sustainable. So where is the sustainability element going to come from? How is this going to be determined through a qualitative analysis of growth, and how is this going to fit into this coordination which we are hoping to see in future? At the moment this is a missing element and yet it is supposed to be a key element of the spring summits as decided at Göteborg? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We produce broad guidelines every three years, but this will not prevent us from having an annual modification and an annual debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give you an example: at the moment, the broad guidelines for economic policy have the essential aim of strengthening growth within a framework of economic stability in order to increase productivity and employment. This type of principle is going to be general for a long period. Clearly, the results produced each year, and the modification we will have to introduce bearing in mind what is happening in the economy, will have to be debated each year, and we will have to make annual modifications, but on the basis of a fundamental model which will be in force for three years.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Karas, I believe that either I did not express myself well or the translation has not been entirely correct. I have said twice that our intention with this Communication is to rationalise and coordinate the instruments of economic policy without changing the law. Therefore, this document contains no modification of the Treaties. We are talking about how to take better advantage of the possibilities offered by the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two comments in this respect: the European Parliament’s participation is clearly defined in the Treaty in relation to the general employment guidelines and we are implementing a system for participation by Parliament – not in a co-decision procedure since we are not talking about legislative regulations – which, since there will be more time to work on the application reports of the previous year and – Parliament’s cooperation will be necessary here – the times for decision making on the broad guidelines for economic policy will be improved, will allow Parliament to increase its participation in the process, which is what we all want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">The third element: to what extent can Lisbon be improved and applied further? I believe that that it was what we are trying to do: to achieve the best possible result from Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">A final comment in relation to sustainable development: sustainable development is included this year as an objective of the broad guidelines for economic policy, and these include certain elements relating to sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should first like to say something about continuity. I think working in the context of the longer term is fine, but adjustments must remain possible from time to time. The communication from the Commission takes account of this. I have a question on the timetable. The timetable now provides for new guidelines to cover a period of three years: 2003 to 2006. This would take us beyond the Commission's and Parliament's mandates; I had hoped that this would be more of an induction programme, linked to the political mandates of the Commission and Parliament. Can the Commissioner comment on this?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the global economic guidelines are mentioned as key implementation instruments, as they also contain the lines of force of the employment strategy. My fellow MEP Stephen Hughes has already commented on this in the context of the Ecofin Council. Employment is part of those economic guidelines, but it had already been decided that they would also contain the consensus view on matters such as coordination of pensions and healthcare. I should like to know what has happened to these topics, as I see nothing about them in the notification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course we could consider a long-term programme – five years – but, in our opinion, this period of time is excessive. If we do not talk about five years, the problems the honourable Member mentions will always exist. It is either one year or any figure greater than one year presents us with these problems. However, I believe that the concern is that two or three years raises the problem, as does four years. It is either five or one. Five is too much, one means that we have less room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event I believe that it is a false problem. Because the necessary modifications can be discussed annually and therefore this does not cause any difficulty, as I said earlier to Mr Goebbels, and if a change in circumstances or an institutional change requires the problem to be reassessed, this can clearly be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point: what happens with the Employment Ecofin and to what extent may contradictions arise? Contradictions in the process are precisely what we are trying to prevent, for a very simple reason: the process starts with the Commission, with a position which must be consistent; that position must be decided on or approved by the European Council; the Ecofin Councils and the Employment Council will have to work on the guidelines produced by the spring European Council, and it will be the June European Council that finally accepts guidelines which must be consistent amongst themselves and consistent with what the European Council itself has proposed. Therefore, this type of incoherence should not arise.</p>
<p class="contents">An issue which I believe to be totally outside today’s debate is the Stability Pact. I am not going to say too much about this. The Stability Pact is part of Community legislation. My position is very well known: I believe that the legislation has to be complied with and therefore my position is that the Stability Pact must be applied as laid down in the legislation currently in force.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean that the Commission is insensitive to the experience which the Pact has provided us with and that it has not proposed – the Commission itself – a series of interpretative elements in accordance with economic developments, including such important elements as, for example, taking account of the cyclically adjusted budgets in order to assess the reality in terms of the possibility of achieving the nominal objectives laid down in the stability programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I still believe that the Stability Pact is an excellent instrument and that we must naturally draw the best possible conclusions from the reality of the situation so that the Pact may function better, but not so that the substance of the Pact is affected.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point: the legitimacy of the process, raised by Mrs Randzio-Plath. I believe that the process has all the legitimacy available at the moment; in fact it has even more, given that not only the sectoral Councils are involved in these decisions, but also the European Council at the beginning and the end of the process and, secondly, not only is the current commitment maintained, or the current participation of the European Parliament, but the intention is to increase it.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member raises another problem: what type of modification of the Treaty can be considered in the future with a view to greater participation by the European Parliament in this process? This Communication says nothing about this issue. This is an issue under discussion in the Convention, and the eventual result will depend on the negotiation at the Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, as we have already pointed out, the whole proposal comes within the framework of the current Treaty, which does not need to be interpreted differently or more widely or changed in any way. Secondly, this proposal is just one step. We cannot update the Lisbon procedures in one fell swoop. So, to come back to what Mrs Van Lancker said about other policies, such as pension schemes or policies on other social issues or the problem of exclusion which we discussed recently, I have to say that all these procedures are in a state of flux and that our final objective is to coordinate them within a common framework. The third point raised by a number of honourable Members is just how medium-term or short-term the timetable should be.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the success of this proposal lies in the fact that it sets medium-term objectives – I mentioned 2010. This is very important because, with employment in particular, policies have to be structural. They leave cyclical changes out of account, which is why medium-term objectives are much more significant and help governments to focus their efforts and apply specific objectives. At the same time, however, we propose that procedures should be monitored annually, meaning that a debate will be held in Parliament once a year on the basis of the Member States' reports and, as Mr Solbes Mira just said, if specific incidents occur or unexpected circumstances arise, we can obviously review the new proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
