<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Melchior Wathelet, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to be here in Parliament. It is true that this Chamber personifies the European construct and it is therefore not without some emotion that I take the floor today on a subject as important as the preparation of the budget for 2011; and all the more so given that this is a brand new procedure in which Parliament’s role has been very clearly enhanced. Together, therefore, we are going to inaugurate the procedure set out in the Treaty of Lisbon in terms of preparing the budget for 2011. That is why it is even more important to me to be present today and to make this speech in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate that, within the framework of this collaboration, of these discussions that we need to hold in keeping with the new procedure set out in the Treaty of Lisbon, we have had a number of good initial contacts. The initial trialogues went quite well and that augurs well for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is aware that Parliament regrets the absence of political discussion during the preparation and drafting of the Council position. It is true that the work was carried out within the Committee on Budgets, but I must stress that it was carried out within the framework of political guidelines which were very clearly defined by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) on 16 March 2010 and it is only so as to comply with the first protocol on the role of the national parliaments that the Council formally adopted its position under a written procedure on 12 August of this year. This therefore has nothing to do with the political scope of the Council position. The budgetary procedure for 2011 is a first for all of us, with its new rules, and we will obviously need to learn lessons from it in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the Council has prepared this budget on the basis of a number of principles: the need to respect the financial perspective 2007-2013 and guarantee sound financial management and – and this is a second important principle – the need to guarantee sufficient margins so as to be able to extract the various political positions of the European Union and make them real and credible.</p>
<p class="contents">The preparation of this budget should be re-placed within the framework of the budgetary prudence which has been needed in each of the Member States of the European Union. We had a particularly difficult year in 2009, and this budgetary prudence also needs to be reflected in the 2011 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, if you will allow, to go over the various guidelines for the 2011 budget in greater detail and then to run through some of the headings which I think it is important to highlight here today.</p>
<p class="contents">We are proposing a budget of EUR 142 billion in commitment appropriations; this represents a reduction of EUR 788 million compared with the Commission proposal. As for payment appropriations, the Council has adjusted them by EUR 3.6 billion compared with the appropriations proposed by the Commission in its draft, which represents a reduction of 2.8%.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Council has also taken account of the Commission’s indications in terms of payments for the 2007 and 2013 cohesion policy programmes and, above all, of the latest information on the start-up and cruising speed planned for major projects. As we have in fact seen, there has been a delay in implementing a number of them.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also emphasise that, following the reduction applied by the Council, total payment appropriations have still increased substantially, by 2.91% compared with 2010. That represents nearly 1% above zero growth, or the inflation target set in the Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also draw your attention to the methodology adopted by the Council, which is perfectly in line with the most recent budget estimates; total commitment and payment appropriations are clearly rising, both in absolute values and as a percentage.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to go over all the elements of the budget heading by heading. I should simply like to remind you that, under heading 1A, we know that, for Parliament, policy on young people is a priority. This was in all Parliament’s documents. It is true that we fall slightly short of the Commission proposal, but these budgets are still clearly higher than in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as heading 1B is concerned, all the amounts entered in this budget have indeed been determined on the basis of their current implementation, by adhering carefully to how they are implemented today.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that, under heading 4, the Council is very anxious to maintain the European Union’s ability to react efficiently to political, economic and social challenges, especially at international level, and we are well aware that new budget requirements may emerge during the current budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also point out that, under heading 5, we have obviously not changed the demands made by the European Parliament in terms of its administrative budget, but we do feel that it is important for each of our institutions to make an effort to stay within the financial framework and abide by our current roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I think that it was very important to make you party to this presentation, that it was vital for the Council to be present today and to show what our thinking was within the framework of the preparation of the budget. I realise that Parliament’s perception may differ from the position adopted by the Council, but I expect negotiations with Parliament to be constructive and fruitful and I also thank the Commission for its support during the procedure, which looks set to be brimming with challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">My speech would not be complete without a reference to the budget review which the Commission will publish at the end of this month. In fact, the priorities for the 2011 budget, especially the EU 2020 strategy, will, without doubt, be the priorities for future years. With this in mind, the Council and Parliament must start looking more deeply, as of now, at the future architecture of the European budget and at how it is to be financed. I can assure you that the Belgian Presidency will make sure that the Council attaches particular importance to the budget review.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to come back to the 2011 budget itself, I assure you that the Belgian Presidency will do everything it can to overcome the obstacles in the path to this budget, which will be the first to be negotiated under the Treaty of Lisbon. I truly hope that we shall be able to show that this development, in terms of procedure, will have been a success. The Council will spare no pains to ensure that the budget benefits the maximum number of European citizens, who are the taxpayers who ultimately finance our budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At our last trialogue, not much was agreed, not much has moved forward, but at least what was agreed were the dates and modalities for the functioning of the conciliation committee in 2010. So now the calendar is set, Council’s reading is over, Parliament is to take its position by 20 October and the Commission will continue to attentively follow the emerging views and sensitivities of both arms of the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">But, next to the budget – and this is very important – on the agenda, we still have a whole package of adjustments to the Lisbon Treaty. Therefore, it requires real good will from both sides to agree, because this time there is a wide range of difficult things to solve on the negotiating table for November, so the November conciliation will be multidimensional.</p>
<p class="contents">On the substance, as mentioned by the Minister, there are cuts in payments by EUR 3.6 billion. The Commission, when presenting the draft budget, was fully aware of the constraints and austerity that exist in the Member States and the measure of our responsibilities, such that we have drafted the budget EUR 4 billion below the ceiling of the Financial Perspective and, what is more, we have concentrated all the increases on heading 1. That is conducive to growth and jobs and it should be seen as small anti-crisis packages locally or sectorally placed.</p>
<p class="contents">This is 96% of the increases that have been concentrated in heading 1, as a measure of our responsibility. It is quite usual for cohesion to move at a cruising speed in the middle of a financial perspective, after a slow start.</p>
<p class="contents">As for commitments, we welcome the fact that the Council will not be cutting operational expenditure but also cutting pre-accession programmes, which could be a signal to the candidate countries and could provoke a measure of reopening of the programming process and the revision of the allocation of funds between countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A small comment on administration: I am going to be very tough on this issue and I am not going to be very popular with my colleagues. But what is being cut are the so-called administrative support lines and the main victim is heading 4. This is about managing programmes, including emergency reactions to natural disasters, which is becoming a real challenge for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union was the first to react very quickly to the Pakistan disaster. As for the humanitarian aid and also for emergency aid reserves, I launched this procedure last week, but that needs management. This is about management administration lines for operational programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area that was cut was the increase for research executive agencies, which are phasing in, and research executive agencies are managing the Seventh Framework Programme, which is growing by EUR 1 billion in 2010 and should grow and will grow by EUR 1 billion in 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the conclusions, I would ask both arms of the budgetary authority to take carefully into consideration the concerns I expressed in negotiating the final multidimensional agreement and not to only consider the figures for 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">As usual, we in the Commission are ready to serve as an honest broker seeking, as an intermediary, to play a constructive role to achieve a good conclusion for 2011. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also the fifth budget to be prepared based on the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2007-2013, and because it is the fifth budget, we should already know a good deal about its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the efforts made by the Belgian Presidency to prepare it for reading in the Council, but I am very worried by the fact that as many as seven Member States voted against the Council’s reading. Sometimes, I have the irresistible and unpleasant feeling that when the Finance Ministers of particular Member States look at their national budgets and see the entry ‘contribution to the European Union budget’, they start to think about how they can reduce this or even get rid of it, and that they do not think about what in fact happens to that contribution or what it is used for, nor do they think about or want to discuss the consequences of such a reduction. I deplore the fact that this debate does not take place, and it was lacking, in my opinion, when the Council met to vote on the proposal. I also feel that the explanatory remarks in the Council’s proposal do not contain enough detail. Why, exactly, were some budget lines reduced and not others? Why were they reduced by the amount decided, and not by more or less? I hope that at the next stage of our work, we will be able to be more precise and clear up the lack of detail. All the greater is our obligation to ensure that the subsequent process of establishing the 2011 budget is detailed and precise and that we give careful consideration to every budget line in a responsible manner, which means not only thinking about percentages, but also about what is important, what we want to spend more on and what we want to sacrifice as part of savings.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to underscore the European Parliament’s priority, which is no longer a surprise to anyone, and is not the only priority. It is a priority related to young people, mobility and education. If the Council proposes cuts of EUR 25 million in the main budget line for this priority, namely the line related to lifelong learning, it is difficult to speak of dialogue here. I hope, however, that we will return to serious dialogue in the conciliation procedure, because we express our priorities so clearly that more use could have been made of them than proposing such cuts. In the European Parliament, we are currently at the phase of preparation for the reading. We are already at a very advanced stage, and I hope that our reading will be accepted by the Committee on Budgets by the end of the month and that at the plenary sitting at the beginning of October, we will show we can adopt a good and constructive budget under the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. I am counting on good cooperation, both with the Belgian Presidency and with the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am of the opinion that it is essential to fight for balanced budgets. It is not least a question of intergenerational equity and the possibility of us still being able to make real policies in the coming years and decades. Otherwise, we would be forced to put all our money into paying interest and, as a result, we would choke ourselves politically.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the European Union is not outside the situation in the Member States. However, I would like to mention the following as food for thought as to why we, too, are not in an identical position. The European Union has not incurred any debts, because our rules do not allow for that to happen. Moreover, the European Union – and this is something that the Member States wanted – has gained new tasks as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon, in energy policy, foreign policy and other areas that also need to be carried out. We must, of course, put ourselves in a position to be able to duly carry out these new tasks that have been bestowed upon us by the treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the budget for Parliament and the other institutions, I have to say that we still have not found the right balance between the new tasks and a responsible budgetary policy, including an austerity policy. The Council has rejected all of the new administrative positions, although not for the European Council and Parliament, but for the other, mainly smaller institutions, the European Data Protection Supervisor, the Court of Auditors and the European Court of Justice. I consider that to be unfair and unjust. Smaller institutions in particular, like the European Data Protection Supervisor, which we want to be able to function, need to be in a position to do their job. If we want proper control by the Court of Auditors, its officials must be able to travel and to carry out checks. For this, they need more staff. I believe that finding the correct balance is a political task and it is also an important message to the Member States and to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that I am not certain about is the question of enlargement costs. The funding has been reduced by the Council. The date of accession has not changed, however. Please explain how this is supposed to work.</p>
<p class="contents">The next problem is the salary increase of 1.85%. It is true that we do not yet have the court ruling. However, if we want to produce a sound budget plan, we absolutely must be prepared, at least, for this eventuality. From an environmental point of view, there are definitely opportunities for savings, namely the massive ITER project involving the nuclear fusion reactor. Perhaps we ought to have the political courage to fight over this sort of expenditure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say right at the start that I am certain that the Belgian Presidency will do as good a job as it possibly can. However, it can only do its job as well as it is permitted to do by the Council as a whole. Unfortunately, we have to admit that, in this regard, the result is poor. The Council has, as usual – and I cannot remember things ever being any different – gone round busily deleting and cutting parts of the Commission’s draft, in terms of both the commitments and the payments. It has done this all over the place at random – and that is also the usual procedure. It has not looked to see where this could possibly make sense and where not. The result is more than EUR 780 million less in commitments and EUR 3.6 billion less in payments.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at who this affects in particular, we see that once again, it is the decentralised agencies. We established these agencies together by means of legislation. Both Parliament and the Council were involved, otherwise there would be no agencies. However, if we do not make available to them the funds they need to enable them to do exactly what we have tasked them with doing, we ought to shut them down. Otherwise, every euro we give them really is money down the drain.</p>
<p class="contents">The same thing applies to the executive agencies. The Commission has already mentioned this. If we bleed dry the executive agencies that are supposed to implement the multiannual programmes that have been decided by law, these programmes are finished. Do we really want that to happen?</p>
<p class="contents">Elements in the Council hold pious speeches about how Europe must make greater efforts to be, or to become, competitive. In the budget procedure, however, it is precisely those parts of the budget that are intended to promote growth and competitiveness that are being cut, in other words, category Ia.</p>
<p class="contents">The structural policy figures are being affected in a similar way. Where there are now real requirements for funds from the regions, funding is being reduced by EUR 1 billion. That can hardly be regarded as logical, and it is certainly not wise.</p>
<p class="contents">We would really like those with the political responsibility to look closely at the content of our budget – the content! – and, in so doing, to have Europe and its added value for citizens in mind and in sight. Then they will indeed find a suitable partner for discussion in us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Melchior Wathelet, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, I should simply like to reply to a number of questions raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards the fact that it was not possible to debate all the budget lines proposed by the Council, I presume that these discussions will take place. I think that these debates are necessary and that we need to discuss what the priorities should be within the framework of the 2011 budget. Indeed, reaching agreement within the Council was no easy matter. Suffice it to say that this budget, at Council level, was subject to a vote which was not a foregone conclusion. However, that is also due to the budgetary situation in each country. These are difficult times.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, nonetheless, to remind you that, despite the difficult context, despite the difficulties we are each experiencing at home, the European budget has increased compared with 2010. There has been a 2.91% increase. In conclusion, as I said, some people wanted more, but it is still a significant increase compared with 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Haug raised the question earlier of heading 1B. I would simply remind you that this heading has increased by 14% compared with 2010. It is therefore not accurate to say that the Council does not recognise the specific circumstances of heading 1B, when it has been increased by 14% compared with 2010. I think that there has been an increase in awareness in the Council which has not perhaps been sufficiently described or commented on.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say to the rapporteur for the 2011 budget that, in the speech which I made here, we also wanted to draw attention to the work done by Parliament; you referred to a heading 1A in the budget that Parliament wanted to advance. I wanted to emphasise in my speech that the Council took note and was at pains to show, during the course of its work, that it was open to discussion, especially with regard to policy on young people. Of course, the discussion was opened on this policy because Parliament clearly defined it as one of its priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also remind you that, as regards heading 5 and the institutional aspect as such, it is true that all the institutions need to make an effort, but it is equally true that, within the framework of the budget presented by the Council, we did not touch Parliament’s budget as such. However, I think that it is important for each institution to make savings and for us all to set an example, as it were, in what is a difficult year from a budgetary point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we shall, without doubt, have more fruitful meetings and discussions over coming weeks. I trust that they will be sufficiently fruitful to reach agreement on the 2011 budget and I would simply like to remind you that this will not be an easy budget, because we need to apply a new procedure, because there are all these new policies to implement – as you said – and also because we cannot disregard the difficult financial and budgetary situation in our Member States, each of which has budgetary targets to meet.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that, by being aware of all these difficulties, challenges and constraints, we shall, together, find a budget for 2011 which is acceptable to everyone and we shall, together, show that this new procedure in the Treaty of Lisbon may be brought to a successful conclusion, by which I mean with a budget adopted for 2011. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
