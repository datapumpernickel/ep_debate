<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hughes (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, while my report welcomes the Commission's communication, it is also constructively critical in a number of important respects.</p>
<p class="contents">The report emphasises three horizontal issues of great importance to the success of the strategy. First, the lack of an action plan. The strategy suffers from an unacceptable imbalance and a lack of strategic vision for follow-through. The initial analysis is basically good but the proposals for action are often little more than a description of an issue. Where they propose action, they are often vague, and there is virtually no indication of resources or the timing of the strategy's implementation. For example, the communication presents a good analysis of the changes being brought about by the increasing feminisation of society and the impact of an ageing population, but then proposes virtually nothing by way of action.</p>
<p class="contents">The report therefore calls for an action plan with timing commitments against each major proposal, for such a plan to be endorsed by Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in time for the spring 2003 European Council and for it then to be subject to annual monitoring through the Social Agenda scoreboard, as advocated by the Council. Parliament and the advisory committees would also need to be involved in this monitoring process.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a serious point and I know the Commissioner will be listening to it. I call upon her to give a clear indication tonight that there will be a positive response to this call. If not, I have a clear mandate to ask for this report to be referred back to committee, where it will be reformulated to reject the Commission's strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major horizontal issue is a lack of resources. In 1992, some 130 officials were working on occupational health and safety within the European Commission. Today, that number is down to around 24. We might disagree over the precise numbers but the Commissioner would agree there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of staff working in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a basis for the kind of dynamic and proactive administration that would be required to implement the strategy, capable of responding to a changing policy environment while continuing to monitor and scrutinise the implementation of existing legislation and policy measures. It is essential that this trend is reversed and that adequate resources are allocated to this policy area within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The third major horizontal issue in the report highlights a lack of balance between legislative and non-legislative instruments. I am concerned that the development of non-legislative instruments should in no way be seen as an alternative to maintaining and improving Community legislation on occupational health and safety. Specific instances are given where the gaps and deficiencies in the existing legal framework need to be addressed and where comprehensive approaches to legislation, rather than ad hoc tinkering, will be important for both established and new risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the specifics of the report, there is clearly not enough time to deal with them all, so I shall highlight only a few. First, the report makes the point that, given how much more problematic health and safety are in small and medium-sized enterprises, it is regrettable that the Commission has still not launched a multiannual SME programme based on the two years' preparatory action undertaken by the Bilbao Agency on the initiative of the European Parliament. Such a programme was supported by the Commission in the European Social Agenda endorsed at Nice. It would facilitate the testing, analysis and dissemination of successful measures in this critical sector. I very much hope the Commission will respond positively now.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, in terms of emerging risks, I hope the Commission will look at the need for new laws in areas such as harassment at work, recently called for by Parliament. Equally, in relation to repetitive strain injuries, I hope it will revisit the display screen directive – the directive does not even mention the computer mouse – and the directive on manual handling. I hope it will go further and accept our call for a comprehensive directive on workplace ergonomics.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also highlights a number of existing directives that are in need of revision. The Commission needs both commitment and resources to tackle that work. Reflecting the helpful opinion we received from the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, the report advocates the integration of a gender dimension throughout the strategy and highlights a number of specific strands of work to be tackled. The report also welcomes benchmarking, but it takes the view that a successful benchmarking approach will need not just more comparable and reliable data but also a harmonised system of definitions, recording and reporting of occupational injuries and diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that the report also welcomes the proposal to codify and simplify existing Community legislation in this field, so long as that is not coded language for deregulation for deregulation's sake. I am not accusing the Employment and Social Affairs Directorate-General of that, but there are forces elsewhere in the Commission that have that tendency. In committee I even went as far as to propose a joint amendment with Mr Bushill-Matthews saying that the review of the legislation should be used as an opportunity to promote the simplification of legislation and its repeal when it is redundant. None of us here should have an interest in maintaining redundant legislation, nor in making legislation complicated rather than as easy as possible to understand and implement.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Commissioner can give us the assurance we need on this action plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Hughes and particularly the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their close cooperation. The communication entitled 'Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work for 2002-2006' is a strategy on health and safety for the period in question.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a new strategy which includes some key new elements. These elements concern the quality of work and the need to combine a variety of different political instruments such as legislation, social dialogue, progressive measures and best practices, corporate social responsibility and economic incentives. Of course, the basis of the analysis is that health and safety issues are related to competitiveness and there is always a cost when we neglect social policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The main points in this communication are as follows. Firstly, and I think this must be very clear, it is not just a proposal from the Commission, it is also a Community strategy, so there is a need to include all the European partners including, at political level, the European, national and regional authorities. At operational level, it concerns the social partners and, at the level of services, it concerns all institutions dealing with health, prevention services and insurance organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">A very interesting point in this communication is the question how we can develop the prevention culture. There are, of course, a number of priorities concerning the need to reinforce our capacity for risk surveillance and the need for better legislation. I totally agree with the need for simplification and codification, which is one of the commitments in the Commission strategy. There is also a need for cooperation between the Commission and the national authorities as far as the implementation of the strategies is concerned and, at the same time, for cooperation at international level. I have tried to outline in a few words the main points of the communication, because I believe that responding to Mr Hughes' specific remarks will make for a more interactive debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs made some specific proposals, many of which the Commission has worked on and taken into account. Some of the proposals could perhaps be examined in greater depth. We could be more precise in terms of the timetables and description of the activities that must be carried out, and could do this in a meeting with the Committee on Employment, when we can discuss the activities and proposals of the strategy individually, particularly the five points referred to by Mr Hughes.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the issue of SMEs, which was raised in the report. You are aware of the problems we have with the SAFE programme. Thanks to Parliament we now have a specific budget in Bilbao for SMEs and we can discuss the details for implementing this project as well as the timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding legislation on stress, an analysis has been undertaken. We have launched the first stage of consultation. Again, we can be more definite. The same applies to the proposal for a directive on workplace ergonomics and issues concerning the manual-handling directive. The analysis is under way. We can be specific about the timetables for the study and can make specific commitments on when and how we are going to launch the first stage of consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Next there is the issue of women: on that there is total agreement. Gender mainstreaming is a general principle in all actions in our strategy paper. As regards benchmarking, you are right that perhaps we could find a better way to enforce the procedure. The report specifically refers to the need to encourage Member States to use benchmarking in this area, but maybe we can discuss this together to see how it can be made more concrete. Perhaps we can discuss this with Member States and ask them to set firm objectives. Then we could have a report seeing what progress they are making. It cannot be an obligation – we cannot oblige Member States to do it – but maybe we could present it in a more organised way to see how benchmarking can move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I shall comment on simplification and codification. We are working on a total evaluation of health and safety legislation. This is one of the main commitments in the strategy. It is not an easy task but our final goal is to simplify the provisions, see whether they are consistent and then codify them. One commitment is to codify the health and safety directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would particularly like to congratulate Mr Hughes on his report. As he said, I have been very pleased with the way that our committees have worked together on this issue and, in particular, the cooperation with the rapporteur which has ensured that the points made by the Committee on Women's Rights have been fully taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">This is important because, while men are more often the victims of serious accidents at work, women tend to suffer for longer periods of time from work-related illnesses. Adult women receive less vocational training and education than their male colleagues. That is why it is so important that we have a gender breakdown of statistics on work-related ill health and accidents for full-time, part-time and temporary employment. The Commissioner agreed that gender must be mainstreamed throughout this strategy so that issues such as the effect of the double workload of paid employment and personal responsibilities and issues such as harassment in the workplace are properly addressed. If risk assessment and workplace design fail to take gender into account, women will continue to be prevented from entering certain professions and sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">An evaluation of current health and safety law is needed so that we can identify problem areas to make future legislation more effective. For example, domestic workers and home workers, many of whom are women, must be protected, as well as women in agriculture and spouses in family-run small businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I totally support the rapporteur in his comments on the lack of resources in the Commission to deal with health and safety policy and, in particular, the need for a detailed and costed action plan and a very strict timetable for improving legislation in this very important area. I support the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we can express our opinion on the circumstances in which things take place and the circumstances they reflect. And the reality in the European Union in terms of health in the workplace, without wanting to be alarmist, is that in 1999 there were 5 500 accidents resulting in fatalities, 4.8 million accidents leading to more than 3 days of inability to work, 500 million working days lost as a result of accidents or health problems, compensation payments and, what is more serious, almost 350 000 people had to change job or their place of work – around 300 000 with some degree of disability – and 15 000 will never be able to take on a new job.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there has been a certain worrying rise in the number of accidents in certain Member States of the Union and, in view of enlargement, there is enormous concern about the situation of the States which are candidates for – not future, but imminent – accession with average work accident rates which are above the Community average, although this can be explained, it is true, from different angles, including the importance of higher-risk sectors of activity in those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, surely we are dealing with the poorest relation of enlargement. The European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights states in Article 31(1) that every worker has the right to work in conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity. The Lisbon Summit – and the Barcelona Summit reiterated this – set as one of its objectives the creation of more and better jobs – and that of better ones must be applied not only to the fight against precariousness, but also to safer jobs and workplaces.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the triple aspects of the strategy are correct; the global approach ranging from professional qualifications to the working day, from demographic trends, the general development of economic activity to that of the working population, the notion that safe and healthy working environments and organisations are factors which affect the performance of the economy in general and of companies in particular and, above all, the culture of risk prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the risk inherent in work by definition, constant and insistent action is required. It will be necessary to use all the means allowed by the so-called social acquis, from the framework Directive to the rules laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Protection is therefore going to require joint action by the whole of society, as has already been said: employers, workers, public administrations, citizens. A genuine joint action.</p>
<p class="contents">But without increasing awareness, without training of workers and the people responsible for health, without horizontal prevention policies, without a culture of prevention – as the Commissioner said – and without sufficient information, decisions on the content of regulations will be of little use. Simplification will be welcome when the time comes and when it is possible, but it will be insufficient without increasing awareness. In the face of this risk, I would go as far to say that action is not sufficient, but that what we need is obstinacy.</p>
<p class="contents">The culture of prevention must be insistent, to the point of boredom. There must be new standards when necessary, more material and human resources, specific actions in sectors and companies with greater than average accident levels, monitoring of the different plans and exchange of best practices and the avoidance of new risks.</p>
<p class="contents">The health, safety and dignity of the European citizens is at stake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all of us concerned about the fact that far too many people receive lasting physical injuries in the course of their work. What perhaps is worse is that, in a long list of areas, there has in actual fact been no improvement in the working environment in the EU. It is against that background, Commissioner, that we had hoped that the Commission might have been more ambitious in its working environment strategy and, in any case, when it came to following this up. I had hoped that we might today have been able to obtain a promise of more than just timetables for the various activities.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteurs have emphasised, the situation in the area of the working environment is such that, since 1992, there have been swingeing cutbacks in the resources available to the Commission in this field. I am aware that there are different ways of doing the calculations, but the fact is that the money is not enough. We are concerned here with cutbacks at a time when problems in the working environment have become more complicated and extensive and when, as a matter of fact, we face new working environment problems. We must work with different tools, we must look into prevention and we must help the national authorities. There are many very complicated tasks that have to be carried out, and the challenges we face in terms of directives cannot adequately be described in a three-minute speech. As Mrs Evans has also pointed out, we know that working environment problems may be in danger of becoming problems for women. We know that small and medium-sized enterprises require special attention. There is an urgent need for a directive on the whole range of muscle and bone problems. Stress and harassment require concerted action, and we are also aware of the possible need for a general recognition of occupational illnesses in a minimum directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of all the initiatives we all consider necessary, what is probably our greatest disappointment is that the Commission does not intend to follow up this strategy with a proper action plan. When the Commission says that it would like to be involved in timetabling, our answer must be that timetables should be made still more binding, and we must propose that a proper action plan in actual fact be prepared. If the Commission agrees that we must have timetables and that we must make them more binding, it will hopefully – at the end of this debate in which there will presumably be more people demanding an action plan – explain to us why it does not go the whole hog, pursue this strategy further and draw up a proper action plan. We know, of course, that this would be more binding upon the European Parliament, the Commission and, especially, the Member States. I hope that we can make progress. We need an action plan covering the working environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group agreed that I should table the amendments again in plenary but, unfortunately, no other group was prepared to open up the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation should only be brought forward when we demonstrate that there is a clear need for it, rather than best practice or the exchange of best practice. We must first make sure that existing legislation in the same field is being implemented across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as I have already said regarding comprehensive impact assessments, we must have an impact assessment for each Member State, taking into account the impact on industry, on business and on the workforce. Unfortunately, quite often the impact assessments coming forward from the Commission look more like explanatory statements to me rather than comprehensive impact assessments. Above all, in health and safety we need to have up-to-date scientific and medical evidence to demonstrate the need for such legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Take the example of the vibrations directive. I was given a lot of documents by the Commission. The ISO standards report, the only one that was really up to date, actually said that there was no quantitative link between whole body vibration and lower back pain, but still we brought legislation forward. I am pro-European but we bring forward more and more legislation without demonstrating the actual need for it. This brings the European Union into disrepute.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we may need some of the legislation Mr Hughes has proposed in his report and which the Commission has proposed, without a guarantee of a proper comprehensive and independent impact assessment, the ELDR Group will have to abstain on the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The text is very clear. He is extremely worried that so little is happening, and he puts forward a long list of proposals of a legislative and non-legislative nature which could improve the situation. I am sure that he will gain the support of the whole Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left for all this.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, he also addresses implementation and the difficulties of getting it all to work in reality. I believe we should speak more plainly in this context. This is in fact a dispute. We talk about dialogue and cooperation, but it is actually a dispute. Companies are required to put pressure on costs and profit margins in competition with other companies. The cutbacks have to be made somewhere. Health and safety cost money. We cannot achieve proper health and safety at work if the unions are not strong enough to put pressure on companies. These are the circumstances of the dispute, which are inherent in our system. We should recognise this in some way if we want better health and safety at work. Legislative and non-legislative methods work where there are employee organisations able to use the laws, recommendations and guidelines which we draw up. That is the reality of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we should discuss whether we need to strengthen employee organisations, for example by strengthening union rights. It may be that the opportunities for legal assistance in disputes should be increased. Increased expert assistance might be considered. In the nineteenth century, when there were no strong unions, factory inspectors helped workers. In Eastern Europe we might need work and factory inspectors of the type found in the UK in the nineteenth century. We should perhaps make it clearer to the candidate countries that the right to strike is part of the body of law, or <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, which they are expected to introduce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly endorse Mr Hughes’ report. I have heard him say once that in his opinion the analysis in the Commission communication was solid, but the actual detailing of it left something to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I saw this in the EU reports today. In my view, the analysis is satisfactory, but certainly not solid, for the simple reason that there are far better practices in Europe than those described in this document. I am particularly concerned with the element of well-being at work. After all, legislation on health and safety at work is solid legislation. It is about vibrations, noise, and so on. Extensive research has been done in the Netherlands, for example, as to how well-being at work should be interpreted. This covers aspects that involve organisations, and aspects that can also have repercussions at a later date in the form of repetitive strain injury<span class="italic">,</span> stress or numerous other forms of non-well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of these elements have been mentioned in the Commission’s document in connection with investing in quality, but this aspect came to an abrupt end with the indicators that were developed afterwards by the Belgians. It is regrettable that this area is not further elaborated upon, as the proposals are actually a kind of odd collection of various points. The clinical pictures and problems concerning well-being have been known for a long time, and yet no date has yet been set for these proposals. So once again, I endorse Mr Hughes' description of the problems, and I also hope that he may have the moral fibre to withdraw his report if the Commission is not committed to solving the problems surrounding the reduction in staffing levels, the balance between legislative and non-legislative measures – which, in my view, is still wanting – and, above all, the lack of an action plan with a timeframe to back it up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It talks of the importance of health and safety at work, of the need to strengthen the prevention culture and to secure a better application of existing law. I very much agree with all of that. It portrays the problem as follows: the preventive culture of EU directives has not yet been fully understood, nor has it been applied effectively on the ground. I agree. It admits that people tend to see the Community legal framework as being excessively complex and unclear and proposes that it be simplified and rationalised. I agree with that too.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have hoped that Parliament might have seen fit to endorse these Commission proposals, but the rapporteur has gone off in the opposite direction. He claims that, because Commission staffing has been reduced to some 40% of its 1992 levels, this indicates much lower priority within the Commission. This is nonsense. However, for some people all roads always lead to the standard socialist solution of more money, more people and more regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I note the rapporteur graciously referred to the joint amendment we tabled, which was the great highlight in committee – perhaps it could be the highlight of his report. Colleagues may well hope this is the start of a great new partnership, but I suspect they may have to wait a little longer for it to blossom. We will hope together for progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the rapporteur wants to extend the scope of the framework directive to propose new legislation on workplace bullying and a new directive on workplace ergonomics, strengthen the display screen equipment directive and amend the manual handling directive. All that appears on just the first page of his recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not need more directives. I suggest his conclusions are wrong because his analysis is wrong. The UK Conservative delegation will be voting against it and we will not be alone.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that Ireland has just voted to allow the entry of applicant countries into the EU. If the applicant countries read the Hughes report, they may not want to join. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also want to thank Mr Hughes for emphasising the importance of focusing upon implementation of the legislation. Danish employers often maintain that, unlike their opposite numbers in many other countries, they have to comply with the regulations governing the working environment. To be frank, I am tired of having to listen to this remark without being able in all honesty to contradict it. I should like to be able to repudiate such assertions in the future. That is why it is important for us to obtain more focus on the practical implementation of working environment legislation so that a good and safe working environment really is created at all workplaces in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, we must also give careful consideration to the type of regulation with which we can best make the working environment safe. Legislation is not always the correct route to go down. Sometimes, improvements are better achieved through training, the sharing of experiences and the development of the social dialogue. A good example is the combating of stress and harassment as problems that can only be solved through better cooperation in the individual workplace. That is why I also think that the combating of stress and harassment is a matter for the two sides of industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report by Stephen Hughes quite rightly emphasises three important points: the lack of resources, the absence of an action plan, the lack of balance between the legislative and non-legislative instruments. The report therefore calls for Community legislation to be simplified, for improvements in its implementation in the Member States and for issues relating to gender and corporate responsibility to be taken into account and for new instruments and specific measures addressing the situation in the candidate countries to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The report highlights the need for a detailed plan to be drawn up that has financial commitments and clear deadlines for each proposal and methods of monitoring its implementation. It also stresses and does so very firmly – this is something that I welcome – the need to integrate the gender dimension in the measures to be taken. Generally speaking, women receive the lowest salaries, have the least job security, and are at greatest risk of psychological or sexual harassment. Lastly, we must significantly improve the health and safety of women who are pregnant or breast-feeding or who have young children.</p>

The enactment of minimum requirements in this area is necessary in order to prevent, in this European internal market, competitive advantages from being won as it were on the backs of the workforce. In this sense, it is also laudable that the Commission is thinking about the future and setting out its primary areas of concern.</p>
<p class="contents">As well stated in this report, women and people with disabilities should be the main areas of concern. I am, though, rather wary of efforts to interpret the law broadly and make every conceivable aspect of working life subject to European regulation. In this area, too, there must still be room for national peculiarities and independence.</p>
<p class="contents">We are indeed facing great changes in working life in Europe. There are fewer and fewer employees in the traditional sense of the word. What are termed atypical working patterns are on the increase, and I also cannot rid myself of the suspicion that, in the absence of solutions to the real problems, we are increasingly churning out papers and declarations of intent that do workers at their actual workplaces precious little good. It seems to me to be a fact that – be it on the grounds of the oft-cited globalisation or of general developments in society – there is less protection for workers, the value of work as a factor of production is decreasing and the worker's need for protection is falling behind, whether despite European integration or because of it. Greater attention therefore needs to be given to the maintenance of the status quo as regards safety in actual workplaces.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to maintain the level of protection that we have achieved and made into one of Europe's common assets; it must also be introduced in the candidate countries, not only on paper, but also in reality. Paper can hang around a long time, even, and indeed especially in Europe – we all know that. But the industrial safety that we have achieved is at the heart of the social dimension of a Europe that is becoming more integrated, something that I believe workers see as a far more positive development than papers on employment and other aspects of strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Even if the Commission were to increase its resources, what action could it take in response to the quest for profit of large employers, which leads to staff reductions, and therefore, an increase in the work of those who remain, to cuts in safety spending, and widespread job insecurity, sub-contracting and temporary work, which force badly paid workers to contend with situations for which they are unprepared?</p>
<p class="contents">Even in a country such as France, almost 800 people die each year in work-related accidents, and several thousands are crippled for life. Almost all of these accidents could be avoided, if only the resources were made available, in other words, if cuts were made in the dividends given to the all-important shareholder.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless employers are forced to respect the safety and lives of their workers instead of making profit their number one priority, even the best resolutions will remain hesitant speeches. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Purvis (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, of course we all want health and safety at work, employers, workers and shareholders. What good is it if we have health and safety but no work? There is the problem and there is the challenge. There is an honourable tradition in the long campaign and struggle to achieve acceptable standards of health and safety in the workplace. This started way back with the industrial revolution. It freed children from hard manual labour in the mines and the mills, and to this day it protects workers against avoidable accidents and illnesses. And it is not over yet.</p>
<p class="contents">Still there are unacceptable accidents on the farm and on the factory floor. Only last month on a farm next door to mine in Scotland, the young husband and father of a family died after being caught in a potato-harvesting machine. We must do all we can and continue to strive to eliminate all such tragedies. Our work and business culture must be a safety culture, but life and work can never be devoid of risk. There is no way we could achieve that utopia and still have a working economy, where men and women leave home each day for their workplace and thereby support their families and our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Be in no doubt that absurdly exaggerated restrictions and red tape will only kill off enterprise and the enterprises to which our constituents resort each day to make their living and provide the prosperity on which we all depend. The Commission has it very nearly right. Apply effectively the legislation we already have and encourage health and safety actions as good for business as well as for workers. Mr Hughes' report goes far too far. Its litany of exaggerated good intentions and its demand for yet more legislation risk the future of Europe's businesses, of our prosperity and our jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As I have said, this health and safety at work strategy is an action plan for the European Community as whole. So we have to take account of the differences between the Member States, their different laws and definitions, the Treaty, the legal basis and the constraints on the Commission's human resources budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Attention has been drawn to the human resources cutbacks. But we have the Bilbao Agency. The Commission services and the Bilbao Agency have different terms of reference, but the Bilbao Agency provides support in the form of information, campaigns, analyses and studies. So there is very close cooperation. In any case, I cannot commit myself to more human resources, since you all know how difficult an issue that is.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have proposed in this strategy is realistic and the Commission is able to carry it out with the existing resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Now some specific comments. It is always assumed that the solution for any political issue is legislation. We do not automatically accept or rule out the need for legislation, we are just saying that, in many cases, the situation needs to be assessed to see whether such legislation is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lynne questioned whether this procedure was always right and whether the existing data or studies were necessarily sufficient to demonstrate the need for legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the specific issue of vibration, there have been many different studies. We have received data from all the Member States proving there was a real problem. We shall be analysing it and then presenting proposals for any follow-up action.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just legislation. There are so many different issues in the Commission's text. Reference was made to quality. We have already started working with Eurostat on the harmonisation of at least the definitions in the various Member States. At the moment they define accidents differently, which sometimes causes confusion. We are therefore working towards harmonisation of the existing definitions. Then we have to work on concrete indicators. These are very specific and should be submitted according to a timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">Benchmarking has been referred to. I spoke about that earlier. Partnership is one of the cornerstones of the whole concept. Under the strategy, each of the partners involved is required to present its own action plan. We have already received action plans from the social partners. Each Member State and each partner has to submit its own specific programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already worked through the issues with the applicant countries, and there are concrete references and commitments concerning those countries as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we can in future work together in cooperation with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to assess the potential for more precise commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
