But, anyway, the idea of sustainable urban development has grown into something significant in just the last few years. It is a question, mainly, of a horizontal approach, namely, that sustainable development is a common denominator for social, economic and ecological work in cities. We know that the Commission is now drafting a programme for sustainable development for the whole of the European Union, and that should be ready in six months’ time. I hope that sustainable urban development will form a vital part of this sustainable development strategy. We know that the vast majority of Europeans live in cities, and, until now, these matters, as far as cities specifically are concerned, have played second fiddle. The rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, has quite rightly recommended that the Commission’s proposed budget should be increased. The sum is not very large even now, but it will definitely enable us to start an inter-city networking programme so that our citizens, in particular, will be able to establish direct contact with the various players in the networks of different countries. In this way we can develop the European view on urban development. I hope that these resources will be used specifically for developing European cooperation from the point of view of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is really a question of putting in place best practices which can in a real sense develop our towns and cities in a positive manner. In Ireland, urban renewal programmes are making a significant contribution to the upgrading of small towns and villages. The small town/village renewal programme is an integral part of rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">EU structural funds, mainly through the ESF, as well as national exchequer finances, must always be focused on developing disadvantaged and poorer areas in our society. The issue of sustainability does not only apply to towns and cities. There are many rural parts of the European Union that need to be developed and sustained in a positive manner. Unemployment black spots are both applicable to urban and rural areas. As a legislative institution we should not seek at any time to exacerbate the urban/rural divide. We need to develop marginalised and disadvantaged areas while supporting economic development and expanding social programmes. The planning process must be implemented in a fair and innovative manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am going to explain to you the factors which Mrs Lienemann would have liked to have presented to you herself if she had not been detained by other work.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council, adopted by the European Commission on 22 November 1999 and on a Community Framework for cooperation to promote sustainable urban development, follows on from the ‘European Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign’, launched in 1992. The state of the urban environment, in which approximately 80% of the European population resides, is a fundamental topic of concern which has repercussions at local, European and world levels.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said that the thorniest environmental problems at European level basically concern urban areas. They are often closely linked to global environmental challenges, and their impact is such that they directly influence the quality of life for millions of people. A coherent and sustainable approach to urban development policies may, however, significantly improve the quality of life in cities and towns.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the concept of sustainable development, particularly in the case of cities and towns, is not, and cannot be, limited solely to the environmental aspect, but also embraces social and economic aspects. Europe’s cities and towns are important economic, political and socio-cultural centres. They may also represent a major threat to our natural environment, and the current challenge is to facilitate balanced urban development enabling cities and towns to continue to play an important role in contemporary society, as well as in the society of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">One major challenge in creating an urban policy is to find the means of pursuing sustainable urban development objectives within the administrative structure of the city. That is why, in agreement with the other institutions, Mrs Lienemann, our rapporteur, has proposed slightly increasing the budget to EUR 14 million in order to promote cooperation in this area between 2001 and 2004. The appropriations would be mainly allocated to networks of towns and cities organised at European level and in order to support their activities in the field of development and the dissemination of good practices where sustainable urban development is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The 2000-2004 multiannual programme for sustainable development in the urban environment is an appropriate instrument for achieving this end, and the implementation of Agenda 21 is an excellent way of coordinating and developing actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we must recognise that there has been no widespread success, either in the implementation of Agenda 21 or in the results obtained. Land planning in many Member States still fails to take account of the capacity of the physical environment, the cultural heritage and the resources of local authorities to assume their environmental duties. Furthermore, the report on sustainable cities highlights the existence of significant shortcomings in the practice and in the development of environmental legislation at a local level.</p>
<p class="contents">The multiannual plan has ambitious objectives and a very broad scope, which can be extended to the candidate countries. Of course, we need a budget which is coherent with the terms of the proposal, but we would be falling into another trap if we did not have much more effective mechanisms for monitoring and assessing the results than we have at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude: ‘yes’ to strengthening the budget, ‘yes’ to the report and to the improvements which Mrs Lienemann has made to the Commission’s proposal, but also to reinforcing, considerably, the mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of all these programmes, both within the Commission and in the Member States themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mrs Patrie has already said, 80 percent of the population of Europe live in towns or cities. The chances of a good life for these people depend entirely on the environment where they live. Unfortunately, towns and cities today are associated almost automatically with a bad environmental situation – large quantities of emissions, a lot of traffic and polluted waterways. But it does not actually need to be this way. Better knowledge and new technology provides the opportunity for a better environment in Europe's towns and cities. Clear legislation and careful control of this are yet other tools.</p>
<p class="contents">The towns and cities themselves have many of the instruments available to them, which help to improve the environment for their own citizens. It is often in the municipalities and towns that they are most aware of their own problems. With sensible town planning, well-functioning public transport and cooperation with other municipal interested parties, it is possible to provide citizens with a better environment. In practice, it is also at the local level that the environmental decisions we take here in Parliament are to be implemented. The climate issue is a good example of this. Reduced traffic and conversion from fossil fuels at a local level is necessary to achieve a change in the climate threat we are experiencing.</p>
<p class="contents">There needs to be a clear dialogue and good cooperation between the institutions of the Union and those acting at local level, that is the municipalities or towns and cities. I believe that Mrs Lienemann's report will contribute to this. However, we must also get citizens involved at local level. This can be done through cooperation with universities, voluntary organisations, companies and other actors. For this reason I feel that, in the definition of who can apply for funds from the framework programme, there must be room for organisations other than those we traditionally regard as municipal organisations. There are many good examples of municipalities cooperating with others. It is the spread of responsibility that is the important thing. This, in my opinion, should be a criterion. Therefore, I would like to support Amendment No 31. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, let me first even in her absence congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann for her excellent work, and express my great satisfaction that, thanks to the constructive work of both Parliament and the Council, we might be in a position to conclude on this important initiative already at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal on sustainable urban development has the potential of having a direct effect on the daily lives as many as 80% of the European population. It will enable and encourage towns and cities throughout Europe and beyond to come together and learn from each other's experiences, help them to tackle environmental problems and challenges and to work towards sustainability. The Commission is also grateful for the substantial support which the European Parliament has provided for this proposal and for the many helpful amendments which have been put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recognises the importance of promoting good governance and transparency in its decision-making process. Accordingly, we are strongly in favour of the establishment of a platform of dialogue with the key stakeholders to help determine the priority themes to be supported. Its innovative approach will involve cooperation with the city networks, Member States, EU institutions, NGOs and the business community, ensuring that the funds provided from the framework are targeted at those areas of sustainable development most in need of them. I believe that this innovative approach will provide an example for others to follow. The budget for this proposal has been the subject of some debate with a wide range of views expressed about the appropriateness of the EUR 12.4 m originally proposed by the Commission. Many have suggested that the budget is too small. The Commission wants to stress however that this framework is not about the implementation of projects at ground level. Other Community programmes and initiatives are already in place for this. Rather, the framework is designed to facilitate the sharing of information and ideas about the best practice of sustainable urban development so that the solutions identified to problems in one city or town can be shared with the other cities and towns throughout Europe and beyond. The quality approach of the framework and its multiplier effects are such that despite the relatively small budget it is expected to have a real impact on the promotion of sustainable urban development in Europe. The forty-one amendments have been given detailed consideration and the Commission is able to accept thirty of them, either completely or in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 33 proposes a revised budget for the proposal of EUR 14 m. We must make it clear that the Commission's general line on such matters is that no budget increase can be accepted without additional resources being transferred by the Council and Parliament to the relevant budget lines. In this specific instance, however, and on the basis that it will facilitate the adoption at first reading, the Commission has exceptionally agreed to accept an increase of the financial scope of the proposal to EUR 14 m without the provision of additional resources. While we are willing to support a figure of EUR 14 m we cannot support a figure of EUR 20 m as proposed by Amendment No 14.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue relates to commitology. Given the nature of the activity, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 10 and 23. Establishment of a consultative committee would be the appropriate commitology solution. So, to conclude, the Commission can fully accept Amendments Nos 2, 5 to 8, 10 to 13, 15, 16, 18 to 20, 22 to 24, 28, 30, 32 to 35 and 37. The Commission can in principle accept Amendments Nos 25, 27, 36, 40 and 41. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 9, 14, 17, 21, 26, 31, 38 and 39. Amendment No 31 would allow NGOs, universities etc. to be involved as main partners in the networks to be supported. It is intended that the main partners in this framework should be the Commission and networks of local authorities whose legal responsibility is to develop and implement policies of sustainable urban development. We cannot therefore accept this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the detailed consideration it has given to this proposal and for the valuable input provided by all parties. It has undoubtedly strengthened and improved the quality of the proposal and, as a consequence, helped to ensure that it will deliver the maximum possible benefit to cities and towns throughout the EU and further afield. I am also happy that the spirit of the interinstitutional cooperation has been such that the adoption of this proposal at first reading should be secure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
