Never before, in eight years, have I taken the floor after a report, but I think it appropriate that I do so today. There is no doubt that some of the amendments on which we voted today are perfectly in order. Whilst I do not want to revisit the subject of Great Britain, which we talked about for long enough this morning, some of those that did not get through had to do with the removal of duplications, for example in connection with the OIE's three-month probation period, which causes us concern. We were also concerned to give the report a coherent form. We did not succeed in that, but it does not matter.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to say is that I am very glad that the Greens' Amendment No 25 was rejected. I also want to tell you why. The fact is that it would make the internal market fundamentally null and void, and, when your farmers vaccinate, you would have to explain to them that they were enabling British farmers to eat their own sheep and Dutch farmers to drink their own milk, since these products would no longer find their way onto the EU market or the markets of third countries outside the European Union. You simply have to bear that in mind. It may be all very fine as far as protecting animals is concerned, but there is no political mileage in it at all. That is why I am very glad that the amendment was rejected. Quite apart from that, I am very happy that we worked together extremely well in the committee, without regard to group allegiances, and that this report is supported by a large majority today.</p>

<p class="contents">This is what one of these many scandalous exemptions stipulates: ‘The Member States shall ensure that the number of weekly working hours does not, under any circumstances, exceed an average of 58 hours during the first three years of the transitional period, an average of 56 hours during the following two years, and an average of 52 hours for any additional period.’</p>

Cruel intimidation and the murder of civilians were an accepted tool used for engaging in territorial expansion and securing economic spheres of interest. The military was above the law. Not until 1945, after the defeat of Germany and Japan in the Second World War, were war criminals from those countries convicted by the victors. Were they the only war criminals? Or is the designation of war criminal equally applicable to those responsible for the destruction of Dresden, Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Evidently one needs to be the loser in a war to be tried and sentenced after that war.</p>
<p class="contents">Partial losers, who have not lost control over their home base, get off scot-free, witness the colonial wars of the Netherlands in Indonesia, France in Algeria and Portugal in Angola and Mozambique. Despite that selective approach, it is good that crimes should be punished, even if an attempt is made to justify them in terms of the exigencies of war. In this way we can discourage repetition in future. Unfortunately the Kirkhope report offers mainly a policy of harassing refugees accused by their political opponents of having dirty hands. It will scarcely help us to prevent future crimes of rulers against their people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with his criticism of the Danish proposal’s lack of ambition and scant substance. No progress has been made on the mutual recognition of judgments and we are still a long way off from implementing the principle of the mutual recognition of sentencing. The proposal that has been made only proposes the establishment of a system of exchanging information between Member States on disqualifications imposed in the courts, but does not provide for any type of mutual recognition of sentencing for the purposes of its implementation, which means that an individual who is sentenced to disqualification or to the loss of rights in one Member State can still exercise these rights freely in another State of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must fulfil the desire expressed in Tampere and Laeken to make the principle of the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters effective.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the recognition of judgments in criminal matters is highly sensitive, and raises delicate issues. There are differences in the various Member States and we must avoid the possibility of ‘havens for criminals’, and prevent freedom of movement from benefiting those acting outside the law.</p>
<p class="contents">We must provide a clear response to the citizens’ demands for the EU effectively to confront the problem of the increasing threats crime poses for their freedom and rights by means of a solid and common policy for preventing and combating crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Rejecting the Danish proposal would therefore send an important political signal to the Council and to the Member States: the European Parliament wants consistent and coherent progress under the third pillar and does not want unambitious initiatives that appear to focus all their energy on winning media approval. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although this Danish initiative seeks to establish a system of information-sharing between the Member States on disqualifications issued against an individual in a criminal judgment, it does not, however, provide for any type of mutual recognition of sentencing for the purposes of its implementation. I have therefore supported this report and agreed with rejecting the Danish initiative as the rapporteur proposed and as the specialist parliamentary committee accepted. In fact, this initiative only concerns the creation of an information-sharing system between Member States, and this instrument lacks genuine operability in the fight against organised crime because the initiative does not seek to create, at the same time, any mutual recognition of sentencing with a view to its implementation, which is a prerequisite for the disqualifications it is seeking to achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Important Commission proposals both before and after 11 September 2001, primarily the package of measures to combat terrorism, remain blocked in the Council or are still awaiting transposal or ratification by the Member States. Unable to achieve the consensus necessary in the Council, or to honour their commitments in national legislation, the Member States are using and abusing their right of initiative. We have received a plethora of outlandish proposals, by which I mean proposals that do not form part of any plan and did not feature in the Commission’s ‘scoreboard’.

<p class="contents">The number of people who have taken part in the Erasmus programme since its inception will exceed one million during the academic year 2002 to 2003. A total of 30 countries presently take part. I welcome the fact that the European Union is now putting in place a charter for Erasmus students which will be available to all students in 2003. This charter spells out responsibilities and entitlements, such as full recognition by the home university of academic achievements, as well as credits to be obtained by students during their term on Erasmus. It is the goal of the European Commission and Parliament to reach two million participating students by 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also ensure that, while they are abroad, students continue to receive education grants from their home Member States and that the Erasmus programme is not exclusive to those who can afford it. The Youth for Europe programme has been very successful in encouraging more exchanges between students. We should encourage further development of this area, in particular for those who are disadvantaged. It should also be pointed out that the Socrates programme has already been extended to cover the period 2000 to 2006 and EUR 1 850 million has been allocated for this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as a result of the Court of Auditors' decisions, we must ensure that our accounting and delivery practices are better, to ensure that all students can benefit not only from a tremendous academic achievement but also from a cultural experience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Court of Auditors highlights design weaknesses (Socrates is excessively complex, resulting in different interpretations and problems between the Technical Assistance Office and the national agencies) and shortcomings in implementation (delays, management shortcomings, suspicions of fraud, seven cases referred to OLAF) and evaluation. Evaluation reports were delayed and there were so many irregularities that the Court of Auditors found it hard to come to a judgment as to whether or not the programmes’ objectives had been realised, while the mid-term report on the Youth programme was produced by a company owned by a former director of the TAO.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion contains worthwhile comments and proposals. It calls on the Commission to act on the Court of Auditors’ recommendations, including its recommendation to replace the TAOs by Community public-law agencies. It also calls for any ‘framework’ contracts with external bodies to be phased out and for monitoring and evaluation to be awarded to public bodies. There also appears to be some doubt as to the efficacy of the programmes themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">These positive comments, however, are simply ways of improving programmes which, as we have stressed time and again, have been designed for purposes which bear no relation to their lofty titles. These programmes aggressively impose the Euro-unifying education model in the field of education and youth and are designed to familiarise young people with so-called European ideals.</p>
<p class="contents">Having taken all these factors into account, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from voting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the shortcomings highlighted by the rapporteur and by the specialist parliamentary committee, not least the inadequacies of the programmes’ development and administration, for which some suggestions have in fact been made, it must be acknowledged that a take-up rate of around 90% enables us to see the great importance and consequently, the considerable success that this type of programme has had, is having and will have in enriching and developing both future generations of Europeans and in contributing to lifelong learning, which is becoming increasingly necessary. I therefore agree with maintaining these programmes and the budgetary approach that is proposed, because it is of crucial importance that we continue to promote the creation of a European educational area through informal educational experiences amongst young people, including physical mobility in particular, to promote lifelong learning, foreign language learning, greater use of new technologies in education and to promote cooperation at European level between the various Education providers concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Paragraph 5(2) proposed that the ratification procedure for a future constitution should be designed in such a way that a ‘small minority’ of Member States should not be able to oppose ratification. That is unacceptable because this veto is one of the constitutional cornerstones of the EU. We believe it would have been very unfortunate if the European Parliament had signalled to the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference that, as proposed by the report in its original form, a minority of a third of the EU Member States could be ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we wish to point out that it would not be especially appropriate to demand that future constitutional proposals from a Convention could not be changed by the European Council without the Convention’s approval. The Convention’s democratic representativeness in such a case cannot be seen to be greater than that of the governments.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to emphasise that, even though we are in principle in favour of extending the codecision procedure and the procedure whereby decisions are taken by qualified majority to include all legislation, we believe there may be a requirement for unanimous decision-making where foreign and security policy is concerned. We also wish to point out that codecision in connection with the procedure laid down in Article 139 should not mean any restriction in the ability of the two sides of industry autonomously to reach agreements. Codecision must not lead to a shift in current procedure whereby the material content of agreements is examined, something that would not be the role of the legislative authority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Convention’s efforts to bring about a uniform decision-making structure based on codecision and the Community model within a combined ‘constitutional treaty’ amount to important changes with a view to democratising the EU’s decision-making process and making it easier to grasp. The report contains sound proposals for new terminology aimed at clarifying the ways in which the EU’s legal instruments work and at making the decision-making process more easily accessible. The report makes it clear that the EU can only act in areas delegated by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Those areas that the Member States choose to delegate are characterised by the clear added value entailed in cooperation as distinct from the Member States’ acting individually, especially with regard to the internal market and the joint combating of serious cross-border crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is unclear regarding whether treaty changes should only be based on the outcome of the Convention and whether future conventions need to approve possible changes by intergovernmental conferences to the conventions’ recommendations. An obligation on the part of future intergovernmental conferences to comply with the Convention would fundamentally alter the relationship between the EU and the Member States. The requirement of unanimity in the case of treaty changes must be maintained. The ratification processes must be respected and continue to operate as they do at present. What is also unclear is whether it will be possible for the proposed laws supplementary to the constitution, based on decision-making by qualified majority, to determine how the EU is funded in future. The funding of the EU must be decided upon unanimously. The Moderates are opposed to proposals that may lead to the EU’s being funded by EU taxes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Taking Europe further along its current path, this method would distance the Member States from the European decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our Luxemburgish fellow Members, Mr Poos, former Foreign Affairs Minister for his country, and former President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, has written to Mr Bourlanges to tell him this. Stating ‘that no Member State will agree to a change to fundamental law being imposed on them against their will’, he adds: ‘the citizens of States thus made a minority will reject a Europe with vague authoritarian ideas. As many successive constitutional changes are made, an increasing number of Member States could be reduced to the status of vassal states. We can imagine the result in terms of adhesion to the Community project’.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, the adopted resolution contained a more vague passage on this point, but the intent remains. In any case, the spirit of this proposal is more widely present in the idea of the report (and the Convention) to make codecision with a qualified majority in the Council the rule, without counterbalancing it with any national veto system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It consequently advocates extending the use of qualified majority voting in the Council with the communitarisation of a greater number of policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution also strives to change the method of amending the Treaties and advocates the institutionalisation of the ‘convention’ method with increased powers, laying down different amending processes – making a distinction between what is known as the ‘constitutional’ part and the ‘policy’ part – and opening up the possibility of the national parliaments no longer being able to play their full role in ratifying the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we welcome the withdrawal of this resolution, as proposed by my group, from the point where it recommends the end of decision-making by unanimity in the Council for any revision of the Treaties (when what is at stake are issues as crucial as the decision to transfer national competences to the EU), the resolution envisages an EU legal system that takes precedence over those of the Member States, thereby increasing the powers of its supranational institutions.

They have emerged over the course of fifty years via treaties, ordinances and directives, with the Court of Justice having to act as arbiter. It is unclear to the citizens of Europe who is responsible for those rules, how far-reaching they are and how they can be changed. In the EU, ordinance is the name for direct legislation at the most centralised level, while the same term is used in the Netherlands for rules established by municipalities and provinces within the scope allowed by national legislation. The word ‘directive’ creates the impression that these are non-binding recommendations, hence well-meaning advice. In reality national parliaments are forced to establish corresponding legislation within two years, so that the essence of the decision to be taken there has already been established before public discussion of its desirability can get under way. Anyone wanting a European superstate with lots of centralised legislation will be given an excellent overview by the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges of the relation between constitution, ordinary legislation, programme legislation, framework legislation, organic legislation and financial legislation. I do not support his intentions, but I do support his clarity. He quite rightly wants executive measures of the European Commission to be submitted for the approval of this Parliament if we register an objection within three months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The hierarchy of legislation he proposes (constitutional bloc, organic laws, ordinary laws) is nothing more than an exact copy of that laid down by the French Constitution of the Fifth Republic. Furthermore, insofar as the hierarchy of legislation necessarily implies a hierarchy of functions and bodies, the rapporteur does nothing less than set out a new Community architecture that reproduces the Member State’s constitutional model at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">As with any exercise of this kind, institutional mimicry does, however, have its limits. Is it really appropriate to attempt to transpose to Community level the constitutional model that is common to the Member States? The answer is clearly ’No’.</p>
<p class="contents">What the rapporteur is forgetting when he substitutes European law for current legislation, obviously requiring the extension of the codecision procedure in doing so, or when he mentions a reform of the procedure for revising the Treaties, is that the Union, even equipped with an identical political system to that of the Member States, will always lack the essential factor: democratic legitimacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One could hardly agree more with the rapporteur’s observation that we are facing real legislative, procedural and linguistic chaos; and even more so when he says that the inconsistency between the various categories of legal acts of which this system comprises is making it unintelligible to members of the public, even the most well informed about legal issues. The current framework ignores any principle for designating legal acts and is based on terms that are frequently obscure and sometimes misleading.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I could not support the report when, in political terms, it seeks to take advantage of this need to establish a coherent typology of Community laws and a logical hierarchy of acts – a legislative necessity – in order to move forwards in the ‘long march’ of the highly debatable federalist and constitutional doctrine, presuming that a ‘de facto’ sovereign European State with constituent power already exists and goes so far as to omit any reference whatsoever to national parliaments or actually proposing to end the procedure based on the Treaties themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that giving the Community legal system coherence and clarity by no means requires imposing a federal legislative framework and this is something we all know.

It is also to be welcomed that it insists on the immediate removal of all products falsely labelled ‘Not Irradiated’ when this claim has been disproved by the appropriate tests. It should be remembered that the precautionary principle must always be observed.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is that any technology needs to prove the benefits of its use and take account of the potential risks to health and to the environment, given that food-irradiation technology is highly problematic. In fact, on the basis of a civilian use of nuclear energy, this appears to have no other use apart from replacing the normal hygiene and safety rules that processed foods should already follow. There also appear to be no benefits to consumers because, apart from the risks of improper use, with the possibility of poisoning, irradiation makes it more difficult for the consumer to discern the true state of the product.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the overriding aim of this technology appears to be something else – speeding up the liberalisation of international trade and increasing the centralisation/concentration of the mass production and distribution of foods throughout the world, with consequences for the delocalisation of agri-food production and for the decline of small-scale local farmers, thereby calling sustainable development into question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is an important report because it endorses some firm points of reference in the problematic area of the prevention of this terrible disease. First and foremost in that it calls for emergency vaccinations to be made a priority to control any future spread of the disease, in addition, of course, to calling for a ban on imports from third countries in which foot and mouth disease is endemic and for much more decisive measures to combat illegal meat imports, which we believe are the most likely cause of the entry of the disease into the European Union. Secondly in that the report urges the European Union to change its current policy of vaccination being a last resort. In the event of any future outbreak of the disease, vaccination with a view to keeping the animals alive must be considered right from the outset, along with the immediate need to slaughter the animals in the infected farms and avoid contacts which are widely known to be dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community should be able to play a fundamental role in defining the strategy for controlling foot and mouth disease. Indeed, we support the call for a shift of emphasis in European Union policy away from purely commercial considerations.</p>

Quite apart from the tragic consequences for farmers, the effects of this catastrophe and the urgent sanitary measures implemented have reached far beyond the agriculture sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The report highlights a number of factors that exacerbated the situation: livestock farming and the agri-food sector were subject to the demands of importers and exporters and the race for world market domination; European sanitary directives were not transposed into national legislation; veterinary border controls were sometimes insufficient, despite the tremendously high value of the interests at risk; and there has been a continuous reduction in the number of veterinary surgeons.</p>
<p class="contents">However, although it highlights the aggravating factors and ‘failures’ on the part of the authorities (which some amendments attempt to conceal), this report fails to challenge the general financial principle of ‘commercial breeding’, the principle of the pursuit of capitalist profit. This is precisely why, in order to avoid losing their position in the world marketplace, the authorities decided to prohibit prophylactic vaccination at European level, even if it meant resorting to mass slaughter in the event of an epidemic.</p>

We must, however, stress the connection between outbreaks of animal diseases, such as BSE, foot and mouth etc., as well as other food safety risks, such as dioxins, sewage sludge, etc., and the concentration and intensification of production as the consequence of adhering to a farming model based on exports and on liberalising agricultural markets, and which has therefore preferred culling to vaccination.</p>
<p class="contents">We need only think of the irrationality of promoting the transport of live animals, with the centralisation of markets and the closure of local slaughterhouses, which increases the risks of these outbreaks spreading, especially in an internal market with no borders between Member States. Instead, what we really should be doing is promoting the localisation of production, the creation of local slaughter units and veterinary centres with greater decentralised resources and local and regional markets, limiting as much as possible the transport of live animals, and undertaking more thorough monitoring, even at the internal borders of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">We insist on the need for a ‘ring’-style vaccination to be allowed and on the restarting of research, which has all but ground to a halt due to the ban on vaccination. Inspection services should also be strengthened, especially in the most isolated rural areas, and ‘blind’ culls or slaughter should be avoided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It groups together all the players (public authorities, agriculture sector, citizens) and involves them early on in the debate, in particular with regard to the establishing of early warning systems. These early warning systems, once set up by the Commission, should benefit visibly from monitoring and increased control of their operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Information on the risks and appropriate measures must be distributed and included. All the Member States must also, as we are requesting, carry out regular farm inspections in order to ensure that the general rules on sanitary control and biosecurity are effectively understood and applied. Failure to do so will incur penalties which are in proportion with the breaches observed.</p>
<p class="contents">Although farmers are given substantial responsibility in the measure, all too often increases in the amount of livestock for income are perceived as an essential factor in the risk of an epidemic. International trade, however, is also a factor that should be taken into account. I am also pleased that my fellow Members reacted favourably to my proposal seeking to prohibit the introduction of products destined for tax-free warehouses or the provisioning of ships from countries not authorised to export to the EU. Today, this meat that could carry a risk of foot and mouth disease can be taken to these warehouses within the Union itself.</p>

<p class="contents">However, there are some aspects in the report which need clarifying. Firstly, the culls were carried out in accordance with legal provisions and in full consultation with the European Commission. Secondly, the number of animals slaughtered should reflect farmers' claims for 6.5 million – not 10 million. Thirdly, there have been no prosecutions for breaches of animal welfare legislation nor was any environmental harm identified by the Environmental Agency. Fourthly, there was no evidence of a spread of infection from carcasses during transport or by personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that these points were not sufficiently clarified in the vote, whilst welcoming those provisions seeking to combat any future outbreak of FMD, I decided to vote against the final vote on the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Kreissl-Dörfler's report provides important guidelines should future legislation be required to tackle a new outbreak, were it to occur anywhere across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, reject a number of the report's observations and conclusions which are incorrect, in particular those relating to the legality of culls, suggested breaches of animal welfare legislation, suggested breaches of environmental legislation and suggested bio-security lapses. Given that farmers have claimed for 6.5 million animals, I also reject the claim that 10 million were killed during the outbreak.</p>

<p class="contents">No control on imported products, however, could ever be as comprehensive, precise and rigorous as those applied by Member States and professional bodies themselves. Controls on imports will never provide the same safety guarantees as regular controls and traceability applied to national production and localised production in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This should further encourage us to apply Community preference effectively and keep as much of our agricultural production as possible within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Community preference, which is laid down at the heart of our Treaties, must, in future, be our favoured means of satisfying new consumer requirements in Europe in the area of food safety. This is yet another reason to defend it vehemently to the WTO and ensure that our right to make imported products bear the cost of the controls we need to carry out on them is respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
