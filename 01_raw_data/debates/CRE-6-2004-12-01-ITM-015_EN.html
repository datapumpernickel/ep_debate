May I also congratulate your rapporteur, Mr Coelho, on his valuable contribution to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Before presenting my remarks, I wish to recall the context of the Commission's proposal. The primary objective of the Member States was not only to improve the quality of documents, but also to establish a reliable link between the holder and the identity document. The aim of this approach was to minimise the dangerous trend of the production of counterfeit documents, which are used to enter the territory of the EU illegally. The approach was confirmed by the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">In September 2003, the Commission presented two proposals introducing biometric identifiers into the uniform format for visas and residence permits for third-country nationals. On 18 February 2004, the Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation on common standards and biometrics in EU citizens’ passports as we were convinced that we cannot only secure documents related to third-country nationals. Otherwise mala fide foreigners could abuse less secure European passports. In its proposal for biometrics in passports, the Commission provided for one mandatory biometric identifier, the digital image, and left the second biometric identifier, fingerprints, optional. When drafting the proposal on passports the Commission was fully aware of the sensitivity of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand the EU has to suggest measures enabling Member States to strengthen security and the protection of their citizens; on the other hand the Commission has to take data protection and privacy concerns into careful consideration. At the Council of 25 October 2004, the questions as to whether the second biometric identifier, the fingerprint, should be integrated in a mandatory way, and what the implementation data for the regulation should be, were discussed again. Ministers reached a unanimous political agreement that the first biometric identifier, the facial image, should be implemented at the latest within 18 months and the second biometric identifier, should also be mandatory at the latest 36 months after the adoption of the technical specifications.</p>
<p class="contents">This political decision could help Member States to issue identity documents capable of establishing a reliable and direct link with all others. In this context it is equally important to underscore that the two biometric identifiers, digital image and fingerprints, should be used to reduce the production of counterfeit documents, not to interfere in the private lives of EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the timing, the European Council in its conclusions on terrorism of 26 March, set the end of 2004 as the date for the adoption of the proposals and the technical specifications. We are actively moving things forward. Our technical committee has made an early start on its preparatory work on the technical aspects regarding the integration of the biometric identifier into the visa and the residence permit. Also, the measurement work for the passport has already been completed.</p>
<p class="contents">The technical specifications have to be adopted by the Commission via the comitology procedure after the Council has adopted the regulation, which constitutes their legal basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the 19 amendments tabled by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are primarily concerned with data protection issues. They are also concerned with reviewing the comitology procedure, so that Parliament and the authorities responsible for data protection are involved in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Article 29 Working Party for the Directive was consulted on the proposal, and most of the amendments relating to data protection were already taken on board during the Council’s work. Nor can the Commission endorse these amendments: either they were incorporated into the version under discussion at the Council, or some of them do not comply with the legal basis, which only covers the security characteristics of passports.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards revising the comitology procedure, the amendments cannot be accepted, because this procedure is the result of an interinstitutional agreement and a Council decision in 1998-1999 laying down the general procedure applicable to committees. These instruments also lay down Parliament’s right to participate and I do not see how there can be any derogation from these.</p>
<p class="contents">A further amendment has been tabled today during the plenary session by the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. It concerns the second biometric identifier to be integrated into the passport, namely fingerprints. In its proposal, the Commission had left it to the Member States’ discretion whether or not to take their citizens’ fingerprints, insofar as some of them did not want to adopt such a policy at that time for political reasons. Nevertheless, the Council unanimously decided, on 25 October 2004, to make fingerprints similarly compulsory at the latest 36 months after the adoption of the technical specifications.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers, in fact, that this unanimous decision clearly symbolises a new political will to harmonise across the Member States the ability to ensure – on the basis of elements such as fingerprints, which are more reliable than simple digital images – that identity document holders are the individuals referred to therein. This approach, in other words, has in fact overridden the initial proposal, which made fingerprints optional. EU Member States have in fact shown their political will to have two biometric identifiers. In other words, they have, politically speaking, chosen between the two options.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I feel that joint effort on the part of all the institutions is crucial to step up security in the Union, whilst ensuring that the legitimate rights of law-abiding citizens are respected. I am grateful to Parliament for expressing its opinion so promptly. This will make it possible for the regulation to be adopted by the end of the year and for us to keep to the timetable set by the Council in March 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must all work together to find solutions to the dangerous times in which we live. There is no point in burying our heads in the sand. It is crucial that we strengthen our citizens’ security, and yet we must do this without compromising essential freedoms, including the right to personal data privacy.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal before us today was submitted to Parliament in February 2004 and is the result of a coherent approach towards biometric identifiers involving harmonised solutions on national documents from third countries, on EU citizens’ passports and on the Visa Information System and the second generation of the Schengen Information System. Increased security in travel documents and the integration of biometric identifiers will help in the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration, and will lead to increased security in the exercise of freedom of movement. The best way to prevent the use of false identities is to check whether the person presenting the document is the genuine holder or not. New technology offers many benefits when it comes to identifying individuals and preventing counterfeit documents. We must combat what is known as ‘visa-shopping’<span class="italic"> </span>and identity misuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is entirely justified in the importance that it attaches to data protection. A balance must always be struck between the need for security and respect for individual rights and freedoms recognised by national and Community laws. This is an essential and <span class="italic">a priori</span> condition for adopting the use of biometric identifiers.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore fully endorsed the proposed amendments tabled in the letter from the Article 29 Working Party and I emphasise the need for measures relating to access; in other words, who is entitled to access and for what purpose. The Member States must draw up a list of the competent authorities, of guarantees relating to people who cannot provide certain of the selected biometric data, such as fingerprints, as in the case of burn victims or amputees, and of guarantees to the effect that when border checks are carried out and a false rejection occurs, the citizens concerned will be informed of the reasons for such a rejection and of the means to be employed in order to clarify and rectify the situation as quickly as possible. Lastly, new functions must be granted to the supervisory authorities in this area, along with an increase in the resources needed to carry out those new functions.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to mention the four questions that are crucial to the adoption of this report. Firstly, there should be one sole objective for the use of data. It must be made clear, with no room for doubt, that data may be used solely for the purpose of identification and under no circumstances for the purposes of covert identification or surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the question of the database. The report that I am presenting to you categorically rejects the idea of setting up a centralised database. Biometric data must be stored solely on the passport. It is not necessary to set up a database to ensure a more reliable link between the passport and its holder; the risk of function creep – the use of data for other purposes than originally envisaged – is too great. I wish to state categorically that nowhere in the Commission’s legislative proposal or in the current Council text is there a proposal to set up a database. There was a reference in the explanatory statement to the notion that this may be considered in the future and, for this reason, we suggest that Parliament’s position be made clear straightaway.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the technical solution chosen: the technical specifications should be sound, as it is those specifications that determine whether the biometrics will work or not. We cannot run the risk of rushing into solutions that are later found to be poorly prepared, technically outdated, or too costly. This would damage the citizens’ trust. One key question, Mr Frattini, is that the most delicate part in terms of data protection is not a matter of which principle is chosen, but the way in which it will be implemented. We therefore propose that the experts viewing the technical specifications from a data protection point of view should have the opportunity to evaluate the technical specifications and raise any issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth and last point concerns amendments to the initial proposal. At its meeting of 26 October, the Council decided to proceed with the amendment to make fingerprinting compulsory; it had previously been optional. From a political point of view, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs had already adopted, by a large majority, the introduction of both biometric identifiers, with the sole difference that it left the adoption of the second to the Member States’ discretion. All reservations were raised with the Council and it was the Member States themselves who opted to dispense with that discretion and to choose both straightaway.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that there should not be any objections to Parliament voting in favour of this report. In so doing, Parliament will be making its position clear on the issue and underpinning the guarantees that we always want to see safeguarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to welcome Mr Coelho’s report – it is an excellent piece of work. On behalf of my Group, however, I have to state that we are not happy that there has not been time for Parliament to be reconsulted on the new proposals from the Council. We have concerns – although thankfully some of them have been met – with regard to the protection and integrity of data, verification by the passport holder of that data, the insertion of any corrections necessary, and restrictions on the use of the passport and the data.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that our citizens want freedom of movement not only within our borders, but outside those borders too. We must therefore be realistic in our approach and ensure that biometrics in passports ensure free and virtually unrestricted movement across borders so we can focus on and combat organised crime, traffickers, drug barons and terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one particular fear that arises from this, and which has frequently been discussed in our debates, is that of the capture of data. In this area we must be extremely vigilant. Access to data must be carefully regulated by national legislation in accordance with the provisions of Community law, European law and our international agreements. Biometrics in passports must reinforce privacy and civil liberties and must not be used as a catalyst to assault fundamental freedoms and rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I welcome the protection of citizens’ rights and freedoms as contained in Articles 2 and 3 of the Council document agreed on 23 November 2004. I commend Mr Coelho’s report and in particular Amendments 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, which reinforce citizens’ rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should firstly like to thank Mr Coelho for his report on the Council’s proposal to include biometric data in identity documents, which from a liberal point of view was on the whole balanced and justifiably critical. I believe that Mr Coelho, in his report, made reference, without hesitation and with the necessary clarity, to the issues that remain unclear, whether these issues involved the guarantee of data protection or the remaining uncertainties with regard to the technical procedures for storing the data on the identity documents. Further to Mr Coelho’s comments, I wonder why it has not again been clarified as to which costs will be incurred by the inclusion of biometric data in identity documents, before the Council presses forward and takes a decision? The question must also be asked as to whether this is financially responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, however, seriously annoyed, as the lack of clarity over some of the contents leaves me no option but to ask myself how much attention the Council really pays to such a serious issue. I am not necessarily talking about technical issues. In this connection, I have to ask myself – and this is something that was referred to by Mr Cashman – how the Council defines its relationship with Parliament. After the relevant committee issued its opinion on the proposal, the Council presented us with an amended proposal, with amendments which were clearly more than merely editorial or cosmetic changes. The original Council proposal provided, as mentioned by Mr Frattini, for the mandatory integration of a biometric feature in EU citizens’ identity documents, with the way in which this was to be implemented being at the Member States’ discretion. The new proposal we have before us is quite different. This gives rise to two questions, to which I would ask the Council to respond; why have these amendments been made after the relevant committee had discussed the proposal? The Commissioner’s answer implied that the subsidiarity principle was being circumvented here, as a number of Member States had no interest in implementing the proposal. The other question – and I know that my time is nearly up, but I have one more question I should like answered – is: what kind of way is this to act? Parliament is being threatened with ...</p>

The Commission has not yet provided Parliament with the requested information on the scope and seriousness of the problem of false documents, the results of previous improvements in document security and the error rate of the various biometric options, in particular the lack of reliability of fingerprints, the intrusive nature of their use and the risk of misuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday the Chairman of the Article 29 data protection working party sent a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in which he pointed out that the working party does not have enough information on which tests have been conducted, what their outcomes were, or on which basis the Council decision had been taken. Therefore the working party expressed its reservations as to the use of biometric procedures that have not proved efficient, in particular the compulsory use of biometric features such as fingerprints.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Verts/ALE Group, it is clear that the introduction of two biometric identifiers can represent a threat to security through risks of abuse, technological flaws and lack of transparency and data protection. We are therefore suggesting that only one biometric identifier be integrated, namely a digital photograph in visas, residence permits and passports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider the report a democratic scandal. I turn firstly to its substance. What is, of course, at issue is whether it is fair to introduce biometric data, which in this case means fingerprints, into people’s passports. Yes, says the Council, and the report submissively concurs, of course, irrespective of the fact that these demands are synonymous with a huge extension of the police surveillance that the EU has been developing in recent years. The scandal consists in the fact that neither the report nor the Council’s decision contains any serious discussion of the relationship between ends and means. A number of significant encroachments upon people’s rights are to be introduced without the remotest evidence that these encroachments are of any use at all in achieving the objective. On the contrary, all the competent and expert bodies have been united in stating that there is simply no point in demanding biometric information in passports. The operation was successful, but the patient died, as we say in Denmark. In recent days, this scandal has taken on the character of a farce. The consultation of Parliament, ostensibly based upon Article 67 of the EC Treaty, is clearly inadequate, and a future Council decision would therefore be invalid. I adhere to the minority opinion, issued by myself and a number of fellow MEPs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was already apparent that biometric details would soon be included in passports, and Mr Coelho tried to subject this to a number of conditions in order to safeguard the privacy of citizens in any case, for which credit is due to him.</p>
<p class="contents">Even before the Commission had a chance to vote on this, however, the Council tabled its own, much more far-reaching proposal. In other words, the Council did not even have the decency to wait for Parliament’s recommendation. Judging from the subsequent course of events, it would appear that the Council wants to push its own opinion through at all costs, and is prepared to bring considerable pressure to bear on Parliament in order to achieve its goal. That is a very undemocratic attitude, certainly in view of the fact that passports directly affect every EU citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not harbour any illusions, though. I am convinced that the governments that are represented in that self-same Council will, in the national debates about this issue, point the finger at Europe once criticism gets underway; that, they will say, is what Europe prescribes. I do want to clarify, though, that this is not a European decision. It is a decision that the national governments enforce at European level, by capitalising on, or taking advantage of – whichever way you look at it – the democratic loophole that is still there.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very curious to hear the response by the minister responsible, but none was forthcoming. Let us hope that his response would have been less cynical than that of Mr Donner, the Dutch Justice Minister, in the Dutch Lower Chamber, to critical questions about this sequence of events. It was suggested to him that this was immoral, but, to his mind, it was simply politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The previous speakers have already drawn attention to the lack of cohesion in the democratic process where this issue is concerned. The decision to add a second characteristic was taken behind closed doors, and both the EP and the national parliaments were simply frozen out in the process. The Council has subsequently more or less blackmailed the European Parliament to push through a few decisions as soon as possible, even though this issue is a very fundamental one. I have to add that I very much regret the fact that there is no one from the Council present today to respond to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Frattini has said that this is a security measure and that we demand better passports. That is of course all very well and good, but we should not forget to add that we also have to consider the request of the United States that we should include one biometric characteristic. It has not asked for two, and it is therefore beyond me why this second characteristic should all of a sudden be added, certainly if the United States has no intention at all of doing the same. I would therefore ask you to support our amendment tomorrow to keep the second characteristic optional.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, looking through the proposals, I wonder whether these would really lead to an improvement in security or whether they represent a show of security, because, as you know, terrorists simply travel using their own passports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
