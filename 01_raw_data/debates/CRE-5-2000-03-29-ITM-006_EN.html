The first question one wants to ask is: is <span class="italic">The</span> <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> accurate this morning in forecasting that the Commissioner is about to answer our questions by saying that only part of the noise regulation will come into force, the part relating to the European Union, on 4 May. We believe that what the Commissioner is going to say is that the part relating to third countries, which should come into force from 2002, will not come into force and will in fact be suspended.</p>
<p class="contents">The Environment Committee is the committee responsible within the European Parliament for the original regulation on aircraft noise and we have watched with some dismay the reluctance of the United States to accept that the European Union is within its rights to insist on bringing the regulation into force by the due date.</p>
<p class="contents">The background to this is from our point of view continued prevarication on the part of the United States’ administration whose attitude has, in the past, given us insufficient guarantees that they are willing to negotiate seriously through ICAO to find a way out of our difficulties. The Environment Committee insists that we have every right, given the proximity of very many European airports to centres of population, to try to get lower noise levels from planes landing in Europe, no matter where they come from and who operates them.</p>
<p class="contents">Europeans should surely be able to legislate as they wish to protect the population of Europe, and give them the highest standards possible of noise protection. To put it at its crudest, how will we explain the situation to the people of Europe if, after 2002, they still hear noisy old planes from third countries, fitted with the hushkits we judge inadequate, clattering round our skies?</p>
<p class="contents">This is, of course, a difficult issue to discuss sensibly in a United States election year. We can understand that American politicians have little room for manoeuvre. I think, however, that the Commissioner may be about to announce to us that light is dawning and that we can see a way forward that will enable both sides to be satisfied and to allow sensible negotiations to continue for a global solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The first compromise put forward a little time ago seemed to many in the Parliament to be much too shaky. In effect the European Union would have suspended the whole regulation, and then the United States would have suspended its complaint to ICAO and negotiations would have gone forward. Or would they? The danger, it seemed to us, was that the European Union would have been left with absolutely nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">We look forward to what the Commissioner has to say, and I have to underline that it is very important that she should satisfy the Environment Committee and the Parliament, not least because if she is asking us to suspend the application of any part of the regulation, it will have to come through this Parliament by codecision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">So what is the crux of the matter? In 1977, agreement was reached at international level to replace old and noisy aircraft with more modern and quieter aircraft. The problems started when the United States decided, on a unilateral basis, to phase noisy aircraft out at a faster rate. This was an excellent idea in theory, but in order to keep the high cost of this down, the United States started equipping obsolete and noisy aircraft with expensive engine-muffling systems, known as hushkits. However, this was nothing more than an expensive con, given that studies at airports have shown that these hushkit aircraft are still relatively noisy. One of the reasons for this is that standardisation is based on unladen aircraft. What is more, the international agreement of 1977 was never intended to artificially prolong the life span of aircraft due to be phased out, or to transfer aircraft from chapter 2 to chapter 3.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The regulation is important if we are to take the problem of noise pollution seriously. However, it would be better still if the United States and the European Union could conclude firm and reliable agreements on noise standards for aircraft. To this end, we need to conclude an agreement with the United States whereby we commit ourselves to a concrete schedule for phasing out the noisiest chapter 3 aircraft, including the hushkit aircraft. At the same time, we need to agree on international standards for new, chapter 4 aircraft. In addition, we must avoid having a situation where aircraft that have served out their time in America are sold to countries which can fly these noisy aircraft to European destinations. As an absolute last resort, we will have to develop our own European standard, but clearly that would be a second best solution.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, there is no getting away from the fact that one of the key stumbling blocks in the conflict between the United States and the European Union, is that there is obviously no longer any basis for trust. This is evident from the mutual recriminations we are hearing. We need to restore this trust rather than fan the flames of suspicion.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">On that note, I would like to ask the Council and the Commission how they propose to deal with this matter. The resolution that has now been produced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy aims to clarify the position of the European Parliament. We need to find a way out of this impasse. There is willingness to do so on both sides; what we need now is to see this in action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As is clear, the regulation was adopted in order to protect the environment and the public. At the same time, however, it seems that the regulation affects the interests of the American aircraft industry. To show good faith, the Council and Parliament postponed the regulation’s entry into force by one year. Despite our positive attitude, the Americans for their part have shown supreme arrogance especially towards the European Parliament, calling as I said earlier for the regulation to be withdrawn at first and then, as a slight concession, speaking about indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, Mrs de Palacio was authorised by the Council of Ministers to negotiate with the US. I have no doubt that aside from being lengthy, those talks were also difficult. A time came when it seemed that some progress had been made, though far from anything that could be considered satisfactory, but in the end even that slight progress has vanished in the last few days, since the US has petitioned the ICAO under Article 84 of the Chicago Convention against the European Union concerning the regulation whose purpose, as I said, is to protect the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we wish to make it abundantly clear that we have no desire to create tensions with the US. We do not want a trade war, we want no problems in our relations, and we regard them as allies and friends. However, as they themselves would say, they must understand that ‘it takes two to tango’.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position, then, is as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">- firstly, our strategy must aim for global agreement on much stricter standards on aircraft noise;</p>
<p class="contents">- secondly, if there is no agreement, then it is clear that the European Union will have to act unilaterally; </p>
<p class="contents">- thirdly, we consider that the position of the United States, calling for withdrawal of the regulation or indefinite suspension of its implementation, is totally unacceptable;</p>
<p class="contents">- fourthly, we welcome the progress made within the Committee on Aviation Environment Protection towards gradually phasing out any noisy aircraft in circulation today;</p>
<p class="contents">- fifthly, we oppose any further delay in the regulation’s entry into force for aircraft of the Member States, and this because we regard the issue as an internal one and we cannot consider the Americans competent to determine what we do about our own aircraft,</p>
<p class="contents">- and sixthly, we are prepared to review Regulation (EC) No 925/99 on aircraft registered in third countries provided, however, that in the interim agreement is reached within the ICAO on new standards.</p>
<p class="contents">If good faith prevails, that agreement can become a reality. Meanwhile, however, there is no reason to suspend the regulation for third-country aircraft, for the very simple reason that the regulation concerning such aircraft only enters into force in 2002. In that sense I cannot understand the insistence of the US, who continually talk about the suspension of our own regulation. And, of course, we believe the US ought to withdraw their petition to the ICAO under Article 84 of the Chicago Convention, because that kind of action blows the spirit of cooperation sky-high.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I want to conclude with two respective observations. The first is this: it must be made clear who is negotiating on the US side. We know who our negotiator is, it is Mrs de Palacio, and to date she has proved a very good negotiator. As for the other side, it is not clear who the negotiator is. This is preventing us from having a stable position from the US, and is also thwarting our own efforts. The second observation is this: the US must understand that the European Parliament is no longer the body it used to be, in previous decades. It is now a powerful body. So they must understand that besides the Council, they must also talk to Parliament and take its views very seriously, because without Parliament there can be no progress. So if they want us to help them, they must first help us, they must first contribute towards progress by showing goodwill. With these thoughts, therefore, I would like to ask the Commissioner and the Council what their positions are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is all we know for sure. From then on we will have to see how we can carry on negotiating with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this regulation is very clear: to achieve compliance with what has been agreed within the ICAO, that is to say, that the aircraft landing at our airports genuinely conform to the noise standards of the ICAO. This regulation has no further intention, but I believe we need to be more ambitious. The current standards, as Mr Blokland has reminded us, date from 1978. Since then, world aeronautical technology has made great advances. Today, the noise levels of current aircraft can sometimes be 20, 40 or even 50 times lower than those of older aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore a question of achieving new noise levels as international standards within the ICAO. In this respect, we need to cooperate with the Americans who, after all, are our friends and allies.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that this regulation will enter into force soon does not mean that we do not have to carry on negotiating with the Americans with the aim of improving the situation with regard to noise standards within the ICAO. What can we negotiate? We can negotiate two things:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we are going to seek higher international standards within the framework of the ICAO, we are going to cooperate within the ICAO and we are going to seek a common objective, which will be to reduce noise at airports even further and thereby achieve lower noise levels, by applying more modern technologies, with a phasing out period for the most noisy aircraft with the establishment of a chapter 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Americans must suspend their complaint to the ICAO in accordance with Article 84 and we – this is something we could negotiate – could suspend the part of the regulation which refers to third country airlines; but certainly not in reference to European airlines, since that regulation enters into force on 4 May. In other words, with regard to European airlines, there is nothing more to say: we can only negotiate with regard to third country airlines – for which we have some leeway until 2002 – and we would have to suspend that part. Obviously, when we reach a new agreement within the ICAO, the Community standards will be adapted to the new ICAO standards, which, in any event, will be better than those laid down in the present regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Hatzidakis asked me who we are negotiating with and Mrs Jackson reminded us of the meeting they have had with Mr Slater, the Secretary of State for Transport. I have negotiated with many people from the United States administration. The only problem is that what is required – and I hope that at some point we will obtain it – is not only negotiations but also the confirmation that the preliminary agreements reached with the particular negotiator on duty receive the backing of the United States administration.</p>
<p class="contents">I have kept you informed promptly and with complete transparency throughout all this time. I am not going to expand on what the stages have been, since you are perfectly familiar with them. The last took place on Monday, with Mr Slater. Agreement could conceivably be reached on the basic ideas which I presented to him, and we will continue to work on it. Therefore, Mrs Jackson, what the Financial Times said is not true at all. Only if there is in agreement on the other aspects would I come to Parliament to ask for your support for a postponement with regard to third country airlines, for a suspension of the provision of the regulation in this specific respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, between us all, we can reach this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue was, of course, discussed at that meeting, which gave its full and unanimous support to the outstanding way in which the Commissioner has carried out this work and has conducted negotiations with the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to echo the Commissioner’s words about the Commission’s strategy for progressing this issue and to inform the House that in accordance with the opinion of the Council presidency and also of the Commission, this matter was discussed as part of a wider issue which we wish to address in this Chamber today, which is an area of fundamental importance for the future of Europe. That area is air transport and the environment, and how to overcome the challenges of sustainable development. The Council also heard a Commission communication on this subject yesterday, and I believe that it is becoming crucial to ensure that the hushkits issue is incorporated into a broader strategy for building a new Europe in this area.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If you do not mind, Mr President, I would also like to give a very brief account of the conclusions reached by the Council yesterday on this matter, including the issue of hushkits.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the development and early implementation of international noise standards, a decision that will be taken at the ICAO Assembly in 2001, as well as the establishment of transitional measures for phasing out the noisiest aircraft, which must meet the concerns of regions with higher environmental standards and those which suffer most from noise pollution.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the introduction of economic incentives to reduce the environmental impact of various aviation operations, bearing in mind the need to avoid distortions of competition, the special nature of operations involving peripheral locations, and the contribution of voluntary agreements with the aviation industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, development in the future, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, of guidelines for the sustainable development of airports, as an objective basis for the measures to be adopted by the competent authorities, taking into account the needs of communities living close to airports. It was the Council’s opinion that the measures to be adopted should, at the same time, ensure that a high level of safety is maintained, that there is fair competition, that the transport system works efficiently, and that there is equality of access to transport systems, taking account of the diversity of situations in the Union’s various Member States and regions, and above all, the requirements of economic and social cohesion. We believe that the issue of hushkits should be seen in the context of these principles, as otherwise we risk making the mistake of restricting ourselves to a single problem, although it is a serious one and one on which we must be firm. And we are being firm. The Commission is being firm and the Commissioner has stated here today that the regulation will come into force on 4 May. We must also be realistic, however, and create conditions in which the negotiations that the Commissioner is taking forward can succeed. To this end, the Council yesterday unanimously agreed upon the flexible framework essential for reaching agreement in these negotiations. Negotiation is the art of compromise and not the art of imposing one’s will. The United States cannot be allowed to impose their will – but neither can we. The presidency is convinced that we will achieve results and, once again, I would like to state before Parliament that we have complete confidence in the work that the Commissioner is carrying out. I feel sure that the formula that is reached will also have the support of this House, as it must if this problem is to be resolved once and for all.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament was unanimously in favour of this regulation at the time. The regulation was intended to provide EU legislation which would ensure that certified supersonic civilian aircraft are subject to new environmental stipulations.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore make no secret of the fact that I took great exception back then to the decision to defer the regulation. What is more, this deferral of the measures proposed by the EU came about at the request of the United States government, under threat – I might add – of an official complaint. </p>
<p class="contents">The negotiation process attending this regulation, which ensued at the request of the American authorities, was a drawn-out uphill struggle. I would like to offer my compliments to the Commissioner responsible, Mrs de Palacio, in this connection. She acquitted herself of her task admirably and gave her all to the matter at hand. In other words, we were not obstructive but we <span class="italic">were </span>firmly united in our willingness to introduce a regulation; under the terms of which, I might add, the United States would, in any case, have two more years in which to complete the phasing-out process.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I will also be speaking for many of my fellow MEPs when I say that we will lose credibility in the eyes of the electorate and the grassroots support if we spend tens of millions of guilders in our own Member States on pulling down and insulating housing in the vicinity of civilian airfields, whilst neglecting to tackle the root of the problem in an effective manner. I believe it is unacceptable that the people of Europe continue to be exposed to noise levels which are damaging both in financial terms and to health. That is why the PPE-DE Group intends to show a united front in its support for our own resolution, and hence for Mrs de Palacio’s policy. I also call upon the United States again to take our European legislation seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I did become a little perturbed on hearing the President-in-Office of the Council say that new conditions were introduced yesterday. I wonder what he actually means? It is either one thing or the other. The regulation should come into force now as far as we are concerned. After all, there is no conceivable way in which you can start dreaming something else up. That would be absolutely out of the question because we are past the adoption stage. Things went wrong on the legislative front last year as it was. If the European Parliament had approached the European Court of Justice at the time, then it would have been proved right. I have a feeling there is a little bit of backtracking and outmanoeuvring going on, which is completely unacceptable in a case such as this. We must support our Commissioner and honour the legislation that we ourselves have adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is much ado about a great deal. However loath I am to put things a little more into the right context, thereby perhaps disassociating myself somewhat from the President-in-Office of the Council, the point is: we are not talking about the environment here, which I am otherwise quite happy to discuss, as you well know, we are talking about health. What we are discussing today has very little to do with legislation on transport or the environment; on the contrary, we are legislating to protect people. Every scientist in the world, including the USA, has established over recent years that noise makes people ill. Noise makes people ill and therefore not only injures and stresses people themselves, it also damages the community as a whole, i.e. the national economy. That is something which many of us here wish to bear in mind, which is why we tabled this legislation. That is the only reason. That is what we wish to bear in mind, irrespective of the fact that, otherwise, we are, of course, always happy to integrate transport policy into other policy areas and environmental policy into transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation is in force, as everyone has said here today and, commendably, the Commissioner too has again made that quite clear. The last few times I have listened to you, Mrs de Palacio, I was most impressed by the very clear, very logical and very decisive manner in which you conveyed that. I welcome that and I congratulate you.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation is in force and I therefore wonder what the Council of transport ministers discussed yesterday. Basically, it has nothing to discuss, unless it wants to submit new legislation to us, which is obviously not the case. Mrs de Palacio said earlier that she will need Parliament’s support at some point for the second part of the regulation, the part relating to third countries, including the United States, South America and the countries of eastern Europe, i.e. all countries outside the European Union. That is the part which is due to enter into force in April 2002. But if you approach us, Mrs de Palacio, and want us to defer this part, then I think you will need to offer us more than you have at the moment, as you well know. If you go back and negotiate, then one thing must be made clear and I hope and believe that the House is relatively united on this question: it must be clear that we need a declaration of unequivocal standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be clear and united on where we want to go and what the ultimate goal is. I am not haggling over six months, but I do want clear objectives and we must have a clear timetable. If – and I say this now completely off the record, insofar as I can in a minuted debate – if, rather than April 2002, it were September 2002 or even January 2003, I would be the last to make a song and a dance about it, but I do want a clear, binding timetable to be adhered to by everyone concerned, including the USA. Once we have all this, then I should like to see it go through the general assembly of the International Civil Aviation Authority, the ICAO, in September.</p>
<p class="contents">If it goes through in September of next year, then we still have enough time to suspend the regulation. I am not prepared to consider a suspension without the conditions which I have just formulated. If that is, nonetheless, what you come to us with, then it will be possible, but it will have to go through the normal legislative procedure and then you will need Parliament’s support – even the United States of America must understand that – and then perhaps we can finish at the end of the day with another play which Shakespeare might have called “No ado about anything”!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that is a particularly sorry state of affairs. We must bring the new standard into force as soon as possible. It is in our interests to do so, but what we are lacking is commitment on the part of the Americans. That much is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">They have not given us their commitment, that is what makes us so suspicious. They have given it to us so often. On so many occasions they have half committed themselves and then backed off again, and so on and so forth. As far as I am concerned it is clear that the suspicion derives from the Americans’ lack of willingness to commit themselves to something that is inevitable. Only when they actually sign on the dotted line to this effect will we in the Union be able to help to move the situation on. We should not turn things round.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday we had a talk with the American Minister for Transport. It was my impression at this meeting, that in common with ourselves, Mr Slater is of the opinion that the hushkits are an issue of secondary importance which stands in the way of far more important issues, and that we must put this matter to bed as swiftly as possible. But there is a huge amount of suspicion on their side too. And so I think that it is time for a clear signal; but it must come from them in the first instance. What we need to hear from them is that they want to find a solution, not behind closed doors somewhere, but officially, on paper. It is not acceptable for them to ask us to defer our own regulations. Their future commitment depends on whether or not we are willing to defer. The complaint they have filed with the ICAO is in fact uncalled-for blackmail. I believe they should withdraw it. Mr Hatzidakis has said that it should be withdrawn and you have said that we should defer. I have tabled an amendment to the effect that they should definitely withdraw the complaint. I think we need to word what we currently have on paper a little more strongly. What <span class="italic">is </span>worthy of admiration, in my view, Commissioner, is that you are presently taking the same line as Parliament and, it would seem, the Council. That being the case, I think our position is stronger than that of the Americans at the moment, and we must do all we can to keep things that way as far as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are engine-mufflers for old and grimy aircraft that are mainly bought by developing countries and Eastern European countries. Parliament and the Council have decided that from 4 May onwards, the number of these noisy American machines permitted to land on European airfields will be frozen. This one aircraft firm obviously has such a strong lobby that the Clinton administration unquestioningly does its bidding. The US government has threatened to prohibit Concorde from landing in the US if Europe does not revoke this decision.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This threat came as such a shock to the fifteen Ministers for Transport and the European Commission, led by Commissioner de Palacio, that they wanted to make concessions to the Americans. Fortunately, Parliament has the power of codecision in environmental matters. That is why these concessions were not made.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">What happened is that the European Commission, mainly under pressure from Parliament, did not make enough concessions to the US government. That is why the Clinton administration decided last week to lodge a complaint about Europe with the ICAO. That was a big mistake. Ultimately, the US could even have Europe thrown out of this organisation. But we need not worry on that score, for it would then be much easier for us to push stringent environmental standards through. The situation is bound to simmer down in time though, and it will not come to that. Discussion will be less heated once the American presidential elections are over.</p>
<p class="contents">The political conclusion reached by my group is that Europe must frame its own policy when it comes to the noise and environmental pollution caused by aircraft, both new and old models. This is the European position we must thrash out in our negotiations with the Americans, particularly in view of the international negotiations due to take place in September 2001.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If we are to reach a compromise with the Americans, then surely the minor problem of the hushkits can be resolved as part of the overall package.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Keeping noisy aircraft out is one way to achieve this. We were right to lay down regulations to this end in the past: regulations that are better than those in other parts of the world and that imply a break with the era of the Tupolevs, Concordes and old, noisy aircraft with engine-mufflers.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In the US, the importance of profit still far outstrips that of the people and the environment they live in. One way of making a profit is to carry on flying old, noisy aircraft, or to sell these aircraft on to future Member States of the European Union. In retrospect, we have to admit that Europe sent out the wrong message to the US a year ago. We thought that postponing our own measures would help us to reach rapid agreement on restricting noise levels world-wide. The Americans, on the other hand, thought that we were no longer taking the matter quite as seriously and that we would be satisfied for the time being with less stringent noise level standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We have since learnt that there is no prospect of us reaching agreement either rapidly or easily. We can no longer harbour illusions about swiftly reaching an accommodation with the Americans, this year being election year. We may want to avoid a trade war at all costs, but what we are doing is likely to lead to precisely the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a choice between caving in to the United States or standing by the stringent demands that we drew up earlier on. It is no disgrace if the European Union continues to push for more stringent regulations than the US or the ICAO at international level. It is regrettable that in the run-up to this debate some individuals once again conveyed the impression that reaching agreement with the Americans is more important than environmental protection. I can only hope that any misconceptions arising from this will not stand in the way of us bringing clarity to the situation at tomorrow’s vote. Europe must be prepared to consult with America on joint, stringent environmental standards in the short term, but must not accept delays or give in to short-sightedness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now, I feel that the issue here is not which devices should be used in aircraft to reduce noise, for standardised procedures exist to control the levels of aircraft noise, but that the important thing is for the noise limits not to be exceeded. It does not matter whether this is achieved through the use of modified afterburners or other types of engine mufflers. What is important is that the limits which have been set to protect our communities are respected and that their observance is enforced by the competent bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No other course would be possible, because there is no legislative process which is fast enough to allow further changes to be made in May. What is crucial in our view is that noise protection regulations are right for our people, that we must protect people in the vicinity of airports and that American interests have not, in any case, been affected thus far. Individual interests of American companies may be affected, but the regulation does not enter into force for aircraft registered in third countries until 2002, which is why we must bite our tongue somewhat and choose our words carefully, Mr President-in-Office.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder if we should abolish this regulation as far as third country aircraft are concerned. It has not even entered into force. It is on the statute books but will not enter into force until May 2002. Why should we abolish it? I think that we should begin with a legislative procedure at the end of the year. Once agreement has been reached on global standards in the ICAO working parties, we can start to adopt these global standards in our regulation insofar as it relates to third country aeroplanes for the year 2002. If, during the course of the legislative procedure, which takes six months or a year, we receive an indication in September that these standards have also been adopted by the general assembly of the ICAO as they stand, we can conclude the legislative procedure well before May 2002. This was also what my fellow member was asking. We should not begin the legislative procedure under the slogan “suspend” but under the slogan “adaptation to new, jointly-agreed standards”. In this respect I think that Mr Slater should put his money where his mouth is, as we say in Hamburg. It is not enough for him to say that he wants to agree with us; as the Vice-President has called on him to do time and again, he must also say what noise reduction quality standards he wants to agree on. On that basis, Madam Vice-President, you continue to have our full support.</p>
<p class="contents">We admire you, because the Council has gone on the attack time and again, saying you should draw up a legislative proposal right away and give in to the Americans. You rightly said, the Americans are our friends but we will not be blackmailed when it comes to our own environmental protection. Stand by your guns, Madam Vice-President! If the Americans approach us on this matter, we are perfectly able in principle to start the legislative process the day after tomorrow. But I would advise that we wait for the first working results from the ICAO working party on noise protection regulations. Then we can start on a sound legislative process in the interests of all our citizens, because we want global standards which are more stringent that those we have had in the past.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Read (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt quoted from Shakespeare in her contribution and I would like to quote from Hamlet’s soliloquy: whether it is nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or by opposing end them. As chair of the US delegation here in this Parliament, I am only too well aware of the many slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that make up the trade disputes between the EU and the United States of America. But having said that, it is important to get each trade dispute in proportion. Every one of us would want to welcome the small indication of progress that comes after the meetings with Secretary of State Slater and Ambassador Morningstar. I say this knowing full well the massive pressures there are upon Congress in an election year. I do not want to be too critical, we know only too well as parliamentarians about electoral pressures, but it is worth saying that the pressures in the United States are not so much from the citizens, from the voters, but from the big business backers of both parties and both campaigns and that makes an enormous difference.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner and others have outlined the basis of possible discussions. I will not go through all those again, but just say that there is a need not only for a timetable to agree stringent noise standards but also to agree a timetable in which they should be implemented. Mrs Roth-Berendt has mentioned a target with which I will concur.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make one other brief point, because this dispute highlights the need for earlier and more forthright discussions about the many issues over which there are disagreements. The delegation for relations with the US is planning, as you probably know, a transatlantic legislators’ dialogue using video-conferencing techniques so that we can discuss and understand – and clearly the Americans need to understand – what the powers of this Parliament are, the positive powers and also the negative powers and also the importance of timing in our joint negotiations. We need to learn lessons on both sides but I very much hope that even at this late stage there can be some sort of resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do so not only because of the importance of the hushkits issue itself, although no one should underestimate the huge disturbance and the very real and significant health impacts from noise, but also because it establishes the principle of Europe setting its own regional standards. The hushkits issue is also widely seen as a first case of how aviation issues will be dealt with in the future by the new Parliament and the new Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very clear that ICAO standards need to be seen as a floor, not as a ceiling. It should be quite possible and right to go beyond them. This is a critical case because it is about how we face hard decisions about how to begin to make a deeply unsustainable industry a little less damaging. It is about how we put into practice the Treaty of Amsterdam on integrating sustainability concerns into all policy areas, even the very difficult ones.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder if we can use this conflict and these negotiations with the US to enter into a broader discussion about a proactive global environmental policy on air transport more generally. Hushkits are important but noise pollution is only one aspect of the environmental damage from the airline industry. It is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions and we know that it is deeply unsustainable. We need to be looking towards a new policy architecture to deal with all these questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was voted through the last Parliament without any debate. It is contrary to the principle of non-discrimination. It offends against the fundamental requirement for reasons under Article 253 of the Treaty in that there is no explanation at all in the regulation for the use of the bypass ratio of an aircraft engine as a criteria when internationally approved noise and emissions standards certification for aircraft engines already exist. It is contrary to the principle of proportionality and, most importantly, it is contrary to the rules of the WTO which require the use of performance standards, not design standards, as is the case in this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In whose interest was it to depart in this piece of fast-track legislation from tried-and-tested procedures and the practice of using objective performance criteria for environmental standards? This legislation rolls out the proposal made by Airbus at an Airbus-hosted meeting in Toulouse on 29 and 30 September and 1 October 1997, effectively commercially sponsored legislation. At that meeting the Members of the European Civil Aviation Council (ECAC) present were told by their legal advisor that they could not proceed under the ICAO Agreement as requested by Airbus and so Airbus persuaded the Commission to legislate where ECAC could not.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have legislation which threatens another transatlantic trade war – but that is another issue – which does not respect best environmental practice with performance criteria and which – surprise surprise – excludes aircraft using a modern US manufactured engine while permitting the continued use of the Rolls Royce engine which conveniently has a bypass ratio of 3.1.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Mr President, noise pollution affects 20% of our population, and 0.01% comes from aircraft. I fully support the necessary standards to protect the health and quality of life for our citizens. The strictest possible criteria to reduce noise and emissions from aircraft engines can only be achieved however by using performance criteria and not design criteria which is commercially sponsored and fast-track in anti-competitive legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental legislation based on design criteria, I put it to you colleagues, is without precedent, and for good reason. I would ask with respect that the Commissioner, in the interests of probity, satisfy herself fully as to the genesis of this regulation in question to ensure the impact of its roll-out on the aviation industry world-wide. I do not care whether it is America, Europe, China or Mars – world-wide is equitable.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, it should serve as well as possible the important environmental objectives it purports to achieve. I fully support the objective of the regulation and we must agree on a timetable to implement noise standards, but it must be one based on objective performance criteria and not design criteria. The integrity of this House demands detailed answers to questions which raise major doubts about aspects of a regulation upon which the motion before us is based and on which we will be asked to vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot imagine, Madame Doyle, that the Council was unanimous and this House almost unanimous in taking a decision based solely on the Airbus defence. No, there are thousands of residents living in the vicinity of airports who suffer considerable noise pollution. Obviously, this regulation offers them the best protection as things stand at present under current international legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mrs de Palacio, Mr Coelho, in my view, the postponement of one year served no useful purpose, for the simple reason that American interests – and when I say American interests I mean the interests of one section of American industry – are clearly interests which run counter to the general improvement of standards, even more so in the case of ‘hushkits’. There are only two things that will cause them to shift position: pressure from the European Union or pressure from their own public opinion for, unfortunately, the United States is a vast territory and the environs of airports are less badly affected than the territories overflown in Europe, which is, by virtue of its geographical layout, affected more seriously by such constraints. American opinion will therefore only be shifted significantly in turn if we first make it known in our capacity as Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">My regret is that this year’s postponement may have been seen by our partners as indicative of weakness in our position.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you, then, Mrs de Palacio, Mr Coelho, that we want to see firm negotiation. There are no grounds for suspending regulations. We might at best revise them, but we could do so only in one instance: if an international agreement makes it possible to improve the situation and to draw up an overall framework agreement. An overall framework does not mean evading the issue, as I began to doubt upon hearing the views of the Council. Do we in fact all agree on the idea that the framework agreement should apply to standards on sound levels and should not seek to cover too wide an area, which would tend to force us to accept a number of compromises regarding sound levels, at the expense of some other type of pollution, which probably deserves our attention, but not so much so as to warrant our ceding our argument.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our airport is very close to housing and, like 20% of Europe’s citizens, we suffer levels of noise from aircraft which health experts consider to be unacceptable. On 29 April 1999, the European Union adopted a Council regulation with a view to controlling and reducing the noise produced by subsonic aircraft engines, limiting in due course the use of silencers, which do not resolve the problem completely, and helping airlines to update their fleets with new generation aircraft which create less pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">This has pleased the powerful American firms, as aircraft manufacturers, but at the same time harms them because they are also owner-investors in thousands of leased aircraft in all the countries of the world. Since these aircraft are antiquated, it would be difficult for them to operate in Europe. Neither has the European Regulation been popular with the American manufacturers of aircraft engine silencers known as ‘hushkits’ and, therefore, the United States has announced commercial, financial etc. measures against the European Union unless we delay the entry into force of our regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that we must not be inflexible. We must offer an opportunity for dialogue and understanding, but in order for this to happen, the United States must agree to adopt certain approaches. At the next assembly of the ICAO, the United States must commit itself to the adoption of a new and more restrictive standard for aircraft noise, as well as to withdrawing its complaints and coercive measures. Only under these circumstances could we accept a delay in our regulation for third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are regulations, we put them in place. I was here at the first reading in the Parliament in Strasbourg. There were not very many of us here, a lot fewer than there are today, when we introduced these regulations in the first instance.</p>
<p class="contents">They are good regulations. There are going to be useful regulations and they are going to bring positive benefit to the people of Europe. That does not mean though that you should not negotiate. I was fortunate to have an opportunity to talk with Under-Secretary Slater yesterday along with a number of my other colleagues. They seem to be reasonable people who would be willing to talk reasonably with you about a better, long-term solution. We know there are better long-term solutions because we know our regulation applies only in Europe. Although it may have some spillover effect in the not too far distant future to third countries, we are not having a world-wide effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Your objective, Madame Palacio, is to get that world-wide effect. Your objective is to make absolutely sure that whatever agreement you come up with with the Americans secures new controls on aircraft noise world-wide out of ICAO in a clear timescale. It is not just a question of agreeing to the controls and the levels but also a timetable for implementation that makes us happy and satisfied in this Parliament. That is the mandate we are giving you here today. That is what we would like to see you come back with at some time in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime though, enforce and implement the regulations as we expect them to be enforced and implemented. Tell the Americans that if they want to talk in an atmosphere of confidence and trust and goodwill, the first thing they can do is to suspend their Article 84 complaint in ICAO. They do not have to withdraw it, they do not have to take it away, they just have to make sure it does not go on the agenda of the next meeting. Suggest that to them, Madame Palacio. Start the negotiations and then come back to us with a reasonable compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is essential as far as public health is concerned. Mrs Roth-Behrendt was quite right to point this out. The problem of noise pollution caused by aircraft is an important political issue, and this is also the case in my constituency in Flanders. We have some serious problems to contend with on this score, such as the extremely noisy aircraft that land at the airport in Ostend. The people in my country are also affected by the problems associated with the noisy night flights into Zaventem.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">There are four points I would like to bring out in this debate. Firstly, there must be a concerted, world-wide effort to produce more stringent noise standards for aircraft. Secondly, progress must be made in the gradual phasing out of the noisiest aircraft. Thirdly, our own Regulation 925/1999 on hushkitted aircraft must come into force in undiminished form. The fact that we deferred it for a year under pressure from the Americans is a scandal in itself. It was good to see the European Parliament put up a fight there. I welcome the position adopted by Mrs de Palacio, and I am pleased that the regulation will enter into force on 4 May. That is a positive development. Fourthly, I support Mr Sterckx in his analysis, when he talks about mutual distrust between the United States and the European Union. Mr De Roo was right to point to the pernicious influence exerted by the firm Pratt and Whitney. The ball is now clearly in the Americans’ court. They must withdraw the complaint they filed under Article 84 of the ICAO. I support the resolution that we are to vote on tomorrow and I appreciate the constructive approach taken by the Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yesterday we discussed this matter and I received the full support of the Council, for which I would like to publicly express my gratitude.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it should be made abundantly clear that our ambition must not be to conform to the ‘Hushkits’ Regulation, to the regulation on silencers. The regulation on silencers means nothing more than implementing the noise levels of 1978 and we are in the year 2000. We must go further. We must reach an agreement within the ICAO, and to achieve this, the support and cooperation of the United States is essential. The United States should not be the only country with which we cooperate, but we certainly must cooperate with the United States and with the United States in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">We must move beyond what has been reactive behaviour, that is to say, behaviour that has worked on the action-reaction principle, and move towards an approach which is ambitious and which looks to the future. In this respect, there are two issues we should be discussing: in domestic terms, we must talk about the communication on air transport and the environment which Minister Coelho referred to, which we discussed yesterday in Council and which involves many other things, apart from simply noise, such as emissions, and a series of other issues. With regard to the United States, we must try to find a form of cooperation that goes much further than current cooperation within the ICAO.</p>
<p class="contents">We must try to create a common transatlantic aviation area which is a regional area in which we can achieve greater integration of the markets on each side of the Atlantic, because it is a geographical area with similar levels of development and which has the highest level of air traffic in the world. Clearly, the tensions and confrontations involving the ‘Hushkits’ issue hinder this type of action. We must therefore try to reach an agreement which will allow us to overcome the current situation of conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make it very clear that the regulation on silencers comes into force on 4 May for European airline companies. There is nothing more to say about this. We have proposed to the Americans that, if they consider the definition of ‘bypass ratio’ to be a form of discrimination – and we think it is not – that we try to find a different definition. However, the United States have not wanted to enter into this type of discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation comes into force for European airlines on 4 May. Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, if we could reach an agreement with the United States to act jointly, in order to obtain lower levels and greater requirements in terms of aircraft noise emission, I would be prepared to make a proposal to this Parliament and the Council to suspend the provisions of the current regulation with regard to third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Sterckx has said, we must overcome any mutual distrust, we must overcome situations of confrontation and I believe that a gesture of this type, if backed on the American side not only by this commitment but also by the withdrawal, or even suspension, of Article 84 of the ICAO Convention, would be valuable if, in exchange, we manage to move forward together to achieve better international standards which will also be applied here in Europe, and which will allow us to go much further than we can go with this regulation on silencers at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all. Thank you very much, Mr President. I would like to thank you once again for your support and I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council on Transport and the Council on Transport as a whole for the answer they gave me yesterday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
