<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Garot </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Parliament"s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development intends to refer to the Commission the matter of the European Union"s deficit in vegetable proteins added to animal feedingstuffs and what is at stake strategically for biotechnologies in the European Union as a result of this situation. Several of my colleagues are due to take the floor after me this morning and will clarify the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out right away that it is estimated that the European Union fails to provide around 70 % of its internal consumption of these proteins. This therefore means that we are very dependent on US imports. I would remind you that this situation is the result of the concession made to the United States when the Treaty of Rome was signed on duty‐free soya imports into the Community. The situation has deteriorated with the Blair House agreement, which sets a quota for the production of oleaginous protein crops in Europe, and it could become even worse during the 2000‐2006 period.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, the provisions of Agenda 2000 will probably lead farmers to reduce their production of oleaginous protein crops in favour of cereals unless, of course, wise steps are taken to promote crops in the non‐food agricultural production sector. On the other hand, production capacities for amino acids, particularly synthetic lysine, are decreasing in Europe. In fact, we should be aware that European manufacturers are increasingly choosing to invest in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise this point, because the synthetic lysine produced in Europe is important in that it enables us to use the maximum amount of cereals in feedingstuffs, whilst working towards reducing our own protein deficit. However, we have to recognise in this connection that the redistribution of the cards between Europe and the United States with regard to lysine production is a matter of concern. For example, the cover rate of the US market has increased from 0 % to about 165 %, whereas the cover rate of the European lysine market decreased from 84 % in 1991 to 54 % in 1997, and is predicted to fall to around 38 % in 2002 if present trends continue. However, since it is likely that the maize used for starch production will continue to be sold in the United States at a lower price than that of Community cereals, it seems logical not only to preserve the present system of refunds which compensates for the disadvantage in relation to the United States, but to greatly reinforce the system.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would like the Commission to answer the following questions. How will the European Union reduce its dependence on protein imports and use the agricultural potential available in the 15 Member States? How will the present level of refunds be adjusted to take account of the use of cereal derivatives and the relaunch of intra‐Community lysine production? How does the Commission intend to promote on a more global level the expansion of the starch and biotechnology industries that could open up agriculture to new markets? The answers to these questions are of particular importance for us at the moment since the WTO negotiations are soon to begin.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liikanen, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (FI)</span> Mr President, the Commission maintains an active policy to reduce the Community"s dependence on imports of vegetable proteins and to increase the use of grain in cattle fodder. The Community agricultural policy reform, begun in 1992, has led to a substantial annual increase in the consumption of grain in cattle fodder of around 20 million tonnes and a significant reduction in the importation of cattle fodder and, in particular, vegetable proteins. In Agenda 2000 the Commission proposed to extend the 1992 reform for the specific purpose of boosting Europe"s agricultural competitiveness both in the single market and in external markets. The 15 % drop in the price of grain and the additional direct aid for protein crops should do much to achieve this aim.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always been keen to ensure that the starch and starch‐processing industries in Europe, and especially the biotechnology sector that uses starch and its derivatives as raw materials, remain competitive. Generally speaking, starch‐based industries have maintained a healthy position and have developed steadily. Protection from imports is assured with the application of appropriate customs duties. Exports, meanwhile, are enhanced by means of export subsidies, which make it possible to export a diverse range of products in their original state, or sometimes as highly processed starch products. Within the Community, sales of starch and its derivatives are promoted by means of production subsidies when such products are used in the sectors of industry which have no protection from imports, such as the chemical and pharmaceutical industry and the paper industry. These systems of aid mean that a significant and constantly increasing volume of products emanating from the starch industry and the starch processing industry reach markets in countries outside the Community as well.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Agenda 2000 programme, the Commission will continue to use tools to control these markets as long as there remains a significant difference between the global market price and that prevailing in the Union"s single market. These measures should guarantee that industries that use starch, and the biotechnology sector in particular, will remain competitive in the global markets.</p>

I believe that the examination of the impact on this industry, occupying what might still be called a small niche in the market, is rather important, which is why we owe a debt of gratitude to Mr Garot for putting his finger on the wound straight away and calling on the Commission to take the lead and do something positive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has just spoken of deepening and strengthening. The nature of his address, though complimentary in tone, was that of a declamatory statement of intent. We naturally want more than verbal declarations of deepening commitment; we also want assistance on a massive scale, which is why it is gratifying that the Commissioner responsible for financial policy is sitting in our midst. This massive assistance, of course, must include financial resources; however, the Socialists in the European Parliament do not place all their trust in public funding, but naturally rely on the free and socially controlled market too. That is why it is necessary that this market niche, this environmentally acceptable niche, should be established at long last as another supporting leg, as an additional source of income, for the agricultural sector. This additional supporting leg also has the merit of not entailing any further surplus production, but actually creates a means of promoting our market policies by replacing surplus production with alternative crops which may also serve as a substitute for mineral oil, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want to do in the European Union is to take this product out of its niche as a set‐aside option, to increase production and to place starch on an even footing with other agricultural products. But since we are part of a world market, we also have an interest in ensuring that, at the WTO negotiations which are due to begin in Seattle on 30 November, barriers to free trade are properly removed and that the European Union obtains the same sort of level playing field on which to operate in this market as it does in the other major markets. That demands a great deal of work, Commissioner. Not only do we need money; we need decisive action too. I know that our tasks at the WTO negotiations have been made far more complex and numerous by the results of the agricultural talks at the Berlin summit, some of which were far from satisfactory, but I assume that the Commission and the other representatives of the European Union are capable of robust defence of our interests in this area as well.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sonneveld </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, this oral question deals with the links between a number of important EU agricultural products, the high‐tech sector that uses them and the supply of vegetable protein fodder. The Blair House agreement also covered protein‐rich fodder in the form of processed oilseed extract, and was so restrictive that it held back the further development of the oilseed crop sector in the EU. In Agenda 2000, the Commission tried to overcome this problem by giving oilseed the same hectare premium as grain, a decision confirmed at the Berlin summit. This meant that the premiums have been decoupled for an entire group of agricultural crops: grain and oilseed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Commission whether we can now tell the United States – entirely in keeping with our current method of transatlantic communication on agricultural matters – that this aid has now been decoupled just as it has in the US, and that therefore the one million tonne oilseed extract restriction no longer applies. I am assuming that we do not need to wait for a full WTO millennium round agreement to regulate this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, will the cure not be worse than the disease for the future of the EU oilseed sector, and will the lower hectare premium not prove a strong disincentive to grow oilseed? Now that the Berlin summit has confirmed that a non‐food agricultural policy is to be pursued more energetically in future, does the Commission plan to do more to promote the use of biodiesel and biolubricants?</p>
<p class="contents">Next there is the issue of the relative price of cereals in the EU compared with the price on the world market. The EU starch industry is complaining that its products are becoming increasingly expensive in the EU compared with competitors who obtain their supplies of cereals on the world market. Will the industry"s position be helped by a further 15 % reduction in the price of cereals? When it proposed this price reduction, the Commission claimed that it would improve the EU"s competitive position, and this should also, and perhaps in particular, apply to the starch sector. Or will the sector simply have to learn to live with a price difference between cereals on the world market and in the EU because the EU currently has a shortage? In any event, the EU"s starch consumers are calling for an incentive to be given to secure the use of EU starch in future.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the price of cereals on the world market, I would like to ask the Commission whether prices for this product do not tend to be forced up by the application of marketing payments as in the United States. In the European Union"s recent study of US agricultural support policy, very little was said about this, whereas the current American farm bill has used marketing payments for almost all agricultural products as a very efficient way of increasing competitiveness. Are we not overlooking a very important support instrument here?</p>
<p class="contents">I would also just like to mention the balance between potato starch and cereal starch. I assume that the agreement reached in Berlin on this is being ratified, and I would like to ask the Commission whether the implementing regulation has been drawn up, because I think it is extremely important for the existing balance between the potato starch and cereal starch regimes to continue by maintaining the existing system of balancing premiums for the potato starch sector.</p>

My group too feels that is it particularly important for the balancing premium between potato starch and cereal starch to be maintained. It is vital that potato production should be maintained in various parts of Europe, and particularly in the north of the Netherlands, otherwise there would be a huge economic slump which would cost us even more money to resolve. So it certainly needs to be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express my support for the industrial use of agricultural products for non‐food purposes. I am pleased that Commissioner Liikanen is here at the moment, because I would like to make a suggestion that will cost nothing at all, which I am sure he will be delighted to hear. What if we made it compulsory in certain ecologically sensitive areas, for example in Finnish waters, to use products that can be made from agricultural products, such as plastics that can be made from starch and biolubricants that can be made from protein‐rich products in the south of Europe? This would create an enormous new market for these products and we would probably need to spend less on subsidies. I admit that these products might be a little dearer than the conventional ones, but the environmental benefits are so great that I think the Commission should come up with some definite proposals to give these products greater access to the European market.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wanted to ask something about the situation after Berlin. We all know that the Blair House agreement was not very advantageous for us. How confident is the Commission that the current proposals are compatible, in other words that we can grow as much as we want and the Blair House restriction no longer applies? Or are we going to have another trade dispute with the US in the WTO? I hope not, and I would like to hear what the Commission has to say on this point.</p>

<p class="contents">The origins of this delicate situation lie in the significant differences between the European Union and the world market in terms of the conditions of supply of agricultural raw materials. However, along with the starch industry in particular, the industry"s use of non‐food agricultural products in the cereals balance is very significant. Moreover, the industry is one of the cornerstones of the future development of biotechnology industries.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, compensation in the form of a production refund was introduced in 1986 – as Commissioner Liikanen mentioned earlier – in order to remedy the situation. However, when this system is applied, it unfortunately only partially compensates for the disadvantage, thereby weakening the position of European industry not only on the world market, but on our own market as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The disparities in glucose production costs for industry between the US and the European Union can frequently amount to between 30 % and 100 % of the cost price. It is impossible to overcome this through technological advances or greater productivity, particularly since the majority of European manufacturers are also at a disadvantage because of their size.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation raises the burning issue of European industry"s durability. In the last few years, several production units have closed their doors in Germany and Italy. In order to respond to greater demand, capacity is currently increasing but mainly outside the European Union, whether it be in the United States or in the newly industrialised countries, such as China, India or Brazil.</p>
<p class="contents">The European market is increasingly supplied from industrial areas outside the European Union. You only have to look at Eurostat"s statistics to see this. The depreciation of world prices means that the European Union can no longer maintain its trading position on the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">These converging trends demonstrate how unattractive Europe is. The main cause of this is the cost of starch raw materials and this comes on top of the other disadvantages affecting the industry, which I just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore make two demands at European level. The first is that the production refunds should be calculated on the basis of world maize prices, and not wheat prices, since the starch industry is based on the maize industry. Secondly, as our colleagues Mr Sonneveld and Mr Mulder just mentioned, we must also ensure that we maintain a certain balance between potato starch and the starch produced from cereals. Above all, we want the European Union to demonstrate an aggressive attitude at the international conferences in Vienna on the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">If we make some concessions to the Americans – as we now apparently should – particularly on the issue of wheat gluten, which is a sector where they are attacking us, and where we have not yet referred the matter to the WTO, we can harbour legitimate concerns. This battle must be won at the future WTO negotiations; it is essential for the future of our biotechnology industries.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Barthet‐Mayer </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the recent conclusions on Agenda 2000, it is possible to think that the balance of the European budget always bends under the weight of excessive agricultural subsidies. These are linked, in particular, to the production of surpluses that have to be taken off the market, put into storage and processed. In short, agriculture and its surpluses are to blame for all evils.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet when we analyse Eurostat"s statistical data and the annual situation of European agriculture, we see that – contrary to all expectations – the European Union is not self‐sufficient with regard to certain types of agricultural products. This is the case for sheepmeat, which is the only resource of many dry regions in the south of Europe. We only provide 80 % of our consumption requirements. We are still short of tobacco, wood, non‐processed citrus fruits and certain types of fruit and vegetables. But most importantly, as a recent study by the Directorate‐General for Research revealed, we only produce 30 % of the protein‐rich products required to produce feedingstuffs, mainly for pigs and poultry.</p>
<p class="contents">Imagine what will happen if there is an American embargo, like the once we witnessed in 1973. This would prove to be catastrophic for the European Union within a few weeks. Cereal stocks would continue to provide energy feedingstuffs, but we would soon have a shortage of vegetable proteins, which have been essential since the BSE crisis. Yet at the same time, the starch industry, which is the basis for the production of numerous industrial compounds, including amino acids such as lysine, is being penalised by overly high prices in Europe for these raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now time for the Commission to go beyond making speeches and to deal specifically with these issues. For a start, we must maintain and improve the current system of refunds for the use of cereal derivatives. But we must also implement a genuine policy on non‐food agricultural production in order to produce the raw materials required for the organic compound and biofuel industries, particularly by promoting the use of set‐aside land. Moreover, we simply need to make use of the possibilities that exist in the regulations on cereals and oleaginous protein products in order to make our livestock production sector self‐sufficient in feedingstuffs once again.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we strongly urge the Commission to include all aspects of the problem – which was very well presented by Mr Garot – in the preparatory work for the WTO negotiations. We do have some weapons we can use, provided that there is the political will to use them.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Funk </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Garot for taking this initiative and enabling us to deal with this resolution here and now. I believe this resolution has to address four problem areas and that each of them is actually very important in its own right. First of all there is the question of the competitiveness of the European starch industry, and then there are the Berlin decisions on oilseeds and protein plants, which as we now know are entirely inadequate and completely incapable of overcoming the prevailing deficit in these markets and therefore of little use to us in their present form.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is crucial that the Commission should pursue and develop a more active policy in the realm of non‐food crops, because we have simply ground to a halt somewhere along the line. We have conducted a great many experiments. We have developed organic oils for use in protected water‐collection areas, at places such as Lake Constance and other popular tourist destinations where the use of conventional mineral oils would cause severe pollution. But progress is not being made. The process of introducing these products into the market is stagnating. Our policies have been based on the principle of pushing forward a little and then retreating a little. That will have to change, otherwise nothing good will come of our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is also about competition between grain and potato starch production, for they each have different production costs, which means that harmonisation is required. In short, Commissioner, the issue is this: instead of financing surpluses, we must invest in markets that still operate efficiently. The work on the Agenda 2000 decisions must begin now. They provide a rough framework that cannot give us any cause for satisfaction. But of course it is ultimately the responsibility of Parliament and the Commission to develop that framework and above all to grasp the opportunities that these markets still offer, opportunities that are no longer available in the realm of mass production, where we have lost the initiative. We must look for our opportunities in areas where we can help the environment, and we are not doing nearly enough in that respect. That is why it is imperative to take this action.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liikanen, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, I have just three comments to make on this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is no doubt that industries producing specific products, such as lysine, are confronted with increased imports, particularly from the United States where production capacity is expanding more rapidly. This situation, and the investments possibly made outside Europe, is not to be attributed to the common agricultural policy. The system of export and production refunds compensates for the difference in the price of the raw material on the world market and the EU market.</p>
<p class="contents">Other factors, external to agriculture, are involved, such as labour and energy costs, regulations on the environment, the proximity of markets, and so on. Economy of scale can also bring comparative advantages, and this can be seen clearly in the United States, which has very large manufacturing units that are sometimes integrated into the starch industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, several comments have implied that the level of aid is not sufficient. The Commission cannot allow levels that are insufficient. The present refund rate – effective since the Management Committee"s decision yesterday – is ECU 60 per tonne, that is, approximately 30 % of the value of the raw material. This means that the difference between the world price and the Community price is compensated for.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, many general questions have been raised in connection with the common agricultural policy, as well as in connection with the WTO negotiations. I shall refer these questions to my colleagues, Mr Fischler and Mr Brittan, who will thus provide you with answers to them.</p>
