<p class="contents">As we all know, this is an ambitious programme which will require a great economic effort on the part of the European Union, in the order of EUR 4,000 million in seven years. Consequently, the text of the proposed regulation has taken a long time to draw up, and even then it has been judged to be unspecific and incomplete, since it does not include implementation procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been a complex report and it has taken us time to reach an acceptable degree of consensus. Furthermore, there is no need to stress that, on sending these funds to Russia and the New Independent States, we were not convinced that they would be administered properly. In fact, we were rather worried about their administration and distribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Initially, it was the Committee on Budgets that requested greater control and rigour in the implementation of this aid programme. Today, more than six months after those first exchanges of opinion, I think that we should be proud of the modifications made to the proposed regulation, mainly by this Committee, which increase the guarantees that these funds will be put to good use.</p>
<p class="contents">There was also a problem with the commitology of this programme within the old REX Committee, but, after the Council decision of 28 June 1999, to standardise the different Committees, this obstacle was overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the discussion of the legal basis of this report has also been polemical, although in the end the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market approved it, finally defining it under Article 235, a decision which did not please many of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem which has faced us is the fact that, until now, there have been no harmonised implementation procedures in the proposal for a regulation. I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission representative when we will have harmonised procedures, which will guarantee more transparency, and efficiency, as the second report of the Independent Experts recommended.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither do I wish to end my speech without drawing attention to the unfortunate events in Chechnya and I therefore propose an oral amendment regarding the suspension of aid to Russia while this conflict continues. I would like to make it clear that I do not intend to change the basis of Amendment No 39 of my report, but I do wish to adapt it to recent events, to which end we have reached agreement amongst the PSE representatives in our committee, thereby achieving greater coherence, consensus and technical quality.</p>
<p class="contents">The text of the amendment which we are proposing would be as follows: “In accordance with the European Parliament resolution of 18 November 1999, the conclusions of new contracts covering measures for the benefit of Russia to be funded in the context of the budget for the 2000 financial year shall be suspended, with the exception of the TACIS line for democracy, until a satisfactory solution has been found in Chechnya, in accordance with the European Union’s recommendations and on the basis of the procedure established in Article 13 of the present Regulation”.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask the representative of the European Commission, with regard to this last point as well as to the report in general, if he is really going to take account of the recommendations made within the framework of this consultation, once they have been approved by this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the Commission for their excellent cooperation in the preparation of this report. TACIS is an important political instrument of the European Community, not only in Russia but in all the republics of the former Soviet Union, with the exception of the Baltic States and Mongolia. The philosophy that funds should be used more for the benefit of both sides has finally permeated through to TACIS. This means that we should shift from demand-driven payments by partner countries to the deployment of funds by both sides. This deployment will, in my opinion, prove to be much more effective and we in Parliament should also make sure in future that the European side can influence the deployment of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">This will give the entire programme the flexibility which it has been lacking hitherto and help to prevent funds being misplaced. In past years I and many of my colleagues who are active in Eastern Europe have noted that EU budget appropriations for TACIS are not always used as efficiently as they might be. I do not want to dwell here on our tiresome experiences with hundreds of studies. This has been due in part to limitations in the regulation itself and to problems in the management area. The most significant shortcomings in this area have, in my view, been reduced in the new proposed regulation; more importantly, concentrating on two rather than 12 priorities per partner country as in the past will show a greater degree of professionalism and improve visibility.</p>
<p class="contents">New provisions on potential investments are geared to the development of either the embryonic or non-existent SME sector. SMEs form the backbone of the economy in a modern economic system, which is why I have tabled the idea in a proposed amendment that we gear investments to the capacity of the partner country in question, rather than capping them at 25% of the total volume.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel that visibility and hence the widespread impact of our programmes is a problem which we in the EU need to address in areas other than TACIS. We could learn a lesson from the USA here. The new TACIS regulation allows us, as did the first regulation, to use appropriations for humanitarian purposes in crisis situations. That this flexibility is extremely important is demonstrated by the fact that, on the one hand, the EU wants to stop certain TACIS projects in Russia, as decided in Helsinki while, on the other hand, humanitarian aid is urgently needed. Mr Valdivielso de Cué, I hope that I have misunderstood only as the result of misinterpretation; I consider it imperative that the TACIS Democracy Project should continue, especially in Russia, and that that we should choose the areas in which we really need to stop TACIS. We did this in the case of Belarus and we should do the same in Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I did not have time to write it down, and so I will speak without a text, although it is a subject I know something about. We are all wondering today what to expect of Russia after this crisis. Wars always end, and I imagine this one will end when the Russian presidential elections are over, at the latest. But, ladies and gentlemen, the question of whether Russia will cooperate with us in the future, and what form that cooperation will take, will depend on the skills we demonstrate today. If we chose a policy of humiliation, the outcome may be a bad one, and dangerous too. The TACIS programme is good in the sense that it is practical and gets close to the ordinary citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a few important points. Firstly, it is important that Russia holds the elections in five days’ time. Secondly, we must continue with the sort of cooperation that aids the development in Russia of democracy and civil society. That is important both for the Russians and for ourselves. Thirdly, in my opinion, aid should be allocated more precisely than at present – so that it reaches the ordinary people, the impoverished Russians, rather than Moscow. Fourthly, we should establish a massive, long-range project within the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to create smaller projects to cover a timeframe of 20 years. By then – irrespective of who is leading Russia or the European Union – we will need Russian resources. The first of these is Russian gas, as Norwegian gas will run out. In addition to gas, Russia has, for example, the world’s largest forest and mineral resources. We must take the development of the infrastructure and the environment into consideration. We should implement projects which look to the future in this area and which will carry us through this present crisis.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, a request addressed to the Commission. I spent some hapless years working as a junior official in the TACIS programme some years ago. What I experienced, as I tried to interest everything from local transport authorities in Kishinev through to energy ministries in Uzbekistan was the following: just as in so many other EU policy areas, in TACIS projects we perhaps try to do too much across too many geographical boundaries in too many sectors. I think we are all aware of this danger of the dispersal of EU assistance in far-flung places. Could I make a plea that when this regulation comes into place the many loopholes which still remain in the regulation and which would allow a continued proliferation of small and excessively multiplied projects are closed and that a real, and perhaps in some cases ruthless, concentration of implementing projects is enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second point I address the rapporteur. It concerns the political issue of the partial suspension of at least the TACIS programme under the budget year 2000. I am glad to hear that the rapporteur has very much moved towards the amendment which the ELDR group tabled. Many of us are instinctively still not convinced that any form of suspension is the right way to respond to present circumstances but nevertheless that seems to be the drift of debate. In those circumstances, I would suggest that we at least make our words on the partial suspension of the TACIS programme under the budget year 2000 entirely compatible with what was decided in Helsinki, mainly and most particularly, that if we are going to save the democracy budget line we should also equally save the budget line which applies to nuclear safety projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this point I should like to stress the points which we would like to have accepted but which have not been incorporated for the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we agree fully with Amendment No 51, tabled by Mr Krehl on behalf of the Liberals which, in view of the war which the Russians are waging on Chechnya, seeks to grant aid only for democracy and social development. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, insofar as we are allocating appropriations for the restoration of nuclear power stations, we would like them to be conditional upon the closure or replacement of these power stations, as we do not wish their lifetime to be extended. Consequently, we have tabled Amendment No 48, the wording of which, as set out here, has been accepted by the Liberals. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we wish to support integrated projects with environmental implications which are on a more modest scale than national projects and which retain a local or regional dimension, so that the appropriations granted can be better controlled. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we consider that earmarking 25% of appropriations for investment is excessive and we would like to see this capped at 2% for investments in pilot projects, with a larger percentage going to projects of an experimental nature.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust that you will give these proposals your due consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gemelli (PPE-DE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> I would like to thank my friend and the rapporteur, Mr Valdivielso de Cué, for the wonderful job he has made of mediating and reconciling the various yet justifiable interpretations of the validity of the new instrument for economic cooperation with the New Independent States and Mongolia. It was a difficult job but the competence and tenacity of the rapporteur means that we can approve this measure. </p>
<p class="contents">The new financial programme for the development of the New Independent States and Mongolia that is replacing TACIS is bringing in mechanisms that are more precise than the previous ones. Partnership and competition between the partner States in gaining funding encourage them to play an active role and they aim to enhance existing professionalism and therefore to create a ruling class which will be based on meritocracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to continuously monitor the implementation of the plans, as laid down in the document, protects the European Union from the blatant attempts at fraud noted in the past, and aims to put in place obvious and thus verifiable initiatives. The choice to undertake visible interventions complies with the condition of emphasising the positive role of the European Union with regard to the wreckage left by communism ten years ago, and puts to the test the effectiveness of the western democratic method with regard to the failed <span class="italic">dirigisme</span> of the past. </p>
<p class="contents">It will be necessary, as anticipated, to carefully consider interventions in the civil, economic and social areas of the various New Independent States and Mongolia using two parameters: the solution of the issue of humanitarian intervention and social and economic marginalisation, without privileges and ranking, and the assessment of strategic civil, economic and social value with the aim of bringing the peoples of the new Independent States and Mongolia closer to the European Union. Therefore, we need to proceed with the interventions in order to create a security framework between, on the one side, the new Independent States, and on the other, the European Union, so that we can establish ever greater peace and stability. </p>
<p class="contents">An essential demand that the European Union must make is that the new Independent States respect human rights, so that democratic principles and cultural, religious, political and ethnic pluralism will increasingly take root, in order to improve people’s quality of life. The possibility of suspending the intervention in the unhappy event of a crisis occurring is certainly a strong deterrent which will lead the new States and Mongolia to seek a negotiated solution to disputes, thereby turning them into everyday political dialectics. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should debate and approve the new instrument that is replacing the TACIS programme, even if currently Russia, the largest of the new States, is the focus of a just European Parliament initiative that has suspended the technological cooperation agreement following the war begun against Chechnya. But the Russia question is not solely about this: it is a large country experiencing an extremely serious political, economic and social crisis and it is preparing for presidential elections. It is a large country undergoing a difficult transition and, in my opinion, it should not be left to its fate nor should it be isolated in punitive terms; instead, it should be helped and reassured by means of a close political and economic relationship, even if the political relationship is dialectic and the economic relationship is competitive. </p>
<p class="contents">Russia needs a lot of help from the European Union, based on caution, encouragement and when necessary, objections, but without the possibility of breaking off relations, which we actually need to intensify, in areas such as the creation of a new legal-administrative system which will do away with any temptation to behave improperly. </p>
<p class="contents">It is up to us to create the conditions for peace, cooperation, support, aid and partnership, and we must put the onus on the New Independent States, Mongolia, and above all, Russia, to make sure they deserve our help, by complying with the objective conditions of defending the fundamental principles of citizens and governed communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would then be easier for the interpreters, because he talks at such high speed when he has a script.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say that it is with great humility that I am taking part in this debate because I believe that there are few people who know what is right in this matter. We may feel extremely brave when we are about to cut off aid. At the same time, we must recognise, however, although we do not say it straight out as the Council does, that there are many in Russia who want us to stop providing the TACIS aid<span class="italic">.</span> We are perhaps turning our backs on this section of the Russian population, upon those who might need us now, something which illustrates just how blunt a weapon sanctions are in general. I therefore think it is extremely important that we adopt the compromise amendment which was indicated by Mr Clegg and which means that we can help with a development which begins from below and works its way upwards. The need to help young people in the future is also emphasised in one of the amendments and, in the longer term, this is the only right thing to do. We must teach young people who do not know what is meant by a market economy and who cannot in any case know anything about the matter because they do not have any books about it. The opportunity must be there of learning. We cannot go in there and just apply US economic models, but I am very clear on this point about helping young people and promoting a better future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Putting it on ice or reducing it in some way will hit ordinary Russians and our most important partners in cooperation. Russian cooperation has to be seen in the longer term. Russia must not be isolated, nor must it be allowed to cut itself off either. Through cooperation we must help social conditions to become established in Russia and democracy to gain strength. The flaws that became visible when the earlier programmes were being implemented have to be corrected. Now projects have all too often been left half-finished. There have been few practical results, and the greatest benefits have been reaped by western consultants and local middlemen. A lack of coordination in the Interreg programmes has also meant poorer results. We have to choose who we help, through these projects, more carefully and become more effective when implementing projects on a practical level. Our local partners in cooperation must also be called on to commit to closer cooperation, and the commitments have to be kept on both sides.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is inevitable that this evening our minds should be focused on Russia and that our thoughts should be with the people of Grozny as they spend a further night under threat of bombardment. It is inevitable that Chechnya looms large over this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">When I last addressed this House on 17 November, just before the Istanbul Summit of the OSCE, I said that European Union relations with Russia were under very considerable strain. That strain has grown steadily in subsequent weeks, to the point where the Helsinki European Council decided that it had to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">The declaration adopted last weekend could not send a clearer message. We understand and support Russia's concern about terrorism and about its territorial integrity. There is no question of that whatsoever. There never has been. But that does not justify recent or present action. We condemn Russia's disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force against the Chechen population. We condemn its failure to abide by international humanitarian law. We condemn the lack of cooperation with international humanitarian operators; and we condemn as well the lack of a meaningful dialogue with elected Chechen leaders and the unwillingness to countenance external mediation, for example, through the OSCE.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now setting about putting into practice the European Council's operational conclusions with the presidency and with the Member States. First we will work with the Council to review the implementation of the common strategy for Russia. Second, we have been asked to draw up proposals to suspend some parts of the partnership and cooperation agreement. We are doing this. At the same time we have been asked to adopt a zero-tolerance strategy on breaches of existing trade agreements, like the steel agreement, with Russia. To Mr Paasilinna I would just point out that while we are concerned about these issues it is worth noting that Russia exports about 40% of its total exports to the European Union; that the European Union exports about 3% of its total to Russia; and that Russia has a EUR 10 billion trade surplus with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly – and this brings me closer to the subject of today's debate – we need to review our technical assistance to Russia. I hope that Mr Valdivielso de Cué, Mr Clegg and Mr Piétrasanta will sympathise with the argument which I am now going to develop for a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council has invited the budgetary authority to consider using some of the 2000 TACIS budget for Russia for additional humanitarian assistance. In a general sense this could mean redirecting funds from traditional technical assistance to the immediate needs of the population of Chechnya, including an element of reconstruction. The prior condition is to ensure that the necessary security conditions are in place for international aid agencies to ensure effective delivery. The European Council has decided that new commitments should be strictly limited to areas that have a direct interest for the European Union and do not directly support the Russian Government, including human rights, the rule of law, civil society and nuclear safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In all, this could reduce TACIS support for the Russia programme by two-thirds, down from about EUR 120 million to about EUR 40 million. It is with no pleasure at all that I set out this list of measures. Indeed, as I said when I last addressed Parliament, they will also have negative consequences for the European Union – a point which two speakers suggested late in this debate. I would much prefer it to be otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the conditions will soon be in place for our relations with Russia to return to a more normal footing. That is my very strong, committed view. But that cannot happen unless the Russians heed the European Council's message. The onslaught on the civilian population of Grozny must cease. The military action must be replaced by political dialogue and the conditions for safe delivery of humanitarian assistance must be assured.</p>
<p class="contents">Russian policy must change. We can make our displeasure known and our pressure felt by applying firmly the economic, financial and political measures I have just outlined. But in doing so let us remember, as Mrs Krehl said and as I said at the outset, that TACIS is not only about Russia but about a much wider region. The regulation before Parliament will benefit 13 countries with a combined population of about 300 million. It would surely be wrong, in our effort to make Russia recognise that there is an inevitable price to pay for its behaviour, to end up penalising the many other countries that depend on TACIS and with whom we have no quarrel at all. That is why I hope that Parliament will deliver a positive opinion on this new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me respond to some of the points which have been made, some of which have emerged in this debate and some of which emerged in the earlier discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regulation is designed to be flexible; it is designed to respond to changing circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">It embodies, I hope, some of the key lessons learnt in recent years. These include views from Members of this Parliament. Your input has proved extremely valuable in helping us to frame the new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that you recognise the innovations included in the new programme such as links with the partnership and cooperation agreements, regional differentiation, concentration, a point made with the benefit of experience – concentration, as Mr Clegg said, on a restricted number of cross-sectoral themes – wider use of investment financing and an incentive scheme aimed at improving the quality of projects through a competitive mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">A particularly important aspect is greater emphasis on dialogue with the national authorities in beneficiary countries to ensure that national programmes more accurately reflect our mutual interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions in the Council have been progressing well. Many issues including tendering and contracting procedures have been debated at length. We note your proposal with which the Council agrees but existing procedures should be rolled over until new harmonised procedures are adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can agree to this, I have to say somewhat reluctantly, as the only practical way to have the regulation adopted in good time. However, given the generally acknowledged need to simplify and harmonise procedures across the board we hope that this transitional arrangement can be kept short. The Commission will soon be tabling proposals to amend the external assistance chapter of the financial regulation to give legal backing to key parts of the new harmonised procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">At this hour – though from my experience as a Member of the House of Commons in Britain a few years ago this would be regarded as fairly early in the day – I do not think that honourable Members would want me to go through absolutely every point that was made in the earlier discussions on the regulation. But perhaps I can single out one or two particularly important points.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Members have suggested that the proposed ceilings for investment projects and the new incentive scheme and the regulation interfere with the prerogatives of the budgetary authority. That certainly is not the intention. We fully recognise the role of the budgetary authority. However, the proposed ceilings are intended to provide flexibility to develop actions in these areas while retaining the primary focus of TACIS on structured cooperation and technical assistance to the countries involved.</p>
<p class="contents">We know the key role of NGOs has caused concern to many honourable Members. We have to recognise that the capacity of NGOs in the region is not yet as well developed as any of us would wish. It is therefore unrealistic to imagine their taking on much greater responsibilities at this stage. In many countries there is not even a legal basis for their establishment. The priority today should therefore be to help countries develop the necessary regulatory framework. NGOs in TACIS countries will, of course, continue to be eligible to submit appropriate projects for funding under the European initiative for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly agree that delegating responsibility for project management to the field can make our assistance more responsive and therefore more effective. However, the precondition for a bigger role for European Union delegations is ensuring that they have the necessary staff and the other resources to take on these new responsibilities. This is something we need to look into in the context of the review of external aid management I announced earlier today. At the same time we must avoid taking risks in delegating responsibilities to beneficiary countries whose authorities may not be equipped to handle them. This is probably the case with all TACIS partner countries at present.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my gratitude to Parliament for this debate. The Commission agrees with many of the ideas underlying the amendments that Parliament has put forward and these will be reflected in the text. Reasons of pure form prevent me from accepting the specific wording advanced in many cases, but the Commission can fully agree with Amendments Nos 4, 5, 8, 22 and 32 as well as parts of Amendments Nos 1, 14 and 19.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one last point. Listening to the speeches this evening, realise that most Members of Parliament, like me, believe it is a historic responsibility for us at the end of this century and the beginning of the next to try to avoid the mistakes which have disfigured Europe's relationship with Russia during this century, to try to develop a strategic relationship and partnership with Russia that will draw Russia into the European family.</p>
<p class="contents">That depends on both sides moving. It is very much a two-way street. It has been a matter of considerable regret and more to many of us that Russian behaviour in the last few weeks and months in Chechnya has stretched and strained our attempts to create that sort of relationship almost to breaking point. I very much hope that the decisions taken at the Council and the speeches made in this Parliament today will help to convince Russia that what it has been doing in the northern Caucasus is not sensible, is in breach of the undertakings it has given both to us and to the international community about its behaviour, and is well below what one would expect of a great and civilised nation. I hope that we can look in the future to a relationship with Russia which allows normal business to be resumed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
