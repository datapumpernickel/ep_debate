Less in the public and the political spotlight is another form of sea transport, namely, the transport of bulk goods, in particular, ores and coal. The consequences of the sinking of a ship in this category are actually less in terms of pollution, but the number of crew members who die as a result is considerably higher.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take a closer look at accidents involving bulk carriers: 146 accidents in the last ten years, in which 780 seamen drowned. Of the bulk carriers, 69% were more than fifteen years old. Two main reasons for these accidents are indicated. Firstly, the lack of expertise of the crew and secondly, the physical condition of the ship. In the majority of cases, a fault in the hull of bulk carriers is involved, caused by damage resulting from incorrect loading or unloading.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem is recognised at an international level. The International Maritime Organisation, the IMO, issued the Bulk Loading and Unloading Code, the BLU Code. This contains tasks both on ship and shore which are to be carried out before, during and after loading and unloading. The IMO urges all participating countries to declare the BLU Code applicable to the terminals in their country.</p>
<p class="contents">With the proposed directive, the Commission, on behalf of the Member States, wants to respond to this call. It intends to incorporate the BLU Code, with a few amendments, into Community legislation. The main points are firstly, the appointment of a terminal representative, secondly, the drawing up of a loading and unloading plan and thirdly, the right of intervention by the competent authorities in the event of a disagreement between ship and shore. Along with this, as an equivalent of the so-called "ISM Code" for ships – that is, a quality management system – the Commission also proposes to make a quality management system obligatory for the terminals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism thinks this proposal by the Commission is a step in the right direction. It will not prevent all accidents, seeing that fatal damage often arises outside the European Union. Nevertheless, it gives an impetus to the sector to proceed safely and cautiously and thus to prevent unnecessary damage. Precisely because the problem, like the sector, is of a global nature, an international solution is of great importance. We therefore support the incorporation of the BLU Code into Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the text of the directive adheres as closely as possible to the BLU Code in order to prevent distortion of the competition between countries inside and outside the European Union. In spite of our endorsement of the Commission's proposal, a number of improvements need to be made to this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to highlight the need to guarantee the safety of the crew, in view of the large number of casualties mentioned. Emphasis on that point in a few places in the text is in order.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point: the captain bears many responsibilities. It is also logical then that he is fully informed and that in the event of emergency repairs, his judgment forms the basis for the decision as to whether or not the ship should put to sea. For the rest, it is also important that classification societies receive reports about damage to bulk carriers, seeing that these bureaux often have to form their opinion about the condition of a ship. They can only do so if they have sufficient information at their disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the role of the competent authority which is informed of or verifies irregularities during loading or unloading. It must be obliged to interrupt the procedure in order to guarantee the safety of the ship and crew.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly: it is common knowledge that the capacity of the port State control, or PSC, in the Member States is inadequate. In this directive, the PSC authorities are at risk of being given extra tasks. For this reason, the Commission must see to it that these tasks are actually carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a few more observations about Amendments Nos 14, 13 and 16. We have already seen that we must adhere as closely as possible to the text of the BLU Code in order to counteract distortion of competition and obscurities. Amendment No 14 does not tie in with this, however, and I therefore cannot support it. The necessary disquiet has arisen over Amendment No 13. The voyage data recorder is an instrument for recording travel data. Information about loading and unloading is not recorded on it. Furthermore, in the IMO, agreements have already been reached about the obligatory use of a voyage data recorder in bulk carriers. The effect of this can be found in the Erika II package. Apart from this, if there is a voyage data recorder on board a ship, then it is the responsibility of the port State control to inspect it and not that of the terminal operator. The latter does not have the knowledge for this. In brief, you should understand that I cannot support Amendment No 13 either. I hope that my fellow Members see the logic of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite unable to support Amendment No 16 tabled by my fellow Members Mr Simpson and Mr Fava. It imposes requirements on ships from outside the European Union, which have not been internationally agreed. That is not legally possible. Anyway, work is being done on this. I hope that reassures those making the submission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if we accept this report, in a slightly amended form, I am of the opinion that we will have considerably improved the guarantees for the safety of bulk carriers and their crew. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In recent years, the Commission has tabled a number of proposals for increasing maritime safety in various ways, and this as a result of a number of accidents affecting both people and the environment. The complaint may be made, as it has by myself in various connections, that the EU often reacts after the event instead of taking vigorous action beforehand, but it is good, nonetheless, that a real effort is now being made. Erika I has been succeeded by Erika II, and there is presumably more to come. During the next few months of the session, Parliament will have a number of reports on which to adopt positions in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, we are dealing with safety in connection with the loading and unloading of bulk carriers. There is no doubt that bulk carriers in particular have been especially badly affected by accidents, at least during the last decade. There are a great many reports and a good deal of statistical information to indicate this – a fact which the rapporteur in particular has pointed out. A good half of the vessels that have foundered have done so as a result of accidents involving the hull. Lack of maintenance is a cause of accidents of this type, but many accidents also occur in connection with loading and unloading.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last decade, this has been observed by the UN’s maritime body, the IMO. A special report has called upon Member States, classification societies and shipping companies to be alert to errors in loading and unloading. A number of interim measures have been proposed, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to take an overall view of this problem. There is an explosive growth in the number of shipments. More and more of the traffic comes from Eastern and Central Europe or from third countries. This means that the way in which loads are secured is going to become one of the most important issues of all for us. We are concerned here not only with bulk carriers but also with other forms of shipping and other forms of transport. The fact that loads are not always adequately secured is now a growing problem for shipping and for road and rail transport. The Commission ought therefore to come back with proposals as to how these problems might be solved. Since this is not only, or even mainly, a problem for the EU but is a global issue, it is also important for the Commission to pursue issues of this kind further within the IMO or in other international contexts.</p>
<p class="contents">I should be grateful if the Commissioner could say something about the initiatives the Commission intends to go on taking on this important matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issue under consideration has already been analysed by international organisations: principles and rules have already been set in place for incisive action, aimed at preventing the very frequent accidents and the casualties sadly recorded, as both the rapporteur and Mr Stenmarck said. However, these provisions are not binding, as the Commission has reminded us, and this is the point. This is why we must intervene at European level with legislation which is based on the provisions and makes them binding for all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">When drawing up European legislation to complement international legislation, the Commission rightly consults all the interested parties, particularly the authorities of the port State, and focuses duly on the prevention of accidents during the delicate operations of handling the cargoes and the issue of repairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments adopted in Committee take the right approach, stressing certain points: firstly the obligation, rather than the capacity of the competent authorities, to block the loading and unloading operations whenever the safety of the ships is endangered. Furthermore, in the event of damage which is serious enough to jeopardise the safety and seaworthiness of the ship, it is now clear that the decision on whether or not repair is necessary is to be taken by the port State control authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with regard to the crew and, in particular, the huge problems arising from the low level of training of the crew even today, I propose, on behalf of my group, that the amendment tabled by Mr Simpson and Mr Fava should be altered to replace the word "qualification" with the word "experience".</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is important that this legislation enters into force as soon as possible and that the Member States make every endeavour to ensure that it is implemented effectively. Indeed, even though there is European or international legislation in this area, the Member States fail to apply it properly.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support the Commission's call for the Member States to apply these provisions as of 1 January 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We support the proposal of the Commission. International regulations do indeed exist, a kind of voluntary agreement, but they appear either not to be complied with or are incompletely complied with. If we are considering safety in shipping, then we can see that a striking number of accidents occur involving bulk carriers. So we must do something about it. We therefore support the report compiled by our fellow Member, Mr van Dam.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has two observations to make. We will not support the proposal on the black box that is made in Amendment No 13. What is involved here is the loading and unloading of ships. It does not involve ships that are sailing. The problem of the black box is therefore out of place here and belongs, rather, in the Erika II package, where it will be dealt with in the place where it should be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I have tabled an amendment in relation to Article 8. We have rightly changed the right to stop a loading or unloading operation into an obligation. I think that is a good thing. Also the Member State determines who is authorised to do this. I think that is also a good thing. But when a port authority is authorised, it may be that a port authority also has a commercial interest in the loading and unloading of ships and then a conflict of interests may arise and we think that that is not a good thing. That is why in a number of cases we feel that a Member State must also be able to assign control to the authorities that are in charge of port State control.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from these two points, we are able to support the proposals in general. Safety at sea is a very important issue. We must invest in it. It struck me, Mr van Dam, that you said that people must be invested in too, both people who exercise control ashore, the port State control and other types of control, and the people on the ships who have to know their job, because I think that that is an important element in the promotion of safety at sea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the Commission has done its work well too. Against the background of the type of accident that we know about from the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, but particularly against the background of the knowledge that we have now acquired that there are 8000 ships that do not comply with standards and are actually sailing on our seas in a manner and with a risk of accidents that are not favourable.</p>
<p class="contents">It has all been said before. One hundred and forty-six ships have gone to the bottom in ten years. That means 780 deaths. That also means that in large areas of the sea, the environment may become polluted. Of the 146 accidents – and it has all been said by a number of others before – one third can be traced back to problems with the hull and one third to navigation problems. We do not need to explore the whole problem of navigation now. We have already done that before, but the problems with the hull worry me in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">In the knowledge that a captain, together with the terminal operator, has to make a loading and unloading plan which must be put into effect and also monitored, we concur with the consideration not to include the so-called voyage data recorder in this amendment. However, we really would like to give the Commission something to consider, because anyone who has ever been round those terminals, iron ore terminals and coal and steel terminals, in a number of ports in Europe will have seen what goes on there. Not only are cargoes dumped in the terminals but mechanical shovels are used as well and mechanical shovels can cause damage. In my opinion, this report provides a solution to this by specifying who must do what. This does not quite solve the whole problem of training though.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what is not reported here is that part of the voyage comprises loading and unloading itself. The information about loading and unloading, whether twisting or torsion occurs in a ship, is not reported. In view of the fact that it is mainly ships of 15 years and over – just remember the discussion which we had about oil tankers and in which we ascertained that age is not always an indicator – that cause the majority of problems which result in these disasters, I should like to point out to the Commission that what goes on must be recorded in some way.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it can be said that we agree with the manner in which the other problems in the report have been resolved, matters concerning ISO quality management and, in particular, Community law too, into which a number of the BLU Code's sections have now been incorporated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the rapporteur has pointed out, the directive is intended to incorporate into Community law the so-called BLU-code agreement, that is the code of practice for the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers, which is already applied within the scope of the International Maritime Organisation, but which will not be mandatory until it is incorporated into Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">On that basis, I would like to point out that we can accept the majority of the amendments proposed, both by the rapporteur and by the different groups in general. We accept Amendments Nos 2, 5, 8, 10 and 15 in their entirety, and we accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11 and 12 in principle, but we will have to revise the terms in which they are incorporated. However, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 4, 13, 14 and 16 for reasons which I will explain.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, because, according to Amendment No 4, the competent authority will have to have experience in the loading and unloading of bulk carriers. We cannot accept this, if we take account of the principle of subsidiarity. It is not appropriate to interfere in the responsibilities of the Member States, which must have sufficient room for manoeuvre to create the competent authority which they deem to be most suitable, in order to guarantee the correct application of the directive and in order to carry out the role of arbitrator between the master of the ship and the terminal representative in the event of disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">We reject Amendment No 13 because it intends to assign the representative of the terminal the task of checking that standards for the installation of the black box or voyage data recorder are complied with. Ladies and gentlemen, the inclusion of this requirement in the directive is superfluous, since the same provision is included in two other, more general proposals for legislation in the field of marine safety. I am referring specifically to the proposal for a directive on control of the port State, in the Erika I package, and the proposal for a directive on the Community system for monitoring, control and information on marine traffic which appears in the Erika II package. Above all, by means of this latest proposal, we are going to guarantee the incorporation of black boxes in all Community ships. This will happen in different stages, but it will eventually apply to all ships. By way of clarification, the intention is that black boxes will be incorporated in new goods ships as from 1 July 2002; and that for existing goods ships, in the case of those of 20 000 tonnes gross or more, this will apply from 1 January 2007 and for those of between 3 000 and 20 000 tonnes, from 1 January 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 14, which refers to an element of one of the technical annexes, contravenes the BLU Code, the code of practice for the safety of loading and unloading of bulk carriers, and the principles of the directive with regard to the shared responsibility of the master of the ship and the terminal representative, in relation to certain aspects of safety in the interaction between the ship and the coast.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we cannot accept Amendment No 16 which seeks to lay down qualifications for crews which are not included in the STCW Convention (International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers), because it would discriminate against Community crews.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I will end by once again thanking the rapporteur, Mr van Dam, and the whole of the committee, for their work. This is another of the initiatives presented during last year by the Commission in order to step up the demands and requirements for marine safety, which will enable us, if not to prevent all marine disasters, because that would be difficult, since there is always the possibility of uncontrollable causes, at least to enormously restrict the risks. As has been pointed out, over the last ten years more than 780 people have been lost in accidents involving bulk carriers within Community territory. We believe that that is something that we cannot sit back and accept when measures can be adopted to guarantee the safety of crew members' lives. We are not talking here only about the problem of marine pollution, which we mentioned, for example, in relation to double hull oil tankers; we are talking about something which goes much further, that is, the safety of the crews on Community ships and the ships which visit our shores.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, we are once again combating unfair competition from ships that are sometimes sub-standard or which show little concern for checking and monitoring the whole issue of ship safety. We also have to take account of the way in which bulk carriers are loaded and unloaded. I believe that, with all these measures, the safety package is well focused within the Community sphere, and we can view 2000, in a way, as having been the year of marine safety, from the point of view of the maritime sector. The other day we presented in writing the measures on documentation in the coastal shipping sector and I hope that tomorrow the Commission will give the green light to the ports package. Ladies and gentlemen, during 2001 we are going to continue working in the maritime sphere in order to give it all the impetus, dynamism and scope it needs to absorb some of the demand for transport and to be fully integrated into an intermodal transport system which is more rational and more respectful of the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
