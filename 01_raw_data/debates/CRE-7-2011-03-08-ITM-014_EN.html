Even though both the Member States and the candidate countries are facing noticeable challenges, I believe that the enlargement process must go on continuously and consistently on the basis of the performance delivered. In order to achieve this, both parties must remain committed. Knowing the activities of the European Parliament, it is clear that this is the forum where all participants are aware of the significance of our relations with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">These are long-standing relations, which are made even closer by the country’s candidate status. At the same time, Turkey is also an important regional actor, and plays a crucial role in a number of significant areas, such as energy security and regional security, as well as the promotion of dialogue between civilisations. Meanwhile, the dramatic international events taking place in our immediate neighbourhood highlight even further the extent of Turkey’s significance in the aforementioned areas. Accession negotiations with the country are proceeding in line with the relevant conclusions of the European Council and the Council, as well as the negotiation framework. Despite the negotiations, which are at an advanced stage and are also becoming increasingly complex, the Hungarian Presidency is committed to making progress with regard to all chapters where progress is possible. The work is proceeding even now, and its main focus is currently on chapter eight, that is, competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that our Turkish partners will continue with their efforts and that we will soon be able to see results. In its conclusions adopted in December last year, the Council welcomed Turkey’s continuous commitment to the negotiation process, as well as its political reform programme. The constitutional reform package adopted by Turkey in 2010 represents another important step in the right direction, as this package covers several priorities of the accession partnership in the fields of justice, fundamental rights and public administration. The most important task at the moment is to ensure that the reforms are implemented in accordance with European norms and through consultations that involve the widest possible scope of participants, that is, all political parties and civil society organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that continuing the work on the political criteria remains extremely important. Serious efforts will be required in many areas, as has been underlined in the Council conclusions of 14 December 2010, the draft resolution of the European Parliament and the Commission’s 2010 progress report.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me highlight some of these areas. Turkey must further improve the respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly the freedom of expression and the freedom of religion, in both legislation and practice. Additional efforts will also have to be made in order to ensure full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, in respect of property rights, trade union rights, the rights of persons belonging to minorities, the rights of women and children, the fight against discrimination, gender equality and the fight against torture and inhuman treatment, among other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the freedom of expression, the areas giving cause for concern include restriction of the freedom of the press, insufficient protection of journalists’ rights, as well as the frequent and large-scale banning of websites, which is also highlighted in Parliament’s draft resolution. Allow me to refer at this point to the events of the last few days. On 3 March, the Turkish police arrested a number of journalists. We must monitor this case very closely and we must continuously remind the Turkish authorities of the importance of the continuous assertion of freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the freedom of religion, Turkey must provide both the legislative and the practical conditions for it to be exercised. To guarantee religious pluralism in line with European norms, a comprehensive legal solution is required. Similarly, the Presidency is concerned about the large number of news reports about torture and inhumane treatment and specifically, abuse committed outside official detention facilities. In order to prevent the violation of human rights, the strict implementation of the act on the scope of activities and powers of the police, as amended in 2007, must be monitored. As highlighted by the draft resolution of the European Parliament, the affirmation of the optional protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and the fight against impunity represent essential steps in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Turkish-Kurdish relations and the issue of the south-eastern territories, we hope that the implementation and continuation of the process of democratic opening will soon deliver the expected results, and can ultimately lead to the economic, social and cultural development of the region. Let me also recall that the Council strongly condemns the acts of terrorism committed in the territory of Turkey. It must also be highlighted that the Kurdistan Workers’ Party is still on the EU list of terrorist groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to relations between the EU and Turkey, I note with deep regret that despite being repeatedly asked to do so, Turkey still refuses to fulfil its obligations on the full and non-discriminatory implementation of the additional protocol to its Association Agreement. This is a core issue and therefore, the Council maintains its 2006 measures, which, on the other hand, clearly have an impact on the pace of the accession negotiations, as we all know.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council continues to closely monitor and review any achievements made. Similarly, there has been no progress in relations between Cyprus and Turkey returning to normal. The Council expects Turkey to actively support the negotiations under way under the auspices of the UN for the just, comprehensive and feasible settlement of the issue of Cyprus, pursuant to the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and with respect for the basic principles that represent the foundations of the EU. Turkey’s commitment and contribution is indeed essential for such a comprehensive settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I would like to emphasise that Turkey must make a clear commitment to good neighbourly relations and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Turkey is a key country of origin and a transit country in illegal immigration to the EU, and we therefore welcome the fact that the negotiations for a readmission agreement between the EU and Turkey have been concluded. The Council is looking forward to the agreement being signed as soon as possible and then implemented successfully. We are well aware that this took place at the latest Justice and Home Affairs Council, and we are now expecting Turkey to sign the treaty. Until that happens, the Council stresses once again the obligation to fully and properly implement the existing bilateral readmission agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the customs union between the EU and Turkey, I would like to note that it is time for Turkey to finally fulfil the large number of commitments it has failed to address so far. These include the technical and administrative barriers to trade, the registration requirements, the import licences, state aids, the assertion of intellectual property rights and other discriminative practices and provisions. These are all issues that need to be resolved urgently. Furthermore, Turkey must lift all the restrictions that affect trade and transport between EU Member States and Turkey. Thank you for your patience and I will be pleased to entertain any questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Štefan Füle, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, I would like to thank the Parliament, and, in particular, Ms Oomen-Ruijten, for her report on Turkey. This debate and your resolution come at an important time for EU-Turkey relations, and the draft resolution underlines a number of issues of great importance for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission remains committed to the accession process with Turkey. The enlargement process encourages political and economic reform in the country. The EU-Turkey relationship is strong. Turkey needs the European Union and the European Union needs Turkey – this balance has not changed. The European Union is, and will remain, a key player for Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The relationship is based on deep economic integration: 40% of Turkey’s foreign trade goes to the EU and 80% of foreign direct investments in Turkey come from the EU. The European Union efficiently contributes to Turkey’s modernisation through technology transfers, Turkey’s participation in EU education and research programmes and our pre-accession financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, accession negotiations have slowed down. Moreover, the negotiating chapters that Turkey can aim to open under the present circumstances require significant reforms and adjustments. Against this background, I welcome all the more the progress made recently, in particular, as regards the competition chapter. I am confident that we can soon open this chapter, provided Turkey fulfils the last remaining conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the Cyprus issue weighs on the negotiations. Positive steps on the implementation of the additional protocol to the Ankara agreement or in the settlement talks would have a positive impact on the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to the reforms in Turkey. I welcome last year’s constitutional reform and the subsequent legislative amendments as a step in the right direction. Getting the laws right is important. However, only objective and impartial implementation of the new laws will ensure the success of the constitutional reforms. Turkey should continue with the constitutional reform. The process should be as inclusive and transparent as possible with the active participation of different political parties, civil society, non-governmental organisations and the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is following with concern the recent actions against journalists. Independence and freedom of the press is of utmost importance for democracy. In its 2010 progress report, the Commission has already highlighted the high number of court cases against journalists and undue pressure on the media which undermine this fundamental right in practice. Freedom of the press entails that dissent and opposing points of view need to be heard and – more importantly – tolerated. Freedom of the press means guaranteeing a public space for free debate, including on the Internet. The European Parliament’s draft resolution rightly underlines these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the right to freedom of religion, we welcome the initiatives taken in favour of non-Muslim religious communities in Turkey. However, further and systematic efforts are needed to address the problems of non-Muslims and the Alevis.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the issue of migration. Two weeks ago, the Council endorsed the EU-Turkey readmission agreement. This agreement is beneficial for the EU Member States, as Turkey is an important transit country for migration flows to the EU. The development on the readmission agreement also opens up for the first time new and concrete perspectives for further cooperation with Turkey in the area of visa and migration policies, with a view to improving mobility and contacts amongst our citizens and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey and the European Union have a shared interest in working closely together in this area. There are many good reasons to increase the ability of Turkish citizens, businessmen and students to travel to Europe: to familiarise themselves further with European standards; to enhance EU-Turkey trade to the benefit of both European Union and Turkish businesses, and to give a much-needed boost to our cooperation with Turkey. Madam President, I assure you that the European Parliament will be duly involved both on the issue of the readmission agreement and the visa dialogue, in line with the Treaty requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations with Turkey have also to be seen in a wider context. Turkey’s active foreign policy is a strong potential asset for the European Union, provided it is developed within the framework of Turkey’s EU accession process. The European Union stands ready to intensify its existing dialogue with Turkey on foreign policy issues of mutual interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking about Turkey today, we cannot ignore the major developments in its wider region. The events in Tunisia and Egypt have highlighted Turkey’s stability, prosperity, and democracy. Citizens in these countries look at Turkey, as they look at the European Union, as examples to follow. They watch Turkey advocating standards and values that they are now fighting for themselves and that are associated with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear: while an example to others, Turkey has still a lot to do. Many of these challenges ahead are outlined in your report. This is the occasion for Turkey to move even closer towards implementing fully the European Union political criteria. The government has a very important responsibility to uphold such a privileged position and to lead by example for the benefit of its own citizens, but also for the region as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ria Oomen-Ruijten, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE Group. </span>– <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate and the report on Turkey comes three months before the parliamentary elections in Turkey. More so than in previous years, I have therefore done my best to ensure that the tone of the report is very objective and constructive. The 22 compromise amendments for the vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs are evidence of that. On the basis of the developments over the past year, we, as the European Parliament, want to set our priorities, priorities for the new Turkish parliament and for the next government. There are six priorities, it seems to me.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, a heavy responsibility lies on the government and opposition to seek a compromise and consensus for further reforms. The opposition, and the government too, have indicated that they want a complete reform of the constitution and I expect this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, checks and balances are the basis of any democratic system. Further steps need to be taken to strengthen an independent and impartial judiciary, parliament’s supervisory role and, in particular, freedom of the press and freedom of expression. I am particularly concerned about freedom of the press, but I will come back to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, minority rights. I congratulate Turkey on the symbolic steps it has taken and on the dialogue which the government has explicitly sought. However, dialogue alone is not enough. The people in the southeast of the country, the Alevis, the Christian minorities, they expect something concrete. The statement on Mor Gabriel, in particular, proves that plenty of work still needs to be done and I suspect that it would be damaging for the Turkish Government if this case had to be settled by the Court of Justice once again. That is why something must be done about providing a democratic opening.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, women’s rights. Much has been done in the past year, but laws alone are not enough. I have visited women’s shelters. I have spoken to Turkish women’s organisations. It is clear that efforts have been made ​​by both the Turkish Government and parliament, at national and local level, but things seem to grind to a halt when they reach the police and the courts. That has to change. Laws are all very fine, but enforcement is also important. Today, on the hundredth anniversary of International Women’s Day, I would like once again to make a stand for better representation of women in the Turkish parliament. Things have to change in that respect in the coming elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the Ankara Protocol is vital, in my opinion. Here, the responsibility lies with Turkey. That, in particular, is the source of deadlock in the negotiating chapters: let me reiterate that.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, foreign policy. We Europeans are in favour of Turkey playing an active role in the region. Having said that, I would point out that Turkey will only be able to play a bridging role in that respect as long as the pillar of that bridge remains firmly anchored on the European side of the Bosporus, too. Madam Ashton will, on that point too, have to seek very active coordination with Turkey, more active than has hitherto been the case. By the way, these are not just my priorities. Everything I have mentioned has been under discussion in Turkish society as well. It is now up to the politicians to translate this debate into a consensus and a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, just two more areas of concern. We are alarmed by PKK’s announcement that it wants to end the ceasefire. The Commissioner has spoken about this. Freedom of the press: last Friday, I received an open letter. Let me say once again that anyone who restricts the freedom of expression in a particular country attacks that country’s culture. A free and tolerant debate is of crucial importance to any country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should welcome the fact that momentum has returned to the reform process in Turkey and, recognising the controversies of last September’s referendum, call for it to be a platform for fundamental constitutional reform with all-party support in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly endorse Commissioner Füle’s work in this respect and his uncompromising words this afternoon on freedom of expression, particularly as I, with fellow European representatives, were prevented from acting as legal observers to the KCK cases in the Diyarbakir court only last month. But I also ask the Commissioner to make progress on the visa issue, particularly for businesspeople, and on holding Turkey to its promises for the draft trade union law.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Socialist and Democrat Group believes that the accession talks are threatened, not by a train crash, but by death through strangulation. No new chapter has been opened for eight months, the longest period since the talks were first launched. We will vote tomorrow for the opening of the chapters on fundamental rights and judiciary and on the common foreign and security policy, not because we want to be weak on these issues, but because we want to be strong. We do not do so because we want to alter the pressure on all sides to achieve reconciliation on the island of Cyprus.</p>

We are important neighbours, we are allies in NATO, and many people of Turkish origin live in Member States of the European Union. We must show respect for one another. I very much support visa facilitation for businesspeople and students, just as you have said. I am also in favour of integrating Turkey much more closely into the structures of the common security and defence policy. I would like to see Cyprus bringing an end to its blockade in this area. When we look at North Africa, it is clear that Turkey is a role model for many countries in the region. All of this is very good.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we come to the accession process and we find that many chapters are blocked. It is extremely difficult to open new chapters. There are only three chapters left and the competition chapter is almost at the stage of opening. What will happen when the last chapters are opened? Will Turkey and the European Union no longer have anything to say to one another? That surely cannot be the case! Therefore, we must consider very carefully how to progress with the accession process and whether or not we can retain the current procedure, which involves Parliament commenting on the Commission’s progress report by means of a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Our 2010 report is highly critical, but also constructive. It deals with fundamental rights which are self-evident, particularly for Liberals: freedom of the press, freedom of speech, expression and assembly, student demonstrations, trade union rights and freedom of religion. For years, we have been calling for improvements in freedom of religion, but far too little progress has been made. The arrest of Ahmet Şık and Nedim Şener and the interference in the work of political foundations in Turkey are giving us great cause for concern. This is covered by the first Copenhagen criterion. It is a central issue, because it is the political criterion. If Turkey cannot move forward with its internal democratic constitution, I believe that we will still have serious problems in some areas, quite apart from the deadlock in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In diplomatic terms, we need Turkey and Turkey also needs us. In democratic terms, there is still a great deal to be done in Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report – unlike you, Minister, but that is understandable – stresses freedom of expression and freedom of the media. Unfortunately, this is obviously very necessary and current events serve to remind us of this with the recent arrests of the journalists Nedim Şener and Ahmet Şik in the context of the enquiries into Ergenekon and Sledgehammer. I tabled an amendment on this subject and I would invite you to support this work to put our Parliament in a position to exercise the greatest vigilance it can over this crucial issue of the freedom of the press, which also affects the question of the independence of the judiciary and the drawing up of the new constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would ask you the following political question: when we observe the stranglehold on the process of accession and the standstill on those chapters that are crucial if we want to make progress on issues of fundamental freedoms, the independence of the judiciary and the new constitution, is it not the case that our decision and that of the Council to punish by closing chapters, and the impossibility of opening and closing chapters, are today totally counterproductive factors?</p>
<p class="contents">There is no sense in the European Union depriving itself of one of the main levers for action in Turkey, that is to say, negotiations – in particular, on chapters 22, 23 and 24 – and I would wish to ask the Council to examine this situation once again because, obviously, it looks today as if the accession process has been taken hostage with these sanctions which, at the end of the day, can only have an effect if the accession process remains on the burner. Now, everyone can see that it is not. We therefore find ourselves in an extremely worrying political situation at a time when Turkey is seen by all the countries to the south of the Mediterranean as a source of inspiration for their own democratic transition.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not asking for there to be a decision on Turkey’s accession. I am asking for the decisions that we take at all levels to be absolutely consistent with the reliability, credibility, seriousness and loyalty of our process of negotiation. Today, this is very clearly in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course there are concerns, but I would say that, given the turbulence we are now seeing in North Africa and the Middle East and against the background of a continuing threat from Islamist terrorism, never has it been more important for us to send a positive signal to Turkey that she is welcome in the club of the European democracies.</p>

It must immediately hand the town of Famagusta over to its inhabitants – we are talking about a European town with a European history dating back several thousand years, a town which has been left to the ravages of time for nearly four decades – and it must start withdrawing its occupying troops from Cyprus immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I would remind you of the protests by Turkish Cypriots calling, Mr Van Orden, for Turkey to give them a say in their own affairs. Instead, Eroglu has called for the protesters to be brought to trial. Turkey needs to respect the wishes of the Turkish Cypriots, by allowing a census to be taken in the occupied area and by putting an end to colonisation and allowing the names of the towns and villages to be shown on the map as they were for thousands of years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly appreciate the position taken by Mr Füle. The message to come out of Mrs Oomen’s report is that Turkey must discharge its obligations towards the European Union in full if it wishes to accede to the Union. If it does not wish to accede to the European Union, it should say so because, for a large country such as Turkey, I am against batting the issue back and forth and only talking in diplomatic terms. However, despite Europe’s clear message to Turkey, it is acting in a contradictory manner. It is as if there were a problem between the political leadership and the military regime. At the same time, it demonstrates good intentions towards its neighbours one minute and makes a ‘sieve’ out of the Aegean the next, with Turkish aeroplanes and ships passing through and violating Greek land and air borders on a daily basis.</p>

His visit to Ankara was inflammatory, and it is a pity that German Christian Democrats do not take Max Fischer’s advice and look in the mirror, because the AKP today is the mirror image of the German CDU in 1950 – not Christian Democrat, but Islamic Democrat – and that is no doubt why the Commissioner says that he understands and shares Turkey’s frustrations.</p>

<p class="contents">This should be stated very clearly in this House today, particularly since we expect that the consultations and cooperation on events in North Africa may prove to be a key aspect of good cooperation with Turkey. The fundamental goal we must achieve today is therefore to show Turkey’s value as a partner for the EU in energy matters, and as a political partner for the EU in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Words do not mean much’. However, the supporters of Turkey have allowed themselves to be deceived by positive-sounding, empty words. The 2010 progress report is, in reality, a fault report. It shows that Turkey is many things, but it is certainly not ready to join Europe. Fundamental rights often exist only on paper and there are significant restrictions on freedom of speech. This has been confirmed by the recent arrest of two journalists. There have been no changes in the discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities, such as the Kurds and the Christians. Prime Minister Erdoğan hypocritically accuses European countries of Islamophobia, despite the fact that Muslims are free to practice their religion here, in contrast to the Christians in Turkey. The land dispute over the monastery of Mor Gabriel is one more demonstration of this. Despite claiming the opposite, the Erdoğan government is pushing forward with the process of Islamification. We know that this is what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">A recent survey shows how the Turks really see the EU. They are in favour of joining the EU, but, at the same time, they regard Europeans with a great deal of mistrust. We should break off the accession negotiations as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You should not compare the Justice and Development Party (AKP) with the party which returned Germany to democratic government and the rule of law at the end of the Nazi era. This is really alarming, particularly as the German party in question was in cooperation and in coalition with the Liberals during the 1950s.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of strong links between Turkey and the European Union. Turkey is strategically important to us, but not at any price. Firstly, we cannot abolish the conditions for accession, including freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, rights for minorities and freedom of religion. This has been made clear in the Commission’s reports and in the report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten. Secondly, we must not put the integration capacity of the European Union at risk. We need to find other methods. Thirdly, it is Turkey’s responsibility to ensure that this process is not obstructed and, at last, to keep the promises that it has made in the context of the Ankara Protocol, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is in a position to make it clear that integration within the European Union is possible. However, when Mr Erdoğan says in a speech in Germany that Turks who have German nationality owe their primary loyalty to Turkey, we have a serious problem as far as integration is concerned. This is the expression of a particular mindset and also a means of establishing it.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I am of the opinion that Turkey is not yet ready. However, we have invited Turkey to work constructively with us in the context of the Berlin Plus agreement and in other areas in order to forge closer links. The example of Mor Gabriel forms part of this issue.</p>

This process is a measure of Europe’s credibility and of Turkey’s intentions to carry out the necessary democratic reforms. However, the government’s stated intention of making democratic changes is belied by the facts. We have been following the successive arrests of journalists over the past few days with concern. On 20 February, the journalist Nedim Şener, known for his criticism of the police’s approach to the murder of the Armenian journalist, Hrant Dink, was arrested along with six of his colleagues. They were all gaoled on charges of belonging to a terrorist organisation, thus bringing the number of journalists in prison to well over a hundred. What ultimately appears to be the real offence in these cases is their criticism of the Erdoğan government, rather than any criminal activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union supported the government’s efforts to stamp out the para-state.

Despite all the complexity, however, we should not allow ourselves to be influenced by historically-based prejudices. Recent events in Turkey indisputably constitute factors that are unacceptable from the perspective of European democratic principles. We must intensify negotiations with Turkey all the more. Turkey is of fundamental geopolitical importance to Europe with regard to the complex region of the Middle East. This position must not, of course, be abused. If we have an open and principled dialogue with Turkey, however, this can lead to an improved understanding of democratic rules. The economic development of Turkey over recent years has been truly remarkable, and its industry is becoming a significant partner of European firms in many areas. It is therefore important for these economic relations to be matched by corresponding political relations with the European Union, with a clear perspective on the future. If Turkey is genuinely interested in joining the EU, it cannot take steps such as those we have seen recently. I strongly support, for many reasons, the continuing process of Turkey’s approximation to the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The case of the monastery of Mor Gabriel is one example of the problem.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, let us remember that the Ankara Agreement provided for the four freedoms of movement and for the customs union between Turkey and the EU.

Implementation of the Council decision of 26 April 2004 would greatly encourage Turkey to implement the EC-Turkey Association Agreement.

The opening of new negotiating chapters will result precisely in the kind of new dynamism, as regards progress on human rights and justice, that we want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Press freedom is a major concern. Protection of this freedom, which has seen some difficult times, is a valuable asset. In a democracy, the press has an important role in putting checks on those wielding power. Obviously, there is a great onus on Turkey itself to implement EU legislation, but Europe has responsibilities, too, such as delivering on the commitments in the Association Agreement about the free movement of persons and on the conclusions of the Council of April 2004 on Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on this hundredth anniversary of International Women’s Day, I would give some thought to women’s rights in Turkey. There have been many improvements legally, but I call on the Turkish Government to do absolutely everything to ensure proper implementation of these and – in view of the upcoming elections – respond to Parliament’s call for quotas to increase the number of women in representative positions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new and unusually active Turkish policy towards the region obviously poses the question of whether it will be a Turkish policy under a European flag or whether it will, in fact, be a European policy with help from Turkey. Either way, it is a valuable perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my impression that this cooperation should be placed on a much more pragmatic basis as soon as possible, and that very protracted discussions on membership are – entirely unnecessarily – frustrating for both parties. There are various reasons why they have lasted so long, and the prospects for their completion are not particularly good at present. Today, I would like to express my thanks for the report tabled by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, which is a well-balanced document, as usual. In particular, I am grateful that issues relating to the religious freedom of Christians in Turkey have been dealt with so well. This issue continues to be a problem, involving the legal personality of the Christian community, the return of property and opportunities for the training of clergy. We should remember this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every year, the European Commission adopts an ‘enlargement package’, and we draft a report assessing the progress towards accession to the European Union made by each of the candidate countries over the past 12 months on the basis of this package. In the Commission’s assessment, Turkey fulfils the political criteria sufficiently. Recent constitutional reforms have provided opportunities for improvements in many areas, such as the judiciary and fundamental rights. The package of amendments to the constitution approved in last year’s referendum is a step in the right direction, but the drafting and adoption of these reforms were not preceded by a consultation process involving the political parties and civil society. It is very much to be welcomed that the reform creates a basis for appointing an Ombudsman and creating a national human rights institution.</p>
<p class="contents">It will now be of key importance to ensure that these new proposals are implemented transparently and on the basis of democratic procedures in accordance with European standards. Unfortunately, Turkey’s relations with its neighbours cast an ever-present shadow over the negotiation process. I believe that if Turkey shows good will, creates a favourable climate for the ongoing negotiations on Cyprus and supports these negotiations, and if the country makes a tangible contribution to a comprehensive resolution of the problem, Turkey will have a warmer reception on the European and international stage. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One year on and the colonisation continues, the presence of the occupying army continues in Cyprus and, not only that; for about a month now, we have seen Turkish Cypriots protesting against the presence of Turkish troops on the island and against the economic situation in the occupied area caused by the presence of the Turkish occupying army.</p>
<p class="contents">How did the Prime Minister of Turkey respond? By saying that it is in Cyprus not for the benefit of the Turkish Cypriots, but for Turkey’s strategic interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The moral values and principles of the European Union will not allow it to sacrifice Cyprus on the altar of Turkey’s progress towards accession and I must say, as a socialist colleague reminded the House – and it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck – that it was not Cyprus that invaded Turkey; it was Turkey that invaded Cyprus.

<p class="contents">To underline that this is a catalogue of very little progress on the major issues under discussion, she has very carefully listed in paragraph 40 the need for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus; in paragraph 47, as other speakers have done, she deplores Turkey’s non-implementation of the Additional Protocol; and then, as others have not mentioned, she refers to the blockage of NATO-EU strategic cooperation beyond the ‘Berlin Plus’ arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is very important that the Union does not give way on any of the issues or open any more of the chapters of negotiations until such time as we see that Turkey is a willing partner in this discussion.

No, not yet. Is Europe ready for Turkey? No, not yet. Has Turkey abandoned its aspirations to accession? No, no yet. Three questions and three answers, Commissioner, which realistically set out the critical turning point which Turkey has reached on its path towards accession. They also summarise the complicated relationship between Turkey and Europe. For historical, political and cultural reasons, this relationship has always oscillated between trust and suspicion, between attraction and repulsion. The political expression of this reality is Turkey’s long and painful journey towards accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the noteworthy progress that Turkey is making, it is still giving cause for concern on human rights issues. It is still haggling over every tiny obligation towards the European Union. It refuses to normalise its relations with a Member State, the Republic of Cyprus; it maintains the threat of war against another Member State, Greece, and it refuses to recognise and apply the Convention on the Law of the Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, the arrogance of the Turkish leadership has even angered the Turkish Cypriots. For its part, Europe is still sending ambiguous messages about accession, which are doing nothing to help. We therefore need a clearer position. Only Turkey’s full compliance with the undertakings it has made can and – it is only fair – must guide it towards accession. However, if we are to be fair, we must also be strict with Turkey.</p>

That leadership and vision is to bring Turkey into the EU, where it belongs.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been some positive developments, but equally there is more to be done. I will offer some constructive suggestions. There needs to be more done to combat discrimination and to promote equality on the base of sex, gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, age and sexual orientation. This should be guaranteed by law. Therefore, I ask the Turkish authorities to reinsert the reference to sexual identity into the draft law on combating discrimination and inequality.</p>
<p class="contents">Time is running away. I could speak about this issue for a long time. It is worthwhile recalling that Turkey is a modern, secular country and that in Turkey, women got the vote long before women got the vote in some parts of the EU – something we should remember as we look back over one hundred years of feminism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Turkey has not made any significant progress compared to last year in implementing reforms and fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, full compliance with which is an essential precondition for EU membership. Shortcomings persist, above all, in the judiciary, where the right to a fair and rapid trial is still not secured, in the area of minority rights and women’s rights, and also in the issues of freedom of religion, expression, a free press and the fight against corruption. The lack of religious freedom is particularly evident.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey must improve the coordination of its foreign policy with EU foreign policy, and thus show that it shares common values and interests with the EU. A specific instance could be support for EU efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, for example, and signing the statute of the International Criminal Court, which Turkey evidently continues to postpone. I also expect Turkey to be much more active in resolving the Cyprus issue – as we say in Slovak - by pulling its military forces out of this occupied territory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why, Commissioner, anyone wishing to help Turkey should ultimately listen to what is being said by the Turkish Cypriots, who are currently protesting, not for direct trade or for its translation, as we heard today in the decision dated 26 April, but for Cyprus to be released from the occupation and for them personally to be released and rescued.

<p class="contents">We are not managing to overcome this hypocrisy, but perhaps we could deal with it better if we considered a few general background factors. The first is that we must recognise the fact that we have utterly failed, or perhaps we have never even tried, to initiate a real strategy in relation to the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean. The Turkey issue is closely linked to that.</p>
<p class="contents">When we went on our mission to Tunisia a few days ago, the only Islamist party, al-Nahda, told us quite sincerely that it found inspiration in Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s AKP, and so in some way, people look to Turkey to be able to have a frontage towards Europe, but they do not know whether the opposite frontage, Europe, is willing to take it into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ask ourselves what it is worth doing with regard to Turkey: is it worth being thoroughly sincere and moving quickly towards forms of privileged partnership that involve the whole Mediterranean area, or is it worth continuing to play for time and putting off our decision indefinitely, so that the Turks themselves, with their great pride, end up saying ‘no’ to us once and for all, thus further complicating the situation in the Mediterranean?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we are the ones who should decide and not wait for the others to make a decision. We have specific responsibilities and we must assume them in their entirety. We must have the courage to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’, and then we will see that this situation will have a positive outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We regard Turkey as an important Euro-Atlantic partner. This is why I am sure that, in spite of our contradictions, we all agree that we need a reformed, democratic, secular and European Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally feel deeply uneasy about the risk of Turkey’s domestic and foreign policy taking an Islamic slant. We can see that part of Turkey’s political establishment clearly has no desire to adhere to the principle of strict separation between religion and politics, as handed down by Atatürk.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs to help Turkey overcome the internal division in Turkish society, which includes improving the situation of minorities and relations with its neighbours. We cannot, of course, point an accusing finger only at Turkey. Its neighbours also need to make their move in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect us to work in partnership on all the common issues of general interest, especially cooperation in NATO and the energy infrastructure. Finally, I hope and expect Turkey to sign as soon as possible the anticipated readmission agreement with the European Union, without any delay and without imposing additional conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the differences compared to European culture, tradition and values, however, Turkey is not a fundamentalist country and religion is the free expression of every individual.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not possible to deny Turkey an attempt to fulfil the criteria for joining the EU, even though it is desirable, of course, to take more intensive measures to help settle the disputes between Turkish Cypriots and Greeks. A solution to the Cyprus question might then also bring greater stability, prosperity and security to the Eastern Mediterranean, and might help to speed up Turkey’s EU accession process to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to say one thing in conclusion. We are here, ladies and gentlemen, just like our colleagues in the Commission and the Council, in order to be honest, and if we affirm that Turkey is gradually fulfilling the criteria, then we must not talk in advance about a privileged partnership. It would be better to tell Turkey directly that, despite fulfilling all the criteria, it will not achieve full EU membership. In my opinion, that would be honest on our part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One reason, of course, is the non-compliance with the Ankara Additional Protocols and non-recognition and continued occupation of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">The refusal by the Turkish Government to open its ports and airports to trade from the Republic of Cyprus is unacceptable, but I would also like to mention the fact that they could also have a more constructive approach towards their neighbour Armenia, including the reopening of the shared border with Armenia and an acknowledgement of the deliberate mass killing of Armenians in 1915. Furthermore, Turkey’s thinly disguised political support for Iran risks impeding the EU’s efforts to stop the Islamist theocracy in Tehran from building a nuclear bomb, and that is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned by its increasing hostility to Israel, our ally, as witnessed by the Gaza flotilla episode and Turkey’s officially published findings. Turkey continues to maintain the Greek Orthodox Monastery at Halki closed for no apparent reason, and to deny its ancient Syriac Christians full community rights. There can be no doubt in my mind that Turkey must now redouble its efforts if it wants to make further progress towards the EU and its values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, it is impossible to ignore persistent problems in the area of respect for human rights, especially the rights of minorities and women, and the suppression of freedom of religion.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the most serious problem appears to be the fact that Turkey still occupies almost 50% of the territory of one of our Member States – Cyprus. The EU is therefore indirectly involved in a military conflict with Turkey. This conflict has cost many inhabitants of Cyprus their homes and so far, it offers no hope of a solution to this unlawful state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the dialogue between Brussels and Istanbul requires more openness, so that our Turkish friends can understand that the path to the EU leads only through criteria which cannot be circumvented. If it seems to our Turkish friends that they are not prepared to fulfil the demanding criteria of the EU, it would be proper to acknowledge this honestly and put forward a sensible alternative for our common coexistence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But, as many of you underlined, if Turkey indeed fulfils all relevant accession obligations and we remain committed and serious, then we will be able to avoid most of the frustration some of you referred to and move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with those who are saying quite clearly that moving on the Additional Protocol, the Ankara Agreement, and achieving progress on the comprehensive settlement talks on Cyprus, would create a momentum for the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with those who indicated that the rules of the game should not be changed in the middle of the game. But let me make it absolutely clear. For me, this is not a game; for me, this is a serious process. I strongly believe that, at the end of this process, most European Union and Turkish citizens will see clearly the benefits of a new and modern Turkey being a Member of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark would be that this year’s report is indeed very balanced. What I very much appreciate, and what the rapporteur has managed, to a large extent, to take into account, as has the debate today, is the need to look at the bigger picture and not just present this House with a list of incidents and problems.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that I also agree with those who are making it absolutely clear that the key to a number of the chapters is in the hands of our Turkish partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I am one of those who would like to see chapters such as Chapter 15 on Energy and, especially, Chapter 23 on the Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, opened. This is very important, particularly Chapter 23. I think it would be in the interests of both Turkey and the European Union to work on establishing a track record on these important issues.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that 14 chapters are frozen because of the Ankara Protocol. Let me make a personal comment. I think there is a distinction between those chapters which are frozen unilaterally and those which are frozen based on the recommendation of the Commission, because of the non-commitment of Turkey towards customs union, and then agreed by the Member States by consensus. Chapters 23 and 15 are among those being frozen unilaterally.</p>
<p class="contents">As a last point, let me also address an issue which is very much on our minds these days, and that is the situation of media freedom in Turkey. Last Thursday, I issued a clear statement to make absolutely sure that a message is sent to our Turkish colleagues that Turkish law does not sufficiently guarantee freedom of expression in line with the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights, and to make it absolutely clear that Turkey urgently needs to amend its legal framework to improve the exercise of freedom of the press both in practice, and in a significant manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I raised this issue in very much the same terms with Mr Davutoğlu, the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, last Friday. But let me also make the following comment. I think it is important not to shy away from commenting critically where we see problems. But it is also important to help Turkey put the legislation into such a form, such order, that it corresponds to the abovementioned Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking about how to involve both the Council of Europe and the OECD in this process, and I will be informing the House about the results of these consultations and the way I recommend we proceed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A multitude of arguments, both for and against, have been put forward with regard to both Turkey’s preparedness and the whole accession process. This, too, indicates the complexity of the situation and of how difficult the task of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten was. I believe that she did an excellent job in creating a report which reflects very well how difficult it is to evaluate the situation and Turkey’s preparedness.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, points on which we are in agreement, and in my opinion, this was also reflected in this debate. I believe that there is not only an agreement here between the parties but also on the part of both the Commission and the Council. The first of these points is that we need a European Turkey and it is in our interest to assist with this process. We are talking about a strategic partner here. I cannot stress enough how important it is to have a country with a small area in Europe as our friend. There is also no doubt that this is a process based on conditions, and that Turkey must comply with its obligations, all those it has undertaken, and in order to ensure that we can make progress in the negotiations, it must meet the benchmarks and expectations we have formulated. There is also no doubt that Turkey must strive for good neighbourhood relations. This is a matter which is not to be questioned in any accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We could see that there is a debate on how much progress there has been, and how many tasks Turkey has completed. I believe that we cannot call into question the achievements of the constitutional reform and that there has also been progress in minority affairs, for example, albeit partial. No one questioned the fact that there is still a very long way to go. It is enough to refer again to the issue of the freedom of the press, the situation of women or the operation of the justice system. If we are looking at how new life can be breathed into the accession negotiations, we should examine our scope of action. As mentioned by Commissioner Füle, there are indeed 13 chapters that remain open and we only managed to close one, while 16 have been frozen, where we cannot make any progress at the moment. <span class="italic">De facto</span> we can work on three chapters, namely, those on competition, public procurement, and social policy and employment. The best prepared of these is the chapter on competition, and much has been done during the Belgian Presidency as well in order to enable us to open the chapter, and the Commission is working very hard, with our maximum support, to open this chapter at least during the term of the Hungarian Presidency. Again, Turkey must meet a very large number of conditions to that end. I trust that there will be progress in this respect, and I truly do not wish to see for months on end that we are still unable to open another chapter.</p>
<p class="contents">Many have asked or indicated that progress in the matter of visas would be welcome. Let me be frank with you. The Hungarian Presidency would encourage the Commission to commence the dialogue, but we all know that in the Council meeting, the situation was not entirely clear in this regard, and a number of Member States have expressed their doubts. I believe, as does the Hungarian Presidency, that it would be in our interest to launch the dialogue. There have been several references to the freedom of religion and the persecution of Christians. The Council has received its share of criticism for not addressing this issue. Although this falls under the competence of Lady Ashton as the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Council, let me tell you that the issue was added to the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council in January. At that time, there was no agreement, but the February Foreign Affairs Council did adopt a resolution in which the persecution of all religious minorities, and specifically Christians, was condemned, so the Council did actually address this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, please allow me to also ask us all a question, because we have been talking about what Turkey has done, whether it has done enough and whether it is working properly towards accession. However, let us also think about all that depends on us. And if we want to be honest, we will see that Europe is not living a period of inclusion. We look at what is happening in North Africa, but if you look at what is going on within the European Union or in our even more immediate neighbourhood, you will see that Turkey is one of the five candidate countries, but there are also four others. To what extent can we support these processes? How prepared are we to conclude the accession negotiations with Croatia? How prepared are we to admit Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen Area? How prepared are we to uplift Europe’s hard-fated community, the Roma? Inclusion is on the agenda in a great variety of contexts.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has now turned somewhat inward. Let me state this with a great deal of openness. There is an enlargement weariness. We must deal with our own public opinions, with how open we are with regard to these issues. I believe that maybe we should be thinking in a somewhat longer term. If we consider the long-term interests of the European Union, that is, to retain its attractiveness to both EU citizens and our immediate neighbours, whether it be Turkey or all the North African countries, I believe that we should bring back a more inclusive Europe within ourselves, naturally, with the proviso that this can by no means be unconditional, and that we must not save on the work that is expected from all candidate countries. It would, in my opinion, be a very grave moment for the European Union if Turkey lost interest in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This year, it is 48 years since Turkey became a candidate country for joining the EU. It is beyond dispute that much has happened since then. The economic development of the country, along with the opening up of EU markets, have certainly played their role. However, the country still has a problem over a number of factors which hark back to the creation of the modern Turkish state. The treaty of 1924 clearly declares that citizens professing the Islamic faith are Turks, while citizens professing another faith are regarded as Greek Catholics. The treaty does not recognise other ethnic groups. That which was progressive in 1924, namely, recognition of the fact that someone could be of a religion other than Islam, has quite different connotations today. It is by no means a simple matter in Turkey to declare an ethnicity other than Turkish, whether it be Kurdish, Circassian or any other of the nationalities that have clearly existed in Turkey for a great many years, but whose recognition in real life, including the promotion of ethnic rights, will take a long time yet. The key issues in the problematic situation over the negotiations at the moment are the failure to resolve the occupation of Cyprus, inactivity over the UN resolution on Famagusta and a failure to fulfil the ‘tasks’ arising from previous reports. The reduced role of the army is positive, but only if secular forces remain in power. If this is not the case, it could threaten the stability of the entire region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It could enable us to have a dialogue which will force Turkey to adopt the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. While recognising the progress made by Turkey in meeting the technical criteria for opening the negotiations on competition, we must also tell the authorities in Ankara that additional efforts are required in this area. I also think that opening the negotiations on the chapter on justice and fundamental rights can provide the ideal context to encourage Turkey to progress along the path of reform in this area, which is our common aim, in my view. I also think that we should ask the Council to step up the dialogue with Turkey on foreign policy as, particularly in the context of recent events in North Africa, this country can act as an ally which will encourage democratisation and development in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a general rule, the problems raised are the same – Turkey makes a certain amount of progress in bringing itself into line with EU requirements, but the progress is never satisfactory enough to give a clear indication of an approximate date for accession, or to state whether the country will, in fact, ever join the EU. The changes which have already been made are beneficial, but the EU’s failure to adopt a clear position on Turkey’s accession is a source of frustration for the Turkish authorities and the country’s citizens. We cannot, of course, demand that the Member States take an identical view of the matter, but our indecisiveness means that the EU appears to lack credibility. Support for EU membership is falling among Turkish citizens. The country may start to look for new allies and turn away from the West, which would be disadvantageous to Europe. Turkey is our strategic partner in economic, regional and energy matters, and it is also a significant military force and a key player in the Middle East. The problematic areas are always the same – human rights and civil liberties, the rights of women and national minorities, the rule of law, reform of the judiciary, corruption, freedom of the press and freedom of speech – and they still fall a long way short of European standards, despite the efforts that have been made. Whether the negotiation process can be accelerated depends on how quickly and how effectively Turkey can fulfil the conditions imposed on it, and on the form of membership that the EU proposes to the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There can, however, also be no doubt about the fact that numerous democratic reforms have been carried out as part of the process of Europeanisation in Turkey, as a result of which the negotiating framework for Turkey’s accession was agreed on 3 October 2005. The opening of negotiations can be regarded as a success not only for Turkey, but also for Europe, since the main motive for Turkey to carry out reforms was its European ambitions. While recognising the significant progress made by Turkey to date, it should, however, be remembered that there are many problems which are hampering its integration into the EU. Above all, these include constitutional reform, freedom of the press, women’s rights and the protection of national minorities. A modern democratic state must be based on the principle of division of power and a balance between the executive, legislative and judicial authorities, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and, in particular, freedom of expression and a legal framework which guarantees women’s rights and gender equality. I welcomed the announcement by the Turkish Government and opposition that they are willing to carry out reforms to transform Turkey into a fully-fledged pluralistic democracy, and I hope that all political parties and society will be involved in the entire constitutional process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
