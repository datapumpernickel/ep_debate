Unfortunately, a large number of colleagues will be unable to attend, as this is a plenary week. Nonetheless, I would remind you that this is the 6th World Water Forum and that we already have a resolution from the United Nations from 2010 drawing attention to water and sanitation as a human right. I believe that we should take this as the starting point for our deliberations in our resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin, however, by reminding you of a few statistics. The Earth is a blue planet, with the greater part of its water resources made up of saltwater. Our water reserves amount to 1.4 billion cubic kilometres, only 2.5% of which is usable freshwater. Most of this freshwater is in the form of groundwater and only 1% of this is available for actual human use. This represents a figure of 200 000 cubic kilometres. Sixty per cent of this is already used.</p>
<p class="contents">If we also consider that water consumption worldwide is increasing at twice the rate of the world’s population, then, I believe, we have food for thought. We need to consider how to secure worldwide consumption in the long term. According to United Nations statistics, the fact is that about 70% of water is used for irrigation in agriculture, with industry accounting for a further approximately 22% and domestic consumption the remaining 8%. At the same time, we find a stark rise in urbanisation, particularly in the developing world. Forecasts indicate that the developing world will witness a 50% increase in water consumption by 2050.</p>
<p class="contents">If we consider that the Earth’s population will probably have reached 9.3 billion people by 2050 and that we will need 70% more food to feed this population, then it is possible to imagine how great the strain on water resources will be. Nonetheless, there are also positive signs. We have achieved the first of our Millennium Development Goals, access to clean drinking water. That was evident in the last UN report. We have actually exceeded this target with 89% and may even reach 92% by 2015. Unfortunately we are not quite so far advanced with regard to sanitation. Nonetheless, it is quite clear that if we want to make progress and succeed in solving our water challenges, we must choose a path of economic development, as these successes were only possible by facilitating access to clean drinking water for the Chinese and Indian populations. Unfortunately, there is little positive to report from sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is a very positive thing, and I am sure that many of my colleagues will agree with me, that the slogan for this 6th World Water Forum is ‘Time for solutions’. We have already passed numerous resolutions. We now need to put these resolutions into practice. The World Water Forum is working to draw up 12 key priorities with three strategic objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is to secure the well-being of people. The second is to keep the planet ‘blue’. The third is to contribute to economic development. What do we need to do to achieve these objectives? We drew up a few ideas in our resolution. Firstly, it is important to improve the situation regarding data. There is still a significant deficit in relation to effective data in the water sector: what are the incoming and outgoing volumes, who are the consumers, what is the level of pollution, and so on. The availability of data must be improved in order to be able to frame and implement policy correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, planning and action are required in relation to river basins. This is also the central concept behind the Water Framework Directive. However, this concept must be spread throughout the world. A UN resolution also exists. The central point here is that countries need to cooperate across national divides. We are also aware that water leads to conflict in many areas. I also believe, however, that cooperation provides an enormous opportunity to practise policies that will secure and maintain peace.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also of central importance that decisions in relation to choosing locations will need to include water-related points in future. This applies in particular to industry. It applies to agriculture and, of course, to industrial production too. We should not forget that water has a very regional character, being extremely scarce in some places and plentiful in others. For this reason, I believe that the ‘one-size-fits-all’ principle is inappropriate, particularly in the water sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In reply to your questions, first I would like to recall that a Ministerial Declaration was developed by the host, France, together with states’ representatives and the Commission. Second, the EU has developed over several decades a comprehensive water policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the year 2000, with the adoption of the Water Framework Directive, water policy aims at achieving good status of all EU waters by 2015 on the basis of integrated river basin management. This brings together all users and stakeholders to address all pressures on the water environment in the whole river basin, beyond administrative boundaries. The EU will continue to promote this approach worldwide. But, in spite of our efforts, the achievement of EU water policy goals is still challenging due to a number of old and emerging water management issues related to both water quality and quantity. We also have to look ahead at the vulnerability of the water environment to climate change and ensure that adaptation to climate change is taken into account in our water policies. The Commission presented at the World Water Forum a unique EU web-based platform: the European Climate Adaptation Platform, which is a concrete solution, focusing also on water issues like drought and flooding.</p>
<p class="contents">At global level, the EU will do its utmost through its development cooperation policy to promote integrated river basin management as a key tool to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and multi-level governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, I would like to refer to the 2012 Blueprint to Safeguard Europe’s Water Resources that will present the EU policy response to current water challenges. The Blueprint should, subject to an impact assessment, suggest actions in seven specific areas: on land use; on economic incentives to propose recommendations on how water pricing can reflect the true cost of water use and pollution; on water efficiency targets, to provide tools to develop indicative water efficiency targets – at EU, Member State, river basin and sectoral levels; on innovation, the Blueprint will be complemented by a Water Innovation Partnership with stakeholders and the private sector. The Blueprint will also look at ways to improve governance, including analysing the administrative setup and the potential to reduce administrative burden. Consideration will also be given to the knowledge base for water policy-making, where the Blueprint will seek improvements in statistics on pressure exerted by all activities on water resources; the enhancement of the Water Information System for Europe and the development of a Roadmap for water research. Finally, the Blueprint will reinforce the EU’s commitment to achieve the MDGs on access to drinking water and sanitation, while taking into account relevant outcomes of the Rio+20 Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the new Commission policy framework on water management in developing countries will translate integrated water management into concrete action, that is by expanding the EU Water Initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ministerial Declaration of the World Water Forum complements the Commission communication on a development Agenda for change, by highlighting the key water-related issues for the implementation of EU development policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I was especially pleased to be involved in preparing a resolution on the issues from the World Water Forum with my colleague Mr Seeber.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, when we talk about water we are actually talking about the health and living conditions of billions of human beings. I have just returned from a remote region of Burkina Faso where there is no running water or electricity. I lived with the population, with standing water. There, I experienced the difficulties they encounter, the worry and the sickness among children. I am therefore pleased to learn that the first of the UN Millennium Development Goals has been achieved before the deadline set for 2015. In 2010, the proportion of the population without access to water had fallen by half since 1990. I want to say to you: ‘What good news!’ However, this is also a real call to action. This success is a sign that we must never give up and that action does bear fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore pleased with this resolution and I have taken three main ideas from it in particular. Firstly, as I have just said, we must put everything in place in order to achieve all of the UN Millennium Development Goals, particularly with regard to the problem of sanitation. Secondly, we must ensure water management through drainage basins and deal with the problems of source pollution upstream rather than downstream. Finally, I would like to mention the idea of 1% solidarity for water, a principle that has been applied in France allowing for fundraising to improve access to water. I spoke about this just a moment ago, with regard to Burkina Faso for example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having access to drinking water and sanitation is a human right. This is the main political message which I would like the European Union to convey in Marseille. The motion for a resolution also deals with other key aspects, with one of the most important being, in my view, the use of water in agriculture. Seventy per cent of the water we use from nature is used for agricultural activities, while this figure rises to 80% or even 90% in some countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The provision of access to water can only be achieved if technology and methods allowing more food to be produced with less water are used on a wider scale, such as efficient irrigation systems. We need to encourage the use of these technologies in order to achieve this objective. We must support the farmers in the European Union who deploy them and we must endeavour to remove the barriers obstructing farmers from third countries. Let us not forget that, although 70% of the water taken from nature goes into agriculture, we waste 30% of food at the same time. In other words, we waste a huge amount of water at each point in the food chain, from extraction to consumption. The provision of access to water is also closely linked to other global problems, such as food security.</p>
<p class="contents">Just like we need international forums on the themes of biodiversity and climate change, which relate to this topic, we also need one dealing with this global problem. I hope that the European Union’s negotiators will convey these messages in Marseille, as well as at the Rio Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is a very scary prediction indeed. We are going to batter each other’s brains out due to water shortages. The quotation does not stop there, however, a fact which is often forgotten. The official went on to say, ‘<span class="italic">unless we change our approach to managing this precious and vital resource.</span>’ The thinking here is that, in contrast to oil, water is a renewable resource that we can use over and over as many times as we want. It is just that we have to handle it very wisely. That is what the World Water Forum in Marseille is all about, as well as the Rio+20 conference in June.</p>
<p class="contents">This week, the UN’s World water development report came out. That report, too, is alarming, but it, too, is not defeatist. It contains some absolutely critical elements, and the exhaustion of groundwater, in particular, is a problem that is completely underestimated. This is the case in China, the Middle East, in California and in many other parts of the world. We need to give an awful lot of consideration to this, and in particular to the role played by agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">The paramount thing, however, is collaboration. Yesterday, the Danish Presidency reached an agreement with China to export more European technology to China. China will be investing EUR 500 billion in water management over the next decade.</p>
<p class="contents">That is perhaps also a handy comparison between water and oil. The water shortage is not just a threat. It will also, of course, represent a major economic opportunity before long. Let us reach agreements about that at Rio+20, and let us ensure there that we really do provide for much better water management at the international level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to highlight some problems. Firstly, in terms of water management. As we speak, the World Water Forum is being held in Marseille. Yet, as you know, there is strong criticism with regard to the conflict of interest arising from the fact that the president of this World Water Forum, Loïc Fauchon, is also the chief executive of the Marseille water service (<span class="italic">Société des eaux de Marseille</span>), an affiliate of Veolia. This has therefore become a commercial forum rather than a general interest to see water become a shared global resource. In terms of water management, it is very important that water management is reallocated to local authorities under direct state supervision. This forum ended with a declaration claiming that private investment can guarantee the right to water, which logically leads the debate towards the privatisation of water systems. This is a problem for both European and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem concerns water and health. When we see that 88% of the diseases in the world come from drinking dirty water, poor hygiene practices or inadequate sanitation services, we must seriously invest in the treatment of industrial waste water and waste water in particular, which are poured untreated into nature. This, nevertheless, represents 70% of waste water.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point relates to water and energy. We cannot replace water. Yet, as you know, the problem of shale gas management may lead to problems with groundwater pollution, hence the importance of the framework directive on groundwater, where they realised in Canada and the United States that it could cause pollution. Therefore, if we are fighting for water quality, we must do so at all levels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Water as a resource, water as a global problem, water losses, defective water management and the inadequate protection of water in some parts of the world are very serious problems. I therefore very much support the ongoing conference and the motion for a resolution, although with one minor exception. We have – perhaps in error – included a sentence in the resolution declaring that water is a shared resource of humankind - which is true - and that it should not therefore be a source of profit. You know, if we support this sentence, then I firmly believe it might very seriously threaten water management in most of the Member States, and I therefore very strongly support the proposed amendment tabled by Richard Seeber and others to change this to 'illegitimate' profit. If this word is added, the proposed amendment will go through. It will be a great honour for me to support the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an essential precondition for the functioning of living organisms. We need it in the household, in factories and in agriculture. A sufficient supply of water determines where we can live, produce and sow food crops. It constitutes about two thirds of the human body, which cannot survive more than 12 days without taking in water. According to Leonardo Da Vinci, a genius who was several generations ahead of his time, 'Water was given the magical power to be the sap of life on Earth'.</p>
<p class="contents">There is not, however, an unlimited amount of water on the Earth. Our consumption requirements are growing with increasing social development. As no new water is created on the Earth, with the same water going round in an endless cycle, we must learn to manage it more rationally, protecting its purity and quality. The legislative pressure for stricter protection of water sources, ensuring the necessary access to drinking water for all and strictly regulating the efficient management of water in production sectors, is therefore a justified and important measure for limiting the waste of this precious and life-giving liquid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among other things, charging schemes in these countries are to be altered so that the charges for drinking water and waste water are designed to encourage and reward a thrifty attitude to water.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the Commissioner is as follows: there are several countries who have dragged their feet for the last 12 years in implementing this Water Framework Directive. The countries were given until 2009 to implement the directive, however this has not happened. Several countries, including my own country, Austria, have been tardy in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if we also wish to have any credibility in future World Water Forums, I would ask the Commissioner that the Commission pay more attention and attach greater importance to the implementation of this Water Framework Directive. In the final analysis, however, I believe, despite the defects that can be found in any resolution, that this resolution is correct and that this is the right message from the European Parliament to the 6th World Water Forum, which is why I intend voting in favour of this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Water management has an immediate impact on human health, on energy generation, agriculture and food safety. Thus efficient water management is a fundamental premise for combating global poverty. It is also worth remembering that the UN recognised the human right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a right that is related to the right to an adequate standard of living.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to realise that the times of so-called easy water are over. For this reason it is our responsibility to update and revise existing regulations in this area in order to respond to and face the challenges posed by urbanisation, increases in human population and pollution. On the day before the World Water Forum we should pay particular attention to this problem, in order to give this issue as much publicity as possible and draw the public’s attention to its potential consequences. It is only in this way, that is with the support of the international community and the most influential politicians, that the outcomes and conclusions of this world forum can be positive, setting a good direction for future changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resolution calls on countries and international organisations to step up their efforts at providing everyone with safe, accessible and affordable drinking water and sanitation.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not easy to secure the adoption of this text. It is no coincidence that certain countries, including some Member States, vetoed it initially, before eventually abstaining from the final vote. The fact is that the United Nations text is strong and clear, while others prefer the partial and ambiguous approach that opens the door to big business dealing with water and sanitation. Effectively guaranteeing the right to water and sanitation inevitably clashes with the greed of the cartel of multinational water companies. In order for this right to be enforced effectively, this precious public resource needs to be under public ownership and management. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Water is sometimes renewable, but not always. Many aquifers are not renewable, but water returns to the ground. The problem is that it does not always return to the same place it comes out; for example, the water that evaporates from the Mediterranean forms the rain that falls over Austria or Prague, and that aspect needs to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I think transboundary water agreements are very good, and I think that the Commission should place much greater emphasis on them. As the directive lays down, a river has to be managed in a uniform and unique way, but this approach needs to be strengthened a great deal, and international relationships with respect to transboundary waters need to be promoted. That is essential in my view, and we will see it with Turkey, which will never agree, but we must insist.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think the monitoring of aquifers is very poor. The technology exists to monitor aquifers. Most damage is done through illegal extraction of water from aquifers. I therefore think it is vital that this aspect is taken on board, and technology exists for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the relationship between agriculture and water should be reviewed, because it should not be the case that crops that consume a lot of water are treated in the same way as those that do not. If we put a price on water, which I support in agriculture, and which occurs in my country and region, it should be taken into account that corn and lettuce, for example, consume much more water. We are then exporting water to all the countries to which corn or lettuce are exported. That needs to be reflected in agricultural prices. It is an issue for consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore not a unique platform for dialogue as our resolution says. Alongside this, an alternative forum is taking place where the fundamental issue is the right to water. For water is a resource unlike any other; it is a natural resource like the air or the sun. It is essential to life, and not just human life. Water does not belong to anyone. It cannot be owned, even publicly. It cannot be a source of profit.</p>
<p class="contents">What is being called into question is the management of this water, of water that is useful to human beings. There is dramatic abuse in this regard on the part of public-private partnerships within our countries. Water is becoming more and more expensive while its quality is not improving. We must ask ourselves about the European Union’s responsibilities, particularly with regard to abuse as a result of public service concessions. It is time to react, to take a comprehensive approach and I, for my part, am pleased that in France a number of local authorities have decided to regain control of their water management at local level.</p>

On the other hand, we, who currently have enough water, often use it irrationally, undervaluing it and wasting it. The poor management of water in all respects certainly contributes significantly to climate change. As we can now regulate emissions, industrial output and gigantic rivers, we must next find a way to protect water and soil, and to capture raindrops where they fall. Compacted soil and the uncontrolled spread of forest paths are the main cause of natural disasters every in year in valleys, where rainfall exacts a heavy toll on human life and on property.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to express the conviction that the future Commission plan will also include technical measures for the recultivation of compacted soil, so that it retains rain water where it falls, allowing it to gradually penetrate the soil, reaching the roots of plants, and naturally replenishing the sources of streams, rivers and wells. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Water is not merely an input in production: it is a right, an eco-social input and a public resource. It is essential for life.

EU water law is neutral, as it concerns the legal regime of the providers of such services, and this choice is left to Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Stadler was referring to problems with implementation of the Water Framework Directive. I think this is a very relevant issue. I also know that very recently the Heads of State had a very systematic discussion on the need for us in Europe to be much better at implementing and, when the Blueprint that I referred to at the beginning comes out, there will also be some ideas on how to improve implementation of environmental legislation in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Pargneaux said it was strange that we all know that water is going to be an increasing problem but is really not addressed in the CAP. One could argue that it will be indirectly addressed in Pillar 2, but I think that Mr Pargneaux had a good point, which I am sure Parliament will discuss with the relevant Commissioners.

Climate change and human activities in the region are aggravating the situation. This can be seen from the greater incidence of floods or extreme drought in areas where these were previously not common. New problems are also emerging, such as the penetration of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors into surface and subsurface water, and threats from new techniques for extracting raw materials. Growing demand for packaged drinks also creates waste plastics that threaten the environment and our own food chain. Privatisation of distribution networks makes people hostage to private companies, and their activities often result in devastated public water supply systems which have to be reconstructed from the public funds. Today, however, we really do not need the cycle of privatisation of profits and compensation for losses from public funds. Instead, we need investment in greater efficiency, as losses in distribution networks are as high as 40% in some Member States. When reviewing the EU legislation currently in force in the area of water policy, it is above all necessary to respond to the new risks and to ensure the organic interlinking of sectoral legislation in order to protect key elements of the environment such as water.

The 21st century is seeing the emergence of an increasingly intense competition for the Earth’s diminishing freshwater reserves between the various geographic regions and economic sectors. It is particularly important for us to reduce the water consumption of the agricultural sector, which is responsible for almost 80% of the world’s water use. To this end, we must apply irrigation technologies that use water sparingly, cultivate drought-tolerant plant varieties and introduce a pricing scheme that is equitable yet promotes savings. I will therefore submit a proposal in connection with the reform of the common agricultural policy to allow the eligibility of irrigation systems promoting water savings for support. Desertification represents a particularly serious problem in Hungary, too. Over the past two decades alone, groundwater levels on the already arid sand plateau of Kiskunság have dropped by five metres. This is partlydue to human activity but also partly due to climate change. The recycling of water for agricultural purposes must be increased within the borders of the EU. For this purpose close cooperation with Israel would be advisable, as there the rate of recycling reaches 75%. This by far exceeds Spain’s mere 25%, which is the highest in the EU, whereas other EU Member States, for example in the Mediterranean region, are far behind even this level. Hungary, too, has much headway to make in respect of water recycling. Another reason for EU rules to promote efficient water management and water recycling is that only in this way can we ensure the international competitiveness of European enterprises in this strategically important field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
