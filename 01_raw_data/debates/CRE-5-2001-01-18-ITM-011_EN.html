At that point, I myself accepted that the report that I had worked on and which, moreover, was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, would be postponed until this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the meantime, I was informed that most of the people who had taken part in this debate in my committee, and who I hoped would be able to speak before the House, had unfortunately sent their apologies as they were unable to take part in the debate. This affects more than half of the speakers who were to attend this debate on a matter on which we are basically at odds with the Council, since, in the legal basis, there is a contradiction between what I propose and what is acceptable to the Council, and this is likely to have significant consequences for thousands of people who, every year, would like to benefit from free movement in the Schengen area.</p>
<p class="contents">Regretfully, then, I have had to note the absence of Mr Watson, chairman of the committee; Mr Pirker, coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party; Mrs Terrón I Cusi, who was due to speak and who is coordinator of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and Mr Hernández Mollar, who also sends his apologies, being unable to attend, as well as two other speakers. In these circumstances, concerning a matter where we require all the political groups to adopt a clear position, where it is a question of fundamental conflict between Parliament and the Council, I believed that it was important to have an in-depth debate and a full vote. That is why I request that this report be postponed until Parliament’s next part-session. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also support it on behalf of my group, because we believe that this is such an important issue – as Mr Deprez has said – that it requires the attention of the whole House. And he has put forward a persuasive argument that many of the speakers who commented on this in the committee and who wanted to speak this morning are no longer here.</p>
<p class="contents">What was right for the Ferri report this morning must also apply to the Deprez report this afternoon. But of course I should also like to qualify this by saying that we cannot deny that this debate is, amongst other things, about an agenda and calendar problem. If we do not change our minds and make both Thursday and Friday working days here, then we will discuss this problem over and over again every Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion this can be resolved by creating a coherent and internally logical system for doing our work which runs until Friday afternoon. In this specific case Mr Deprez has a right to have better attendance than he has now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, the responses to this are far from systematic.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday, Mr Seppänen said that his report was too important to be taken on Thursday evening. Nevertheless, following Mr Seppänen's speech, this House made a democratic decision to take his report on Thursday evening. Then at midday on Wednesday, the President of the sitting explained that with the agreement of the groups Mr Seppänen's report would be moved to Thursday morning.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning we were presented with an agenda, out of which it emerged that the Ferri and Deprez reports would be dealt with this evening. This morning nobody protested against this. At lunchtime Mr Ferri realised that he would be leaving and asked for his report to be postponed. His request was granted, and Mr Deprez sat there and did not protest. This afternoon Mr Deprez realised that his speakers had gone astray and now this evening he wants his report to be postponed. This is looking increasingly like a Punch and Judy show, I really do have to say. I should like very clearly to oppose this postponement. Mr Schulz, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and I are Members of this committee. We can air our views on this issue, and we should go ahead with the debate. However, I would hope that proceedings could be more orderly in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Deprez (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my report is based on an initiative by the French Republic concerning third-country nationals, who are holders of what is called a national long-stay visa; in other words, one valid for no more than three months, which has been issued by a Member State of the Schengen area. These third-country nationals are awaiting their residence permits in the Member State that approved their entry.</p>
<p class="contents">Under current Community law, namely, Article 18 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, third-country nationals are only permitted to transit through the territory of other Member States in order to reach the country which issued the long-stay visa. Following their arrival in this country, third-country nationals cannot travel any further within the Schengen area until they have obtained what is called a residence permit. This is exactly where the problem lies. It can take several weeks, if not several months, for a residence permit to be issued, mainly due to cumbersome administrative procedures, poor coordination of administrative departments in some Member States, and because the person concerned has difficulty in finding out the correct procedure to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, and this concerns thousands of people every year throughout the Union, a holder of a long-stay visa and who has not yet received a residence permit, is in the least favourable position by comparison with other third-country nationals as far as freedom of movement in the Schengen area is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that a whole raft of extremely stringent conditions must be fulfilled, in each of our countries, in order to obtain a national long-stay visa makes this situation even more paradoxical, and, to my mind, even more scandalous. Apart from cases involving family reunion, applicants for long-stay visas are subjected to a preliminary in-depth enquiry. They must prove that they have adequate resources and, depending on the circumstances, produce either a document to certify that they have been accepted in an educational or research establishment, or a valid employment contract.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of the French Republic is simple and is very clearly stated in the Explanatory Statement. The aim is to enable freedom of movement in the Schengen area for holders of a national long-stay visa who are awaiting their residence permit. All of us, or so I hope, at least, share this objective which aims to facilitate freedom of movement for these nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the problem lies not in the objective itself, but in the way that the French Republic has chosen to achieve this goal and the consequences of this in terms of the discretionary powers of Member States with regard to citizens’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is rather surprising that the French Republic initiative takes Articles 62(2) and 63(3) as its legal basis, as both of these relate to procedures and conditions for issuing visas. Yet, if the real aim of the initiative is to facilitate freedom of movement for nationals, the required legal basis is Article 62(3), which stipulates that the Council shall, within a period of five years of the Treaty of Amsterdam’s entry into force, adopt measures setting out the conditions under which nationals of third countries shall have the freedom to travel within the territory of the Member States during a period of no more than three months.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the choice of legal basis is never an innocent choice. In reality, the legal basis selected in the French initiative proves that the main aim of this initiative is to harmonise conditions for issuing long-stay visas by bringing them into line with uniform short-stay visas. This means that, if we accept the proposal as presented by the French Republic, it would give any Member State involved in the closer cooperation under the Schengen Agreement the right to be informed of all requests for a long-stay visa made in every other country of the Schengen area, through what is called the prior consultation procedure, and, as a consequence, it would be able to block the freedom of movement by persons that this country does not approve. In practice, if we accept these arrangements, it would mean that, through the prior consultation procedure, the French government could request to be systematically informed if Spain were to issue a long-stay visa to an Algerian national tomorrow, and it would have the right to object to the request, without anyone’s knowledge, because currently no one knows which countries make use of the prior consultation procedure and the Council refuses to release the list of countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I myself chose to amend the initiative of the French Republic in order to bring it into line with the stated objective, as set out in the Explanatory Statement, which is to facilitate the movement of holders of a national long-term visa while awaiting their residence permit.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I support the aim to implement a uniform long-stay visa system, as already currently exists for short-stay visas. However, I hope, and I believe that we should all hope, that this initiative should be part of a clear, consistent, overall proposal from the Council and not part of an initiative which is sketchy in scope and shaky in its arrangements, like this one. That is why I shall ask the House to accept the amendments that I have made with the full support of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not the only issue concerning legally resident third-country nationals where we have a problem concerning the appropriate legal base. I am thinking, for example, of the extensions of the 1408/71 Regulation concerning the coordination of social security systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere Summit in 1999 spoke of according similar rights to third-country nationals as those enjoyed by EU citizens. Yet we still have those who wish to view them as short-term travellers, rather than as people who have much contribute to the Union. Otherwise why would our governments be so keen to encourage inward investment from American and Asian companies? We believe we need political coherence in our policy-making in this area. The lack of such coherence partly explains the argument over the legal base.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Petitions supports the view taken by the rapporteur, Mr Deprez, and thanks him for his diligence in this matter. It was our committee's view that we could reduce the number of such disagreements with the Council in future by reducing the number of individual national initiatives in this area and looking instead for Commission proposals which go through an initial vetting procedure. I know that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has already raised this with the Swedish presidency and we must hope it bears fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">On the substantive issue, while being aware that not all Member States are involved in the Schengen Agreement, of course, it seemed to our committee that we should bring the rights of third-country nationals into line with those of citizens. This is particularly important where partners, not parents as it says in my explanatory statement for some very strange reason, are affected by a different legal status, and we have had a number of petitions on these issues which we added to our opinion. We felt it was also important to support the position of Mr Deprez, as the need for this proposal itself is more the result of bureaucratic delay than decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our hope and expectation also that the Committee on Petitions will automatically be asked for an opinion in good time on such issues in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have of course worked very hard on this report in our Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. My dear Mr Deprez, I could not have wished for a better time for this report to be dealt with, because this is an excellent time – whenever Parliament sits is an excellent time – but I would have wished you better speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">But irrespective of this, I believe that the speakers who will now take the floor instead of the original speakers are perfectly able to make a contribution to this debate. I should like to say quite clearly that both Mr Deprez's comments on the legal basis and his criticism of the Council and the Commission's approach to this area deserve our full support. The Council and the Commission are acting just as unsystematically on this important issue as we almost did just now and as we have done this week regarding the agenda. Where asylum and immigration are concerned we are dealing with a completely confused policy where individual initiatives are put to us one after another – sometimes by the Council, sometimes by the Commission, sometimes by individual Member States – but where there is no strategic approach. But this is also precisely what this proposal – which is perfectly sensible in practice – is suffering from. There is no strategic approach which draws a clear distinction between asylum and immigration, which regulates both appropriately and which deals with the important issue of burden-sharing, and all of this gives rise to problems. These problems are then once again resolved by the back door by means of bureaucratic chicanery, and they are not resolved for good: these are pseudo-solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">If this initiative really does make the lives of those people who have a long-stay visa in the European Union easier then I welcome it. But you cannot treat cancer with aspirin. The way in which we have handled this important field in the last few years – and unfortunately still do so – cannot be allowed to continue. That is why I believe that Mr Deprez's critical comments are more than justified. Practical easing of restrictions in the interests of people, yes. Sensible burden-sharing where burdens arise, yes. And of course free movement for third-country nationals within the European Union. But we call on the Council and the Commission finally to move from patch-up jobs to a systematic, strategic policy in this area and to present an overall, unified vision through which we can move step by step. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we were talking this afternoon and I would have had to begin my speech with the phrase, "Mr President, absent friends," because altogether five colleagues were present, Mr Posselt said that if there were no other speakers there from his group apart from him, he would take over all of the PPE Group's speaking time. This would have meant that we would have had to listen to Mr Posselt for a whole fifteen minutes. Imagine that!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Now this cup has passed from us and we can turn to the issue addressed by Mr Deprez. Mr Posselt, burden-sharing, which you talked about – one of your favourite subjects – has nothing to do with what we are discussing today, although I do concede that we need to talk about burden-sharing.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me first of all to say to the Council that we are dealing with an initiative of the French Government, and recently in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs we have seen individual Member States taking initiatives time and again, and we have then seen that the Member States sometimes happen to be mistaken about their choice of legal basis. For once I will dare to take up something which Mr Posselt said. There is no strategic plan, particularly in the Council. That is why the Council would be better advised to adopt Commissioner Vitorino's strategic plan, which is actually available, instead of blocking most of his ideas. I say this as a point of principle to the Member States and the Council itself.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is, why is there no strategic plan? There is no strategic plan for one simple reason. Policy in the European Union as far as freedom of movement is concerned, to the extent that it is pursued by the individual governments of the Member States, is characterised – not in all of the Member States but in the vast majority of them – by a defensive attitude, because in principle most governments in the European Union have as their premise the restriction of freedom of movement and not the granting of freedom of movement, which, incidentally, is defined as one of the four fundamental freedoms in the Treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing with a deficient strategic plan because we talk about the free movement of services, capital and goods, and from cattle to uranium they can move around freely in Europe. It is only people who are subject to restrictions in the European Union. They are subjected to these restrictions because of a defence mechanism. When Mr Posselt talks about freedom of movement, he mainly means people from the southern hemisphere or asylum seekers. But I am talking, say, about an American professor who accepts a chair at a German university, receives a residence permit for the Federal Republic of Germany and who, when he wishes to give a guest lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris has to apply for a visa, which he is possibly still waiting for because the French or German authorities are not making progress on it. This is because of the diverse and – for the lack of a strategic plan – very heterogeneous administrative provisions in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am talking about the engineer who is sent from a third-country to the EU by a firm which has offices in various different locations. He is subjected to the same bureaucratic obstacle, which incidentally ought not to exist at all in a free market and in a free economy. That is why, in connection with Mr Deprez's excellent report, I call on you, when you are debating the freedom of movement and its regulation, not only always to employ a defence mechanism against those whom we supposedly or really do not want here, but finally to realise firstly that freedom of movement is a human right and secondly that it makes economic sense in the European Union.</p>

All the statistics show that migratory flows have not diminished and that they will even increase over the coming years. Therefore, the problem of free movement of third-country nationals within the Schengen area will again rear its head and become even more acute.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, the citizens of Europe expect a clear and consistent overall policy on migration. The amendment of Article 18 of the Schengen Agreement is the key element of the French initiative. A holder of a long-stay visa should not enjoy fewer rights than a person who holds a short-stay visa. The issue is to facilitate the free movement of migrants who return home regularly, whatever visa they hold.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be aware that, currently, third-country nationals may only transit through the territory of another Member State in order to reach the country which issued their long-stay visa. From then on, they can no longer move around within the Schengen area until they have obtained a residence permit.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where the difficulty lies. In terms of the principle of free movement, third-country nationals with a long-stay visa are in the most unfavourable position, even though they might have had to wait several months or even years to obtain the visa.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the text of the French initiative omits the problem of family reunion, a problem which arises in particular when citizens of the Union marry third-country nationals. Why not therefore treat those who hold a long-stay visa as already resident so that they can enjoy the same right to freedom of movement? As Mr Deprez also highlighted, the legal basis of the proposal could have been envisaged in a different way so that it covered all aspects mentioned in these arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, it seems right to reject an imprecise and incomplete initiative relating to a matter as sensitive as Community immigration policy. In order to respect and fully guarantee Community legislative power, we must urgently adopt legislation on rights to freedom of movement, immigration and asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way to prevent a Fortress Europe being built is to make our repressive visa policy considerably more flexible. The current system does nothing to reduce the migratory flow, on the contrary, it encourages networks of smugglers of illegal immigrants to thrive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a really important issue which goes to the whole heart of why we have the European Union. The fundamental principles of the Union are freedom, respect for democracy, human rights, and if you remove freedom of movement, if you stigmatise people because they have applied for a visa or they hold a particular type of visa, I believe you undermine the fundamental principles of the Union. That is why I welcome the broad thrust of Mr Deprez's report. It is a well-considered report and, as he said quite rightly, it is relevant to thousands of people. But even if it was relevant to only one person, we would still be acting, I am afraid, years, decades, after the time when we should have acted. It is, as he said, a means to achieve a goal and I welcome his legal basis of Article 62(3).</p>
<p class="contents">I share Mr Deprez's concerns and his amendments afford freedom of movement for those awaiting a definitive visa. I welcome his refinement of the French proposals. There is a real need for these proposals. We must treat people fairly and with dignity and remove the stigma of visa stays.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States will have reservations, but we must recognise that change is essential and that people must not be penalised in terms of their freedom of movement by unjustifiable and cumbersome administrative procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Deprez on an intelligent and reasoned approach, with measures that facilitate freedom of movement for third-country nationals on Member State territories for a maximum period of three months. This is a guarantee. We should welcome it and therefore welcome his report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, perhaps this report will at some time enable us in this Chamber and in the Union to have a rational and reasonable debate on immigration and visa issues, decoupled from the ugliness of nationalism and xenophobia. I welcome Mr Deprez's report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission supports the objective pursued by the French initiative to facilitate freedom of movement within the Schengen area for holders with long-stay visas prior to the issue of a residence document with equivalent status to a visa.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission cannot support the selected legal basis, which has obvious implications for the content of the actual instrument. The Commission accordingly shares your rapporteur's position. It considers that the proper legal basis for this regulation is Article 62(3) of the EC Treaty, "measures setting out the conditions under which nationals of third countries shall have the freedom to travel within the territory of the Member States during a period of no more than three months".</p>
<p class="contents">For the sake of consistency with that legal basis, the Commission also agrees with your rapporteur on the need to amend Article 21 of the Convention for the implementation of the Schengen Agreement, which regulates the movement of foreigners, rather than Article 18. The latter article merely specifies that long-stay visas are issued on a national basis and sets the conditions for transit by holders of long-stay visas.</p>
<p class="contents">The only further point that the Commission might add to those made by the rapporteur is this: it regards the amendments to the Common Consular Instruction as going far enough. It is also necessary to amend the Common Manual so that border police can be informed of the new status of the long-stay visa.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission can confirm its intention of shortly presenting an overall proposal for legislation as regards the right to travel in the Schengen area to avoid fragmentary action that would not be conducive to transparency and clarity in the public mind or certainty as to the law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
