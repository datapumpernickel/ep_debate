<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Avril Doyle (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, this is a package of two pieces of legislation and I am rapporteur for both; hence the time allocated to me. I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group and all the political groups for a wide-ranging discussion and debates. We did not agree on everything but we have had a lot of discussion on the very interesting issues contained in both these pieces of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The background is that the fluorinated gases were introduced in the nineties to replace the ozone-depleting CFCs and HCFCs. They are used in all sorts of applications, some essential, others less so: in insulating foams, aerosols, refrigeration and air conditioning systems, in fire protection equipment and even in the soles of air technology jogging shoes.</p>
<p class="contents">As the debate on climate change developed following the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the harmful impact of these fluorinated gases, owing to their high global warming potential or GWP, became recognised as a major contributor – 5% and rising – to the ‘greenhouse effect’. Of the six greenhouse gases listed in the annex to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, three are fluorinated gases. The aim of this legislation is to enable Member States to meet their Kyoto targets by containing the leakage and restricting the use of fluorinated gases.</p>
<p class="contents">Whereas the original Commission proposal to Parliament was in the form of one regulation with a single market legal base – Article 95 – the Council reached a common position which took the form of two separate texts: a directive based on Article 95 and a regulation based on a dual legal base consisting of Articles 175 and 95. The rationale for the split of the Commission proposal into two different texts was to move all the requirements relating to emissions from air conditioning in motor vehicles from the proposed regulation to the framework directive for type-approval of motor vehicles, Directive 70/156/EEC. The proposed regulation would then focus on the remaining stationary applications.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the mobile air conditioning or MAC Directive is concerned, I am of the opinion that a balance has to be struck between, on the one hand, being technology-prescriptive in relation to the global warming potential of the gases to be allowed according to the directive and, on the other hand, promoting the development of alternative environmental technologies. As it now stands, the ban in the directive applies to gases with a global warming potential higher than 150, meaning that HFC-152a – which has a global warming potential of about 120 – can still be used. This will allow further innovation and development of alternative technologies with regard to air conditioning systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Reducing the GWP threshold in mobile air conditioning will effectively mean that the development of CO2 technology is the only option for European car manufacturers at the present time. While I recognise that European industry is a world leader in this technology and I commend its achievements, the current state-of-the-art CO2 systems have a number of disadvantages which make them unsuitable for export outside the EU. First of all, they involve very high pressure equipment, which would present health and safety risks to mechanics who do not have the expertise to service them. Outside the EU, where F-gas technology will remain mainstream, the service networks for such systems will simply not exist. Secondly, CO2 technology is not suitable for use in certain extreme temperatures, in very hot climates for instance. Setting the threshold at 150 GWP does not exclude the further refinement of CO2 technology, but it would allow our car manufacturers to maintain market penetration in all areas of the world. By coming down from the present position to 150 GWP, there is at least a ten-fold decrease – 1000% – in emissions and there would be negligible extra benefit – about 2.6% – in setting a GWP threshold at 50. I know some colleagues are attached to this proposal, but it would be hard to defend it at world trade level because of this insignificant extra environmental benefit and because of this it could be perceived as a technical trade barrier.</p>
<p class="contents">To reiterate, what is important is that, by adopting this directive, we are blocking the use of HFC-134a, which has a global warming potential 10 times higher than HFC 152a.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the phase-out dates proposed by various Members, our aim should be for this legislation to enter into force as soon as possible, so that industry can begin to get rid of the gases with very high global warming potential, while maintaining the six-year type-approval timeframe. I am therefore in favour of approving the common position on the directive as it is, without further amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">On the regulation on certain fluorinated gases, there has been serious debate over the legal base: whether the legal base of the regulation should be the environment (Article 175 of the Treaty) or the single market (Article 95 of the Treaty) or whether the dual legal base proposed in the common position (Articles 175 and 95) should be maintained. We as a Parliament have a duty to settle this issue; above all, industry needs legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I have consulted widely on this issue and examined every option from one end of the spectrum to the other. My main priority has been to achieve legal certainty for industry. After considered deliberation, I have come to the firm conclusion that the only logical and legally watertight option in the spirit of the aims and scopes of the regulation – I would advise colleagues and others interested to read the recitals – is to opt for a single legal base that corresponds to the preponderant purpose or the ‘centre of gravity’ of the legislation. In this case, as in the ozone depleting substances regulation to which this proposal is related, that is environmental protection. It is clearly explained in the recitals to the regulation that the main aim is to contribute to global warming reduction targets. The scope of the regulation is absolutely clear on that as well: global warming reduction targets, air quality improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s legal opinion stated categorically that an unevenly weighted dual legal base, as in the common position, is legally unsound and will be struck down by the ECJ. All the precedent case-law confirms that the Court will quash the reference to the subordinate legal base – Article 95 in this case – and interpret the whole regulation as founded on the main legal base – Article 175. However, this outcome will only come about after years of wrangling and protracted uncertainty for industry. We should keep control of legislative decisions in this political arena – even if it means conciliation it is still political control – rather than letting the courts decide on legislation for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 175 will also allow those Member States which already have more ambitious legislation in force as part of their Kyoto strategy to keep that legislation where it is appropriate for the functioning of the internal market and not, as would be the case with the current common position, force them to bring their environmental standards down to lower EU levels.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to remember, however, that Articles 175 and 176 do not give Member States a free hand to introduce whatever measures they want. The internal market will still be protected from unjustified trade barriers under the environment legal base, Article 175, which is predicated on protection of the single market. It is clearly stated in Article 176 that no stricter measures can be taken by a Member State unless they are compatible with the Treaty, i.e. unless they are proportionate, non-discriminatory and do not create unjustified barriers to the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The effect of the environment legal base is substantively the same as the single market (Article 95) base, which also allows Member States to take stricter measures. It is only the burden of proof – on the Commission under Article 175, on the Member State under Article 95 – and the enforcement procedures which are different.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I call on the Commission to make a declaration, on the record, that it will be assiduous in pursuing its obligations as enforcer of the Treaty in relation to this regulation and that it will take particular care to police and monitor any stricter measures that are proposed by Member States, in the interests of furthering the internal market within the bounds of Article 175. While the Commission may not have been proactive enough to date in using its infringement powers, I hope that its recent case against Denmark will be a sign of things to come and will assuage the worst case scenario fears of industry with regard to the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">As a further safeguard, and to assist SMEs, I have proposed an amendment to introduce an online register where any stricter measures that are compatible with the single market under Article 176 would be recorded in an easily accessible single document. I urge colleagues to support this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In an enlarged Europe of 25 – soon to be 27 – Member States, the Council may well resort to more frequent use of a dual legal base in order to try and satisfy various national interests. This will result in fragmentation of the purpose and focus of legislation. This trend towards cobbling together sloppy compromises at the Council negotiating table when Member States cannot reach an acceptable political agreement is extremely worrying. I believe that the European Parliament is uniquely placed to overcome the constraints of national positions and to provide policy coherence in areas where Community-level action is required. We as a Parliament must resist the dilution and emasculation of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The bottom line is that, if the common position on the dual legal base is maintained, this regulation will end up with a single Article 175 legal base after the ECJ has examined it and struck down the subordinate legal base, Article 95. I would prefer this Parliament’s decision to prevail and I cannot put my name to a regulation that is not legally sound and will not withstand legal scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">One key argument that has received little acknowledgement in the heated debates so far is the competitiveness case of employing Article 175 to achieve our Lisbon targets of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, with sustainable growth as an integral part of that objective. The proposal to use a single market legal base and also impose additional bans in the annex is a blunt instrument that industry, the Commission and the Council cannot accept. At present, none of the proposals to include additional bans on the use of F-gases in certain applications have been subjected to impact assessments or comprehensive health and safety or even cost-benefit analysis by the Commission. I do not believe we should use them without prior technical examination.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe in containment and recovery as very sensible and effective means of mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases. However, I also see the need for promoting the development of alternative technologies which are more environmentally benign than the existing ones. By allowing more ambitious legislation in some Member States, subject to the close scrutiny of the Commission, and by restricting the marketing of certain products where better alternatives exist, the objectives just mentioned will be given impetus.</p>
<p class="contents">Industry must be given long-term certainty. It is our duty to lay out the directions for the future and it is for us as politicians, together with the Council and the Commission, to decide on legislation and not allow the ECJ to direct it all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposals we are debating today are an important part of Community policy on climate change. Fluorinated gases are very strong greenhouse gases. In the European programme on climate change, legislation which limits emissions of fluorinated gases has been called one of the measures of crucial importance in order for the European Union to achieve its objective within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft proposals being debated today will help considerably in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in the European Union. This reduction is calculated at approximately 21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year up to 2010 and at 40 to 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year after 2020, once the proposed measures have been fully applied.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal on fluorinated gases was debated in the Council during the Irish and Dutch Presidencies and it soon became clear that it would have to be reformulated to some degree. The Council decided, in the end, to change the form of the Commission proposal, but kept it as a package of measures, with a directive especially on the question of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in vehicle mobile air-conditioning systems (MACs) and a regulation covering the remaining issues in the original proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also agreed that the directive should be based on Article 95 alone, in that it would come under the type approval system, and that the regulation should have as its legal basis Article 175, in conjunction with Article 95 as far as Articles 7, 8 and 9 of the regulation are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agreed to this change, given that the two elements qualify as an overall package which safeguards the environmental aims of the original proposal. The change in form also reflects Parliament's wish to address the question of MAC systems through type approval legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise here that I shall be closely monitoring developments with certain outstanding issues in Parliament and in the Council, especially the very serious issue of the legal basis, it being the wish of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that the regulation on fluorinated gases be based solely on Article 175. The outcome of the vote on this question in plenary will be especially important.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to add that the Commission welcomes measures which have been taken by various Member States to reduce greenhouse gases. Recent reports show that several Member States will need additional measures to achieve the objectives to which they have committed. Consequently, actions to restrict fluorinated gases are one effective means towards this objective. The Commission merely wishes to ensure that these measures and these actions do not infringe other obligations in the Treaties which the Member States must honour, especially with regard, for example, to the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments proposing additional bans on the placing on the market, the Commission has always maintained that, before a decision is taken as to the extent to which a product or item of equipment containing fluorinated gases must be banned, a full technical and economic evaluation is required. However, this has not been done for the new bans proposed by the Committee on the Environment. It is worth noting that, within the framework of the review, four years after the regulation entered into force, provision is made for examining possible additional bans.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers many of the remaining changes incorporated into the common position and the amendments proposed in Parliament to be improvements to its original proposal. They do indeed improve the definitions and clarify the text; at the same time, they strengthen transparency and accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also accepted certain amendments in the common position, such as the new article on labelling, which goes far beyond its original proposal, and such as the article on the review of the regulation, which has been considerably strengthened and is now more specific.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the directive on emissions from MAC systems is concerned, the Commission supports Parliament's proposal for the gradual abolition of fluorinated greenhouse gases from MACs, using the type approval procedure, rather than a system of transferable quotas. There is convergence of opinions between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is willing to look positively at every possibility for compromise which may arise in relation to the amendments voted by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we shall manage to complete the procedure on the present matter as quickly as possible. We need the new regulation and the new directive without delay, so that they can start to contribute towards the limitation of emissions of fluorinated gases. They will thus make it easier for us to honour our commitments within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is clear that this will send a real positive and timely message as we set in motion – today to be precise – the second stage of the European programme on climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has to be said, though, that it is becoming more and more difficult to get people to show any sympathy for environmental protection measures when Article 175, the legal basis for them, is transposed in different ways in different countries, thereby endangering the smooth functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that things are not the way the Council would like them to be; there are indeed differences between countries, and the internal market does get disrupted. All I can do, then, is urge that we accept Articles 175 and 95 as a dual legal basis, which is necessary in this instance; in any other, I would be in favour of a single legal basis, although I would then have to argue the case for Article 95, which does not fit the bill exactly.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House have always defended the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises, and it is particularly with regard to air-conditioning units that our objective gives rise to concern and criticism on their part. While the goal – an ambitious one, and important in terms of environmental policy – of changing air-conditioning units over to non-fluorinated gases by 2011 is to be welcomed, it has to be said that it does create problems for small and medium-sized enterprises, and that is why, at first reading, this House adopted a derogation, according to which, if the number of units produced is less than 50 000 per annum, the new arrangements can be introduced two years later – that is, in 2013. It is regrettable that the Council did not see fit to take this on board, but, as I regard it as necessary that flexibility in transposition be guaranteed if the changeover is to be successful, I have tabled an amendment, which enjoys support from all the groups.</p>
<p class="contents">What is this amendment about? The intention is simply to make it possible for small-volume manufacturers, after 1 January 2013, to be given type-approval for vehicles operating in accordance with the old regime. We should give small businesses this opportunity, and not only the manufacturers of vehicles, but also the suppliers. I therefore ask you to support this amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone is agreed that measures must be taken urgently in order to reduce the quantity of greenhouse gases. First of all, though, I should like to thank Mrs Doyle who, as rapporteur, has taken a number of important initiatives in order to safeguard the environmental quality of these proposals, and has shown much commitment in this. She has opted to change the legal basis from the internal market to the environment, which I believe to be of the utmost importance and which enjoys the warm support of the majority of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position is disappointing. A number of countries in the Council have voted against it because they have already more far-reaching measures in place. With the internal market legal basis, Austria and Denmark would have to withdraw their more far-reaching measures, which is really unacceptable. The internal market must provide a high level of environmental protection. If that is not the case, the environmental legal basis is more suitable because it allows the Member States to introduce more far-reaching measures themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is not there to impose changes for the worse on the Member States or to deny Member States the opportunity of adopting proper environmental policy. Europe is there to improve the conditions under which all of us live. The environmental legal basis is also clearly less complicated and as such, fits in with the better regulation project, which we all want. For the record, the environmental legal basis is not a licence to start issuing all kinds of bans arbitrarily; it goes without saying that any ban should be underpinned by a sound environmental reason.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, an overwhelming majority were in favour of reducing the use of f-gases. Many companies work with f-gases and a large number of companies have sent lobbyists in order to get this House round to their way of thinking. The army of lobbyists claims that there is no alternative to using of f-gases, that their use is either not that harmful or negligible relatively speaking. Although, needless to say, I can appreciate all these arguments, I think that innovation is necessary and that we should really phase out the use of the most harmful greenhouse gases as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, of course, carefully consider the environmental impact bans have and we must ensure that the restrictions to market access are proportionate; we would be happy to do this in consultation with the Council. There is broad consensus in this House about the need for adopting an ambitious climate policy. Sadly, it appears that a broad consensus for a strong climate policy is not equal to the automotive industry. The Socialists would have liked to push car manufacturers into replacing f-gases in air-conditioning systems more quickly. Unfortunately, they were unable to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of compromise, our group proposes putting the latest date of introduction forward by one year, from 2017 to 2016. This is not a shocking change, but sufficient for the car industry to launch a strong lobby to make it clear to MEPs that that is really unacceptable. The production cycle of a car model is six years, but I would ask the car industry out there whether that attitude is not too defensive. Innovation is of paramount importance if the car industry wants to survive the competition from China, and it is then inappropriate to put innovation on the backburner. If we continue to do this, the Lisbon agenda will not come to anything either. As for Mr Schnellhardt’s proposed exemption for small volumes, we regard that as unnecessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have to oppose global warming because of the enormous impact that it has on the environment. I should just like to mention the fact – as we can see in the newspapers every day – that extreme events are getting worse: heavier rains and longer droughts.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union regards this problem as central to the issue of sustainable development, which, in turn, is one of the fundamental principles for the Union: solidarity with future generations, on a par with the dignity of the individual and democracy. The more complex the molecule, the more intense is the greenhouse effect. Organofluorines belong to this category and must be taken into serious consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">There is all the more reason, then, to think systematically – that is, looking at the whole system – that the impact has to be minimised in relation to the global greenhouse effect, and thus we should not be concerned just with the gas in question but also with the way in which it is used. Therefore, it is essential to minimise its overall global warming potential: that of the gas and that of the equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">If the emissions trading method works – as it does – I believe we should first of all apply a kind of internal emissions trading to the systems where the method is being used, reducing the effects of the gas and equipment to a minimum in the first place and analysing the costs and benefits. The systems I am referring to are, for instance, mobile air conditioners, fixed air conditioners, and the system comprising the gas plus the energy needed to make the equipment work. Gas is used to extinguish fires and, like fire, is a source of greenhouse gas, so the effects of both the gas and the emissions from the fire must be evaluated. It is therefore important not to be prescriptive and over-attentive to detail, but to aim at minimising the greenhouse effect as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">There are gases, such as sulphur hexafluoride, for which there are no alternatives and which thus constitute exceptions, because vital equipment depends on such gases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My Group fully supports the change in the regulation's legal basis to Article 175. The sole objective of this regulation is, clearly, climate protection. It should be remembered that these gases were already included, in 1997, in the basket of gases to be controlled under the Kyoto Protocol and that this regulation emerged from a specific programme called the European Climate Change programme. So we should not be fooled by the pro-F-gas lobbyists who argue both for avoiding a change of legal basis and for maintenance of the status quo for their climate-destructive products.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate-friendly alternatives exist for almost all applications, or are in development. None of the phase-outs and bans proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is unrealistic, as some would claim, since they all take into consideration exemptions where safety standards require.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that f-gases were pushed onto the market as replacements for CFCs, which cause ozone depletion and skin cancers, precisely by the same big chemical companies – like DuPont or, in my own country, Ineos, as ICI is now known – that were, themselves, major producers of ozone-destroying substances.</p>

We usually agree that they are the greatest environmental problem of our time, and we usually agree that we must do more. Now, we are here; now, we can do more; now, we can ensure that some of the most damaging greenhouse gases disappear or are phased out, or at least have restrictions placed on them. We know that there are alternatives, so it is a question of coming up with the goods.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully support the rapporteur’s demand that Article 175 should be the legal base. This is an environmental issue. It would be absurd if we wanted to reduce the environmental requirements that already exist in some of the EU Member States when the requirements should in actual fact be made stricter. Not to let countries take the lead prevents invention and innovation. It may be objected that allowing them to do so might interfere with the internal market. Certainly, that is possible, but my political group believes that democratic countries’ right to tighten up environmental requirements if doing so is good for the environment - as, indeed, it is – should take precedence over companies’ right to sell exactly the same product across a particular market.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen shameless and unprecedented lobbying on this issue by a range of different companies. Quite a few of these companies attack the Member States’ democratic right to tighten up their legislation. The same companies often wish to call themselves friends of the environment, or they maintain that they have modern environmental policies. This attitude can be summarised in a single word: hypocrisy.</p>

While she has moved a reasoned proposal particularly where the legal basis is concerned, my group would like to see the Member States’ right to take additional measures made more explicit in the directive. That is why we have tabled Amendment 45. I hope that the rapporteur can endorse this in addition to the change to the legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the bans that are added to Annex 2, especially Amendments 34 to 36, I can tell you that I do not support them. In time, I would like to see the use of fluorinated gases phased out in those applications, but we do not know whether the alternatives are actually more energy-efficient. It is therefore too premature to impose a ban at present. In future, a ban could be instituted when this directive is reviewed, but only if research were to prove that this is really more energy-efficient. I would be interested to hear what view the Commission takes of these product bans.</p>
<p class="contents">The last thing I would like to say has to do with Amendment 19. We have just discussed my own report on cross-border waste shipments. Like many other substances, used fluorinated gases are waste substances that may be processed more effectively in a different country. Fluorinated gases are therefore not as unusual as this amendment gives us to believe, and so we should not make an exception to the normal licensing procedure for waste shipments. It would be very strange indeed if during tomorrow’s vote, we first demonstrated our allegiance to a more coherent approach to waste shipments, only to shoot this uniform approach to tatters the next day. I would therefore ask the rapporteur, and the House, not to back Amendment 19. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I felt it necessary to distance myself from certain positions that appear only to favour sectional objectives and are likely to produce a much more disastrous outcome both for the environment and for many Member States’ economies.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, on the issue of the legal basis, the shift to Article 175 may result in a distortion of the single market concept, since it allows individual Member States to introduce more restrictive requirements and measures. Choosing Article 175 as the legal basis might lead to a paradox whereby some countries may decide to prohibit the use of SF6 but then resort to current alternatives that are more polluting and less safe than fluorinated gases.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that the purpose of the regulation is to contain fluorinated gas emissions and not to ban them. Any ban – I am referring to Articles 7 and 8 in particular – should be preceded by a study assessing both the economic impact and the environmental benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">I must emphasise that it is pointless to cause serious economic damage to countries that base part of their economies on the responsible use of those gases when there is no likelihood of gaining appreciable environmental benefits, while even causing greater harm in some cases.</p>
<p class="contents">It is pointless to resort to bans that cannot offer any feasible scientific alternatives, when at the moment it would be enough to reduce emissions. It is pointless to hinder harmonisation, when this move puts even safety at work at risk. Fluorinated gases have high energy efficiency, are non-flammable and non-toxic, and can be handled and managed by workers in total safety. Statistics show that the alternative solutions have caused many deaths in the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">An approach based on responsible use, with the same rules for all the Member States, has the clear advantage of being a win-win solution. It provides a reduction in the energy costs associated with a guaranteed high degree of safety, and the environment benefits as greenhouse gas emissions are cut to the absolute minimum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with her that we must do our utmost to protect the environment. We must give serious consideration to the ominous progression of global warming and recognise our responsibility also for the fate of future generations. To this end, we should strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a minimum. If there are substitutes for fluorinated industrial gases that offer more advantages in terms of environmental protection, energy efficiency or health and safety, we should not hesitate to replace such gases with the more environmentally friendly substances.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress, however, that this should apply only in those cases where a substitute is available. I believe that in the automotive industry, for instance, there will be no problem finding such substitutes by 2010. I would like to point out, however, that there are also plans to ban the use of sulphur hexafluoride SF6, which would have negative consequences for the treatment of cancer, since this substance is used in radiotherapy and no substitute is available. Should it be banned, many patients in Europe would lose a highly effective form of treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am in complete agreement with the line she has taken.</p>
<p class="contents">That the Kyoto Protocol was able to enter into force was primarily a result of the efforts of the European Union. Three of the six gases listed in it are f-gases, the use of which has been prohibited outright by both Austria and Denmark. It is abundantly clear, not only from experience in these countries, but also from innovations in other Member States, that technically and economically workable alternatives to fluorinated gases are available, and that they do less damage to the environment. Alternatives to a wide range of products and installations are available, and are capable of bringing about a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; some of them even reduce energy consumption at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">A large number of European manufacturers are capable of putting alternatives on the market. Consumers are already able to shop in supermarkets in which the refrigerators use alternatives to f-gases. The German Federal Office for the Environment has produced a comprehensive study of the availability and efficiency of the alternatives showing that alternatives are indeed available for many important applications.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that needs to be mentioned is the lack of ambition apparent from the Common Position. The proposal for a regulation on certain f-gases takes insufficient account of tried, tested and already available developments. The imposition of bans and restrictions that can simply be neglected not only stifles ecological innovation in this area, but also robs the Community of any credibility where the development of eco-efficient solutions is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Council’s Common Position on the Regulation does not allow the Member States to do anything ambitious and of their own free will and accord about seeking technical alternatives. The EU’s burden-sharing agreement commits different Member States to very diverse targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases, and so individual Member States need to take different measures to achieve them. That is why it is absolutely crucial that Article 175 should be the legal basis for the whole Regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I see it as our duty as legislators to encourage and facilitate the development of new and more environmentally friendly technology. When there is new, environmentally friendly technology at a reasonable cost, there is no reason for us to permit older, environmentally polluting technology.</p>
<p class="contents">In the legislation, we must also, if possible, avoid confining ourselves to a particular technical solution just because, at precisely the time we legislate, it is the best in environmental terms. Instead, we must lay down requirements regarding upper limits for emissions and for other environmental pollution. In the light of this, I am in actual fact quite satisfied with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety’s proposals for limiting the use of greenhouse gases, even though I should obviously have liked some of my own amendments – which went a little further, for example regarding the use of fluorohydrocarbons – also to have been sanctioned by the majority of the committee. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has, however, decided, despite everything, to demand that more substances be phased out than those put forward by the Council for such treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, in actual fact, particularly glad that the Committee has supported having Article 175 as the legal base, something that quite a few speakers have already mentioned. It is important that the Committee wishes to make it possible for countries that have stricter rules for the use of greenhouse gases to be able to retain these rules and for those that want to introduce such rules to be able to do so. Environmental requirements within the EU must not be harmonised downwards, but upwards.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to air-conditioning in cars, we are not convinced that there is at present good reason for requiring that the gas used should not be permitted to have a warming potential higher than 50, partly because the climate benefits of such a reduction would be extremely small and, at the same time, very expensive but mainly because the technology involving carbon dioxide has not yet been tested sufficiently for us to commit ourselves irrevocably to it. We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament therefore support the rapporteur on this specific issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to call on everyone to support the changes proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in tomorrow’s vote and, at the same time of course, the amendments tabled by the PSE Group, for example those about introducing the stricter rules for air-conditioning in cars at a time earlier than that proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A GWP threshold value of 150 reduces emissions by 90%. The deadlines – 2011 for new types and 2017 for new models – are ambitious enough, and it will also be possible for the manufacturers to meet them. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has already voted to reject the demand for the reintroduction of GWP 50. Compared with a threshold value of 150, a GWP threshold value of 50 has no significant impact on the greenhouse effect; that is confirmed, not by the car industry, but by the British impact assessment, the Commission and the Swedish Environment Ministry. Setting the GWP at 50 would exclude all the alternatives to CO2 as refrigerants for mobile air-conditioning systems, but it is not for the legislator to prescribe one single technology to the industry. We should instead leave that to the engineers and promote competition between environmentally-friendly alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The core issue with the f-gas Regulation is its legal basis. There is no apparent reason why we should have different legal bases for stationary air-conditioning systems on the one hand and for mobile ones on the other. In both instances, we are dealing with product-oriented legislation for the internal market. If the confidence to plan ahead, legal certainty and common standards in the internal market are to be guaranteed, then the legal basis should be Article 95. This expresses a clear commitment to both high environmental standards and a functioning internal market in which all are subject to the same ground rules. At a time when we frequently find ourselves discussing better regulation, I would, in this specific instance, remind the House of the problems involved in transposing the electronic waste directive, which is based on Article 175. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When you consider what we are up against and the way in which the fluorinated gas industry is lobbying us at the moment, it is simply hair-raising. They misinform us when they, for example, talk about its being more energy-efficient to use their poisonous gases. The fact is, just about all energy-efficient refrigerators, that is to say those rated AA+ and A++, use natural coolants rather than these gases. Nor is it the case that there are no alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">By virtue of tough legislation and industry that is up-to-date and well disposed towards the environment, we in Denmark have in actual fact developed alternatives, and we can say that, in general, we are in a position to comply with the most stringent requirements. It would be completely scandalous if we were knocked back again by an old-fashioned sunset industry that thinks only of itself. Let me just say a word, finally, about mobile gases. When you consider how few countries in the world actually need air conditioning in cars, I do not see that there is any reason at all for there to be so much environmental pollution from this source. It is ludicrous that we cannot get something done about this too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A direct ban, as has been implemented in Denmark, would be best. As Mrs Auken said, Danish industry has got used to the ban and is developing environmentally friendly alternatives. However, neither the Commission’s nor Mrs Doyle’s proposal refers explicitly to this viable ban.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Doyle deserves praise for using the minimum provisions of Article 175 instead of the internal market’s total harmonisation. We know that she has been under heavy pressure, but Mrs Doyle’s proposal is scarcely enough to preserve the Danish ban. Together with Mr Blokland, I have therefore tabled Amendment 45, which specifies that all countries should be permitted to go further in protecting the ozone layer against fluorinated gases. I want to be satisfied that we can keep our ban and thus the incentive to create sustainable alternatives. We know that the Commission administers Article 175 very strictly and always wants to see uniform rules instead of supporting those countries that wish to lead the way. The Commission represents total harmonisation rather than promotion of the environment, the hole in the ozone layer rather than the ozone layer itself and the past rather than our common future. I would therefore call on all my fellow Members to support Amendment 45. It reads: ‘This Regulation shall not prevent Member States from maintaining or introducing stricter protective measures’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a fellow-Member of the same group, I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for the outstanding work she has done. The message that this Common Position carries from us to the world at large is a positive one. We are showing ourselves to be taking the Kyoto Protocol’s targets seriously, and endeavouring to be an example to the rest of the world in this respect – an example of how to pursue ambitious climate targets and make less use of f-gases.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, have been glad if this House’s Legal Affairs Committee had done as it needed to do and produced its opinion in good time, in order that we might have a few pointers on the legal position. I am myself in favour of the dual legal basis using Articles 95 and 175, as described in the Common Position – not, I have to say, out of any antipathy towards the environment, but because I would like to see the whole of the European market, and Europe’s environment too, maintained and developed in accordance with the same high standards.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to have a common legal basis, I see Article 95 as a good starting point, for it enables us to find more common ground than we would if we followed Article 175 and left too many options open to the individual Member States.

If we are to achieve the Kyoto goals and move towards sustainable development, it is desirable that the regulation we are discussing today should enter into force without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">In his speech, Commissioner Dimas said that the intention was that the adoption of this piece of legislation should send out a positive signal, but that is possible only if either Community-wide targets are ambitious and stringent enough – and we know that that cannot be said of this proposal – or if we take Article 175 as our legal basis and thereby offer those Member States that have already gone further the opportunity to implement a more rigorous and more environmentally-friendly policy that will be beneficial to the climate.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been pointed out that both Austria and Denmark have adopted general bans on the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases, and it is clear from the experiences of both these countries that alternatives to such gases exist. Reference was also made to a comprehensive study by the German Federal Office for the Environment, which shows that there is potential for reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and the use of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must use this legislation to ensure that more rigorous regulations can be retained. That is important if the Member States are to be enabled to meet the obligations imposed on them by the Kyoto Protocol. This option also reflects a legal opinion given by Parliament’s legal service, according to which Article 175 is the right and proper legal basis. It would also, in effect, send a positive political signal if we were to refrain from bringing back into line those countries that are already taking action that is more likely to prevent damage to the environment and to the climate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must replace fluorinated gases with safer alternatives and take real action towards stopping their release into the environment. However, it would be counterproductive to ban these gases in such a way that we simply destroy European companies, while simply moving manufactured products that use F-gases to countries that do not ban them, countries that may even see an EU ban on fluorinated gases as an opportunity to capture the refrigeration and other related markets. The whole globe shares the same ozone layer.</p>
<p class="contents">Phasing out the use of fluorinated gases in favour of competitive alternatives is an important step towards making real environmental progress. However, in phasing out substances, we must also ensure that existing F-gases are not simply released into the environment. Regulation of F-gases has led to toxic graveyards of leaking fridges in some countries.</p>

That is why I think it is best if it is taken with caution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will need to table an assessment report in a few years’ time, and the important measures that are now being proposed must also have the chance of being implemented in the sector. As science and technology develops, it will become evident whether additional restrictions are viable, and more analyses are required for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the sector involved is a global industry, and since goods must be able to circulate freely in and out of the EU, it is impossible for each country to impose its own rules. We must prevent disparity between the different legislations from leading to different playing fields for the market operators. That is why it is also important to state that a happy balance should be struck between solid environmental progress and not too many restrictions for the internal market. This is best accommodated, in my view, by the mixed legal basis proposed by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also the ideal approach in the framework of which research and development can be stimulated on a large scale. The EU sets out the guidelines that guarantee the responsible use of the f-gases and the sector can further develop research in a creative manner. Consequently, it is wholly unacceptable to us if at present, more unviable restrictions were to be imposed on the sector unilaterally, without consultation, on applications for which there are insufficient alternatives available or for which alternatives are not more energy efficient, taking into consideration the environmental cost as a whole, if possible within the provisions of Article 175.

It seems to me that low-volume cars are often high-spec cars with all kinds of features and I wonder what the Commission thinks about the amendment to somehow exempt them from the requirement of having sound technology for mobile air-conditioning.</p>
<p class="contents">On the regulation, I think you have heard that the consensus view in Parliament is going to be in favour of Mrs Doyle’s approach, and I am very loathe to use EU legislation to reduce environment standards in different Member States. We have heard from colleagues from different countries who have said they feared this would happen. We need the Council, the Commission and Parliament to bang their heads together to get a resolution on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, I am also loathe to agree, when we come to vote, on a series of prohibitions on the use of F gases, which have not been tested or assessed for their health and safety, nor for their economic or environmental impact. Although many of the letters from lobbyists on both sides of the argument may well be valid, before we ban things, we ought to have proper assessments. Therefore, Commissioner, I agree with what you said when you spoke about the prohibitions and the need for them to be examined and to come forward in the review.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mrs Doyle for her work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been a very interesting debate. I also thank Commissioner Dimas.</p>
<p class="contents">As I came here to speak tonight, the Committee on Legal Affairs was only beginning to consider – as is its duty – the proposed change in the legal base in the common position. I should like to put on record that it was considered, but without much debate at all, and the Members of the Legal Affairs Committee were never even advised that Parliament's legal opinion to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was that the dual legal base would not withstand a challenge before the ECJ.</p>
<p class="contents">They agreed that the dual legal base, as proposed in the common position, should remain. But our clear legal advice is that this will not withstand a challenge before the European Court. On that basis and according to what everyone else has said, I appeal to colleagues for support for the legal base of Article 175 tomorrow, with the proper Commission policing – please – of the internal market, as required of them under Article 176. That is most important.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the better regulation announcement by President Barroso some weeks ago, the F-gases were mentioned in terms of impact assessment and analysis. The four-month time frame that we have in Parliament at second reading did not allow a proper teasing-out of exactly what was in the Commission's mind. It is unacceptable to ask us to pass this legislation – but we have no choice, because of the time frame – without a proper and full impact analysis, as many colleagues have requested, particularly in relation to bans. I do not, generally speaking, support the extra bans, particularly on SF6 and others. I am generally in favour of Article 175 but against extra bans. It is not acceptable at this point for that industry to bear that particular burden.</p>
<p class="contents">The political reality is that if we do not get a qualified majority for legal base Article 175 tomorrow – and we need a qualified majority for a second reading – the common position will remain: the dual legal base. That will be challenged before the European Court of Justice, as we have been told, and we know the countries that are going to do it. All legal advice tells us that they will find in favour of Article 175 as the legal base. So for those who do not want that to happen, ironically, they should support Article 175 tomorrow so that we go into conciliation and politically we decide the shape, which will not be purely Article 175 because there will have to be compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">We should decide in conciliation and not let the ECJ decide, even though I would be very optimistic that my personal opinion will come out of the ECJ. We are politicians; we want to decide it ourselves. Thank you for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stavros Dimas, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I have listened carefully to the speeches of the distinguished parliamentarians and I should like to make some comments on the specific amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments relating to the legal base of the regulation are of particular importance. Amendments 1, 4, 5 (first part) and 45 concern the establishment of Article 175, and Amendments 33 and 40 concern the establishment of Article 95 as the sole legal base.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has accepted, as part of the compromise, that the directive should be based on Article 95 alone and that the regulation should have a legal base of Article 175 and Article 95 in relation to Articles 8, 9 and 10. However, the Commission will closely follow further developments on this issue in both Parliament and the Council. I have most certainly taken note of your concerns on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 2 and 7 specify in Article 1, with a corresponding change to the recital, that specific actions are needed in order for Member States to reach their individual Kyoto emission targets. As I have already said, the Commission can support these amendments provided that the Member States do not infringe other Treaty obligations. Likewise, it can support Amendments 6 and 31 on the promotion of alternative technologies, provided there is a change to the text.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of amendments of a technical nature specifically addressing containment. The Commission can support most of those amendments, provided that in some cases there is a change in language to reflect the technical realities.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also agree in principle to Amendment 25, as regards the need to indicate the global warming potential on labels for the applications covered in this regulation, although we believe the issue of labelling would be best resolved by the Commission through the committee, after careful preparation.</p>
<p class="contents">The review provision is very important since the regulation is only a first step. In this context, we can be positive on some of the amendments that strengthen this review process. However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 27 and 30, which would require the Commission to provide a proposal by a specific date, irrespective of the findings of its review. This would undermine the Commission’s right of initiative with respect to legislative proposals and cannot be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot support Amendments 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 41, which introduce new ‘placing on the market bans’. The Commission has always stated that a full technical and economic evaluation is needed before establishing whether a product or equipment containing fluorinated gases should be prohibited. The review provides for this four years after the entry into force of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 26, which requires the use of HFCs only where safe, technically feasible, cost-effective and more environmentally sound alternatives do not exist, is also unacceptable. In practice, this would allow any Member State to do as it wished with respect to products containing fluorinated greenhouse gases, because there are no established criteria to determine that alternatives are safe, technically feasible and environmentally sound, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of other amendments that improve some of the general provisions of the regulation can be accepted. However, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 12, which provides a new definition of placing on the market. Although it supports the principle of Amendment 19 on the need to facilitate the shipment of recovered fluorinated greenhouse gases in the Community, the Commission believes it is unnecessary here since this matter is covered by the new waste shipment regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the directive, the Commission believes that Amendment 1 on fiscal incentives does not provide any new value added to the proposal. Member States are already allowed to grant fiscal incentives, provided that they comply with state aid rules, particularly the guidelines on state aid for environmental protection, as well as on Commission notice on the application of the state aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation. The same goes for Amendment 2, as the 1999 directive already requires Member States to ensure that the label indicating carbon dioxide emissions is affixed on all new cars for sale in the European Union. However, as part of its review of this directive, with a view to making an amending proposal in 2006, if necessary, the Commission will also investigate the possibility of including on the label information on the greenhouse gas effect of mobile air conditioners. This will cover information regarding both the refrigerant used and the impact on fuel consumption. I believe this will satisfy all concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the new amendments that have been tabled seeking to shift the final date in the common position from 2017 to 2016 will not be supported by the Commission, since we believe that the existing dates achieve our environmental ambition and would allow industry sufficient time for compliance. It is important that the phase-out is achieved in a smooth, effective and technologically sound manner.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the Commission believes that, given the relatively small environmental gain that would result from advancing the deadline for the phase-out, the case for a change is not justified. Likewise, we cannot support amendments that change the threshold for the global warming potential from 150 to 50, since this would in our view be determining the technology that the industry has to apply for little environmental gain. We also believe that the proposed exemption for small car producers is not compatible with the type-approval system.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, out of 45 proposed amendments to the regulation, the Commission can accept five fully, and a further 18 in principle or in part. For the directive, the Commission cannot support the 10 amendments proposed. I shall give a complete list of the Commission’s position on the amendments to Parliament’s Secretariat.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just like to add that, in a letter from the Director-General to Mr Florenz, the Commission has given details of the discussion we had in the college regarding the proposals pending before the legislator. This is just to provide Parliament with the existing available information, but no further economic studies are necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
