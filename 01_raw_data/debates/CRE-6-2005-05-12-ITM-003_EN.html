<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Enrique Barón Crespo (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">Author</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the question that I have the honour to present on behalf of the Committee on International Trade relates to the current state of our commercial relations with China.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, China’s entry into the WTO in 2001, which Parliament supported, was the result of a laborious negotiation in which the European Union played a very important role. There were no precedents for the entry of a commercial partner whose rules were at such variance with the common system.</p>
<p class="contents">We should remember that to join the WTO was an objective actively pursued by China for ten years, to which end it carried out a series of detailed concessions in all sectors, it committed itself to fulfilling all of its obligations and accepted the monitoring of that compliance. This has been expressed repeatedly by Chinese leaders, particularly since the policy implemented by Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, the predictions of generalised conflict with China have not come true. Nevertheless, recurrent problems arise in fields such as the protection of intellectual property — the fight against forgeries and counterfeits — the transparency of legislation, standardisation and certification, the openness of services, in particular financial services, telecommunications and transport, and numerous non-commercial obstacles, such as the CCC, the notorious China Compulsory Certification, which is almost impossible to obtain. The essential issue, however, is that China has to deal with a significant contradiction: to open up its markets and to protect its own industry, within a context in which rules such as the application of the ILO conventions on child labour, the establishment of free trade unions, etc. do not fall within the context of the WTO, but are important, as is environmental protection, and in this regard I would like to point out that China signed the Kyoto protocol two years ago now.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently in a situation in which it appears that China is operating extremely close to the limits of what may be acceptable. And the case of textiles, which other Members have mentioned, is an example of this, since it is affecting many countries and not just the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not advocating that we call into question the decision taken on 1 January on total liberalisation, but rather that we examine, for example, the possible significance of a policy of dumping in terms of invading markets, how energy can be subsidised, how funding policy is being applied and whether there is privileged funding, etc. These are important issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Another specific and very significant example is the recording industry, which is facing a very dramatic situation in Europe. At the moment, the majority of pirating, almost 70 %, takes place in China and much of it is taking place on the Internet. Furthermore, it is almost impossible to receive royalties, because structures do not even exist.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to point out that the European Union has supported China's integration into the world economy. This is a challenge for everybody that requires a process of economic and social reform on an unprecedented scale. China still has ten years to complete its transition to a market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, it is the case that China has already moved from a centrally-planned economy to an economy which appears to be governed by Manchesterian capitalism led by Communist mandarins. It is for the Chinese to take charge of their own development, but it is important that we have control involving the greatest possible transparency and knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, Mr President, we have reached the final phase of the Doha negotiations, which must be concluded in Chinese territory, in fact, with such decisive issues as the openness of its economy, the exchange rates of its currency and stability in a part of the world in which a very alarming arms race is taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, China plays an important role in the Club of Twenty, which brings together some of the great tenors of the new world stage, and because of its history, because of its weight and also because the European Union has advocated that China should be incorporated into world trade, I believe that it makes sense at this point to ask these questions, taking the view that we are all in the same situation regardless of our specific characteristics, but that we must respect each other in order to survive together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peter Mandelson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to respond to this debate. It is important. It raises some very serious issues for us, and I am very glad this initiative has been taken. I am also very grateful to the distinguished chairman of the Committee on International Trade for making his points in such a balanced and moderate, but no less serious way.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that we have a great challenge on our hands to bring about the progressive integration of China to the global economy and to the international trading system. We also have a responsibility to those whom you represent, and to whom others of us are accountable and are answerable, to smooth these changes in the best way we possibly can.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that in one sense China is testing the limits of what is acceptable, as the honourable Member said. Another way of putting it, however, is that China is presenting a competitive challenge to us in Europe to which we need to adjust. Now many have. In some cases though that adjustment remains to be made and we have to assist people in doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">My broad view is that China’s renaissance in recent years brings with it many implications for the European Union and it is essential that we equip ourselves properly to deal with these challenges. I believe that China’s astonishing economic growth will be good, not only for China but also for Europe and for the rest of the world. That makes it all the more important that we build the sort of dynamic relationship with China that is based on partnership, cooperation and respect, not just for each other, but for a rules-based multilateral economic system.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against that backcloth that I want to address two sets of issues this morning: first of all, the appropriate response we need to make to textiles imports from China and, secondly, what we need to do to continue to push China on its WTO implementation record and in particular its record of enforcement of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall first address the issue of textiles. The level of textiles imports and the dramatic increase that we have seen since the beginning of this year, when textile quotas were finally removed, has become a very sensitive topic in many of our Member States. There are many who have serious concerns and anxieties. It is clear why and I understand those anxieties. I am confident that our response is both appropriate and proportionate, but also legally defensible. We have to satisfy both those requirements, basing our response on facts and data. We need to act with a degree of caution, but also determination.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission guidelines on the use of a safeguard mechanism were intended to equip us to respond effectively to any unreasonable surge in imports from China. As I am sure you know, the Commission has now launched investigations into nine categories of Chinese textile exports to the EU based on import statistics for the first quarter of this year. In all these categories, import volumes for Chinese textiles have now risen above the ‘alert levels’ defined by the Commission. I always said that I would act on the basis of the relevant data and I am doing so now.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the alert mechanism has been activated, I have set up an experienced task force to conduct a full and rapid investigation into these named categories. It will reach its conclusions within a maximum of 60 days. This investigation will determine whether market disruption in Europe and elsewhere really has occurred. We will also have to consider the actual damage to producer interests, set against the consumer benefits involved. If it proves necessary and justified, I will use the safeguard powers at our disposal. A number of other categories appear to give cause for concern, but after careful consideration I have decided that further analysis of the data is required. This is being undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there have been requests for the application of the urgency procedure foreseen by the guidelines. This would mean going directly to formal consultations with China under the WTO without an investigation, if there is evidence that irreparable damage will be caused to EU industry in the absence of such a course of action. My services are currently analysing these requests.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, I have actively engaged with the Chinese authorities to give them advance warning wherever possible, to urge them to provide concrete evidence that the measures they have put in place are having an effect, and to explore whether they cannot do more and indeed to urge them to do so. I have launched informal consultations with China in an attempt to find a sustainable solution for all parties. This was high on my agenda last week in Paris when I met with the Chinese Trade Minister Bo Xilai. My message to Minister Bo was that to avoid the EU having to take action, China needs to give a stronger response to curb its export growth in the short term. I believe that my message was received loud and clear.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted the statements made by the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao yesterday in Beijing and I would like to welcome the fact that China now understands the acute concerns of certain Member States, as Wen Jiabao acknowledged yesterday in Beijing, and that China prefers, as he said, a solution based on dialogue and cooperation. I also welcome the fact that China considers the need to resolve this issue as amongst China’s primary interests in relation to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I noted with particular interest the statement by Wen Jiabao that, in addition to the measures already taken to curb textiles export growth, China will take even stronger measures in the near future. I welcome this, but I also believe that the effects need to be felt quickly if they are to stay our hand in any action that we might consider taking. It is imperative that China explain in detail, and quickly, the type of additional measures it intends to adopt and what consequences these will have on future trade flows. I am looking forward to receiving such information as a matter of great urgency. Failing to receive such concrete information quickly would narrow the options available to the EU to resolve this issue and could leave me with no alternative other than to act under the WTO. I have a team of officials in Beijing this week. They are meeting Chinese counterparts as we speak now, to follow up on my discussions with Minister Bo last week and on yesterday’s statements by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to other matters concerning WTO implementation. This is important because the WTO agreement is the lynchpin for the development of our trade relations with China. China has made substantial progress in implementing its WTO commitments, as set out in its accession agreement, but some issues still raise concerns. I am addressing these in both a bilateral and multilateral context.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions have met with considerable success in a number of areas, in particular on coke, the construction and automobile sectors, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures. However, concerns still remain in the automobile sector, in services sectors such as banking, and in telecommunications. I raised these and pursued them when I was in Beijing earlier this year and I will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept that a particular area of concern is the need to ensure an adequate and efficient level of protection in China of intellectual property rights. China has shown willing, but the continuing difficulties encountered by European industry in terms of counterfeiting and piracy have made clear that more work is needed. I am addressing this issue on two fronts, using a combination of political pressure and cooperation, both bilaterally and on a multilateral level. I am determined to give practical answers to industry’s concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">We took an important step forward when the Chinese recently agreed to my proposal to set up an Intellectual Property Working Group. The intention here is to address problems in a systemic way and on a sectoral basis. It will include experts from business who know where the delivery problems in China’s laws exist. But IPR is a worldwide problem, and it therefore requires consideration on a global level.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the WTO, the EU, as well as the US and Japan, used the 2004 Transitional Review Mechanism to challenge China on its implementation record of its obligations in respect of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, otherwise known as TRIPs. The answers given by China demonstrate its commitment to the fight against counterfeiting and piracy, but further efforts are obviously needed and I am committed to helping China make those further efforts. The EU has also suggested that the Review Mechanism could be usefully complemented by a multilateral discussion within the TRIPs Council, and I intend to follow this up.</p>
<p class="contents">But I also believe that continuing to share our expertise by providing technical assistance on intellectual property is an important element of our work with China. We have recently concluded an EC-China Agreement on customs cooperation. Another example of assistance is EU financing of training on trademarks for judges. These are just two instances of the sort of cooperation that will help China build a sound and coherent enforcement system. Finally, I would encourage European industry to make use of all available tools in the EU and in China to protect its own rights and put the system to the test.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the level of cooperation and partnership that China and the EU are demonstrating in these areas are the building blocks for a dynamic and more effective relationship between us. Nobody should underestimate the huge potential gains and benefits for us in Europe of such a relationship growing and being soundly based. There are obviously going to be challenges ahead, and I will ensure that the EU responds in a timely and effective manner. But there will also be great opportunities for European industry and producers to supply into that rapidly expanding Chinese market. If we can work together to ensure that a rules-based economic system is respected and strengthened in the DDA, then the rapid economic growth in China will benefit the EU and the rest of the world. That is why in responding to the question originally put, I say again that we have to combine our short-term management of the problems that are thrown up by China’s expansion with a clear-sighted, longer-term perspective of the opportunities that China’s growth offers Europe.</p>

This being so, I would like to put a number of questions to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, last year saw 9 000 court cases in China involving product piracy. That is a good start. What is the Commission going to do to support the Chinese in their efforts to this end?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, although sentences are handed down, they are often not carried out. How will the Commission support the Chinese authorities in enforcing the sentences passed on product pirates?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, products exported from China are often in breach of patents and copyright. During Question Time on 8 March, Commissioner Kovács assured me that the EU would offer to send customs officers to China at the EU’s own expense to help their Chinese counterparts in their work. Has this offer in fact been made to the Chinese, and how have they responded to it?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, a steam iron made in China, which bore the CE label but did not meet the relevant standards, recently caused the deaths of two people in Greece. What will the Commission do to get the Member States, without delay, to put in place effective market controls preventing such products from being put on sale and compelling the Chinese manufacturers to comply with standards and patents?</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, there are to this day in China many obstacles to European firms. What does the Commission propose to do in order to effectively remove these barriers to trade, most of which do not take the form of tariffs?</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, modern weapons contain the most modern of technologies. What adverse effects on businesses and jobs in Europe does the Commission anticipate if the embargo on weapons – and on the transfer of associated technologies – is lifted?</p>
<p class="contents">Seventhly, what is the Commission actually doing to induce China to allow its currency’s exchange rate to find its own level? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I very much welcome the safeguards that have been put in place, and I hope that you can obtain reliable data, including reliable data from the individual Member States. As I see it, Romania is one example of how it is not that simple to get your hands on reliable data. I hope that you will then not delay in bringing that data to the Committee on International Trade, so that we who sit on that Committee can discuss it with you and advise you on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I also rejoiced to hear that you had, in your speech in Singapore on 29 April, revived an old initiative of this House, that being the demand for closer cooperation between Europe and Asia. This House did once advocate a free trade area and urged that it should at least begin with one state. While we now have a very strong presence in Latin America, there are other regions, Asia in particular, that we have been positively culpable in neglecting. I agree that, where China is concerned, we are paying a bitter price for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Our major concern – of which textiles might be described as merely a ‘super-example’ – is the unfair competition that, for various reasons, exists in China. Competition may be deliberately unfair, or the unfairness may very well be involuntary. What do you propose to do about it? What can actually be done to ensure that enquiries take a good hard look at such things as disguised subsidies? You also mentioned intellectual property rights, but there is a good deal more to it than that.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a particular case that you have been considering for a very long time. I would be grateful if you were to say something about it. This case, moreover, has to do with non-ferrous metals, and this House has for some considerable time been calling for an enquiry into disguised subsidies for these. In China, in particular, reimbursement of VAT is used to support the local recycling industry. What progress has been made with enquiries into this? Might I ask you to say something about this?</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from all that, it is a good thing that you have done something about investment. We are right behind you in that respect and wish you plenty of success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That decision was taken about a month after the United States had swung into action.</p>
<p class="contents">Time and again, the Commissioner has said that trade with China should be seen as a challenge rather than a threat. Indeed it should be, and I think the European textile industry is prepared to do so, provided, though, that the trading game is played correctly on both sides. In countries such as China, unfair trade practices, including export subsidies, dumping prices, direct and indirect government support, free capital and illegal imitations and piracy, are endemic. This aggressive trade policy is making the European textile and clothing sector crack at the seams. And yet, Commissioner, this sector is still an extremely important industrial sector, with a total turnover of EUR 200 billion spread across 177 000 businesses that, post-enlargement, employ 2.7 million textile workers, equivalent to 7% of the total industrial workforce. In fact, not only Europe, but also a large number of developing countries, are at risk of collapsing under China’s aggressive export policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of last year, this House urged us to pursue a more assertive trade policy in respect of China. That import figures would be alarming could already be deduced from the import products without quota. I hope that the measures now announced by the Commission will not prove to be too late in the day, and, above all, that they are merely a first step towards protecting our industry, in a manner acceptable to the WTO against unfair competition, from wherever that may come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have already heard about the impact of the surge in textile imports on the EU and the devastation some EU producers face as a result. But let us not forget the impact on other developing countries. China’s deflationary pressure is already driving down wages right across the developing world and pushing global suppliers to reduce their workers’ rights and conditions in a bid to remain competitive at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Philippines, for example, the government has ruled that its law on the minimum wage would not longer apply to the clothing industry. In Bangladesh, the government recently announced that it would increase the number of authorised overtime hours and reduce the restrictions on women’s night work. Chinese workers themselves do not necessarily have much to gain either, facing seven-day working weeks, very low wages, appalling health and safety hazards and no trade unions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are looking here at a downward spiral of social and environmental standards; certainly minimum international standards might help stem that downward spiral. It is most important for this debate not just to focus on this or that sector, textiles today or footwear or machine components tomorrow. What we are looking at here is a systemic problem. It is a challenge posed by a country that has entered the international trading system not just with a comparative advantage but with potentially an almost absolute advantage in just about everything. It is complacent and patronising to assume that Europe and the West can keep a monopoly on innovation and high-tech while China simply does the manufacturing.</p>
<p class="contents">Chinese graduates are also moving up the value-added chain. Very soon we may need to face the possibility that there could be very little that Europe could produce that China cannot produce more efficiently. The old assumption that while the EU and the industrialised countries keep the leading edge in knowledge-intensive industries while developing nations focus on lower-skill sectors, is now open to huge debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The response to the challenge posed by China needs to include a thorough reassessment of the assumptions that have underpinned international trade theory up until now. We need to look again at the old ideas dating from David Ricardo onwards that comparative advantage always works in everybody’s best interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Commission will act swiftly on textiles. I would also like to hear what the Commissioner plans to do about these longer-term systemic issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a more balanced view than this oral question suggests. We should be looking at some of the impacts of liberalisation on China itself, because there is ample proof to suggest that many of the poorest people in China face significant losses themselves, particularly in the agricultural sector, as a result of China’s accession to the WTO. So let us have a more balanced view; a view that looks into the future as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Their discourse seeks to disguise the fact that it is the large economic groups who stand to gain the most from the current liberalisation of world trade. They are the ones who relocate their production in search of higher profits; they are the ones who, owing to their domination of distribution, come away with the lion’s share.</p>
<p class="contents">The textiles and clothing sector is an example of this alarming situation. China was not to blame for the way in which the WTO talks on the textiles and clothing sector were conducted; the Commission and the Council were. China is not responsible for the over-valuation of the euro, which exacerbates the problems and hampers the competitiveness of the textiles and clothing made in EU countries. It is the Council and the Commission, not China, that have thus far failed to activate the safeguard clause, in spite of the appalling situation that the EU’s textiles and clothing sector is currently enduring, particularly in countries such as Portugal. Instead, they delay this crucial decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask the following questions: When will safeguard clauses be activated? When will there be a revision of the Commission’s mandate for WTO talks? What we must do is suspend and reverse the current policies on trade liberalisation. What we must do is ensure a level playing field for trade, by introducing a system that is geared towards genuinely and sustainably developing each country’s potential, a system that is not based on dominance and dependency, a system that is thus geared towards urgently improving the standard of living for people across the world and towards guaranteeing their rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To put it succinctly, it pits the advent of cheaper textile imports against the maintenance of our own textile sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I understand that Commissioner Mandelson has to steer a middle course between those in favour and against measures against China, I think it is far too late to launch an investigation now. The Commission should have utilised the past few years to develop a position on an unencumbered global textiles market and a policy towards that end. I think that discussion on the temporary introduction of protective measures should focus on the period after 2008 if this House is not to end up having exactly the same debate in three years’ time. The period until 2008 should be used to start a dialogue with the Chinese authorities –a dialogue with the dual purpose of underlining both the importance of a stable global textiles market and China’s WTO obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the WTO grants China rights, but also requires that it tackle, for example, restricted market access in the services sectors in banking and telecommunications. I wish the Commissioner much perseverance in his negotiations with his Chinese opposite numbers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On top of that, there is the footwear industry and other sectors all in line to be hit by the Chinese tsunami effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The end of import quotas owing to the expiry of the Multifibre Agreement, the entry into force of the EU-China bilateral agreement of 2000 and the counterfeiting of the EC trademark were the subject of three questions that I addressed to the Council and the Commission on 6 January of this year. Concerned by the consequences, I sought to find out what provisions the Commission intended to adopt, given that the principles upon which the WTO rules are based (the environment, work, non-harmful products, counterfeiting) were being violated by China.</p>
<p class="contents">The replies were of a provisional nature and, even today, the Commission – perhaps a prisoner of a mistaken rigour in interpreting the law – behaves more like a notary than a political, governing body. To all of the above must be added the impact that the REACH Regulation will have on the competitiveness of businesses: Europe is anxious to apply and to export an increasing number of principles and values, which is entirely proper, whilst China and other countries are concerned to produce tights, shoes, knitwear and suchlike at low cost and export them to Europe, with the gratifying outcome for Europe of witnessing the progress and higher levels of employment achieved by exporting countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The picture would appear almost complete if we consider that relocations favour large European companies, but impoverish Europe, whose white collar workers and capital, together with equipment and machinery, are emigrating elsewhere, leaving thousands of unemployed workers clinging to the dream of social values.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe of knowledge, research and innovation cannot be divorced from the Europe of competitive production. It is a matter of cause and effect. A distinguished and most humble monk, Saint Benedict of Nursia, was fond of repeating the words ‘Pray and work’ to each of his brothers, in order that the abstraction of prayer did not distract from the reality of life. We must reflect on the extensive resources that we still possess, on the very many regions addressed in Objective 1, and on the support policies.</p>
<p class="contents">A new strategy needs to be drawn up, and we need to additionally consider the poverty and needs that exist in Europe itself, including its requirement for harmonious development. We need to assess, moreover, whether vulnerable regions can truly hope for genuine development and whether they can attract European companies to relocate onto their soil. That would perhaps be possible if well-equipped business districts and a modern system of tax breaks were created in those very regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In international trade, two contradictory elements need to be reconciled: firstly, and obviously, the need to trade and therefore to remove barriers; and, secondly, the need to ensure that jobs and social benefits are secure.</p>
<p class="contents">In pro-am golf, this problem is resolved by giving the professional a handicap. In international trade, the handicap of customs duties had been created. With the GATT and the WTO, decisions have, however, been taken since 1947 firstly to reduce the duties and then to abolish them. Article 341 of the Constitution confirms this.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the upshot of this is the Chinese affair. The solution, Mr Mandelson, is to invent a new customs technology. Instead of reducing and abolishing duties, you, Commissioner Mandelson, need to propose to the WTO that it reduce duties. In this way, the importer would make a customs credit – a kind of economic drawing on the importer’s economy - available to the exporter.</p>
<p class="contents">The system would impose a duty on Chinese textiles coming into Europe and provide China with a customs credit which could only be used for purchasing products that had emerged from the European economy. In this way, a virtuous circle would be created. The system would resemble the compensated contracts, offshore contracts and Marshall Plan systems but, in this case, the credit is made available by the customs duty itself. The thorny problem of relocations would thus be resolved in terms of a new customs technology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A few months later, we are returning to over-protectionism, both on the part of the European Union and on the part of the United States of America. Many, moreover, have lost no time in calling this trade attack 'Chinese fever'. In truth, if you think about it properly, this is a war, not a war of impressions, but a war of substance at all levels, which is aggravating Europe's and the United States' relations with Beijing.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to comment on one fact here: in the first quarter of 2005, China's economy grew at a rate of 9.5%, due to the explosion in exports, which rose by 35%, increasing China's foreign currency reserves to just over 650 million dollars. We are therefore debating an economic, historical, cultural and commercial behemoth which today appears to be awakening from a long slumber.</p>
<p class="contents">Today China is showing its real strength and its limitless potential in the commercial sector, in trade, in exports, in technology and, in particular in goods, the raw materials for which traditionally have a history which goes back centuries for this country of mysticism with its volcano beneath the ground which is ready to explode.</p>
<p class="contents">The attention of the European Union and its vigilance in passing resolutions on relations with China are welcome here because:</p>
<p class="contents">- firstly, 9 categories of Chinese products are currently the subject of investigation;</p>
<p class="contents">- secondly, China is becoming stronger and stronger on the world political scene;</p>
<p class="contents">- thirdly, the European Union is China's most important trading partner and China is the European Union's second most important trading partner. Consequently, we have strong ties with this country;</p>
<p class="contents">- fourthly, China can prove its commitment to WTO rules by improving its legislation on intellectual property and thus controlling imitations and</p>
<p class="contents">- fifthly, with this approach and current rates, the WTO estimates that China will have 3/5 of exports in 2015, a position which it held for a thousand years, from 500 to 1500 A.D.</p>

I believe that his approach is absolutely admirable. He has managed to resist the pressure on him to act precipitately. The approach that the Commission is taking is correct in terms of making sure that we have all our facts marshalled, that any action we take can be legally justified and, if there is a legal case for taking action, that action will be taken. That is the right approach. An alternative approach would have resulted in the EU being accused of being protectionist, it would have damaged our relations with China itself and, above all, it would have sent a very bad signal for the Doha Development Round. So his approach is correct.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add one caveat, however. The news today that America’s balance of payments has surprisingly improved might be good news for America, but underlying that there is a clear indication that imports from China have dropped dramatically and that the decline in Chinese imports includes a 21% reduction in textile imports. I do not want Europe to be seen as a soft touch. I do not want China to think that it has to respond to American pressure, but not to European Union pressure. So, if the statistics and facts justify EU action, I am sure the Commissioner will agree that he will have to take that action and send a very strong signal to China.</p>
<p class="contents">On other issues, I hope that the Commissioner – and I was pleased to hear his comments on this – will keep up pressure on China in terms of intellectual property rights. The Chinese justification that it is all too complicated, that the difference between regional, national and local structures makes it impossible for China to implement WTO rules, just does not wash because China can do it when it comes to protecting Chinese intellectual property. China should also be made to do it in relation to European intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good news that China is part of the WTO. It is good news that China has to respect rules. It is our job to make sure, in the long term, that it sticks to those rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have explained to us what you have done and what responses you await. Allow us to state that the opening of the inquiry seemed late in coming.</p>
<p class="contents">Worrying statistics were already reaching us in January, February, March and April, showing an abnormal – absolutely exceptional – increase in imports from China. The serious damage caused to the textile industry is obvious, and is one of the conditions cited by the WTO Treaties for implementing the safeguard mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that China is probing the limits of the application of the Treaty, and Europe must behave responsibly. We are all pleased at China’s entry into the WTO; we helped to achieve this objective. Commissioner, we are certainly not calling for protectionist measures or a return to the old ideas of import duties, but for a Europe that stands strong and firm in making China respect the rules to which it has itself subscribed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that this country – I am talking about China – is striving to become the manufacturing centre of the entire world. Today it is happening with the textile industry, tomorrow it will be the mechanical engineering industry and later on the electronics industry.

It is, then, hypocrisy to demand that we be protected against textile imports while ignoring the conditions in the oil and precious metals industries where there are not the same threats against European companies. What we should do is introduce fair tariffs across the board whereby manufacturers which do not comply with ILO requirements and environmental requirements are obliged to pay. These tariffs ought then to be returned to the developing countries in order to improve their environment and social situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it odd that we have to concentrate on protecting large companies’ intellectual rights in China when it is mainly human rights that need protection in China and when that is of course where we should be investing our energies. The transition from free to fair trade now demands reform of economic policy as a whole, however, so that trade becomes a tool for human beings, and not the other way around. The UN’s environmental protection organisation, UNEPO and the UN’s development programme, UNDP should call the shots where the World Trade Organisation is concerned, and not the other way around. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission played a leading part both in the signature of the multifibre agreement and at the WTO and it is on this basis that textile products are being imported from China.</p>
<p class="contents">The textile industry and cotton cultivation started to shrink in the Member States of the European Union many years before 1 January 2005, when imports of Chinese textile products were allowed, with painful consequences for the workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The WTO is an imperialist organisation which serves the interests of the multinationals and of big business, at the expense of the workers' interests. They set the particularly strict terms for the accession of China to the WTO, for the purpose, in other words, of opening up its markets, of liberalising the markets and of privatisation, so that they could exploit China's wealth-producing resources and workers. In exchange, China secured the free movement of its textile products.</p>
<p class="contents">The belated interest in workers in the textile industry and other sectors is being expressed at a time when the workers' wrath at and fight against the anti-grass roots policy of the European Union in the Member States is growing. The objective of this initiative is obviously to disorientate and appease the workers intending to vote NO to the European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">We also note that the warnings about limiting Chinese imports come at a time when pressure from the United States of America and the European Union on Beijing to break the fixed parity between the dollar and the yuan is culminating; in other words, the imperialist centres want China and the other countries of Asia as a huge consumer market for their goods, without any competition from them on international markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The danger emanates not from China, but from international competition on the part of the imperialists. We are fighting for international economic relations on an equal footing; we defend the right of the peoples to choose their own path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, this balance is altered when the ground rules of international trade are not respected. I want to speak first of all about the measures needed – in accordance, let us not forget, with the WTO agreements - to protect intellectual property. These measures help combat pirating and counterfeiting effectively. In order to guarantee the future of our textiles industry, it is now up to the European Union to ensure that the agreements protecting textile patterns and designs are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced, finally, with what is recognised as market disruption – I am referring here, of course, to what you yourself have confirmed is the spectacular development of Chinese textile products – we need to apply the legal instruments available to us within the framework of the WTO. Moreover, do you not believe, Commissioner, that it is now imperative, when all the indicators are in the red, to set in motion an urgency procedure enabling safeguard measures to be implemented? Why are you delaying so long, to the detriment of our industries and to the detriment of the industries in the countries close to us?</p>

It came from China and carried 5 100 containers, mostly containing textile goods.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people described it as the ship of unemployment, the job-destruction ship; nevertheless, a prominent business leader pointed out that our great challenge was to ensure that that ship did not return to China empty, but full of our products for that immense and growing market.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that that is the great opportunity facing us as Europeans. In order to make this possible, however, two conditions are essential. The first is that the openness of the markets and progress of exchanges should be of reasonable dimensions and that the textile sector should be assisted in its process of restructuring. We cannot allow the creation of a serious imbalance that will eventually destroy the European textile industry and have dramatic social consequences for many European regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that we all have to play according to the same rules and that conditions must be reciprocal. That includes compliance with the WTO agreements, which have been mentioned here by several speakers. We must also demand that the rules that we must all follow include respect for the ILO conventions and the protection of workers.</p>

It is for that reason that we welcome the imposition of safeguards. Compliance with the treaties must be tested and demonstrated.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, of course, China’s accession to the WTO has been a triumph not only for China itself, but also – and particularly – for us Europeans. We should at long last come to see the debate in its global dimension, and not just from the narrow Eurocentric angle. Commissioner Mandelson has tried to look at it globally. Calls are made for the return of trade barriers and for tighter controls, but these would be a slap in the face for the European manufacturers who have spent 10 years campaigning for a changeover from quota-based trade to more competition, and have now been successful. To return to the special arrangements would be to regress to protectionism, and that, now in particular, would send completely the wrong message.</p>

It was not until 2002, after China had joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), that it became possible for the EU to determine what the impact of gradual liberalisation would be. Prices fell by 40%, and China captured 75% of the market in a trice. There could probably have been no clearer indication that EU trade policy should change course. Yet that is exactly what did not happen, even though the Member States have entrusted the EU with exclusive power over trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At present China is ruthlessly crushing the poorest Asian and African countries, where textiles were key to survival. Dumping prices will mean that one million European textile manufacturers, including tens of thousands of women in the Czech Republic, will lose their jobs in areas where textiles are a traditional industry. It is not only the famed Chinese industriousness that makes such prices possible; they are also the result of minimal environmental and social standards, not to mention child labour, and state subsidies and China’s undervalued, state-controlled currency also play a part.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opening up our markets, yet textile manufacturers are barred from the Chinese market. The car factories are ample proof that the principle of cooperative ownership is being violated. I believe it should be quite clear from what I have said that the WTO rules are being breached.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must use any economic and political instruments it has left to force China to observe the rules of fair competition, both for the sake of sustainable development on our planet and for the sake of the values that prompt us to regulate the European market, even though we know that we are increasing the cost of producing goods in Europe and lowering our competitiveness in the process. If the EU wishes to boost public confidence in integration, it must form a united front and become a strong partner for the WTO, on a par with Japan, China and the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, the Council and also this House should view this as a duty, rather than a challenge. I am delighted that the Commission has realised that the impact of liberalisation needs to be mitigated, but it is not enough to impose 7% quotas for one year. I would urge the EU to make major changes to its foreign policy towards China, in order to ensure that this policy is in line with the long-term goals of the EU internal market. I very much hope that we can succeed in this task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must pay attention, however, to the textile industry, where I believe there is an issue emerging that is also political in nature. The importance of events is such that the citizens of Europe are looking to us with great anxiety to find an effective escape route that a united Europe alone can provide. They will not tolerate any kind of delay or even just the impression of involuntary powerlessness. It is therefore necessary to immediately adopt useful policies, as you have said. In addition to opening talks with the Chinese authorities, we must encourage the introduction of concrete provisions, such as labels of origin to encourage consumer awareness, and a more rigorous, intense fight against counterfeiting. Creativity, innovative technology, and team spirit among the institutions, industry, the social partners and the research world are, of course, equally necessary. I believe that this Parliament, together with you, will equally be ready to play its part in this possible breakthrough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

China is already one of the biggest trading powers in the world and its growth has positive repercussions on the development of many other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are indications and substantiated accusations that China is not fully honouring its obligations under its WTO accession agreement. It has maintained restrictions in domestic trade and in the distribution of goods, such as state subsidies, discriminatory tax concessions, administrative hurdles and obstacles to the establishment of and access to its market for foreign companies in the services sector. Furthermore, it is not applying in full the principle of national treatment. Similarly, there are serious delays in the application of WTO rules on the protection of intellectual, commercial and industrial property and on foreign investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of all this is reduced access for European companies and the blocking of European exports to the Chinese market whereas, on the other hand, the European market remains open.</p>
<p class="contents">In order not to upset trade relations between the European Union and China and to ensure that the voice of neo-protectionism does not prevail, the Commission is being called on to take other initiatives, so that there is a balanced result in bilateral trade, on the one hand, and any unfair practices are lifted, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">The first and best solution is to open further the Chinese market to European exports of industrial and agricultural products and services and, at the same time, to mitigate aggressive Chinese exports of certain products, such as textiles today, tomorrow cars or other products. The application of the safeguard clauses for which provision is made in China's accession agreement is a reasonable last resort, a reasonable <span class="italic">ultimum remedium</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The textile, clothing and footwear market provides us with an excellent example of how Chinese imports can destroy a market, and have a knock-on effect on other sectors. The first issue that needs to be addressed is the length of time it takes the Commission to act, as well as the fact that the misguided decisions it takes are not only damaging, but unfortunately sometimes also irreversible. The second issue relates to the liberalisation of the EU market, the consequences of which have included a sudden influx of subsidised imports, such as subsidised coal. This has led to price competition that has given rise to so much concern and has eventually ruined the coal market. This has made matters even worse for the mining industry, even though the efforts of the latter go towards meeting the EU’s energy needs. The third and final issue relates to the preferential trade agreements concluded when the EU still had only 15 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to revise the customs agreement and the preferential quotas, taking the interests of the enlarged EU into account, as at present the trade displacement effect does not always give rise to the relevant creation effect. By way of example, agricultural and food products from the United States are still keeping goods from the 10 new Member States off the EU market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this rate, it is expected that some 2 000 jobs will go by the end of this year, and if nothing is done, this will continue in the years to come. Allow me to quote two figures, Commissioner, which I received this morning. These are figures that reflect the increase of Chinese imports in Belgium over the past quarter, from January to April 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Imports of Chinese jumpers have increased by 747% and of men’s trousers by 2000%, which adds up to a 20-fold increase. The European – and Belgian – textile and clothing businesses have, nevertheless, largely adapted to the new competition. They have specialised in a number of products, God knows how many, and are thus attempting to respond to the new threat and get their punches in first. Unfortunately, Commissioner, it is extremely difficult to arm yourself against an opponent who resorts to unfair dumping practices, as has been mentioned several times this morning, and illegal counterfeit practices in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">An increasing number of European textile companies are faced with shameless and illegal imitations produced by their Chinese competitors. I am delighted to hear this morning that you are determined to tackle this scourge. The question is how quickly you want to act because figures over the past few months show that the situation is critical. You said this morning in your introduction that you would like to further analyse the information. What exactly do you mean by this? I hope that this does not mean further delays.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is not intended to prompt you, Mr Mandelson, into taking protectionist measures against China, on the assumption, of course, that such a thing is possible at this stage. This is an appeal to make it clear to our Chinese friends that dumping and counterfeiting have no place in Europe and are far from being fair trade practices. It is up to you, the Commission, to see to it that this is done. Mr Mandelson, the employers and workers in Europe’s textile and clothing businesses are relying on you. Please do not let them down any longer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a Vice-President of the International Textile, Clothing and Leather Workers’ Association, I am only too familiar with the present situation, and with the potential social consequences of the job losses that are threatened. The degree to which the Member States are prepared to meet the new situation does indeed vary widely.</p>
<p class="contents">That there is ever-increasing interpenetration of goods in the global economy is self-evident, and it is of course the case in China too. Even I can see that, but the rate at which trade is currently being liberalised, accompanied by exports increasing at an unheard-of rate, does of course jeopardise everything. In Europe alone, over a million jobs are seriously at risk, while on a global scale – and this I say with my vice-presidential hat on – over 30 million textile workers are under pressure, with the threat of their jobs going elsewhere. That is how things stand on the global market at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is, then, whether the majority of the EU of 25 will, for reasons of solidarity, throw their weight behind protection clauses and whether, now that the textile industry has cried out for help, it might also be possible to get the process speeded up. September might be too late. Today, it is the textile industry; tomorrow it will be someone else’s turn. It is in those terms that we appeal to you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We need to safeguard these measures by complying with international law and the rules of international trade and, more specifically, through China's protocol of accession to the WTO. However, in complying with it, not only we can, but also we must activate the textile safeguard clauses. Our strategy on textiles must, in my opinion, be based on competitiveness, quality and consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">For the purposes of consumer protection, I think we need to adopt measures to inform consumers about the attributes of products through appropriate labelling, for example with labels of origin, quality labelling, ecological labelling and, most importantly, labelling which indicates the effect of the product on the consumer's health.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as competitiveness and quality are concerned, I propose that research be reinforced and focus on:</p>
<p class="contents">a) high-quality innovative products,</p>
<p class="contents">b) creating research and development centres,</p>
<p class="contents">c) research into the effect of products on the environment and consumer health.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the Commission communication on textiles, which stipulates as a strategic objective that the production chain must be maintained in countries in the Euro-Mediterranean zone, so that resources do not ultimately disappear via these countries, I have the following comments to make:</p>
<p class="contents">- firstly, we need to help small and medium-sized enterprises established there to become more flexible and to respond better to consumer demands and</p>
<p class="contents">- secondly, the Commission needs to expressly undertake to facilitate trade within the Euro-Mediterranean zone by applying customs duties as quickly as possible and refusing to confine itself to the current bilateral transnational agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The statistics for the last period sent by the Member States to the Commission illustrated how critical the situation is.

This does of course increase Europe’s purchasing power. Europe already has the greatest purchasing power in the world, and cheap imports make us even stronger in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The other side of the coin is that people are paid very low wages in China and hence have very little purchasing power, so the low level of wages in China puts us at a disadvantage and makes it less likely that we will sell goods there. It is therefore vital that we should debate market access, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Such access to the market should be balanced and founded upon reciprocity, with both sides being able to learn from one another. In this respect, the negotiations that are currently in progress are of particular importance. It is also important that we in Europe should give some thought to what might happen if monetary parity were to begin to be subject to the operation of the market. The international financial markets are currently characterised by considerable movement and very marked oscillations, and it may be supposed that parity with China will become temporarily flexible, with inevitable consequences for our markets.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards subsidies, taxation and dumping, we should give some thought to how we can join with China in finding solutions together, and we should in particular make a start on trade facilitation in order to bring about more transparency in this area in future, making it possible for the customs authorities to work together and for a mutual relationship to be established, such as is customary for equal trading partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Each side should see what the other’s problems are and try to negotiate compromises.

<p class="contents">Let me say that, of all the contributions made since the opening remarks, if I had to identify one contribution with which I was most in sympathy and which most corresponded to my own views and approach, it would be that of Mr Calabuig Rull, because stressing that we need to see China as an opportunity as well as a potential threat and that the containers that are heading towards Europe with all these textiles and other goods and produce need then to be sent back to China filled with <span class="italic">European</span> goods and produce hits exactly the right note. When I talk about goods and produce I also mean a huge potential and expanding market for European services. I agree that we need to help the textiles industry in Europe to restructure and adapt, and we are giving that assistance. I agree that, if China is to have its own growth accepted by the international economic community, then it needs to reciprocate by opening its own markets to others’ produce and to comply with international agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also agree that, if, in the circumstances of this very sudden and very dramatic surge in Chinese exports, we have to take action on our side in order to manage this transition and to smooth these changes, then that action is open to us to take. It may be limited in terms of its content and its duration. None of us should exaggerate – especially for those who are directly concerned with these changes – what is at our disposal to do in order to counter this. At the very least, we can limit the growth of Chinese exports on a temporary basis. It is not open to us, under the WTO rules, to do more than that. However, where the facts justify our doing that, I, certainly, and my colleagues in the Commission will not shrink from doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy in a debate like this to talk in generalisations. What we cannot do is act in generalisations. We have to act on a case-by-case basis and on the basis of the facts. Why? Because we must act in a way that is legally defensible. The worst course of action for us in the Commission would be to act in a way that we could not subsequently defend, only to find ourselves challenged in the WTO and forced to reverse the actions we have taken. That would be a tremendous disappointment and setback for those who are most directly affected, and we must be careful. Therefore, we must enforce the rules, but we cannot invent the rules. That is what we must bear in mind throughout this.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, there is a mixed picture developing in terms both of the impact of import levels on particular commodities and categories of textiles and of the impact on production levels and employment within different parts of the European textiles industry. Not just in the United States, but in some cases also in Europe, import levels are falling. In other cases, Chinese imports and their growth are displacing the imports from third countries. So it is a mixed picture.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the impact of these trade flows on European production and employment, it is true that, in some cases, the impact appears to be dramatic, based on the facts that I was reviewing with my services only yesterday, facts, for example, from Greece, Portugal and Italy. There are some very disturbing developments. I have to take note of those and I have to base my future actions on those facts.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of some of our other Member States, I have yet to receive the relevant data and the relevant information. Even certain Member States at the forefront of the demands for me to adopt emergency and urgent procedure have not sent me the facts on which I could base such urgent action. However, I am sure it will be forthcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Caspary, Mrs Mann and Mr Martinez raised interesting questions and ideas, and I will write to them in response in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the statement made yesterday by the Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, in which he seems to have decided to give instructions to relevant government departments in China to prepare effective action to curb Chinese export growth, is welcome to me. We need, however, to look at the reality of these actions, when they are agreed, and consider the impact they will have. In the light of those, the Commission will consider what future action it will take from here on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The principle of dismantling the quantitative limitations of the multifibre arrangement was agreed in 1986 when the multilateral trade negotiations of the Uruguay Round were launched. At that time, China was not a big supplier of textiles and was not a member of the GATT. A lot of French textile companies had already relocated to North Africa or Egypt. When, moreover, the Uruguay Round agreements establishing the timetable and the method for dismantling the quantitative restrictions were signed in 1994, China was not a member of the new WTO, which it only joined in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Criticism of China cannot therefore conceal Commissioners’ and EU governments’ responsibility for the huge difficulties experienced by the textile industry and, unfortunately, extending to other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also scandalous is having agreed, in the name of world trade, to enter into agreements with the largest totalitarian country on the planet, and one which violates all the human, social and economic principles on which Europe is supposed to be built. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By admitting China, we also got Taiwan into the bargain as a member of the WTO, but, of great value though that is, it does not relieve us of the duty to remind China that it has to play by the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the question also arises, even if China were to adhere to the rules, of whether industries such as textiles in the EU could compete against low-wage countries. Europe must specialise, must concentrate on the production of high-quality products, and must focus on deploying high-quality labour. Only then can we handle the competition on the world market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
