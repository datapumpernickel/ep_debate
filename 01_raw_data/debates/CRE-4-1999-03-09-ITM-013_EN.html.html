I was concerned about its consistency in relation to the report I have the honour of presenting on Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the draft report has been voted through in the Committee on Budgets and – this is not just a personal opinion – I admit that it seems not only superfluous but also counter‐productive. And I say this whilst being fully aware of the work the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, has put into the report and the excellent hearing she organised where we all learned a great deal about own resources. But in my opinion, the Committee on Budgets has not reached the right conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, I am concerned that the Committee on Budgets has submitted a text to this House which, I might add, does not correspond to the proposed commitments the rapporteur was defending yesterday in the meeting. The text of the motion for a resolution never really gets off the ground and it is also confused. What are we really talking about here? In theory, we are discussing own resources. In practice, we are discussing national contributions. But this is an artificial problem. It was created by politicians themselves in the Member States but it lacks an objective basis and is strongly anti‐European. It has no legal basis whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty has for many years included the concept that the European budget should be financed wholly from own resources, without prejudice to other revenue. In 1992, the Treaty on European Union, which was signed by the Maastricht Council and ratified by all the national parliaments, including those of the countries that joined afterwards, repealed Article 200. This was the article relating to national contributions and their scale. For electoral reasons and in order to appeal to the masses, the subject has been brought up again. We are undermining European political integration with all our comparative injustices between countries, budget balances, cheques and cries of ‘I want my money back".</p>
<p class="contents">We talk about having more Europe, but some wish to see less Europe. This whole debate is leading to a renationalisation of the budget, and here I am not talking about cofinancing but rather about the general approach of the report by the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, this motion for a resolution misses the point. It is unable to get away from the perverse logic of national contributions and step up the debate. As I see it, it does not complete its task of showing the Council what the medium‐term objective should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, how often do we have to point out that citizens pay taxes, not countries? The main inequality has nothing to do with whether or not the level of contributions from Germany or the United Kingdom are fair, but rather that two citizens with the same income may contribute in totally different ways depending on the country they live in. As a result, it could be that the unemployed in Brandenburg are funding large estate owners in Andalusia.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we have a duty to ensure fair treatment insofar as every inhabitant of the European Union should contribute to the budget – this paltry budget that represents approximately 1.1 % of GNP – according to their income. This is the first injustice that must be rectified. One objective we must have is to introduce a straightforward and proportional European income tax. Yet what does the motion for a resolution suggest? It concentrates on national balances that lead to rivalry and that discourage solidarity. And, to top it all, it suggests cofinancing the CAP, an idea that was rejected by this very House in November and that was even rejected by the government that proposed it to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, my proposal may be utopian, as Mr Spinelli"s was, but the proposal in the report is an anachronism. It is 25 years out of date.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Christodoulou </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, the issue of own resources is, and always has been, extremely complex, as the system requires unanimity to change it and, above all, as improving its shortcomings by amending the current decision on own resources would give rise to other shortcomings and would most likely create new opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission itself accepts that the shortcomings of the system are not sufficient to motivate an urgent amendment of the decision on own resources and confines itself to putting forward alternative solutions to addressing the problem of financial imbalances, which was raised by some Member States. Mrs Haug"s report does not avoid this logic; it enlists the measures put forward in the short term solely to achieve the same objective, that is, to reduce the differences in contributions for the financing of Community expenditure, while in the medium and long term, it resorts to general recommendations. Mrs Haug has attempted to reconcile opposing views but unfortunately these remain as far apart as ever. In addition, we have focused all our attention on the issue of cofinancing agricultural subsidies and we have forgotten many other issues which we could have tackled and which, unfortunately, have gone by the board.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution proposed in the report therefore, which is the partial cofinancing of the common agricultural policy, despite assertions to the contrary, essentially boils down to the partial renationalisation of the common agricultural policy. This touches on a fundamental aspect of Community policy, which goes beyond the amendments this policy is called upon to undergo in the context of Agenda 2000 not only due to the planned enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe but also because of the commitments which the European Union has assumed in the context of GATT, which we are to some extent ignoring.</p>
<p class="contents">What this new provision contains, moreover, runs counter to the philosophy we would expect to govern a union in which the achievement of EMU would normally provide the impetus to aim for greater unification rather than lead to the adoption of the notion of correcting financial imbalances which arise from its operation and from the implementation of policies which were defined many years ago. The notion of net financial surpluses is therefore a retrogressive notion and must be abandoned by the European Parliament. Any direct or indirect attempt to cofinance the common agricultural policy must also be abandoned. An increase in the receipts of some Member States cannot be made on the back of the reduction of the receipts of other Member States. Nor can it have the character of a correction. Quite the contrary: it must be creative, in other words it must be the outcome of participation in existing or unfolding new policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it would be a sad fact if the logic of financial accounting were to dominate, especially at a time when the eyes of the people of Europe are on the European Parliament in view of the forthcoming elections, and if we were to give the impression that we were betraying policies and achievements of the European Union that were of long‐standing, great historical significance and of great importance in relation to issues which were fundamentally accounting solutions.</p>

It aims at the heart of the matter, as Agenda 2000 negotiations have reached a critical stage. For that reason I wish to thank Mrs Haug most sincerely for an excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">The report"s most important proposal concerns not EU income but expenditure, and suggests that the Member States should meet half the costs of the CAP. The proposal is a radical one and would have enormous consequences for the EU budget, which would shrink by some EUR 18 billion, approximately the cost of eastward enlargement. Thus the proposal would solve the financial problem threatening eastward enlargement. The common funding of agriculture would have an immense impact on net contributions. At a rough estimate, Germany"s net contribution would be reduced by approximately EUR 1 300 million a year and that of the Netherlands by approximately EUR 450 million, while the contributions of Spain, Greece and France would increase by EUR 1 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal would also have enormous consequences for matters of principle. If the point of departure here is for consumers to benefit from EU agricultural aid in the shape of reduced food prices, is it right that some producing countries should have to pay more? Would it not be fairer if all those benefiting also paid? From the point of view of the farmer, it is also a question of whether the new system will be as secure as the present one. The main question is whether the CAP should remain under the tightly‐controlled jurisdiction of the EU, with levels of aid at least stable, and nationally based aid which does not distort the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Haug"s report is an important addition to the Agenda 2000 debate, and to the ongoing preparation process for the next phase of the programme.</p>

The issue is the financing of EU enlargement. We are now fighting over who is going to pay for it. On that basis I would like to express an opinion which is important to me and from our point of view generally.</p>
<p class="contents">The total EU budget should not be increased by more than 1.27 %. The EU should not be given the powers to tax its citizens or collect taxes in the Member States: the money must be collected from the Member States themselves. The best basis for calculating how much each Member State should pay is GNP. I do not think it is out of the question to increase the share that agriculture itself contributes. It will only divide up EU income and expenditure in a new way, but we cannot object to that in principle.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blot </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR) </span>Mr President, this report gives us the opportunity to raise some important questions of principle regarding the financing of the European Union. In fact, the European Union"s so‐called ‘own‐resources" system – as it functions at present – seems to us to be dangerous for the taxpayer, as demonstrated by the changes in budgetary revenue in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Studies on the economic rationality of parliaments – particularly, for example, those carried out by Professor Buchanan, who won a Nobel prize – have successfully demonstrated that parliaments are always interested in increasing taxes, the burden of which is shared amongst all taxpayers whilst the expenditure itself can relate to an individual group, and benefit a specific group of politicians. Owing to this rationality, each elected Member of the European Parliament therefore receives payment for expenditure which he can make in his constituency, and he is not disadvantaged by the burden of having to pay taxes which are levied by the national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the bureaucratic machinery itself, most of which comes under the Commission, its interest in extending the tax system is obvious. Numerous studies have shown that when the members of the general public themselves vote for taxes by referendum, as is the case in Switzerland and some states in the United States, for example, they do not vote at all as parliamentarians or bureaucrats would wish them to. This tells us a great deal. Admittedly, however, such referendums can only take place at local or national level, and it is difficult to imagine a large‐scale referendum on tax taking place at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if we want to avoid an increase in tax, it would seem preferable for the Union to be financed through payments made by the Member States that would be fixed on the basis of unanimity and would put into practice the principle of ‘<span class="italic">juste retour</span> " in order to prevent tax increases. Our defence of taxpayers therefore leads us to reject the Haug report. Finally, we should point out that defending the taxpayer is at the heart of defending the freedom of nations.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Tomlinson </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, Mrs Haug's report represents a significant effort to draw together many differing strands of opinion. I want to congratulate her on that. However, she left me with a serious physiological dilemma: how to applaud her with one hand while gesticulating angrily to her with the other. A lot of her report deserves applause but she went somewhat awry when she tried to interfere in decisions that were made at Fontainebleau and were incorporated in the own resources decision, a decision which requires unanimity to change it. I speak on behalf of the British Labour Members on that major area of dissent.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom rebate was created because of the inequity of our net contribution compared to our receipts from the Community budget. That inequity continues and the circumstances of Fontainebleau have not changed for the better. If anything, they have worsened over the years. Instead of threatening the United Kingdom rebate, what we ought to be concentrating all our efforts on doing is mitigating the necessity for the United Kingdom to have such a rebate. That means a combination of all of four things: agricultural spending reform and deep agricultural spending cuts; cofinancing in addition to that reform; a re‐evaluation of the cohesion fund countries who have qualified to join the single European currency and therefore an examination of their entitlement together with a capping of the budget and strict budgetary stringency.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, while I welcome much of the Haug report, the British Labour Members stand firmly behind the efforts of successive British Prime Ministers, including Tony Blair, in their just demand for budgetary fairness and equity.</p>

At the moment we spend 1.11 % of Community GDP and we have written a great volume on the whole question of how we are to collect this money. Personally, I think own‐resources is whatever we decide own‐resources are. Whatever European law says is own‐resources, that is own‐resources. Even if we ask the county councils or national governments to collect it and pass it on to us, that does not prevent it from being own‐resources. So I think we make too much of that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point is the question of the just return. Maybe I am wrong when I tell people that when the European Union was founded there was a common agricultural policy not because it made absolute common sense that we took that particular industry and made it common, but because it was recognised that the single market would give great advantages to a skilled, industrialised country like Germany, and the French demanded, as a corresponding benefit, a common agricultural policy. So we recognised that there were benefits to be gained from the single market in the European Union other than just the amount of money that people got from the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">That has been borne out because we cannot just evaluate the benefits of European Union on the basis of how the balance of payments in the European budget works out. At the moment, Germany has a massive surplus in its balance of trade with the rest of the Union – something like 25 billion. That is fair enough! I do not begrudge Germany that, it got that out of the single market because of its efficiency and hard work. The Dutch have a bigger surplus still, something like 35 billion. Some of that may be the Rotterdam factor but, even if it is, it still leaves profit that would not have been there and could not possibly accrue to the Dutch economy if it were not for the single market. So the single market gives benefit to the Dutch and Germans. Ireland gains because it has a surplus in its trade with the rest of the Community, except the British. We also are net beneficiaries, and have the best of all worlds. So I am not in favour of rapid change! Being serious, we are going much too far and the demand for national contributions to the common agricultural policy is not a reasonable proposal. It is definitely renationalisation.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, does the total amount of Community budget receipts cover the current requirement of the European Union? My opinion is that it does not. The report has nothing to say on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this is a distortion of reality: while here we are talking about the system of own resources, that is, the system of collecting budget receipts, the report concerns itself essentially with expenditure. It wants to reduce expenditure on the common agricultural policy, the Committee on Budgets is transformed into the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, it recommends the restructuring of agricultural policy and finally calls for national contributions to this policy. From 70 % of the budget the common agricultural policy has fallen to 45 %. How much further do we want it to fall? How much further do you want it to fall? Let us just reflect on the fact that, without a common agricultural policy, there would be no European Union today.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final comment is this: the notion of net contributions must cease. We must accept that contributions are determined by the single market as a whole and not just by the Community budget.</p>

But it has no clear thrust. In order to develop that, the report should really be referred back to committee. During the debate emphasis has repeatedly been put on the need for economic and social cohesion and solidarity, and rightly so. But solidarity also means that all the Member States must commit themselves fully to combating waste, corruption and mismanagement. For when it comes to collecting revenue we see particularly large losses in the Member States as a result of irregularities and fraud. The aim of the future own resources system must not just be to make the revenue system more transparent, simpler and more rational but also to reduce the burden on European taxpayers as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, any European Central Bank profits should not, as proposed, be paid into the Community budget but accrue to the Member States" budgets.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bösch </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I want to extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteur for what she has done on behalf of the Committee on Budgets and this House. Ladies and gentlemen, I rather got the impression today that you thought Mrs Haug had drawn up this report largely for her own amusement. Every one of us should realise that she took a real Sisyphean task upon herself here and I believe she has done an admirable and fantastic job. Each of us comes from our own Member State and we really have seen today that we are all bringing our own Member State"s special interests with us here. The discussion showed that extensively enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The way I read this report, Mrs Haug has tried to propose short and medium‐term measures. They include the question of the British rebate and of course they include the question of cofinancing agricultural policy. And to the Member who declared it was about renationalising the agricultural system – something people sometimes say against their better judgment and that has been debated at length – I would say that such matters must of course be addressed here.</p>
<p class="contents">But Mrs Haug has also paved the way for what we will in the final analysis need on the revenue side, namely European revenue in the form of European taxes. Only then will we see an end to the interminable debate about who is the biggest net contributor, who is the biggest net recipient, which is what it is obviously all about just now. Because this report is sufficiently logical and well constructed and because it comes very close to fulfilling the task we set, namely to formulate and document Parliament"s position prior to the European Council decisions, I would call on everyone to support it accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">It will not be the last report by the Committee on Budgets to cause us problems. Looking at the question of the financial perspective, we may find that the balance of interests differs somewhat from today"s, but we as the European Parliament should seek to remain capable of action at budgetary level. With this report we certainly are, which is why we should support it on Thursday.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liikanen, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, with the Haug report the European Parliament underlines once again its political commitment to the question of the Community's own resources. Although the number of parliamentarians present today is not very high I must say that the issue is still of the highest political topicality in all the member countries as we prepare for the Berlin summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Like its predecessors, in particular the famous Langes report of 1994, the Haug report combines short‐term realism and long‐term vision. I am happy to note that the same difficulties that we had in the Commission when we had to draw up our report have also been encountered in the European Parliament. I congratulate Mrs Haug for this balanced combination of those issues: short‐term realism and long‐term vision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Haug report and the Commission report on the operation of own resources published last October are on the same wave‐length on many questions. For example, both reports agree that the present system has provided sufficient resources to finance the Community expenditure, but also that it lacks transparency, comprehensibility and financial autonomy. Both reports agree that the notion of <span class="italic">juste retour</span> is unrepresentative of the relationship of the EU with the Member States and misleading in several respects. Both reports note that VAT resources pose a series of difficulties in terms of transparency and complexity, as well as the possibility of replacing VAT resources by GNP resources. This has been given a lot of attention in the present discussion with the member countries. Both reports recognise the diminishing importance of the traditional resources: it is necessary to take the cost benefit aspects of their collection into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if the weight of the GNP resources increases – which may prove possible in the next few weeks – it will become even more necessary to use the latest and most credible GNP estimates which take account of all the underground economy aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to specific new own resources, positions still differ considerably. These differences have also manifested themselves within the European Parliament. Given the cumbersome decision‐making procedure in the field, more convergence of views will be required before an initiative can hope to have any possibility of succeeding. Intellectually it is very interesting but politically there are not very many realistic options today.</p>
<p class="contents">Timing is important here. The successful launch of the euro and the difficult negotiations on the harmonisation of certain taxes in Europe could be slowed if too close a link is made with the question of potential Community own resources. I fully agree that the question of the financing of the Union has to be seen as an integral part of the integration process of the Union, that it has to move forward in tandem with it. I once again congratulate the rapporteur for her excellent work.</p>
