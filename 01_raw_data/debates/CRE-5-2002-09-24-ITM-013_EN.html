<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Smet (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, this is the second time that social policy and policy on equal opportunities for men and women have been scheduled so late in the day. This is acceptable once in a while, but I should nevertheless like to ask those who draft the agenda to switch things around and to schedule economic policy and agricultural policy, for example, this late on the agenda, which would allow us to discuss our reports in the afternoon and prevent Mrs Diamantopoulou and us always having to sit here burning the midnight oil.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the report. Why has a report been drafted on the representation of women among the social partners? Firstly, because there has been an enormous increase in the number of working women. Women constitute 42% of the total workforce in the EU. This same increase is not reflected in the bodies that have a say in policy. These are the structural bodies of the social partners themselves, their chairmen, their secretaries-general, their executive committees, their general meetings, their negotiation committees, and so on. Women are underrepresented in these. Even where social partners function as delegates in advisory bodies, these delegates are very rarely women.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, the social partners require – and we grant them this with pleasure – a large proportion of the power in Europe and the Member States, for it is, of course, a fact that the collective labour agreements they conclude, and which therefore also affect women, generally have force of law. Indeed, a large proportion of legislative authority, namely that related to labour, has been passed on to them. This is permissible, provided that the social partners are representative. If they are not, then this is not really tolerable. I maintain that they are not representative. When, while 42% of women are in the labour market, not even 25% of women are represented in the administrative bodies of the unions, a figure dropping below 12% or 10% in some administrative bodies, and if, for example, employers' organisations have 1% or 2% of women in their administrative bodies, then I maintain that these social partners are not representative of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the report. We would therefore ask first and foremost that data be collated and that a database be set up that tracks the presence of women amongst the social partners, for it is extremely difficult, Commissioner, Mr President and fellow MEPs, to obtain these figures. This is not too bad for the trade unions since they themselves keep track of these figures to some extent, but this is practically impossible for employers. If you were to ask any Member State what the proportion of women is in employers' organisations, you would not get a reply, any figures or data. Either this is due to unwillingness, or the data is not available. It is therefore essential to set up a database. I know that the Commission is in the course of setting this up and that a research mandate has been issued. This mandate, however, runs over four years, and I hope, Commissioner, that it will not be four years before steps are taken. If we have to wait for the figures, it will be a long time before anything happens.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the Commission, the Member States and the social partners must pursue a policy that is similar to that in the political world. Fortunately, political parties have gradually been convinced of the fact that the political bodies must be representative of the people in their country. If 50% of those people are women, as is the case in all countries – and it is often more – then the political world should be a representation of those women too. This is policy both in Europe and in the national Member States. The same cannot be said, unfortunately, of the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why a series of measures is being proposed in this report which must be implemented either by the European Union or the social partners themselves, with a little pressure from the Member States, in order to achieve an acceptable level of representation of women in all negotiating bodies and in the bodies of the social partners, also with the aim of allowing women's issues to be discussed during the negotiations. It does indeed speak for itself that those who are around the negotiating table are most sensitive to their own issues; this is always the case. This is also normal, for they are most familiar with their own issues. This is similar to organising a negotiating table with disabled people; they too would be very sensitive to the issues affecting disabled people, and they would be right. This is also true of negotiating tables attended only by men. They are very sensitive to their own issues and not so sensitive to those of women. Hence our theory. I urge you, Commissioner, to adopt a policy that addresses this issue as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a disgrace that huge trade union organisations in Europe, with hundreds of thousands of members, do not even have token representation of both sexes and that there are entire trade union executives made up only of men. The number of women on the job market has risen but there has hardly been a commensurate increase in the number of women in trade union organisations, where fewer than 25% hold executive positions, even though over 40% belong to a trade union.</p>
<p class="contents">On the employers' side, as Mrs Smet said, the situation is even worse, with the lowest proportion in Belgium, with 1.5%, and the highest in Finland, with just 19%. Of course, there has been an increase in the number of working women over recent years, but remember that Beijing concluded ten years ago that, if we continue at this rate, we shall achieve equal numbers in 2500 years.</p>
<p class="contents">So what can we do at European level? Clearly this is not an issue which can be resolved through legislation or binding measures. The Commission, as you have already heard, has selected a researcher to monitor statistics and record them throughout Europe, because at present the only records we have are from the national representations; we have no analytical sectoral representation and no breakdown by Member State. This statistical exercise will last 4 years, but we shall be able to use the data from year one and it will be especially helpful in finding out where we need to intervene by networking, by exchanging practices, by working together and by giving incentives to trades union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that we need to agree on specific quantitative targets and timetables for the involvement of women. The social partners, who are due to present their common agenda at Christmas, intend, as far as I am aware, to include the question of equality as one of the common issues which they will endeavour to resolve over the next few years. So if the social partners at European level present a common agenda at Christmas and include the question of gender equality, it is important that we then set specific quantitative targets and timetables. The Commission is still aiming for equal representation of men and women at all levels, including in the committees it sets up, but, to tell the truth, few women are involved even in the Commission unions.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish my intervention, I should like to point out that the question of the lack of involvement of women, as Mrs Smet has explained, is a question of democracy, it is a question of representation, it is a question of neglecting half the population, neglecting half the force and half the talent of European society. We really do believe that, with the employment strategy and social dialogue, we can make progress, but Europe cannot push ahead alone if the social partners themselves fail to assume a large part of the responsibility, which is why we also need their initiative here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that we have little information on the under-representation of women in social partner structures and on their lack of involvement in social dialogue negotiations. It is also true that this deficit, this problem, is not acknowledged in political circles.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, while we often hear about the absence of women from parliaments, from governments, from local and regional authorities, we rarely hear about the absence of women among the social partners. So we too need persuading, as European institutions, as national governments and as social partners, that the involvement of women in decision-making procedures within the social partnership will not merely add credentials to their authority and quality to democracy; it will also, in the final analysis, promote our development objectives, since it will help increase employment, improve the quality of work and increase productivity and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the involvement of women in decision-making processes is concerned, it is the only opportunity to take account of the demands of women, both employed and unemployed, to develop social responsibility for the benefit of working women, to create the conditions needed to develop creativity in the workplace, to take account of specifically female aspects and to deal with wage differentials, which is the most basic problem of all.</p>
<p class="contents">So we need a broad information and awareness-raising campaign in every direction and to motivate working women themselves, because they too must take their share of the responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The balanced participation of women in decision-making bodies is an issue which is frequently raised and with regard to which Europe has often emphasised the need to take measures, and this issue has by no means been resolved. As the Commissioner said, there is a democratic deficit here in all areas of society – economic, social and political. This report seeks to take stock of the situation in the social and political fields, of the representation of women among the social partners. With regard to this matter, the first thing that becomes clear is the lack of systematic data. There is very little information available about the participation of women inside the organisational structures and internal decision-making bodies of the social partners, while even less information is available about the gender-specific composition of delegations of negotiators in the social dialogue. Moreover, there are no statistics available about the advisory bodies in which social partners are represented. The European Trade Union Confederation has made genuine efforts to compile statistics, but it encountered many difficulties because of the poor cooperation of the national trade unions.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, these studies reveal a pyramid structure, in which about 40% of the total number of trade union members are women, and the percentage falls to less than half that figure the nearer one gets to the decision-making structures at the top of the pyramid. There is even less information available regarding employers’ organisations. All this means that women are very poorly represented in negotiating delegations, which has an impact on the success of the equal opportunities policy too. Indeed, in recent years, at the request, not least, of Europe, a number of strategies have been implemented, tailored to the situations of the different Member States, which have led to an improvement in the situation, although it still remains wholly unsatisfactory. In Italy, for example, a policy of positive measures has been implemented within the trade associations, facilitated by legislation and by the funding of specific training projects, to encourage the participation of women in administrative bodies, and, in many cases, this has resulted in organisations including quotas in their statutes. It is true that all this has yielded significant positive results but they have been almost exclusively at local level: progress stops when we reach national decision-making levels.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a direct link between the participation of women in decision-making bodies and negotiating bodies and the pursuit of an equal opportunities policy. This connection is confirmed, not least, by the results of research promoted by the Dublin Foundation on the subject of ‘Equal Opportunities and Collective Bargaining’ in the Union, which stresses that the participation of women negotiators has yielded positive results in terms of reducing the existing inequalities, increasing the attention paid to reconciling work and family life and tackling the issue of wage inequality between men and women. It is therefore necessary, as Mrs Smet’s report calls, for the European Commission to make a start on the compilation of data and the establishment of a database relating to the representation of women among the social partners so that indicators can be established with a view to increasing the influence exercised by women in decision-making bodies, to create a database relating to the results of collective bargaining in the context of equal opportunities and to use it for the dissemination of best practice, and to urge the social partners to create networks among women negotiators and women administrators with a view to their exchanging experience and expertise and, in their employment policy, to develop further the role allotted to them in the promotion of equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of the social dialogue at European level will certainly yield benefits in terms of influence, effectiveness and success in the pursuit of the objectives if more gender balance is developed at all levels, including in the socio-economic context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And although where the social partners are concerned only incomplete information is available, the meagre data available on the participation of women demonstrate that at executive level, the percentage of women is low, with women being clearly under-represented in the upper echelons of organisations, which weakens democracy and makes it difficult to achieve real equality of rights and opportunities, which we incorporated into the Treaties and into various Directives to which we refer on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support the initiatives proposed in this report, both those that seek to obtain a greater knowledge of the current situation (and the need for data collection has already been mentioned here), and those intended to achieve a more balanced representation of men and women among the social partners. We call for timetabled performance targets to be established – on the quantitative and qualitative representation of women, both in internal decision-making structures and in collective bargaining, including at the forthcoming trilateral social summit – and I now wish to draw the Commissioner’s attention to this matter – and also for reports to be drafted on the progress made and the impact of the measures adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Objective conditions must be established, however, to ensure that the participation of women in the social and political bodies becomes a reality. The Commission must also create a database and good practices must be disseminated, including in the joint report on employment, sharing information on the participation of women, and specifically in collective bargaining, and also on the progress made in the field of equal opportunities. This information, this analysis and this approach must be formalised in the various reports on the social sphere and on employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While good statistics are available in parliaments and national institutions, there are still not any satisfactory surveys of the social partners. In both the unions and the employers' organisations women in leadership roles are in a tiny minority. There is no doubt that this needs to be changed, but please not at a snail's pace.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we have unanimously called on the social partners to set precise targets as soon as possible with a view to improving the quantitative and qualitative representation of women. As part of this, deadlines should be agreed for their implementation. Databases should be created so as finally to provide a precise overview of female representation in expert fora and decision-making bodies. A further long overdue measure is the creation of posts for equal opportunities officers in all of the Member States. Whenever change is initiated, however, intensive awareness-raising is required. In training courses and at conferences on gender mainstreaming, women's structures in the social partners should be visible. Positive measures need to be developed in the form of action programmes within organisations. Women's networks should be created and should communicate with each other. They should exchange experiences and pass on information about projects to each other. These projects were successful and are therefore worth replicating and the others failed and we should try to understand what we can learn from them.</p>
<p class="contents">An important component is responsibility at executive level right up to the boardroom. There are therefore sufficient reasons for drawing up this own-initiative report. The vote in the Women's Rights Committee was unanimous and is testimony to the exemplary work of our rapporteur, Miet Smet. I too can fully endorse this assessment of her report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder how much faster we need to move in order to achieve this equality within the next hundred years, which even then would be quite a long period to have to wait.</p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me that while we talk consistently, and correctly, about the need to create equal opportunities in the European Union that in a very real sense that is a secondary objective to treating people with equality, because there is a distinct difference between the question of equality for every single human being and the idea that they should also have equal opportunities. Without equality there can be no equal opportunity and that has to be fundamental to our approach to this issue of women participating in decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues that must be addressed if we are to ensure that women – and in particular working women – can participate and that they get time off work in order to pursue trade union activities, is that of employers being extremely reluctant to allow workers to have time off to pursue either training or trade union activities. This is increasingly the case, even before one deals with the question of allowing either men or women time off to have babies or to look after children. I am not surprised by the statistic which indicates that there has been a decline in the number of women participating in employers' organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The only slight criticism I would have of some of the statistics in the report is that they are out of date. That is not the fault of the rapporteur, it is down to the fact that we do not have consistent and systematic collection of proper data.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the keys to making progress in this area is to have affirmative programmes, action plans and targets. Critical to it also is a programme of sensitising people in trade unions and in employers' organisations to the fact that there is another half of the human race who are entitled to equality as of right and not just as a privilege. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the other hand, it would be extremely cynical to reproach workers’ organisations for not including women in their number, when female workers throughout the European Union have the problem of insufficient or non-existent crèches and nursery schools.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur is a former minister, she would be better advised to use her influence to encourage the Member States to implement an extensive programme for the creation of crèches, day nurseries and nursery schools, employing a sufficient number of staff.

The principle of equality shall not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex.’</p>
<p class="contents">If we compare these general principles, these solemn declarations, with social reality, with the everyday world we live in, specifically in terms of the achievement of women’s equality in the field of representation amongst the European Union’s social partners, one conclusion immediately springs to mind: there is still much to do. Mrs Smet’s excellent report expresses this perfectly, and I congratulate her on her work.</p>
<p class="contents">Women make up approximately 40% of the members of the trade unions in the European Union, but there is no proportionality between their presence within the membership of the trade unions, on the one hand, and within the decision-making and governing bodies of the trade unions, on the other. Furthermore, women, although the data on this is rather imprecise, make up a minority in the upper levels of company organisations. Declarations of intention without commitments are not sufficient to turn the principles I have mentioned into a social reality. We therefore need strategies aimed at increasing the presence of women amongst the social partners and I believe that an artificial system of quotas is not the right or desired solution or approach.</p>
<p class="contents">A fairer society – in a European Union in which 42% of working people are women – cannot tolerate an under-representation of women in the bodies and structures within which social interlocutors meet to define, regulate and agree on issues relating to social policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps women themselves are partly responsible for the situation being analysed here. I believe that the horizontal integration of the gender dimension into the different policies, the action programmes – preferably measures to reconcile work and family life – the efforts of the social agents themselves, training and information, measures to stimulate the participation of women, positive actions and action programmes, are ways to achieve equality and this, in turn, is a means, an instrument, for building a better, fairer and more caring society through social dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to remedy the glaringly obvious shortfall in the representation of women in the decision-making structures and bodies of the social partners, three measures, in particular, are to be emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">First: we need to know where we are now and where we want to be. Hence the need to ensure that we have statistics that give us a true picture of the situation and which can provide a basis for the creation of action programmes and the drafting of evaluation reports;</p>
<p class="contents">Second: knowledge and training are the keys to individual and collective progress. The preparation of women for leadership duties must, therefore, be a priority. This aim can best be achieved through the creation of centres for the dissemination of specialist knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">Third: the social partners must provide training actions to raise awareness of equal opportunities and this issue must always feature on the negotiating agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, for example, the rate of women in employment has been steadily increasing and is one of the highest in the European Union. Nevertheless, such changes are not matched by the level of women’s participation in the decision-making processes and many inequalities still persist. With regard to access to executive positions, only 2% of women occupy the posts of departmental heads and managers, which rises to 3.2% at more senior levels. We are also seeing the insufficient participation of women in positions of greater responsibility in union life. Reliable data are difficult to come by, as has already been stated here several times.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to remind you that various studies confirm that the presence of women in decision-making bodies and in collective bargaining has a very positive impact on the implementation of equal opportunities policy. Therefore, the balanced representation of men and women, apart from being a democratic imperative for the social partners, will lead to a more favourable working and organisational environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
