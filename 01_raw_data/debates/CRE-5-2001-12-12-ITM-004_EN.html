As time passes, there is a growing risk that the situation could spiral out of control. The prospect of a serious political dialogue is becoming an increasingly distant possibility. Dialogue however is the only way forward; there is no other credible option.</p>
<p class="contents">The various parties appear to lack the confidence and the political will needed to end this crisis, so opening the way for violence and extremism. It is now more important than ever that the parties concerned are offered help in reaching a different way of thinking. However, the recent active re-engagement of the United States in the Middle East lead to the expectation of progress towards the resumption of talks. Unfortunately, the terrible events of recent days have made this work much more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the United States, the European Union and the other players most directly concerned have no other choice than to reiterate the firm intention of the international community to prevent extremism and terrorism from undermining diplomatic efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the situation in the Middle East is extremely serious, the European Union must not give in. Both the Israeli and the Palestinian people have the right to live in peace and security. The Members States of the European Union must therefore work indefatigably towards reconciliation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is therefore the reason why Mr Shimon Peres and Mr Navril Shaath were each invited to meet the Foreign Ministers separately within the framework of the General Affairs Council of 10 December. By inviting them, the European Union once again wanted to express its intention to relaunch and continue the political process, and it has therefore used this additional opportunity to prepare the ground for a return to the negotiating table. In short, it is of prime importance that the European Union once again focuses on the essential need for a political perspective in order to lend weight to the current security negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union published a declaration after the General Affairs Council of 10 December which was mentioned earlier. At this juncture, I would like to very briefly repeat the most important elements of this, but at the same time I would like to point out that the text was not shown to either Mr Peres or Mr Shaath before publication. In this declaration, the European Union clearly sets out the obligations to which it expects both parties to adhere straight away. With regard to the Palestinian authorities: most importantly, the dismantling of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist networks, including the arrest and prosecution of all suspects and a public call in Arabic to cease the armed Intifada. With regard to the Israeli government: the withdrawal of its troops and the cessation of all summary executions, the reversal of the area closures and all the restrictions imposed on the Palestinian people, and finally a freeze on the building of new settlements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this wording clearly demonstrates that the European Union always holds a middle position, siding with neither party. Other external players should follow this example. The wording also clearly explains the conditions necessary for restoring a basic trust between the parties, and also the conditions needed for a genuine peace process. The European Union is aware of the complex nature of the undertakings that it is calling for the parties to agree to, especially given the current situation on the ground. However, these requirements have been established on the basis of a rational assessment of the present differences between the parties, and of the ways of overcoming these in the context of a peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative Mr Solana has undertaken another visit to the region on a mandate from the General Affairs Council. He will report back on his mission at the European Council at Laeken. On this basis, it is thus up to the European Union to continue its work to find the most effective ways of bringing the parties to engage fully in the search for a just and lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we remain convinced that the implementation of the Tenet ceasefire plan and Mitchell Committee recommendations is the only way to re-establish a political process in the short term. The plan and recommendations should be implemented without prerequisites or conditions which extremists only use for their own ends. We must not allow extremists to prevent the resumption of negotiations. As far as the European Union is concerned, the basis for political negotiations is well known. These are Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 and the terms of reference of the Madrid Conference, including the principle of exchanging land for peace and the Oslo Accords.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the political negotiations have two objectives. Firstly, the irrevocable right of Israel to exist in peace and security, within its internationally accepted borders, should be fully recognised and reaffirmed. Secondly, a viable and democratic Palestinian state should be established, and the occupation of Palestinian territories should cease.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union also continues to believe that establishing an impartial monitoring body would be in the best interests of both parties. This could help them to overcome the distrust and obstacles encountered in trying to achieve a definitive settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I know that I do not have to explain that the situation is and remains very serious. I know I do not have to explain how important it is that we remain vigilant and ready to act. Along with the United States and other interested parties, we need to continue to evaluate the potential options, including the possibility that the situation will deteriorate. The European Union has more than proved its interest and active commitment to seek political solutions, especially in the last few months. Of course, the parties themselves bear the principal responsibility, but it is important that the international community reaffirms its willingness to help them back onto the path to peace.</p>

It is with regret that I note a dramatic deterioration of the situation in the region despite the tremendous efforts of the international community, in particular the United Nations, the United States, the Russian Federation and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am dismayed by the fact that more than 1 000 people, Palestinians, Israelis – among them, as we heard this morning, many women and children – have died since September last year. I am also dismayed at the fact that we have seen the withering away of the aspirations and the hopes that Israelis and Palestinians have pursued since the peace process began ten years ago. We need to focus our efforts on how to prevent the death of the peace process itself. Much of what has been achieved with the help of the international community is now at risk. We want to see two states living side by side, peaceful and prosperous. Today, that prospect seems all too distant.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of deaths keeps increasing and so, less importantly, does the record in physical and economic damage. The World Bank has estimated that the Palestinian economy has suffered losses of between USD 155 million and 165 million in physical damage and USD 2.4 billion of gross national income since September last year. The number of Palestinians living below the poverty line on less that USD 2 per day will have risen from 600 000 to between 1.2 million and 1.5 million by the end of 2001. Even worse, the World Bank projects more than 50% of the population may fall below the poverty line by the end of this year. The economic decline and the non-transfer of taxes owed to the Palestinian Authority by Israel have caused a fall in Palestinian revenues from a monthly average of USD 91 million to USD 22 million. Palestinians lost more than 100 000 jobs in Israel and about 66 000 jobs in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a result of Israel's closure policy.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Israeli economy is also suffering, which is not surprising when one considers the extent of economic interchange that was taking place before the current Intifada. According to recent forecasts, the year 2001 is going to be one of the worst years since the 1950s for the Israeli economy. This is mainly caused by the global economic slowdown but also by the current political security crisis. Preliminary figures indicate that one in five Israelis live below the poverty line, absolute numbers are up by 10% compared to last year and the rate of unemployment stood at 9.3% in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the European Union's stance, given this dramatic undermining of political and economic stability in the Middle East? We understand Israel's longing for security. We respect the fact that it is the Israeli Government's duty to try to provide safety for its citizens and we also understand Palestinian frustration over the continuous military occupation and the remorseless spread of settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday, as the Minister has just pointed out, the General Affairs Council discussed these issues with Shimon Peres and Nabil Sha'ath. As ever, they were extremely eloquent in what they said. The Council's declaration reaffirms Israel's irrevocable right to live in peace and security within internationally recognised borders and the need for the establishment of a viable and democratic Palestinian state and an end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories. The way chosen by people like the late Prime Minister Rabin was to find a negotiated solution leading to two states with the 1967 line roughly as their shared border, Jerusalem as capital of both, and a solution to the refugee issue acceptable to both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately forces on both the Palestinian and Israeli sides have been working against this goal. They have set out quite deliberately to destroy the achievements of the Oslo process. It is our collective duty to try to stop them doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way of returning to meaningful negotiations is to embark once and for all on the path laid out in the Mitchell report. The Council on Monday strongly encouraged the parties to take the first steps to end this devastating and self-fuelling cycle of violence that we have seen over the last 14 months. I confirm our strong call for the parties to implement the Mitchell report without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial to apprehend extremists and continue fighting those terrorist groups opposed to the peace process, as the Minister said. The Union must continue to press the Palestinian Authority to take concrete steps to arrest and bring to justice those who commit terrorist acts. This is why the Council on Monday called clearly for the dismantling of the terrorist networks of Hamas and Jihad.</p>
<p class="contents">And it is equally crucial that Israel withdraws its military forces, ends the extra-judicial killings, and ends the closures and restrictions on Palestinian people, particularly the senseless bombing of property and infrastructure. It is difficult to see how the destruction of the Gaza airport, the destruction of an EU-funded forensic laboratory and the destruction of vast areas of arable land can help fight terrorism or increase Israel’s security.</p>
<p class="contents">I would strongly argue the opposite. In the World Bank report, they state 'that the main proximate cause of the recession is closure'. Removing, or significantly easing closure is the most important requirement if further decline is to be arrested and economic pressure removed from the Palestinian population. Continued economic hardship will make people easier prey for extremists. We need to persuade Israel that its security will be increased, not hampered, by allowing the Palestinian economy to develop so as to give people a reason to hope for a better future. Where in history is there an example of poverty and economic decline leading to greater security and political moderation?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add to this an argument put by Henry Siegman – a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and a distinguished expert on the Middle East – in the article in the International Herald Tribune today, which I strongly recommend to all Members of this House. Mr Siegman wrote as follows: 'policies which reinforce the despair of Palestinians by killing their hope for an end to the occupation will inevitably fuel escalating violence'.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not allow ten years of political and financial investment to be wasted. The European Union has contributed more than EUR 3 billion to the West Bank and Gaza Strip since 1994. Some may say unfairly that the European Union is only a payer and not a player. I have heard that remark in this Chamber. But what we have done is to provide some grounds for hope – and in recent months to prevent further economic misery and to keep the Palestinian Authority barely alive and in place by providing EUR 108 million in budgetary aid over the last 14 months.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people have criticised us for that, although members of the Israeli Government have explicitly supported these efforts in the past. We have worked to maintain the only viable partner in peace that Israel can find and we should continue to support the Palestinian Authority, especially in its fight against terrorism. Although the Palestinian Authority has made mistakes and must correct them, the Palestinian Authority is the only structure that can provide stability in the Palestinian territories. It is the provider of necessary basic services and in the end the guarantor for a minimum of security for both the Palestinians and the Israelis. If the Palestinian Authority is disabled, we will face a situation of anarchy where Hamas and Jihad will no doubt gather increasing support and local extremist committees will compete in an escalation of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is utterly absurd to suggest that by doing this we are funding terrorists. Our funding actually helps to strengthen the secular administration against the real terrorist organisations. We have put a considerable number of safeguards in place that allow us to monitor the use of our funds. The most important of these is the regular checking and reporting by the International Monetary Fund on the austerity budget agreed by the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make this point very strongly. The European Union has done more than anyone else to promote elections, the fight against corruption, and the rule of law in the Palestinian territories. There is much further to go. But how do we best promote decency, moderation and pluralism? By allowing public services in the Palestinian territories to collapse or by trying to keep them going against the odds and by trying to promote reform? The alternative to the Palestinian Authority is Palestinian anarchy. However long and difficult the road, we should remain committed to supporting moderates, whoever they are and while – thank God – they still exist, on both sides of this tragic feud.</p>
<p class="contents">Some commentators have referred to the problems in the Middle East as one of the root causes of terrorism – or they have pointed out that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been and is abused as a cheap excuse for violence or as a wicked justification for committing evil criminal acts. The international community needs to take action now to help resolve this potentially explosive situation. The risk of wider regional spillover is very real and we must use every means to prevent a return to the time when the Palestinian cause was pursued largely through terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point. Today the focus is mainly on Afghanistan. But increasingly it will shift to the Middle East. If we are to solve the problems there, it is no good dwelling in the past, exchanging half-truths, casting blame, arguing about what Mr Arafat should have done at Camp David or what Mr Sharon should not have done on the Holy Mount. What is past is past. Peace will only come if there is a real and brave and lasting commitment to achieving it, looking ahead to a brighter future, ignoring those who try to derail the whole process through terrorist acts of violence and by disproportionate military responses. That is the way progress was made in the past, for example by Mr Rabin. It must be the path that we Europeans advocate for the future.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I must say that these two speeches and also the Council's decision this week demonstrate how seriously we have to approach this problem, and that the European Union, both in the observations that have been made here, and also in this resolution, has sent a clear signal as to what is to be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament would like our recommendation to contribute to the European Union's ability to be an intermediary in this region, finding an opportunity to achieve a peaceful solution. If I might put it in cautious terms, we will assuredly be able to achieve a balanced text within the framework of the resolution, that is, during tomorrow's procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need for me to analyse the situation now, and I wish to support what Chris Patten said – that there is no point whatever in looking for questions of guilt among the issues currently facing us. What we do know is that the situation has got worse since Arafat refused to give way at Camp David and Sharon went to the Temple Mount. Moreover, 11 September did not contribute to a more reflective mood. Instead, things have worsened since then, and what is now at stake is the breaking of the cycle of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">There comes a point where it no longer makes sense to ask who is guilty and who innocent, because the cycle of violence no longer has a discernible beginning or end. As Europeans, we not only have a great interest in peace being genuinely established in this region, but it is in our most fundamental interest, as the whole issue of the Mediterranean and the issue of terrorism defy solution unless the conflict in the Middle East is resolved. I am not saying that the Middle East conflict is at the root of these issues, but it serves as an excuse for many of the things that cause us grave concern, and it is for this reason that the resolution of this problem in our neighbourhood is in our own fundamental interest. Having, as Chris Patten rightly said, given this amount of financial help to date, we therefore want to take this situation as our starting point in joining the United States in playing an active political role in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that we are working with two basic presuppositions. As far as the first is concerned, it is absolutely clear that Israel's citizens must be able to live within frontiers that are secure and recognised. That is an absolute requirement. It is not even up for discussion, as Israelis have a right to it for reasons which I, as a German, do not need to justify in detail, and which are obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that the Palestinian people, too, must be able to look forward to a state of their own in which they can shape their own future. What this means is that we must make an attempt at progressive removal of the factors that work against this. Settlements and occupation do not help the Palestinians to develop in an appropriate way. Terrorism on the part of the Palestinians does not contribute to a feeling of security in Israel and to Israeli withdrawal. I do think we can now clearly see that Arafat is, for this reason, in a position to act against Hamas and Islamic Jihad. It would, then, have made sense for him to do so at an earlier stage, but if it is to be done now, that should be enough, and combating them with all vigour should be seen as a precondition, just as much as Israel’s refraining from hampering subsequent development by riddling the infrastructure in Palestine with bullet holes.</p>
<p class="contents">It must, though, be clear to us in exactly the same way that the return of the refugees must not be used as a means towards imperilling the existence of the State of Israel. The Arab states must also see that keeping people in camps is not the right way either. With our financial support, the whole of the Arab world must help young people to come out of the camps and to have enough of a chance to grow up.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and the Commission are well aware that Parliament is ready to contribute financially, too, to significant solutions, if it would help to achieve peaceful development. We believe that our position on the guaranteeing of human rights must be seen in the right context, both by the Palestinian Authority and in the State of Israel. We have seen three winners of the Sakharov Prize here today – a Muslim, a Jewish woman and a Christian, thus representing the three monotheistic religions. This, I believe, is where the starting point is to be found. These three religions, which have so overwhelmingly given the world its shape over the past millennia, must find in themselves the strength to achieve a peaceful solution in that centre which was their source, so that people adhering to these three faiths may be able to live together in the city that is holy to them all, Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is what our actions must accomplish. I believe this to be one of the tasks for us in our day, perhaps the central one.</p>

<p class="contents">As Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Israel, it has been a privilege to share initiatives and trips with Mrs Morgantini, the Chairperson of the Delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council. Although we have certainly not always shared the same point of view, I am convinced that we have always shared the same good intentions. We have travelled together with Mrs Fontaine, the President of this House, and last Monday, as has already been mentioned, we received Mr Avram Burg, President of the Israeli Parliament and Mr Abu Ala, President of the Palestinian Legislative Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We had lunch with this year’s winners of the Sakharov prize this very afternoon – as Mr Brok has just mentioned – a prize whose award is intended to symbolise and be understood as an expression of the European Parliament’s good intentions. We are now participating in this debate on a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. I think that, right now, for the first time, we are facing a situation where no reason can be found to be optimistic and for this very reason, I think that the Council recommendation is most appropriate and useful, above all in its final version which the Groups agreed on this morning and which I am sure we will vote for, because the only thing left is intercession, even international intervention, without which we would probably be facing a situation of all-out war.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with today’s tragic circumstances, which are worsened by the international crisis, I firmly believe that the various parliamentary Groups should put our party political differences to one side, which would make our contribution, and that of the representatives of the European Union in this region, all the more effective. The situation we are experiencing is not akin to some kind of movie with good guys and bad guys and for this reason, and to maintain credibility, we need to call on the Israeli Government to stop its bombings, and the Palestinian Authority to prosecute without exception those extremists who are at the root of this terrorism which, under no circumstances, can be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">At times such as these, political leaders cannot withdraw. They must stand up, for example, against the hatred of Israeli youth who call on the streets for the bombing of the Palestinian people in response to the terrorist attacks, and also stand up against this horrendous image of Palestinian children who gleefully celebrate the death of numerous innocent Israeli citizens in Jerusalem or Haifa. What exactly is being taught to these youngsters in schools?</p>
<p class="contents">And if the current Israeli and Palestinian leaders are not capable of putting a stop to this, I am sure that sooner or later their peoples will punish them with their contempt.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Menéndez del Valle (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, whilst we are talking here today in this House, in the Middle East, Israeli tanks are once again occupying the supposedly autonomous Palestinian territories. The Israeli army continues to carry out extrajudicial executions and its planes are still bombing Palestinian police – not army – headquarters, a police force that has no freedom of movement but which has been asked to dismantle terrorist networks and to detain all suspects.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not ignoring the fact that the Council, and especially the High Representative, Mr Javier Solana, are redoubling their efforts to achieve some kind of tangible result. I wonder whether the declaration made by the Council last Monday will contribute to this in any way. In any case, I would like to refer to this declaration. In it, the Union, as is well known, insists, in the following order: firstly, that the Palestinian Authority dismantle the terrorist networks, detain all suspects and make a public call for the end of the Intifada. Next, in second place, that the Israeli Government withdraw its armed forces, put an end to the extrajudicial executions and also to the blockades and restrictions that oppress the Palestinian people, and that they put an end to the building of settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">I applaud this declaration, like Prime Minister Sharon, who stated that this is the first time such a demand in the fight against terrorism has been addressed in such a clear and unambiguous fashion to Arafat by the Union. Obviously, Sharon’s satisfaction refers solely to the EU’s demands to the Palestinian Authority. There was no declaration from Sharon on the Council’s demand that Israel end its violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, Shimon Peres, also liked the declaration. He said that he thought it was ‘a responsible European stance’, which was a more positive statement than that given by Sharon, but he went on to state that the Israeli military action is necessary. He states that this action – which the EU calls for an end to – is necessary to prevent attacks being made on Israeli citizens, and added that ‘it is very easy to give advice to countries whose problems are very different from your own’. It appears that the EU’s attitude is responsible if it gives advice to the Palestinian Authority, but this is not the case if it tries to advise the Israeli Government.</p>
<p class="contents">In my humble opinion, it is probably this type of statement that prompted Louis Michel to say that the EU did not have Israel’s interests in mind when it made such a declaration. I am aware of this, but the question remains that there continues to be a situation where there is an occupier and the occupied, and the occupier wants to continue playing the game by its own rules, whilst the second – the occupied – is asking for a straightforward end to the occupation, and, with this, peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is also aware of this, and it has always hoped to have, like this Parliament, greater influence in the peace process. I think that it also knows that this cannot simply be requested, it has to be worked for and achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that I expect – and I am sure of this – that this recent mission led by the High Representative and the possible decisions to be made at Laeken will take us in this direction.</p>

But we must go on. Let us follow their example.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Groups should congratulate ourselves on the agreement reached with regard to the recommendation, but it should be of concern to us that, even though we are not part of the conflict, it should have cost us more than what is reasonable to reach it.</p>
<p class="contents">During the discussion, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party attempted to give priority to both the agreement and a balanced position. However, I think there can be no doubt that our greatest demand is to be efficient, given that our purpose here is not to be conflict analysts, but to be politicians with responsibilities within the framework of the European Union. From this point of view, I think that the clear position that has been taken with regard to the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government is logical and in line with the position of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while insisting on this required level of efficiency, I would like to associate myself with the opinions already expressed by Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck and Commissioner Patten, that there is much need for international action, that the conflict must stop and that the basic approach well established by the Mitchell report must be followed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would say that it is not sufficient to remain observers and apply pressure. In a conflict there needs to be strong advocates. The European Union, the United States, and, obviously, the UN and Russia, are all strong advocates, and it would be difficult to name another moment in history when it has been possible for them to act together in a such an efficient and balanced way. However, I believe, without a doubt, that this should be our priority: to be able to act as forceful and powerful advocates, if this is a possibility for all of those involved, for the gravity of this conflict requires this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it is just that – the existence of wise people on both sides of the line who have managed to remain tolerant under tragic personal circumstances – it is precisely the existence of people of this kind that makes it meaningful and necessary for us to continue to search for a solution to a problem that at first glance seems so hopeless.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to the cynics in this room, and particularly those outside Parliament, that I say: yes, the European Union has its own special role to play. We will not succeed without the Americans, but neither will we succeed with the Americans alone. What does that mean from my point of view?</p>
<p class="contents">It means that the European Union must be critical of both sides; critical towards Israel with regard to her reoccupation of Palestinian areas, the erection of blockades and extrajudicial executions. On the other hand, however – and let there be no misunderstanding on this point – critical of the Palestinian authorities who could have done more and must do more in the future to combat terrorist attacks and dismantle networks. However, whilst we wish to keep a balance, let us not forget that this is not a struggle between two equal parties. It is the State of Israel that bears prime responsibility for the current conflicts and their resolution. This means that we must exert as much pressure as possible on Israel to find a solution. This means exerting pressure in order to prevent them from finding ways out and excuses for not starting negotiations when they could in fact be taking place. This also means exerting pressure on Israel to distance herself from the kind of thinking which, for example, equates Arafat with Bin Laden. This is a highly dangerous comparison which will only serve to make it extremely difficult for a solution to be found.</p>

I was horrified by these deliberate and cruel acts of murder and I immediately expressed my deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. I stressed that no cause can in any way justify the killing of innocent people. Those responsible must be arrested, tried and punished.</p>
<p class="contents">You do not have to be a genius to understand that these latest crimes are disastrous for the Palestinian Authority. During my visit to the region I was able to appreciate the difficulty in containing the exasperation of the people, especially those living in the refugee camps, in the face of the daily violent attacks by the occupying forces, and especially after the irresponsible assassinations of the long-established leaders of the fundamentalist groups. I thought to myself, if the Israeli Government has decided to take revenge for the victims of attacks in its own way, the Palestinian Authority’s remaining small margin for manoeuvre will be greatly reduced. It would then become almost impossible to break the terrible vicious circle of humiliations, attacks, reprisals and revenge which the conflict has been in since the election of Ariel Sharon.</p>
<p class="contents">Now this has all come true, and how terribly! Israel has wreaked revenge on the fundamentalists in a barrage of fire targeting Arafat. The Palestinian police force, charged with arresting Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists, has itself been bombarded. International Human Rights Day was marked in Hebron by the intolerable image of two children aged three and 13 blown apart by an Israeli missile that missed its suspect target. Who can now doubt Ariel Sharon’s desire to destroy the Palestinian Authority and all that remains of the Oslo process?</p>
<p class="contents">What is Europe saying in the face of the very real danger of the total annihilation of the Palestinian nation and the overwhelming tidal wave of the fundamentalist reaction that would follow? Do we condemn Sharon’s policy of adopting the worst possible line? Are we encouraging those courageous people in Israel who are calling for the resumption of negotiations? Are we congratulating the Palestinian Authority on its first arrests of fundamentalist activists, at some risk? Do we deplore the death of Palestinian civilians as much as we deplore the death of Israeli civilians? Do we at least repeat our long-standing call for international observers to be sent to the region? However unbelievable it may seem, none of the points I have mentioned appear in the European Union’s press release. On the contrary, the European Union has sent a message to the Palestinian Authority, whilst the press has highlighted the unprecedented severity of its tone.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the only hope rests on strong political intervention from the international community. At this time, it would be a tragedy if Europe were to turn a blind eye to the situation, and do nothing to stop George Bush from giving the green light to Ariel Sharon. I think of the men and women of Israel and Palestine, who, like our Sakharov prize-winners Mrs Peled-Elhanan and Mr Ghazzawi, are counting on us to support their resistance, their hopes and their work towards a just peace. Their struggle must remind us of our responsibilities.</p>

The fact is that the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the EU Member States are placing political responsibility for the ongoing Palestinian suicide attacks on Israeli citizens where it belongs: with the Palestinian Authority. Because of this, they demanded three things of the Palestinian Authority: the dismantling of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist networks, the arrest and prosecution of all persons suspected of terrorist activities, and a public announcement in Arabic of the end of the Intifada, the Palestinian uprising.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably enough, I cannot consistently trace the Council’s political clarity with regard to Palestinian terrorism back to the recommendations of this Parliament. I am therefore standing by my Amendment No 6 even after the coordinators’ consultation this morning. The linking of support for the Palestinian Authority with the demands of the Council. This amendment meshes with the spirit of the compromises that resulted from this consultation. I therefore ask my colleagues to support this vote by roll call.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, if this Parliament does not clearly follow the same political line as the Council with regard to the insidious spread of Palestinian terror, the evil forces of 11 September will capitalise on this, because they are really not interested in what the European Parliament expressly states in this recommendation: a safe Jewish state in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Patten and we ourselves, with this draft motion, are rushing to provide the Palestinians, at last, with what they need, with what the Palestinian men and women – the Arabs, moreover, in general – and the victims of the dictatorships in the Arab world are certainly demanding.</p>
<p class="contents">We are making promises to Mr Arafat and we are agreeing to fight, but for what? To give them rights? To give them what all the human rights declarations in the world, including the European declarations, fail to recognise as an individual right? So you want to give them a national State. This is precisely what they need: another Syrian or Yemeni national State, a State of whatever kind; they need a national State. Commissioner Patten, maybe this is what we need in Italy too to solve our problems; maybe this is what you need in Great Britain to solve yours, would you not say?</p>
<p class="contents">The illusion of possible national independence affects Israel too. You wanted a Yugoslav national entity which would be neutral towards both parties. Our pleas for democracy and Europe went unheeded. Do not take sides. Be good Samaritans. Mrs Morgantini is probably all set to call upon the Israeli soldiers to desert, as, on Italian television broadcast throughout the world, she urged the US and British soldiers to desert in the Afghanistan war. You are the just like the pacifists and communists of 1938 who supported nazism and urged the allies and the French to desert in that war.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, if this is what you are going to continue to propose, I feel that it is our duty to point out that the Palestinians and all the citizens in the world – but the Palestinians, in particular – have the right to say “no”, as do we on their behalf, to this illusion. If there were three States – Jordan, Palestine and Israel – the State of Jordan would go immediately, and there would immediately be attempts to use Palestine to eliminate this oasis of democracy between Israel and Palestine representing a third of the democracy in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">An emphatic ‘no’ to this document, which places a condition on continuing our cooperation with Israel and places no condition on our supporting Yasser Arafat. Well then: this Europe, this Palestine and this Arab world are, quite frankly, not ours. We will vote accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because these women have given life, they are now working to prevent further deaths as men continue the senseless killing. We have also listened to Mr Ghazzawi’s appeal for the dream of peace. Our founding fathers shared this dream and it remains the cornerstone of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In listening to Mrs Peled-Elhanan and Mr Ghazzawi, painful memories of past events in the Balkans came back to me. Political and military leaders ignored the fact that the majority of their people wanted peace. They fought from intransigent positions, the result of their deep-rooted distrust of their enemies. In order to allay this distrust, the international community had to take resolute action. This led to the signing of the Dayton agreement, which eventually led to a lasting cease-fire, guaranteed by the deployment of troops. This force has not yet achieved its aim, but Mr Wurtz, it has succeeded in finally breaking the vicious circle of fear, violence and hate.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the international community must today display the same resolve and commitment in response to the desire for peace of the majority of Israelis and Palestinians. The European Union should lead this action. I therefore welcome the statement made by the Council the day before yesterday explaining the impartial position of the European Union. The statement was remarkably strong and no less remarkably concise. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I am delighted to hear the European Union express its determination not to give in to a slide towards increasingly indiscriminate violence.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same spirit, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has worked on the recommendation drawn up by our chairman Elmar Brok. This will be submitted to our fellow members for approval. I hope that Israeli and Palestinian political and military leaders will finally understand that we are only aiming to help them restart the peace process. They have already agreed on the basis of this peace process, but they do not want to implement it because both sides mistrust each other. We implore them at least to trust the international community to guarantee the implementation of the peace process with the utmost impartiality. We can and must undertake to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Sharon has not been able to keep his electoral promises regarding improving the security of Israel and its population. The leader of the Palestinian Authority is weakened, surrounded and besieged in territories which are autonomous in name only. The Palestinian civilians are more subjugated than ever before and do not have any future prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community wants peace. It is now working towards an intermediary objective, but this is unattainable. The objective is the plan named after the American Senator Mr Mitchell. The Mitchell Plan is well intentioned in that its primary aim is to put an end to the killing. It is however misconceived. Every mini-agreement is reached on such a restricted basis that they remain at the mercy of the next suicide attack and then have to be re-established all over again. Even supposing that the preconditions required by Mr Sharon are satisfied, and even supposing that the Mitchell Plan is implemented in full and with great difficulty, this will in no way address the fundamental causes of the conflict. Nor will the deep-seated personal hatred of Mr Sharon for Mr Arafat disappear as if by magic.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental causes of the conflict are to be found in the continuing occupation of the Palestinian and Syrian territories seized by Israel during the 1967 war. According to the winner of the Sakharov prize, Mrs Peled-Elhanan, who spoke to us this morning, this occupation is cruel. Only when the army of occupation has withdrawn from all of these territories, including East Jerusalem, as the United Nations’ resolutions demand, will the conditions for a stable and lasting peace be created.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the European Union should speak out in support of an immediate and definitive agreement to establish secure and internationally recognised borders. These would be protected if necessary by an international force for an interim period. With the support of the European Union, all the countries of the region would then be able to embark upon the reconciliation and reconstruction process from new foundations.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel should withdraw to its 1967 international borders, and the Arab world must give its formal and binding recognition of these. This is the overall objective that the Council should pursue determinedly on the world stage. If we act in this way on the issue of Middle East, we will fulfil the role everyone wants us to take on. What is required today is not an equidistant role but a fair role.</p>

The Intifada and the Israeli reprisals continue, and the number of dead on both sides is growing. We feel impotent, concerned and extremely angry. The extent of our anger is a measure of the hope we felt last year when the Middle East was within a whisker of a peace agreement. We can blame Ariel Sharon for his policy of ‘an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth’. However Mr Sharon was not in power when Ehud Barak, Shlomo Ben Ami and Bill Clinton tried to persuade Yasser Arafat to sign a peace agreement which would have been historic. That said, the past is the past, as Commissioner Patten so rightly said.</p>
<p class="contents">We still want to believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel, to paraphrase the words of the Belgian Presidency of the European Union. We want to believe that the unprecedented appeal the European Union sent on Monday will be noted. Contrary to what was previously said in the House, this appeal was sent to both parties. It presents Israel with her responsibilities, but for the first time the European Union makes an equally clear appeal to Mr Arafat to dismantle the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist networks. There may be light in that yesterday Israel recognised that the Palestinian Authority had, for the first time, begun to take serious action to combat fundamentalists. There is also light in that Mr Arafat has admitted, quite objectively, that the European Union’s appeal is fair.</p>
<p class="contents">At lunchtime today, the Israeli Nurit Peled-Elhanan, winner of the Sakharov Prize 2001, expressed the hope that the voices of the mothers of the Middle East would drown out the voices of those calling for arms. We also hope and want to believe that European Union’s voice will ring out loud and clear and help re-establish a spirit of hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am tired, so tired of these repeated debates where it is so difficult to make progress: it would, however, be a silence in which you could hear the muffled voices of those who have been killed, who are calling for peace and justice, as Izzat Ghazzawi and Nurit Peled said this morning; it would be a silence which tells the consciences of all men and women that there can only be peace in Palestine and Israel if the Palestinian people is allowed to exercise the right to live in its own State, existing alongside the State of Israel, in mutual security. We must make this peace possible and not just by providing economic aid.</p>
<p class="contents">We see it every day. What we build and our citizens pay for is destroyed by shells and bulldozers: from the airport to the port; even the anti-terrorism laboratory was destroyed the day before yesterday. I support the positions of Commissioner Patten and the Minister, but there can be no economic development if there is no release from Israeli military occupation. Europe is resolutely taking this line. A decision must be taken, even a unilateral decision, to establish international protection for the civilian population. There is no equality between occupied and occupier. We must take a balanced approach but not be afraid to make political choices. For peace to be achieved we need clear measures, for our benefit and for the benefit of both Israelis and Palestinians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The people of Israel live in grief, fear and anger, but they at least have political freedom, elections, economic development and the hope of a better future. It is in Israel’s interest that the Palestinians also have hope for the future. People who have hope have something to lose. Without hope, there will never be the willingness to enter into compromises. How can people be expected to hope as long as settlements are being built in their back yards, as long as collective punishments are being meted out for the outrages of the few, and as long as Europe does not take a stand against the gross violations of international law?</p>
<p class="contents">It is a delusion that more force and more suppression will make the Palestinians more compliant. There should be an international peace-keeping force monitoring the implementation of the Mitchell Agreement so that a start can be made with the immediate withdrawal from occupied territories and the immediate dismantling of all settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask the Commission a question. European projects have been destroyed in Israeli attacks; Commissioner Patten himself has already mentioned the forensic laboratory.

<p class="contents">The violence is terrible. So indeed is the spiral of violence. It seemed to us that an urgent call to action was required and that this urgent call needed to be addressed both to the Palestinian Authority and to Israel.

We have done a calculation of the damage so far to our projects. There are nine projects in all which have been damaged in one way or another. The very approximate loss estimation is EUR 2.289 million with, for example, EUR 60 000 also lost with the bombing of the forensic laboratory which we had provided. There was also some support from the Israeli Government to try to help the Palestinian security forces. Those figures are extremely approximate. If you think of the investment that has gone from Europe to the West Bank and Gaza over the years to try to establish decent services, to try to help in the creation of a potential viable state, the loss is incalculable. That is the chartered accountant's balance sheet so far and I hope it does not get any worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I can just add one or two points in relation to the debate. The honourable Member, Mr Poos, who does not use words lightly – he knows about these matters very well – described the situation as catastrophic and that is not too strong a word. My honourable and gallant friend General Morillon reminded us of the consequences in the Balkans of intransigence. Mr Lagendijk and Mrs Morgantini and others spoke about the moving speeches that we had heard this morning about the sacrifice of the next generation because the present generation cannot find a way of living peacefully together. I suppose that when people can behave with that extraordinary resilience and courage and moderation, there is still some hope for the region. My friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Brok, has said that the aim was that the three great religions that we saw represented here this morning should be able to live one day in the holy city in peace together which, in the words of an English poet, is "a consummation devoutly to be wished".</p>
<p class="contents">I would just say one thing to Mr Belder – and I say it very gently and not critically because people are entitled to their own passions – and that is that I am not sure I share his view of balance. I will tell you what my idea of balance is.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday of this week a number of Palestinian and Israeli parliamentarians and intellectuals met at the Qalandia checkpoint to emphasise "the urgent need to continue dialogue between the two sides", even when this is the only venue where it is possible to do so. They argued that these meetings are especially important in the light of the escalation of violence through the past week which they said is threatening to drag their whole region into war. If an immediate halt to the current cycle of violence is not achieved, the situation may spiral out of control, perhaps with irreversible consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">A group, including Yossi Beilin, the former Minister for Justice and one of the architects of the Oslo process, and Yasser Abed Rabbo, the Minister of Information and Culture in Palestine, argued that ending the current crisis entails the immediate abandonment of violence as a political tool and the unconditional implementation of the Tenet work plan and Mitchell report. This requires immediate steps, including prevention and punishment of terrorist acts, the lifting of the closure on and withdrawal from the Palestinian areas and putting a stop to the policy of assassinations. Settlement activity – they argued – is not compatible with an honest move to de-escalation and the pursuit of peace. It must be halted. Incitement in all its forms, both official and unofficial, cannot coexist with rebuilding a climate of trust and non-violence. It must be ended. We clearly state that under no circumstances should the Palestinian Authority or its presidency be harmed or targeted if a way out of this crisis is to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">I will tell you what I believe the European Union should be doing. As long as there are any moderates on the two sides – in Israel and the Palestinian Authority – we should be there supporting them, supporting their courage, toleration and decency. That is a balanced European Union policy. I would say "Hosanna", in suitably biblical form, to all the sentiments expressed in that joint statement. I pray to God that in three, six or nine months' time there are still some moderates left with the bravery and courage to offer a better prospect for the future of the region.</p>

They have had their eighteenth birthdays this year, 2001, which is the year which has seen the most extreme world violence, but it is also the year in which many of the world’s young people have gained the ability to exercise their full rights and responsibilities in coming of age. I hope that this mediation operation, this firm moral message from Europe, will be a constructive witness for peace in the future for the young people of Europe and all the young people of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
