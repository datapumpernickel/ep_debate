<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fourçans </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, the aims of the report I am presenting today, on the basis of the Commission"s report, are twofold. First, it aims to analyse the economic situation and then, more importantly, it aims to put forward some guidelines for economic policy which should serve as a basis for the famous broad outlines of economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I will look briefly at the economic situation. It is no secret to anyone that growth is set to decrease in 1999, however it will still remain above 2 %. So, it will slow down, but – it must be stressed – there will not be a recession. The international crisis has, and will have, an impact on our economies, but the extent of the impact will vary according to country. As a consequence, the internal measures that need to be taken must be adapted to the specific situations in the respective countries. This means that the interdependency of countries needs more analysis, especially now that we have a single currency, at least in the euro zone. And in this regard, Commissioner, although we think your report is good, it did not go far enough and should have gone into more detail on the interdependency of countries. That will be a task for you and I next year, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">What conclusions can be drawn from this situation in terms of economic policy? Should we shift the emphasis away from budgetary consolidation, or even amend the stability pact? Should interest rates be dropped to stimulate demand, as those to the left of you, in this room at least, Mr President, tend to favour? Or should we pursue the strategy adopted over the past months and years, as those to your right seem to advocate, Mr President?</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the second strategy is the best, as indicated by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy in its vote on 24 February. This does not mean – and we must be clear on this – that a good policy mix is not needed or that macro‐economic policy is of no importance, because they clearly are. But to revert to old Keynesian recipes that have already shown their limitations would, in our view, be a mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with you, Commissioner, that we must continue to reduce budget deficits, especially in the three larger countries – Germany, France and Italy – which alone, it must be stressed, account for 75 % of GDP in the euro zone. This policy must be implemented without increasing taxes and other levies; indeed, where possible, these should be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, if public investment is to be increased, as we hope, at least in terms of human resources and research, it will be impossible to implement this policy without reorganising public spending. Budgetary consolidation is also needed, firstly, to maintain low interest rates, which stimulate overall demand, and secondly, to maintain consumer and investor confidence, which also stimulate overall demand, and I would emphasise this for the ladies and gentlemen to the right of me in the House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to look at monetary policy and the question of whether or not the ECB should lower interest rates. As I said before, in 1999, there will be a slowing down, but there will not be a recession, which is something that must be borne in mind when considering this issue. Are we experiencing deflation as some claim? In my view, the statistics show that we are not. The inflation rate appears to have stabilised at around 1 % and the price of raw materials and energy have dropped. Who says that these decreases are going to last? That said, we must be extremely vigilant and, if it ever looked like we were going to fall back into deflation, then the ECB should lower interest rates. But we have not reached that stage yet.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude this section on the policy mix, I should like to stress that wage negotiations must remain reasonable and workers" purchasing power should increase more or less in line with productivity gains. And in this context, workers" purchasing power would increase, which, ladies and gentlemen, would also help to stimulate overall demand.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore evident that a sound macro‐economic policy is needed to guarantee growth and employment, but it is only through far‐reaching structural reforms that unemployment will decrease in the long term. I will not go into this issue as it will be dealt with in more depth in the forthcoming report on the broad guidelines of economic policy. In short, the labour market must be reformed, which means reducing labour costs, especially for the most impoverished, and making the market more flexible. The poorer sections of our society must also have the chance to integrate better. We also need to reform the goods and services markets as well as the financial markets. Such reforms have to form part of coherent whole, in line with macro‐economic policy, so that all measures benefit everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">So, ladies and gentlemen, this is the context of the report I am proposing. It suggests a sound macro‐economic policy and a sound policy mix accompanied by thorough and coherent structural reforms, all based on long‐term rather than short‐term projections, or on the fine tuning that one might use were it possible to regulate the economy like an atomic clock to within a millionth of a second. We are well aware that the economy does not operate in this way and if we forget that, we might be seriously disillusioned. I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that we do not become disillusioned in that way.</p>

We are pleased that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has adopted some important points from our opinion. In the context of a single monetary policy under an independent central bank, economic policies in the Member States will have to be more closely coordinated than ever before.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the call expressed in Amendment No 19 for the abolition of the stability pact does not reflect the views of our committee. What we are calling for is a balanced policy, which implies a stable currency and effective budgetary consolidation as well as the need to ensure adequate purchasing power.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Economic Affairs Committee, we are in favour of a productivity‐based pay policy. If pay restraint leads to increases in profits and investments, a word of gratitude is scant reward for the staff who have exercised such restraint. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs believes that they should be able to share in profits and capital through voluntary schemes. As an antidote to unemployment, we also recommend the promotion of business start‐ups and the provision of venture capital, especially for small and medium‐sized businesses, the development of new services and greater adaptability on the part of companies; at the same time, steps must be taken throughout Europe to safeguard employee participation, to ensure that staff are informed and consulted about structural changes at an early stage, thereby guaranteeing them the opportunity to prepare themselves in good time.</p>
<p class="contents">What we ultimately need is an active, forward‐looking employment policy, a modern form of vocational training for youngsters in Europe, improved opportunities for retraining, for lifelong learning and for research and development, investments in human capital by companies and Member States and through European programmes. That will enhance both the social dimension and Europe's competitiveness in the world market.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hendrick </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Fourçans on what I see as an improved attempt at presenting the Commission's annual economic report. I say ‘an improved attempt" because I see the report itself as being unimaginative – unimaginative in terms of how we can improve on projected growth figures; unimaginative in terms of recognising that we are constantly having to revise the growth figures and we do not really know what to do in terms of trying to increase employment, growth and investment in Europe; unimaginative because, whilst it accepts that we have relatively high unemployment in Europe, it does little other than to accept the fact that jobs are being created but are also being lost. The level of unemployment in Europe at the moment is the same as when I was elected to this Parliament four‐and‐a‐half years ago, and that speaks volumes.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot blame the world situation for everything that is wrong with the European economy. We accept that 20 % of the world is in recession; we accept that 10 % is close to recession. But the benefits of the European Union and of the single market should mean that we can still create jobs satisfactorily despite what is happening outside the European Union borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The report itself states that EMU is itself a protection. EMU has not been a protection. In my view the single market on its own has been a protection. The fact that most of our trade is internal has been a protection. The convergence criteria have helped, of course, and we have managed to maintain some investment as a result of consolidated budgetary and fiscal policies. But the euro is not here, it is on trial and it is not necessarily a solution to Europe's economic problems. That is why I think this is a failing of the annual economic report because what we need to do is look at how we can generate policies to generate jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The report itself states that the European economy is now used to functioning with an inadequate level of employment. Try saying that to the thousands of people, certainly in my constituency, and the millions of people across the European Union who are unemployed. ‘Inadequate" is not a satisfactory term. We have a bad international situation and again the report mentions the prospects of the Union having an <span class="italic">adequate</span> policy mix. Adequate and inadequate, in my view, are not particularly appropriate terms to use.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern, in terms of policy and responsibilities, is that the Commission has failed to use the annual economic report as a stimulus for action and as an input into the broad economic guidelines. Stability and growth pacts are important but public investment should not be included in those figures. We need more private investment, more jobs, more productivity and more sustained growth. The ECB has a role but it is not just the ECB, it is the Council, the Commission and Parliament working together. We need a coordinated response. The annual economic report does not call for one.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">García‐Margallo y Marfil </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, it has often been said that the arrival of the euro is the most important event since the storming of the Winter Palace. This is true in many respects, and is all the more true in relation to what we are debating here today.</p>
<p class="contents">In this new world, the Member States" national policies are shaped by three sets of guidelines: the broad macro‐economic guidelines, the guidelines on employment, in accordance with the Luxembourg process, and the reports on structural policy that were approved at Cardiff I and Cardiff II. But these three sets of guidelines are formed, predetermined and limited by the basic principles that gave rise to the process of European integration. There is the principle of the single market according to which the existence of a single currency permanently rules out the option of adjusting economies by devaluing currencies. There is the principle of a single centralised monetary policy which is managed by an independent Central Bank. And lastly, there is the principle of a restrictive budgetary policy, where austerity is ‘consecrated", to use the biblical term, as a virtue. Therefore, these guidelines are extremely important for Europe as a whole and for each one of the Member States involved, particularly as national policy is being questioned in some of the larger countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few days we have heard statements from representatives of the German Government concluding that the crisis we are currently experiencing is a crisis of demand and a crisis of price stability. In their eyes, these are two important new ideas that rule out the possibility that structural reform might be the appropriate remedy, as had always been claimed in the past. According to the German Government, this remedy harks back to old Keynesian recipes that we thought had been confined to memory following the 1973 crisis. A drop in interest rates is being considered on the other side of the Rhine, as an attempt to influence the European Central Bank, and the stability pact itself is being called into question. In our opinion, we must follow exactly the opposite policy and this will probably be the central debate in the European elections. What the German Government is not telling us is that many of its internal problems are due to an increase in German salaries that exceeds productivity. They are also due to a certain contentment and somewhat of a return to the days of wine and roses in budgetary policy. When stability has been achieved, the benefits are clear, at least in my country. We must address the question of structural reform in order to solve the only problem that really interests us all: unemployment.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Boogerd‐Quaak </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I agree with the point that Mr Hendrick made, which is that we have been sitting here in Parliament for four years now, and unemployment is just as high as when we arrived. The White Paper on growth and competitiveness has been on the agenda many times and we have always said that it must be implemented, yet no progress has been made. In fact we have gone backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight one of the aspects that other speakers have mentioned, which is the conservative attitude adopted by some countries. If we think about the mobility of labour, for example, and the opportunities for firms to operate across borders, we have to say that more obstacles are being created than removed. I recently found out that the German Government imposes extra taxes on workers from companies doing contract work there. I think this is scandalous, and the Commission should put an end to these sorts of practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, the Member States are perfectly accustomed to using social security and taxation to make it unattractive for people to work in other countries. If we look at countries like America, where the employment situation is much better than here, we can see that the mobility of labour contributes a great deal to the level of prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Another subject I would like to raise is venture capital, which is something I have often talked about. This week we approved a report on this issue without debate, but venture capital can give an enormous boost to small firms which are just starting up. The insurance companies and pension funds have huge reserves, for example, but in my view these are not being used appropriately because we do not yet have the rules we need in this field. I would urge that these issues should be given close attention in the context of the employment guidelines.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gallagher </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, the approach adopted by the rapporteur to the Commission's 1999 annual economic report is comprehensive and also sensible. The report covers a wide range of issues and makes some very important statements. In particular, I want to welcome the recognition given to the Irish Government policy towards wage developments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission states, and I quote: ‘Member countries might learn from the positive experience of a number of Member States, especially Ireland and the Netherlands, where continued moderate wage increases over more than a decade have contributed importantly to improved unemployment outcomes. Both of these countries have also in common that the appropriate wage behaviour was underpinned by tripartite consensus‐based wage agreements and was accompanied by a reduction in the tax burden on labour."</p>
<p class="contents">My fear is that the Socialist‐dominated governments of Europe are hell‐bent on harmonising taxes, on raising tax levels and finding new ways of penalising industry and entrepreneurship. We want lower taxes, not higher taxes, and we want an atmosphere conducive to economic investment and the creation of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still an enormous and hugely costly infrastructure imbalance in my country. Nowhere in my constituency on the periphery of Europe is there a semblance of M1‐type motorways linking any of the regions. This stifles economic and business growth and opportunity. Nor have we any direct motorway link with continental Europe. We do not want to penalise these people for using the structural funds wisely and openly. Our infrastructural work is far from finished. Regionalisation is essential for my country; anything less would set us back decades and run counter to Treaty objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome President Santer's support for the cohesion fund. The Agenda 2000 proposals fly in the face of Article 104c of the Treaty which the Commission's annual report itself highlights. Under this article Member States in the euro area must avoid excessive government deficits, and that I support. Under the stability and growth pact budget deficits must be limited to a maximum of 3 % of GDP in normal circumstances, with the possibility of sanctions, including fines, for Member States breaching this limit.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that cofinancing of the agricultural payments is a non‐runner. This would have led to renationalisation and the dismantling of CAP. Slashing structural fund payments to Ireland, which we have used well, and should not be penalised for having used well, would immediately bring about huge pressure on the national budget and create deficits, leading to fines that would obviously exacerbate economic difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge a re‐think and a special case to be made for my country.</p>

<p class="contents">It should also – when the circumstances so demand it – be a time for a serious reconsideration of the approach taken and, on this score, the Fourçans report offers some lucid diagnoses. However, despite its technical merits, it is not a satisfactory report because it does nothing to throw light upon the approach or the guidelines that have been followed so far.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall not dwell upon the already well‐known points of disagreement between us concerning neo‐liberalism and excessive budgetary restraint, but we should like to highlight another aspect: the way in which the labour market works continually against the workers' interests and treats them as though they were the cause of all our ills. Slimming down enterprises – which means more unemployment – and wage restraint: the Fourçans report reflects the economic point of view here, neglecting the social aspects and thus merely making the situation worse.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, as well as sitting in the Committee on Economic Affairs where the report was seen as highly controversial and only passed by a wafer‐thin majority, we have tabled amendments that we would like to see approved, not because they change the report or do anything radically to alter its macro‐economic approach but because they would at least alleviate some of its harmful effects.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular we must: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ try and find ways of reducing working hours without any loss of pay, as a way of fighting unemployment, </p>
<p class="contents">‐ devise a budgetary policy that stimulates growth and employment, while guaranteeing support for SMEs in particular, </p>
<p class="contents">‐ bear in mind the importance of the Structural Funds and the trans‐European networks as a way of promoting state investment in infrastructure and improving the skills of the labour force, </p>
<p class="contents">‐ introduce a tax on speculative capital movements, making an effective contribution to stability through monetary stabilisation machinery or funds, </p>
<p class="contents">‐ last but not least, break with the dogma of the stability pact; it should be replaced by another approach or even a growth and employment pact.</p>

What basically needs to be strengthened is the demand element – purchasing power and domestic demand. This implies that regional policy must be taken as the starting‐point, and strengthening the regions really means creating genuine stability. We cannot create stability by means of an export‐led economy; we have been trying to do that, and it has not worked.</p>
<p class="contents">What basically happens during a cyclical downturn is that our potential is underestimated. And we do have potential: growth potential and employment potential in a whole range of new technological developments – in environmental technology and in the increasingly efficient use of energy. Such potential is simply not being used because it is unconventional, because it is new.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a lack of courage to admit mistakes, to appreciate that international financial crises would be manageable, that action could be taken to prevent them and that they could be averted, if those involved in the formulation of external trade policy were to recognise that economic and social policy need to be coordinated. That relates not only to the EU, but also to the policy of the IMF. We can see it in the Albanian crisis, for example, and we have seen what happened in Bulgaria. One of the root causes of such problems is that the IMF takes absolutely no account of important social criteria in countries undergoing transformation processes. In this context, may I also say that we can certainly take decisive action to curb currency speculation, which is also a destabilising factor, by showing some long‐overdue willingness to introduce the Tobin tax. It is a stabilising tax, and the stability it created would not only benefit countries in other parts of the world but would also bring stability for us in turn. For that reason, all I can say to you is that we must introduce another approach here, and at this time I can only appeal to you to incorporate our amendments into the report so that it will contain at least some new ideas and provide a new perspective, thereby clearly signalling to all observers that we really do want more jobs.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">de Lassus Saint Geniès </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, the euro creates a de facto economic solidarity among eleven of our countries. However, this does not mean it will eliminate as if by magic the considerable structural disparities that exist within the Union, making it particularly vulnerable to asymmetric shocks which could cause national self‐interest and nationalist tendencies to flare up at any time.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly evident when there is an uncertain global environment and repeated financial crises in most regions of the world. The individual responses of our governments have been to try to counteract local economic vulnerabilities while broadly coordinating over recent years only their general economic and budgetary objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">This is clearly not enough. We now need to tackle, in a transparent manner, the comprehensive coordination of both social and fiscal objectives, since these two facets of the organisation of European society are the two major means of adjusting our activities. They create sources of tension between our economies that can seriously exacerbate the impact of the asymmetric shocks that destroy our cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the context of these common social and fiscal objectives, there can be no question of limiting governments" ability to respond autonomously, just as large companies are nowadays well aware that giving their various units a considerable degree of autonomy makes them better able to respond to day‐to‐day developments.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to work steadily towards the long‐term general coordination of social and fiscal objectives in order to bring vitality to European democracy, although these objectives are extremely difficult to meet as it is. However in addition to this, should we also develop a public investment programme, as the rapporteur suggests? Since President Delors" proposals, which were put forward some time ago, this has been essential, particularly to improve the major infrastructures for transporting goods, people and information, which, in the future, will considerably help to structure, develop and define the European area. But the most pressing need is still to strengthen risk investment funds. Subject to these remarks, we will support the main thrust of the Fourçans report. However, we have to criticise the Commission"s economic report for lacking vision.</p>

To deal with this problem, it is proposed that the EU should introduce a new culture for – or, in simpler terms – a harmonisation of, fiscal, monetary and wages policy and a reform of the labour market. Public deficits are to be reduced without increasing taxes or other charges. In fact, these are also to be reduced. That means, for Denmark at least, that we would have to cut tax‐financed welfare benefits. This new so‐called culture is very much in line with what the German Presidency says about the euro not being first and foremost an economic instrument, but rather a political instrument which transfers one of the most important areas of the nation state"s self‐determination to the Union. The recommendations to reduce the budget deficit and to increase public investment are directly contradictory. The Economic Council of the Labour Movement in Denmark has pointed out that it is precisely the reduction in the deficit that has halved investment in Denmark. It is also clearly the reason for the record high level of unemployment in the EU. The June Movement cannot abolish the euro, but we are voting against the report.</p>

<p class="contents">For example, recitals C and F, on the asymmetric shocks that threaten the euro zone, highlight a genuine problem for the future. In recital I, the rapporteur rightly denounces the persistently high unemployment rate, and in paragraphs 21 and 23 he criticises the public deficits and the heavy burdens of tax and other levies in Europe. In paragraphs 28 and 41, he stresses the need to reduce labour costs through the reduction of taxes if we want unemployment to fall. Paragraphs 44 and 49 mention possible deflation and slowing of growth and point out that growth forecasts in Europe have been revised and lowered. In paragraph 48, he rightly calls for the study of varied economic policy scenarios to give a better understanding of how the economic situation is developing.</p>
<p class="contents">We actually agree with all these assessments but regret that the rapporteur was not prepared ‐evidently for political reasons – to admit that the majority of the errors criticised in the economic analysis in fact stem from one ideology, the socialist ideology which currently dominates Western Europe. This ideology is responsible, in particular, for the high taxes and other levies we pay, for public deficits and for unemployment. All of this is, to a large extent, linked to the climate of despondency which is crushing the spirit of enterprise in Europe, quite the opposite of what is happening, for example, among our great American competitors.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the economic criticism in the Fourçans report must be accompanied by political criticism; without it, we will not find any better way of combating the continuing unemployment.</p>

We have to conclude that in the past, old recipes have always formed the basis of EU policy and that there is a real need for us to break new ground. We need to break new ground if we are ever to achieve full employment and the sort of growth that will sustain such a level of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fallacy to imagine that the causes of unemployment are purely structural, because one of our particular problems in the European Union is the way in which cyclically induced unemployment has very quickly hardened into structural unemployment. That is why every effort must be made to kick‐start the engine of growth, which is our only hope of reversing this unemployment spiral. As an economic region, Europe has problems. It must therefore launch a kind of action plan. The annual economic report represents an excellent basis for that. It would also do nothing but good if the Commission were to come round at long last to the idea of inviting independent experts to express their views on the state of the EU economy, as is done as a matter of course in many Member States, to give us more food for thought and thus enable us to develop even better proposals, because we certainly must develop proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now rightly saying, as the European Parliament has said for the past two years, that the European Union will not be spared the effects of crises in other parts of the world like some tranquil island enjoying peace and stability in the midst of a storm‐tossed sea. On the contrary, we in the European Union must take action, and we can only take action if the various players are finally brought around the table with a view to creating favourable macro‐economic conditions in the European Union and above all to coordinating their policies. Policy coordination, after all, is part of the magic formula that has produced growth, investment and employment in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The important thing for us now is to find out why the growth process is stagnating again, even though our inflation is at historically low rates and we are practically starting to pen its obituary. We must ask ourselves why further economic development within a favourable supply‐side framework has done little to stimulate the private sector and why investments are not being made. That is really the central problem for us. That is where we undoubtedly need coordination between the various players.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, I believe that, alongside our very responsible trade unions, we need a monetary policy which can begin at long last to serve the purpose assigned to it in Article 105, as amended by the Maastricht Treaty. Only then will it be possible to pursue additional new paths and to implement successfully new infrastructure projects in the European Union. We need to engage the help of everyone who operates in this field, not just the finance ministers. We need those who formulate monetary policies, we need management and labour, and we also need a bold approach at long last from the Commission and the Council if we are to achieve the modernisation of our infrastructure policy and the creation of a public‐private partnership to provide investments that will effectively generate employment.</p>

What the Fourçans report does, very well and effectively, is to look at the economy dynamically and to adopt some political positions, which is useful and also beneficial.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make a remark about the comments on the introduction of the euro at the beginning of this year. I was expecting a rather more in‐depth analysis, but of course as the report was published on 20 January, it was not then possible for it to adopt a position.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Madam President, I believe we need to give this subject a good deal more thought. I think that we cannot treat monetary stability as an end in itself, although no one should ignore its importance. Monetary stability is part of a more general policy, and experience has shown that whenever we adopt an economic policy – and, even more so, a monetary policy – which has a single objective, ignoring consequences elsewhere in the economy, the results are not very good. The dynamic element is essential, therefore, and we must abandon the very sterile fixation with mechanistic approaches to economic phenomena and explore how a policy mix can reflect dynamic factors. If we do not do this, I very much fear that we shall be vulnerable to the political sirens who advocate solutions which, flying in the face of experience, persist in tackling classic structural economic problems by anticyclical methods. I do not believe that a reduction of a quarter of one per cent in the interest rate will be enough to alter the course of the economy in Europe. I do not think that attempting to solve economic issues which are purely internal to one particular economy by trying to establish a corresponding scenario at European level is particularly constructive.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I think we need to see how the euro can be used as a proper instrument for economic growth. We must not let it lose its value and, above all, we must not try to use it to solve other problems on a temporary basis, without reflecting on the long‐term objective which, in the final analysis, is what we must all aim for. We all know that the problem of unemployment, which is the main problem in the European economy, cannot be solved by using <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> and purely short‐term anticyclical measures: what we need is a very far‐reaching structural approach.</p>

I think that now that we are operating in the euro framework for the very first time, it is natural that we should discuss this issue at length, albeit under rather unusual circumstances. Mr Hendrick pointed out that in the last few years the biggest problem facing us in the European Union, unemployment, has not improved. This is hardly surprising, particularly when you realise that we have spent the last 18 months under Socialist presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The ideas put forward by the current presidency, among others – Mr Lafontaine"s calls for more government investment, a more Keynesian approach, and less focus on what we have agreed about the stability pact and other issues – leave us Liberals completely cold. It is a fact, as we can see from the Commission"s analysis and Mr Fourçans"s comments on it, that those countries which in the last few years have made the best of their economic growth, taken structural measures and reduced their budget deficits have been successful both on the employment front and in reducing national debt, and have put themselves in a position to be successful in the future. So we feel – and this is a question I would like to put to the Commissioner – that the measures under the convergence programmes of the three largest countries at the moment are not enough. They are too optimistic. If we are to discuss global economic guidelines shortly, the national governments – and perhaps the Commission could tell us how it intends to encourage them to do so – need to ensure that they come up with structural plans to make employers, workers and governments face up to their responsibilities and decide on a plan together, rather than having it imposed on them by the government.</p>

It is time to awaken from these illusions. We know that the euro is falling, the rate is too high. The euro is falling against the dollar; it is even down against the lowly Swedish krona, which is quite remarkable. Financial investors are giving up the euro in favour of the dollar. It is therefore necessary to stabilise the euro at a lower level.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is all this happening? To begin with, because the restrictions imposed on the Member States are preventing governments from pursuing an active economic policy and an assertive policy for growth and employment. Secondly, because there is a power split where economic policy is concerned between a central bank which is entirely unaccountable and not subject to any democratic scrutiny on the one hand and the governments on the other. This split is making it difficult to pursue a systematic and cohesive policy. Thirdly, because the demands for harmonisation of the economic policies of different countries are mistaken. As the economies and structures of the countries are different, they must be able to vary their policy if they are to achieve the same common objectives. If on the other hand they are forced to pursue the same policy despite their differences, divergence will increase and in practice the result will be instability. Convergence in policy is leading to inconsistency in the economy. Variation in economic policy, on the other hand, can lead eventually to real convergence between economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience has shown that all systems with fixed exchange rates, or large systems with the same currency, sooner or later get into a crisis. That was what happened in 1931, and that was how it was in 1992. What we need is monetary cooperation with flexible exchange rates which can fend off the adverse effects of economic change in an orderly, agreed manner. We need that in combination with an active economic policy in the hands of the governments and effective control over movements of finance capital.</p>

Even now that we have the euro, growth, employment and stability are still being quoted as the main aims of economic policy. I entirely agree with this, but I was surprised to hear a very significant comment that is decidedly incompatible with it: that the structure and operation of the European economy have been fundamentally changed by the convergence process. If that were true, then all this talk about the problem of high unemployment would not be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting employment was already the aim when the single market was created in 1992. Nothing new there, then. Nor can we expect EMU to solve the problem. The generic approach of coordinating policies, which the Commission seems to regard as a magic economic cure‐all, will not work. The causes of unemployment are structural, and solutions must be found specifically at regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">The current international financial crisis is showing up EMU"s weak points, and it is striking that it is the three main EMU countries that are in trouble and are fighting for breath in the EMU strait‐jacket. Anyone who finds this surprising should read the Minutes from the May 1998 part‐session, when it was already clear that France and Italy did not meet the EMU criteria in structural terms. The Commission is right to call for structural reforms and wage restraint to continue, but it is rather too late in the day for that. This too is nothing new.</p>
<p class="contents">I broadly agree with the resolution as it stands, but we cannot accept any of the 22 amendments that have been tabled. I hope that Parliament rejects them all.</p>

There is no doubt that, after an initial period of euphoria, the introduction of the euro has caused us to think long and hard. And that process of reflection has also been prompted by the fact that the development we would have predicted has not materialised – the kind of development that would be part of the natural order of things among our peoples because of their distinctive traditions of activity. But in order to reach this stage, we have had to adopt policies of restraint and they have had a negative impact on employment. And so, from now on, the efforts of governments, economies and, consequently, the business community and the workforce must focus on relaunching the kind of process that will give us economic development and, as a result, boost employment.</p>
<p class="contents">We Europeans take great pride in our traditions; we believe in the free market, but we feel that we must safeguard the special features of our economic system, which is not the kind of absolutely ruthless system that exercises freedom in a way that may sometimes have the effect of carelessly marginalising the more vulnerable within our society. Ours is a tradition of development that respects the conditions within society and, therefore, the needs of all: it is a balanced form of development which may perhaps seem slower in the initial stages but produces the right outcome in the end.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Berès </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Annual Economic Report has evidently taken on greater significance since the creation of the euro zone. It provides the means for defining action plans at European level as everyone is aware that significant growth is needed to solve the problem of unemployment. However, exactly how a European growth policy should be implemented remains to be seen. In this regard, I think that Mr Fourçans" report, which is a good report, should be completed with a number of amendments we wisely tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we need to develop both public and private investment. In short, we need to finally set in motion the grand plans we have spent so long talking about. Perhaps we will have to review our original list and shift the emphasis on to new sectors such as communication technologies, low‐cost housing and urban transport, which are factors that promote both growth and job creation. Perhaps we will also have to consider structural reforms. These are only possible if our economies are growing, so it is not enough to simply talk in terms of structural reforms to solve employment issues without also considering growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for this growth to develop, we will clearly have to implement a new fiscal policy and Mr Fourçans" report quite rightly included some of our amendments on reduced VAT rates. This is a step in the right direction as it will mean greater tax harmonisation beyond the present situation in the European Union, with respect for a particular code. If we were to introduce tax harmonisation solely to reduce national budgets" room for manoeuvre, we would not succeed in the fight against unemployment. Taxation needs to be readjusted in favour of labour. Monetary policy also needs to be redeveloped, as proposed in some of the amendments tabled by my group.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully understand the present situation, in which the authority and the legitimacy of the Central Bank is being consolidated. It is a new institution and, as such, needs time to make its mark, but at the same time we need to remain as consistent as possible with the Treaty. Indeed, the Treaty states that once price stability has been achieved, monetary policy must be instrumental in achieving the other main aims of the Union, including, of course, employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as tools are concerned, Madam President, I should just briefly like to reiterate the need for a coordinated approach to both the broad political and economic guidelines and the employment guidelines. To achieve this, we need to take a closer look at the role played by social dialogue, while ensuring that the importance of coordination between the Councils and between the Union"s various policies is not overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I should like to make is that we would have liked to have seen greater consideration given to the various possible economic scenarios in the Annual Economic Report this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the House will accept some of the amendments we tabled, so that my group can accept Mr Fourçans" report.</p>

However, we must not be naive; the problem is essentially a political one. In order to reach a position of power these days, it does not pay to advocate structural policy. Those who have done so have all been ousted, while those who have come to power have promised easy solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we are seeing today. It is much easier to lower interest rates, increase public spending and neglect the more difficult issues such as training the workforce, reducing labour costs, etcetera. So in spite of what Mr Katiforis might say, the disagreements among us are not of an economic or scientific nature. We are still able to listen, we invite top experts along and all agree: the disagreements are not between economists, they are between politicians. It is therefore much easier, politically speaking, to develop a macro‐economic policy instead of a structural policy. And that is where the disagreements begin.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Randzio‐Plath, who constantly refers to the success of the American economy, is doing exactly the opposite to what the Americans are doing, exactly the opposite. She extolls the rationale of the Federal Bank. But the Federal Bank has a federal budget that is in surplus and a market that is totally fluid. Its labour costs are 25‐30 % lower than ours yet she seems surprised to see that everything is going well in the United States but not in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us be realistic and honest with ourselves. Policies that succeed in combating unemployment are never popular and that is why they are not pursued in Europe. It is as simple as that.</p>

Parliament must make a decisive contribution to the debate and to setting the economic policy guidelines, taking advantage of improved statistical data resources and more detailed analyses. Monitoring is essential if we are to tackle properly the phase of structural reform which the introduction of the single currency is bound to accelerate. As a result of structural changes in technologies, we have to have an employment policy that focuses on education, on retraining and on improving qualifications: a policy, therefore, that contributes to increasing productivity and competitiveness. But that alone is not enough. Employment is boosted by encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit of competitiveness, by reducing the tax burden and harmonising the fiscal policies of the Member States. If the confidence of entrepreneurs is boosted, the result will be beneficial for productive investment and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must continue to pursue the objective of achieving budget equilibrium by reducing deficits but without increasing public spending. The value of the euro must be determined by the market and by market fluctuations: it makes no sense for the Member States to ask the European Central Bank to reduce rates individually. Political control must be in the hands of the European Union and not individual states. We must beware of the risk of asymmetric shocks and try to emulate the position in the United States. But we shall be able to achieve that only if, after economic union, we move resolutely towards political union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pérez Royo </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, I must begin by saying that we do not agree with the proposals in the Commission"s communication that presents the 1999 Annual Economic Report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s communication is the starting point for establishing the broad economic guidelines, but presents an analysis that we cannot support.</p>
<p class="contents">The title of the communication is ‘The EU economy at the arrival of the euro: promoting growth, employment and stability". I have tried to find where the stimuli for growth, employment and stability are in the communication. There is indeed sufficient stimulus for stability, but you will not find stimuli for either growth or employment anywhere in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">After two years of growth that, incidentally, was not excessively high, the European economy is currently on hold. We can debate whether or not this represents the build‐up to a recession or if it is simply a slowing down of the economy, but the figures are certainly worrying. The three largest economies in the European Union, which account for 75 % of the gross domestic product in the euro area, are behaving as follows: the German economy experienced negative growth in the last quarter of last year; the Italian economy has experienced very slight growth of less than 1.5 % over the past two years; and the French economy is currently reviewing its growth forecasts for this year, although it is experiencing the highest growth rate of these three countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore a real danger for the European economy and even, if I may say so, for the world economy. With almost the whole world in recession, except for the United States and the European Union, a possible shutdown in the European engine would have catastrophic consequences for the economy and the global situation. And we have not even mentioned what effects a shutdown of the United States economy could have, which is also a possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we can debate whether unemployment is structural or cyclical. What is clear is that, at least in the short term and possibly in the medium term, if we do not have a policy that strongly stimulates growth, unemployment will remain at levels that are unacceptable in our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">So what does the Commission say on this subject? Having carried out a most satisfactory analysis of stability, it tells us that the situation is promising from the point of view of monetary stability. It tells us that such positive effects could be encouraged by improving the policy mix, as the report states on page 39.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet later on, on page 67, there is a sentence which says that ‘The output gap for the euro zone is still undisputedly negative, both because of the presence of spare productive capacity and the huge slack in the labour market". However, it goes on to say that ‘as regards budgetary policy, a gradual structural reduction in budget deficits is expected to resume in 1999". Even at the risk of sounding Keynesian, we do not agree with this approach. In fact, we support the opinion expressed in another report that has recently been published under the charge of Jean‐Paul Fitoussi, the ‘<span class="italic">Rapport sur l"état de l"Union Européenne</span> ". This report states the following: ‘Nothing indicates that we are facing a situation of an excessive relaxation of budgetary policies. Moreover, it would appear that excessively restrictive nature of monetary policy has been largely responsible for the increase in public deficit in the euro area in the 1980s and even in the early 1990s".</p>
<p class="contents">It is in governments" interests to cooperate openly and in a more systematic manner within the Euro Council and to work on achieving the best possible harmony between the monetary and budgetary policies. We hope to see decisive action within the Euro Council to stimulate growth, including by means of the budgetary policy. We are currently lacking such growth in Europe.</p>

We switch too easily from Europhoria to Euro‐scepticism and back. We rush from consumer optimism to industry doubts. Yes, we should be concerned. Yes, we should be aware of the dangers of the economy sliding off the rails, whether they come from outside or inside the European Union. But the message that we should be sending from the European Parliament to Europe"s peoples and governments should not be a pessimistic one: it should ask them to be rigorous and demanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite everything, 1999 will be a year of economic growth in the European Union. It might be 2 % or it might be 2.5 % but it will be growth and the real success will be in using that growth to create jobs. We need to keep a clear head in order to strengthen the coordination of budgetary, wage and monetary policies. We need the courage to avoid any temptation to stray from the narrow path that would jeopardise the fulfilment of the stability and growth pact, the credibility of which is the best guarantor of low long‐term interest rates and controlled inflation. We need to make a collective effort, involving both sides of industry to coordinate wage policies and involving the governments of the Member States to speed up the necessary structural reforms and to move beyond their existing stability programmes, in which the budgetary control targets are minimal but nonetheless tend towards a balanced budget, or even a surplus by the year 2002 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">Public investment in the 15 Member States of the European Union came to 3 % of GDP in 1991. That percentage has been steadily sliding ever since, falling tono more than 2.1 % in 1998. Giving a fresh boost to the trans‐European networks and investing in education, training and the information society could help to reverse that trend. At the same time, we must reduce the tax burden on labour and reduce budget deficits. These are the types of news, recommendations and forecasts that we hope to see in the major economic guidelines promised for 30 March.</p>
<p class="contents">Growth, employment and stability are the buzzwords in political debate today. Stability begins within Europe despite the financial crises on the sidelines in Russia, South‐East Asia and Latin America and the overheating of the US economy. It is time to remain calm in the midst of the storm.</p>

He advocates a stability‐based monetary policy and sound budgetary policy. For that he has our approval.</p>
<p class="contents">We share his concern about the French, German and Italian budget deficits which were forecast for 1995 and which amounted to 2 % of GDP or more. Given the economic power of those three countries, this could well have had serious consequences for their smaller partners in the event of a crisis. I support many of the proposals in the report, but time permits me to highlight only three, namely the wish to channel more investments into research, education and training for reasons of competitiveness, the wish to restrict the consumption of non‐renewable resources while developing new forms of sustainable technology, and lastly the need to reduce labour costs without endangering the funding of social security systems.</p>

In 1992, America was in a state of crisis, Mr Herman, and it did not recover from the crisis by relaxing regulations, since regulations in America were already rather loose, and there were no market controls which, you say, hamstring the European economy. America emerged from the crisis of 1992 and gathered this momentum through the deficits created by Mr Reagan. These are just a few facts which you cannot ignore if you want to be realistic. As for the rest, of course our differences are political. We want to pursue a policy to benefit workers, while you want to pursue a policy to benefit stockbrokers. Which is more difficult – to come into conflict with workers or with stockbrokers? Only time will tell. Our work is far from easy, as you were insinuating, and we are not looking for easy solutions. We have a radically different social and political agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the report, I would like to congratulate Mr Fourçans on the intellectual quality of his work, but unfortunately I cannot support his general position, which of course stems from his political approach. For five years now, the Commission report has been following this method: it takes advantage of any slight, chance improvement in the economy to say to us: ‘look, the policy we are implementing is working and Europe"s economy is beginning to move forward". Each time there is a setback, it is not our fault, it is the fault of others. The fault lies with the crises in the third world, for which the third world is to blame. Our own financial speculators, however, are blameless. Neither the Commission report nor Mr Fourçans has addressed the issue of the responsibility of our own financial speculators for the disasters in Asia, for which we will also have to foot the bill – indeed, we have already started to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The average growth rate of the European economy has stuck at 1.9 %, which is 1 % lower than is needed to reduce unemployment. This has been the case for some ten years now. Investments remain static, although profit from capital has reached 1960 levels. Neither Mr Fourçans nor the Commission has taken the trouble to ask why.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years ago, the corresponding report to the one we are debating today stated that growth in Europe no longer depended on exports and instead was starting to depend on domestic demand and investments. What are we seeing now? As soon as an international economic crisis hits European exports, we are back in a recession. Where is the internal dynamism you say we are starting to acquire? We are taking a remarkable step and we refuse to accept that the policy the Commission is adopting has failed and that we must form a united front and totally reject it. We have become like the Bourbons, Commissioner and Mr Fourçans, who never learned anything and never forgot anything. And you know very well what the fate of the Bourbons was as a result of the stance which they adopted.</p>

There will be great scope for coordinated cooperation on the part of the ECB, the Commission and the various Councils, to try to ensure there is favourable development both for the EU as a whole and for the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be stressed that currency stability, whose importance the ECB strongly emphasises, cannot be the only objective of economic policy. Steady growth and the avoidance of recession must be seen as being equally important, since they are the only way to safeguard high rates of employment, which are of vital importance to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECB bases its policy predominantly on the regulation of the money supply. It thus believes in the quantity theory of money. This is associated with the doctrines of the early part of the century, not the thinking associated with a new millennium. It is not right either that the Commission should be forever stressing the importance of meeting overrated convergence criteria which do not take account of Keynesian views on economic and budgetary policy. A surplus should be used to curb overheating; when a recession threatens, we should be prepared enter into deficit to achieve recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">The budgetary deficit should be reviewed within the framework of the whole economic cycle. The importance of this is particularly obvious now, when the public deficit forecast for the three largest Euroland countries for the current year is at least 2 %, making flexibility and scope for recovery almost non‐existent. Parliament should therefore monitor developments and, if necessary, speak up to advocate policies of growth, employment and recovery, as well as structural policy.</p>

An action plan is therefore becoming essential if we are to close that gap.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the present report by Mr Fourçans, the general thrust of which I welcome, still lacks the courage to draw the logical conclusions from its proposals and demand more and better coordination of economic and monetary policy. An economic landscape that is overclouded by investment fatigue will not bring forth the necessary growth or the necessary crop of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, let me say that fear is the only reason why we are now saving more, and worshipping the golden calf of budgetary consolidation – important though such consolidation may be – is surely a short‐sighted and inadequate response. This has nothing to do with Keynesianism, which is often misunderstood. As long as we cannot conduct a coordinated economic policy based on sound arguments, a policy in which monetary policy also plays a key role, both inside and outside the European Union, it will prove difficult to promote employment, growth and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">A gratifying feature of the Fourçans report is the very responsible way in which it deals with the question of incomes and competition. I believe this approach will guarantee that the present rather complex economic situation will not be exacerbated by an erosion of purchasing power. That would stifle any additional growth, which is the last thing we want at this precise time. Impetus is what we need now, fresh impetus and a bolder approach, for more employment and more growth.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Porto </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, the 1999 annual economic report, covering the first year of the introduction of the euro, duly mentions the progress that has been made in firmly rooting a culture of stability and an established framework of stability in the European Union. The report – on which I must congratulate the Commissioner – also talks about a revolution in attitudes in all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This has occurred because the nominal convergence demanded by the Maastricht Treaty for entering the euro – achieving an historically low level of inflation and interest rates and an improvement in the budgetary balance – did not jeopardise economic growth rates: 2.7 % in 1997 and 2.9 % in 1998. The result was an improvement in the employment situation compared with the previous 5‐year period, with 5.1 million jobs created between 1996 and 2000 whereas 4.6 million were lost between 1991 and 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">This success was despite the background of considerable instability worldwide, especially in Asia, Russia and more recently in Latin America, with 20 % of the world economy in recession and 10 % nearing it.</p>
<p class="contents">This has led to a downward revision of the economic growth forecasts for 1999 but, given the overall results so far achieved, there can be no doubt that we are on target for economic and monetary union. Rigorous and realistic policies are now called for, as is suggested in the Fourçans report, on which I congratulate our colleague.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the other aspects, I should like to pick out just one: the role of public investment is going to call for special attention without a doubt, especially since the requirements of the stability and growth pact mean that the budget deficit cannot be increased. In paragraphs 25 and 26 of his report, the rapporteur stresses the desirability of performing ‘an analysis with a view to a harmonised and consistent definition of public investment throughout the European Union" since ‘rises therein may entail a reorganisation of public spending". Like other equally important – but perhaps less delicate – measures, such as making markets more flexible or training people, public investment is a difficult objective to achieve. That justifies the need for the European Union – and, in particular, the Commission and the Member States – to discuss practical measures that could be taken in order to rationalise the very notion of public investment.</p>

The main issue is deciding what policy mix to recommend for the Union and the Member States, traditionally involving budget policy, monetary policy and wage movements, since these are the main macro‐economic factors that we in the Union can influence ourselves. External factors play only a limited role, since external trade accounts for only 10 % of the Union"s GNP.</p>
<p class="contents">So what policy mix is appropriate in the current situation? Economic growth is declining and the Commission is already warning of a further readjustment downwards. The official inflation figure has fallen below 1 %, which means that the real inflation figure, allowing for miscalculations, must be almost zero. If price stability is under threat from anything, it is from deflation. With the employment threshold at 2 to 2.5 % and growing, unemployment is unlikely to fall any further. Something must be done to reverse the slowdown in growth. But what?</p>
<p class="contents">There is not yet much slack in the Member States" budgets, particularly in the bigger Member States that should really be making progress by now. There is some scope in wage trends, but very little, since wages are still lagging behind productivity, which is really not necessary when Europe"s businesses are so well off. So wages could be a way of giving a much‐needed boost to consumer spending, which is currently what is keeping the European economy afloat. However, it is vital here that the ECB should lower interest rates further to make investment cheaper and encourage consumers to spend more and save less. The present state of near‐deflation means that this can be done, and in view of the slump in Europe"s economy it needs to be done. With such low inflation the interest rates are too high, and the ECB must carry out its duty to support the Union"s economic policy.</p>

This year, however, the picture is very different. We have an instrument, the euro, which is binding and compelling and is forcing us towards a new kind of cohesion as compared with the past. We know that the autumn 1998 growth forecasts of all the Member States have been revised downwards, and we also know that France, Germany and Italy alone now account for three quarters of GDP in the euro zone. If just one of those countries were to find themselves in crisis, the whole picture would be affected. We are therefore faced with three new elements for which there are at least three responses. The three new elements are: firstly, a new kind of homogeneity based on the euro, that is to say fiscal, taxation and banking harmonisation – and only last night, at midnight, we were discussing and criticising the banks which have yet to accept the euro – in order to continue the process of achieving budgetary stability in individual Member States. Secondly, we have a new kind of sectoral division of the market, namely the development of the tertiary sector: we have to focus more on commerce, on tourism, the service sector and the craft sector. And finally, we have a new market element: the big companies have their place, but it is in particular to the small and medium‐sized enterprises that we have to look for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The three responses are: economic but also social market evaluation, a realistic wages policy, particularly for young people looking for their first job and, finally, public investment that is targeted and dovetails with private investment. To achieve that, I believe that the economic policy guidelines must be coordinated with employment strategy, and therefore the euro is – and remains at this historic moment in the construction of Europe – the main and most appropriate response. It is certainly not itself the goal, but it is the means of achieving the goal and must always be considered a sound starting‐point, as we intended, and a starting‐point at any rate.</p>

We have to tread warily here, because it is the consumer alone who creates work and determines employment policy. Consumers, in other words we, the people, decide what to buy; we choose the manufacturers of the products we want to buy and their regions of origin. Fortunately, consumers are very objective. They judge the value of the product on offer. In that respect they are very critical. When consumers go into a shop, they do not search the packaging of every product to find out where it was made; they base their choice on price, quality and customer service.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must focus far more sharply on the need to train our employees and our businesses to recognise the needs of the customer and to anticipate the customer's future needs. What makes a good company is its dedication to identifying the future wishes of its customers. To that end, such companies need an efficient government. We must ensure that statutory charges are reduced, that the machinery of public administration operates more efficiently, that we replace redundant departments, by which I mean that we should restructure unproductive departments into genuine service organisations. That is also a particularly important task for the European Union. We must set a good example here. I believe it is worth fighting hard to achieve that aim.</p>

Although our opinions differ considerably as regards the best policy to pursue at both national and European level, I should like to pay homage to his intellectual honesty and stress the importance of some of his proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the serious reservations I have about his text naturally relate to what I would describe as an obsession with budget deficits. Another point of contention, or obsession, relates to workers and their supposed lack of flexibility and adaptability. This is hardly surprising: we have neither the same approach to unemployment nor the same concept of the role of workers in the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are many things on which we agree, in particular, something that concerns me here, namely, the need for public investment and the criticism of the bank charges incurred by people making payments in euros.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the first point, I broadly share the rapporteur"s view that Europe needs to give more attention to matters relating to communication and its infrastructures. I fully believe that society must take on its full responsibilities in terms of training and education in both the short and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second point, I have already asked Commissioner Silguy and Commissioner Monti on several occasions about the issue of taxation. In my view, the Commission needs to act promptly on this as it affects the euro"s credibility at this intermediary stage.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I think that the Fourçans report is very thorough. It does not mask the differences between the left and the right and it is even very discrete about calling into question certain workers" rights. Nonetheless, it puts forward some very interesting proposals that are worth discussing.</p>

<p class="contents">The report tells us that the main European economic indicators remain strong, that investments are achieving good returns, and that inflation and interest rates are at an all‐time low. At the same time, however, we note that previous growth forecasts are now having to be scaled down quite drastically. We must investigate the reasons for this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is undeniable that the slowdown is partly due to external economic conditions. But they cannot be the only reason. The very fact that our trade with the regions in crisis, such as Russia, Brazil and South‐East Asia, accounts for a minimal percentage of the GNP of the European Union shows that this factor is not solely responsible for the slowdown. The real reason for our low rate of growth – and I believe there is broad consensus on this – is a lack of investment. Some people blame the European Central Bank and claim that the base rate is too high. That, however, is an astonishing claim, given that both short‐term and long‐term interest rates have already fallen to unprecedentedly low levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of the responsibility for the sluggishness of economic growth in the European Union lies with the uncertainties in the economic policies pursued by some of the larger Member States, as a result of which business confidence is sapped and investments fail to materialise. Companies will not invest if they have no means of knowing how high their tax and national insurance bills will be at the end of the year. This is the first problem that the economic policy of the European Union will have to address. The main reason for weak growth and the threat to jobs lies squarely in the realm of economic policy, and not with the Central Bank. As an institution engaged in dialogue with the Central Bank, we must not let it be used as a scapegoat for the faults of others.</p>
<p class="contents">Another topic that is currently high on the economic agenda is the strength of the European currency. What determines the strength of the euro, and what matters to the people of Europe, is not the drop in the value of the euro on the world market but its internal stability. With an average inflation rate of 0.8 % in Euroland at the present time, we have price stability. The rate of price increase in the United States, with which we tend to compare ourselves, is more than twice as high as it is here in the European Union. But the reason for the decline of the euro against the US dollar lies primarily in the international finance markets' lack of confidence in the economic policies of our large Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report before us, the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy expresses its support for an economic policy based on the principles of welfare capitalism and its opposition to a dilution of the stability pact. That is the only way to win back the confidence that has been squandered and to start fostering growth and employment once again.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">de Silguy, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Fourçans, on his thorough and precise report which analyses the majority, and perhaps all, of the elements of the multilateral monitoring process of which, I should like to remind you, the Annual Economic Report is the first stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I broadly agree with his oral presentation and I have listened with great interest to your debate, which, perhaps owing to the forthcoming elections, seemed to me to be more politically charged, with a more marked division than has been seen in recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ask you to look at the results, to be pragmatic. When the present House was elected in 1994, it was following on from 1993, a year in which Europe had experienced a recession of 0.5 %, whereas in 1998, growth of 2.9 % was registered. In 1994, deficits stood at 5.4 % and in 1998, they were 1.5 %. Unemployment in 1994 stood at 11.1 %; in 1998, it was 10 %, so it has decreased in the European Union during the present legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to your rapporteur, and if you do not mind me digressing somewhat from the notes that have been prepared for me, I should like to make several comments in the light of this extremely interesting and useful debate. I should firstly like to comment on the state of the European economy, before looking at the various aspects of economic policy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the state of the European economy, I share the rapporteur"s view that the European economy is affected by the world crisis. However, I personally felt that the overall tone in several of the speeches made was too pessimistic, for example, the speeches by Mr von Wogau and Mr Pérez Royo. In my view, the situation now is far less worrying than it was a short time ago, even though there is still some uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, with regard to events abroad, the situation in Asia, and particularly in Korea and Thailand, has become far more stable, with any uncertainty in the region mainly in Japan. Reforms of the Japanese financial and banking sectors have been announced and must now be carried out. As regards Brazil, the situation is being closely monitored. Moreover, growth in America was higher than predicted in the last quarter of 1998. This helps to support world trade. And lastly, but perhaps most importantly, the introduction of the euro offers us a degree of monetary stability and protection at European level. In this connection, I disagree with what Mr de Lassus Saint Geniès and Mr Blot said: it is thanks to the euro, and the euro alone, that the threat of asymmetric shocks in Europe is reduced because it strengthens economic and commercial integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look briefly at the most recent indicators available. Confidence in industry has once again fallen, but not as much as in the past, and in some countries the situation is even becoming more stable, as is the case, for example, in Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands and Finland.</p>
<p class="contents">The second indicator is the maintenance of a high level of consumer confidence after a considerable improvement in recent months. There is also greater confidence in the construction industry. Contrary to what Mr Hendrick and Mrs Boogerd‐Quaak said, unemployment has not increased. I have the latest figures here, which show that in 1994, as I said, the unemployment rate was over 11 %, in January 1998, it was 10 %, and in January 1999, it was 9.6 %. In 1998, 1 700 000 net jobs were created in Europe, and although I admit that the employment situation is far from ideal, it has improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Growth for 1999 will be lower than we predicted a few months ago, but it should gradually improve during the second half of the year, largely thanks to private consumption. It is true that the main areas of uncertainty today are to be found in Germany and Italy, particularly as regards investment. And I agree with Mr von Wogau that confidence is the key to investment.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation therefore backs up the Commission"s analysis. Maintaining effective coordination between the various agents of the policy mix must enable operators to remain confident and allow us to pursue and develop growth that generates employment.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my second set of remarks which focus on the broad guidelines and the content of the various policies. International developments in recent months has generated a certain amount of uncertainty regarding our efforts to achieve our main aim, that is, a visible and long‐term reduction in unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we sustain growth? It is a question many of you have asked, including Mr Pérez and Mr Metten. The Commission is of the opinion that the most important thing is to ensure that the Member States" economic policies are better coordinated in relation to the current situation. This is true of all sections of the policy mix.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin with public finances as it is an issue that many of you have raised. You are no doubt aware that the restructuring of public finances was suspended in 1998 because the nominal deficit, which was −2.1 % in 1998, compared with 1997 when it was −2.5 %, hides the fact that there was no reduction in the structural deficit. The majority of this was, of course, due to improved growth, which reached 2.9 % in 1998. This is somewhat regrettable because we are not far from stabilising the situation once again. There is still approximately a one‐point deficit to recover before the situation balances out, and I should like to remind you that, by contrast, the deficit in Europe in 1993 was −6 %.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Caudron, you will perhaps think that I, too, am obsessed with reducing public deficits, but I only have one obsession, that is, my obsession with growth and unemployment. What is more, public deficits have never ever created jobs; if they had, we would have known about it and seen proof of it. So we must not be mistaken about our main objective. Automatic stabilising mechanisms should indeed be used but only if efforts to restructure budgets create the necessary room for manoeuvre and if the reduction of structural deficits is not compromised; otherwise, this would have negative effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ribeiro, we cannot abandon the stability and growth pact because no‐one, and no minister, wants to challenge it, and rightly so in my opinion, because growth is not possible without stability. This pact needs to be further developed, hence the approach adopted, in particular, to employment, the European employment pact, and the ideas put forward by the Commission in January 1996 on this matter, which now appear to be more pertinent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes – and regrets – that, while they are consistent with the aims of the stability and growth pact, the Member States" stability programmes are not ambitious enough. Here I am replying to Mr Goedbloed, because reduction in this respect is really the basic requirement of the stability pact. So there is no additional room for manoeuvre, which means that our ability to react in the event of a dramatic change in economic trends might be severely limited.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will remain extremely vigilant as regards the implementation of the stability and convergence programmes and as regards respect for the commitments made by the Member States on budgetary issues. In any event, what does budget relaxation actually mean? It means a monetary policy that is more difficult to implement, higher interest rates and, in fact, more unemployment. I think that I am responding to comments by Mrs Randzio‐Plath here: this is why the Commission will monitor the situation and prevent a lax approach from developing, and this is something I can guarantee you.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue that has been mentioned on many occasions today, for example by Mr Porto, is that of public investment. Priority must first of all be given to private investment, because it is eight times greater than public investment and so needs to be encouraged and enhanced since, by its very nature, it supports growth.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards public investment, I would refer you to the Commission"s communication of 2 December, which indicated that the level of public investment had fallen in relation to GDP. At the start of the decade it stood at 3 % of GDP and it now stands at 2.1 % of GDP, which is unfortunate, even if the figures show that the situation varies from country to country. As a result, we must encourage the reorganisation of public spending and the development of public investment since both stimulate growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I took note of several interesting comments – outlined by both Mrs Berès and Mr Caudron – regarding, in particular, investment in what I would term human capital. It is clear that further public investment must not have an adverse effect on our competitiveness or lead to an excessive imbalance in public finances. Nor must it result in an increase in compulsory contributions. This would penalise private investment, which is worth eight times more than public investment.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I should like to reassure Mr Hendrick on this point: the Commission takes account, and will take account, of the level of public investment when assessing the public deficit of each Member State, in accordance with Article 104c(3) of the Treaty, and as recommended by Mr Fourçans.</p>
<p class="contents">Wage trends constitute the third area of economic policy. Over recent years, these have largely been behind the development of a significant number of economic policies, which is good for employment. The social partners have shown a very responsible attitude and today, in general, wage trends still meet the objective of stability in all the countries in the euro zone. I am aware that agreements have been signed in Germany, which have been mentioned in several speeches. We must remain vigilant and ensure that these wage agreements fit the context of what the rapporteur calls a reasonable increase in purchasing power, that is, a context which also takes account of productivity by sector and region and which therefore does not penalise employment in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate in this House on structural reforms – our fourth topic of discussion – has been very lively. It is true that these structural reforms are vital to overcome the traditional handicaps that hamper Europe"s attempts to solve the problem of unemployment. Mr Herman, you quoted the figure of 90 % for structural unemployment, which is perhaps too high. In my view, if it represents two thirds of the total amount, it is already huge. The Member States have made progress in this matter and it should not be underestimated, even though the efforts made to achieve it seem to be inconsistent as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">In my mind, Mrs Berès, these reforms aim to guarantee a high level of social protection and must increase the number of jobs generated by growth. In this connection, I think that it is essential to both improve the labour market and develop a more appropriate regulatory framework for companies. I welcome the fact that some of you, particularly Mrs Boogerd‐Quaak and Mr de Lassus, mentioned the problem of risk capital and its development in the context of improving the capital markets. I think that this is a very positive element that will help us to take full advantage of the impact of the euro in terms of innovation and job creation. Here again, I would refer you to the recent Commission communication, which, unfortunately, for the time being, has not been given a specific format by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say a brief word about monetary policy, which is the responsibility of the European Central Bank. It is a shame that Mrs Berès is not here, because I dare not, and wish not, to interfere in the development of this policy. I just wanted to point out that price stability is today assured in the euro zone and that, for the moment, there is almost no inflation since it currently stands at around 1 %.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall therefore only make one comment on monetary policy. It will be much easier for the ECB to implement the monetary policy in such a way so as to encourage growth, since the policy mix in the euro zone will not be knocked off balance by a relaxation in the budgetary policy. In this respect, I also believe that we are making the task of the ECB easier by dispensing with declarations that are too public and sometimes untimely.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to stress that the introduction of the euro encourages the Commission to enhance the functional nature of the broad economic policy guidelines. I congratulate you on your report, Mr Fourçans, and I congratulate the House on the debate today. It is a first step in the right direction. The running of the Union and the euro zone and the desire to define sound economic policies that focus on growth and employment are issues that need to be regularly debated. That is why the Commission has always favoured, and still favours, close collaboration with this House on the current debate on economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I can therefore assure you that the Commission will carefully consider your comments on the Annual Economic Report, which it will take into account when drawing up its recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines. This recommendation will include specific recommendations for each Member State, and I hope that they will allow the Commission to get on with its work on this issue and refrain from systematically criticising the recommendations or trying to deprive them of all substance. In fact, if we genuinely wish to coordinate economic policy, I believe that it is up to the Commission to state clearly and publicly the path it intends to follow. After that, of course, it is the Council"s job to make the final decision as it sees fit.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, having said all this, and after thanking you and congratulating you, all that remains is for me to invite you to attend the presentation of the recommendations on the broad guidelines on 30 March.</p>

I am supposed to have said that in my view unemployment has risen. Of course I realise that it has fallen slightly, but it is by so little that I do not think we can go back to the Member States and tell people that very much has happened at all.

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">de Silguy, </span> <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> Madam President, can I just briefly say first of all that I did not fully understand the question posed by Mrs Randzio‐Plath. I did not actually say that growth was not needed to combat unemployment, because it clearly is. At no stage did I say otherwise. However, what I did say – and this is something that was borne out and noted in all the economic analyses – was that growth alone will not be, and is not, enough in Europe to allow us to put an end to the problem of unemployment; it needs to be accompanied by structural measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Hendrick, I simply wanted to correct what I understood to be a simple technical error, namely, your claim that unemployment had increased. I said that it had not increased, but that it had decreased, even though it only fell by 1 %, which is not enough. That said, Europe is set to create more jobs in the 1995‐2000 period, generally speaking, than were lost in the 1990‐1994 period. Therefore, what I am saying is that the trend is reversed, but there is still a long way to go before the scourge of unemployment is fully eradicated. This will only be possible through a combination of a sound and stable macro‐economic policy that is focused on stability and growth, and a dynamic employment policy, which must be implemented in the context of general and consistent structural measures.</p>
