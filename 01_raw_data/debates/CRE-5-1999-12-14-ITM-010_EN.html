I am sorry that the Finnish Presidency of the Council is now leaving us because the Finns also wish to reappoint their present member of the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">Under Article 247 paragraph 3 of the Treaty founding the European Community and other similar provisions in the ECSC and EURATOM treaties, Parliament must give its opinion on the candidates before the Council unanimously appoints or reappoints the members of the Court of Auditors for a period of six years. The Council asked Parliament to give its opinion in a letter dated 3 November 1999, which also contained the names and curricula vitae of the candidates. The candidates for new appointments were Mr Reynders from Belgium, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn from Ireland, Mr Caldeira from Portugal and Mr Fabra Vallés from Spain and the candidates for reappointment were Mr Mohr from Denmark, Mr Salmi from Finland, Mr Clemente from Italy and Mr Karlsson from Sweden, in alphabetical order of the proposing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As required under Article 35 of our Rules of Procedure, the Committee on Budgetary Control interviewed and questioned the proposed candidates individually on 22 and 23 November 1999 on the basis of the provisions of the Treaty which require that candidates must hold or have held or be particularly suitable for an auditing office. Impartiality is the most important requirement. We also based our deliberations and appraisals on the guidelines in the 1992 and 1995 parliamentary resolutions by Mr Lamassoure and Mr Bourlanges.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, I am in a position to inform you that, having conducted a detailed examination, the Committee on Budgetary Control has come to the conclusion that the candidates meet the criteria for high office at the Court of Auditors and has returned a positive opinion on all eight candidates. We particularly welcome the fact that, if Parliament gives its assent, the 15 members of the Court of Auditors will include two women. I recall that our condition at the last appointment was that at least one of the candidates for appointment should be a woman and that Parliament would not otherwise give its assent to the appointments. We had one woman then, and another has now joined her. I think we are making good progress.</p>
<p class="contents">If plenary votes as scheduled, i.e. on Thursday, we in Parliament will have fulfilled our duty to state our opinion on time, thereby allowing a smooth changeover in the composition of the Court and ensuring that the necessary collaboration with it continues. These are the conditions which govern the procedure. But, looking to the future, there is more to it than that for Parliament. On Monday we discussed the Court of Auditors’ report for 1998. It highlighted a number of very important tasks which we must now tackle.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer mainly to the fact that the Court states quite clearly in its report, and I can only emphasise this, that we must change the spending culture. The Court of Auditors gave some very important indicators here. Having discussed the Budget 2000 in great detail in Parliament and paved the way so that in crisis areas, such as the Balkans, there is multiannual planning of funding, we must now gear ourselves to that perspective, instead of frittering money away on small, individual programmes and projects, which are not conducive to efficient control and where more is spent on staffing than on the objectives to be achieved. What we want is to work in a target-orientated and not an expenditure-orientated manner. I therefore readily agree with the Court of Auditors: we need better financial management. Some of the Commission’s proposals as to how this should be done have now been tabled and Parliament must also give a detailed opinion on them. We can no longer afford for large swathes of the people in the European Union to say no to Europe. We must all work on this; we must listen to what the Court of Auditors has to say and include it in our appraisals so that we again hear a positive response from the people of Europe to what it is that joins us together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stauner (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, as the authority of the European Union increases, so too does the importance of the European Court of Auditors, which has been an independent body of the Community since the Maastricht Treaty. However, the quality of a body or an institution stands or falls with the people who bear the responsibility in it, which is why it is particularly important that candidates with the right specialist skills who are strong and independent of character be elected as members of the Court of Auditors. Because the task of the Court of Auditors is not always a pleasant one. The members of the Court of Auditors must monitor careful spending of European funds and be ruthless in pointing out irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as spending by the European institutions is concerned, the confidence of the citizens of Europe has gradually been shaken in the past. It is, above all, thanks to the Court of Auditors that shortcomings have been uncovered. Now, however, we need to restore the confidence of the citizens of Europe in careful spending by the EU. The work of the Court of Auditors and its members will therefore be even more important and difficult over the coming years than ever before. All the challenges – enlargement, international competitiveness, sustained high unemployment – are linked to the question of funding and the remit of the Court of Auditors could change as a result. I think that its preventative work will increase. In my view, the eight members who were interviewed long and hard in the Committee on Budgetary Control have the qualities needed to carry out this work to the satisfaction of all concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that you have the courage and strength to touch unerringly on sore points in the future, should it prove necessary. A strong Europe also needs a strong Court of Auditors. However, I make no bones about the fact that the Court of Auditors is weakened because the proportion of women is not high enough, let alone representative. This is a considerable fly in the ointment of the composition of the Court, even though the present candidates include a very impressive lady. The appeal to the Member States to propose women for this job therefore stands. It must have got out even in Europe that women too can count and they certainly have no problem in pointing out shortcomings! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgan (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, under the Treaties, Parliament has the right to be consulted on the appointment of members of the Court of Auditors. The Committee on Budgetary Control held hearings on 22 and 23 November and adopted by secret ballot a favourable opinion on each of the candidates. However I was disappointed, like Mrs Stauner, that we had very few members who were women. Of the eight candidates put forward by the Council only one was a woman. That will mean that as of next year, two of the Court's 15 members will be women, which is an improvement but still not enough. I would therefore appeal to the Member States to put their own house in order.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make some broader points about the composition of the Court of Auditors. The system of appointing one member to the Court of Auditors from each Member State will have to be reformed with enlargement. In the same way that the Commission and Parliament cannot be allowed to grow indefinitely, neither can the Court. That will be considered at the IGC. But in terms of the Court it is important to get away altogether from the system of appointments by nationality. The role of the Court is to examine all Community revenue and expenditure to see whether it has been spent in a lawful and regular manner and whether financial management has been sound.</p>
<p class="contents">I see no reason why that role needs to be carried out by Member State appointees. That system is simply not sustainable in such an institution. Members of the Court should be appointed on the basis of their ability and specific skills, not on the basis of their nationality. There is a danger that Member States' appointees may still feel some loyalty to their national capitals and may be seen as trying to water down criticisms of their own Member States. What is needed is a court that is, and is seen to be, independent of Member States' interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately that should mean a system where we appoint proper, qualified auditors to the Court. The events of the past year make it all the more important that we have a Court able to make criticisms where necessary, both of the Commission and of Member States, which, after all, are responsible for the management of about 85% of the funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And we do mean passed, not just automatically rubberstamped. There have been candidates in the past that have been rejected by this House because there was some doubt as to their qualifications or impartiality.</p>
<p class="contents">Luckily, we have avoided such a turn of events this time even though, and I am betraying no secrets here, <span class="italic">ex ante </span>confidence has been placed in two of the candidates passed.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me therefore to make a few basic comments on the Court of Auditors. The Court of Auditors too is in need of urgent reform as the result of enlargement. As Eluned Morgan has just said, the clearest way of going about this is on the basis of the number of members, as with the Commission. At present, the Court has 15 members, traditionally one per Member State, even though the Treaty does not expressly prescribe this. Fifteen members is five fewer than the Commission but, in the case of a relatively small institution such as the Court of Auditors, any further increase will make the Court much too top-heavy and unwieldy. That the Court is already unwieldy is clear from the overly prolonged procedure preceding the publication of its report. This needs to be addressed at the forthcoming intergovernmental conference. I should therefore like to argue for no further increase in the number of members of the Court of Auditors and, in this case at least, for the reverse, i.e. a reduction in the number of members, to be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I take the view that the number of auditors available to the Court needs to be increased. In other words, to coin a phrase, fewer chiefs, more Indians!</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, and this is the second point which I should like to raise here, we must consider if the Court should not be allocated new tasks in connection with budgetary discipline. The crisis in the Commission now behind us demonstrated abundantly clearly that there is no effective mechanism for calling to account EU officials guilty of serious management errors or worse. This is mainly because the disciplinary procedure is an internal matter at the Commission, with officials sitting in judgement on other officials. So we cannot really blame those involved for taking a very, and unfortunately even excessively, lenient and forbearing an approach to cases from the outset. The only way out of this is to outsource these procedures to an external authority. What we need is a budgetary discipline division and such a division could well come under the Court of Auditors. It has the necessary competence in financial matters and it has the necessary independence. Mind you, this sort of reform would entail amending the Treaties. However, without such reform, all the announcements being bandied about to the effect that stricter action will be taken next time will just be empty words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The new Article 280 of the Treaty also gives the Court of Auditors new responsibilities by creating a legal body which will afford effective equivalent protection against fraud and any other illegal activity in the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Harmonisation in the area of the application of national criminal law and of the administration of justice in the Member States presupposes, necessarily, the harmonisation of legislation on fighting fraud and any other illegal activity in the Community budget. This means that it also falls within the competence of the Court of Auditors to guarantee that the protection of the Community’s financial interests is done on the basis of a single <span class="italic">corpus juris</span> and is no longer done, as it has been until now on the basis of vague, disjointed and contradictory legislation, which deals with the various attacks on the Community’s financial interests according to the policy they relate to and not according to fair principles. </p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore time to end the narrow divisions between the Common Agricultural Policy, the Structural Funds, the Community’s own resources and the Community’s internal and external policies and to guarantee that there is one weight and one measure for all of these. It is time to end the administrative and bureaucratic feuds and chapels and show that everyone has the same will to practice justice and rigour. We think that this is the way to better control and manage the Community budget in an ever more efficient, balanced and impartial way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
