Members will already be familiar with the text of this programme, so I shall restrict myself to emphasising some of the most relevant points.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start by saying that my country understands that the presidency’s work should not just address the need for efficiency at Council level, but should also involve a major cooperation effort in conjunction with all the Community institutions and bodies. This should go hand in hand with a continuing public perception of transparency in the presidency’s activities. We will need to pay particular attention to the relationship between the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament, in view of Parliament’s special interinstitutional role, and because of its legitimacy as a result of its direct mandate from the citizens of Europe’s various countries. This is the first message I would like to convey to you, together with a guarantee that the presidency will always be available to clarify matters and to achieve full and frank cooperation with this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a decisive moment for Europe in defining its model of political and economic organisation and in affirming its identity on the world stage in the face of the new challenges which it knows it must respond to. The plan to create conditions for stability and development throughout our continent, which is the major political objective of the present generation in Europe, means that we are obliged to make a number of choices that will have an impact on the future shape of the Union itself. In recent years, we have managed to achieve very significant progress in establishing the internal market and gradually consolidating the single currency, an ambitious project indeed. We now need to go further: we must guarantee that this progress is matched by parallel developments in other policies, so as to achieve a more coherent process which addresses the key concerns and fears of the public in Europe. If we are unable to use the instruments at our disposal, by which I mean the Europe that we have already built, in an effective and convincing manner, then it will clearly be impossible to persuade our citizens to accept the building of a greater Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese Presidency will seek to ensure that the European social model will, in future, evolve in a way that is compatible with maintaining the Union’s capacity to lead the way in economic competitiveness at world level. With a view to assisting the realisation of this project, we will be organising a Special European Council in March with the theme of "employment, economic reform and social cohesion – towards a Europe of innovation and knowledge".</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you may be asking what we hope to achieve with this initiative. Will this idea bring any added value to what has already been achieved? Or is it Portugal’s intention to initiate a new process to add to those already drawn up in Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne? These are valid questions and you already have part of our reply before you in the document that the Portuguese Prime Minister announced two days ago. We intend, through this project, to create better links, better coordination between the existing processes, but, at the same time, to introduce a new dimension. We must ensure that Europe is given a fresh impetus which will enable it, within 10 years, to turn itself into the most dynamic and active economic area in the world. To this end it is important to ensure that Europe’s economy can make the best use of all the instruments at its disposal and, in particular, that it does not get left behind in the key battle for competitiveness. As we see it, the current phase of this battle is the democratisation of the information and knowledge society at European level, thus radically closing the gap in this field between Europe and the other areas with which it is competing in the globalised economy. It is this push towards the modernisation, up-dating and synergy of new resources that we intend to launch at the European Council in Lisbon. We are relying on everyone – on this Parliament, on our social partners, on other areas of civil society, and, of course, on the governments of the Member States – to achieve this essential objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the political divide in Europe was eliminated some years ago. The unification of Europe has now become a strategic objective which the European Union has to address in its entirety and about which we can have no hesitation. For decades, peoples suffering restrictions on their freedom of expression were told that here, on this side of Europe, we were constructing a model of liberty and progress that we want everyone to share. The time has now come to show that we meant what we said. The plan to enlarge the European Union and all the contractual models that we intend to establish with other European countries all point in the same direction: towards guaranteeing a wide area of stability and development to provide Europe as a whole with a future based on peace and progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese Presidency is faced with the important task of ensuring continuity in the enlargement negotiations which started in 1998, based on rigorous technical criteria and an evaluation of the objective merit of each of the applicant countries. It is our intention to open all the possible negotiating chapters with these countries swiftly and efficiently, on the basis of proposals submitted by the European Commission. In the case of the six applicant countries just starting negotiations now, we will also do our utmost to guarantee that they are given an opportunity to make up for any lost time, without allowing this to have the slightest impact on the negotiations already under way. Turkey, which is a special case, deserves our particular attention, in view of the special situation involved and the need to ensure clear prospects of closer ties with the Union for this country, which occupies a pivotal place on the world scene. Enlargement is, therefore, a European objective which the Portuguese Presidency will not shrink from and which it will endeavour to take forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union considers that if enlargement is to take place, it will be essential to reform the Union’s own institutions so that they function in a more democratic, effective and transparent manner. Some of these reforms can be implemented without amending the Treaties, by improving the working methods of our institutions. Other reforms require treaty amendments, which will be formulated in the course of an Intergovernmental Conference that we will convene in a matter of weeks, with the aim of concluding the conference by the end of this year. This is, of course, a difficult and delicate task, because it involves the management of decision-making powers within the Union. It is our intention here to initiate a model that brings together both ambition and realism, that it to say a model that goes as far as is possible and necessary within a consensus guaranteeing the acceptability of the outcome to the Member States by the end of 2000. The need to respect that date, as everyone will be aware, relates to the fact that any prolongation of the debate could result in delays in the enlargement process, which would inevitably have negative political effects that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of the risk that this new reform process may fall short of some people’s expectations, and we are conscious of the legitimate desire felt by many Members of this House to go further. I can assure you that the Portuguese Presidency will do everything in its power, in line with the mandate conferred upon it at Helsinki, to ensure that the agenda of this conference comprises topics which provide a basis for substantial reform. However, whilst giving this undertaking of the presidency’s commitment, I cannot, of course, guarantee any miracles and, in particular, I cannot promise that the combined will of the governments of the Member States will match your own expectations and wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking to you today in honest and frank terms, because I do not want to give rise to any false hopes. In this context, I would also like to refer to a point which is of concern to the Portuguese Presidency, or rather one which has always concerned my country, even before it held the presidency: the way in which the European Parliament is represented at this Intergovernmental Conference. On this point, which we all recognise to be a sensitive one, our approach – without wishing to deviate from the precise terms of the Helsinki conclusions – is to go as far as possible in involving Parliament, either in the formal manner laid down in those conclusions or else by means of some informal framework under which this institution is content to rely on collaboration with the presidency. Although it has to be said that the model for representation adopted is better than the arrangements applying to the European Parliament during the negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam, we believe it is important to work in a way that promotes the establishment of an atmosphere of confidence and effective collaboration between the Council and Parliament. With this in mind, I have taken the opportunity to write to the President of the European Parliament explaining that our presidency intends to initiate the work of the Intergovernmental Conference at a special Ministerial Meeting at the time of the February General Affairs Council, as agreed in Helsinki. Therefore, at the beginning of each conference at ministerial level, there will be an opportunity to exchange views with you, Madam President, and with two representatives of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, this body will have two observers at all the meetings of the preparatory group to be chaired by the State Secretary for European Affairs. In my letter, I added that the presidency is committed to guaranteeing effective involvement of the European Parliament in the debate on the agenda of the IGC. We are open to ideas for our involvement in any other ways of working which Parliament may consider suitable, as long as they are in accordance with the Helsinki conclusions. I would like to assure you that you can rely on us as far as this joint work is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union can only assert its role in the world in defending its principles and its interests if we succeed in giving Europe a credible voice, and if we succeed in providing an effective response to the crises arising in strategic areas that we cannot ignore. Although opinions may differ, the Kosovo crisis provided, and is still providing, all of us with a lesson from which we need to draw the necessary conclusions. I believe that now more than ever, it has become evident that Europe needs to have its own resources for taking effective and timely action in crisis management and in carrying out operations to ensure peace and stability in areas which are vital for our collective security.</p>
<p class="contents">The Helsinki European Council gave the Portuguese Presidency the task of implementing new security and defence mechanisms in the European context, mechanisms compatible with the commitments entered into by some of us within the Atlantic Alliance, and with the specific situations applying to some of our partners in the European Union. Furthermore, it is important that we should be able to guarantee that this new way of working is compatible overall with the interests of our partners in NATO, either at European level or in the transatlantic context.</p>
<p class="contents">During these six months, we will test the combined will to work in this area, and we will seek to achieve an organisational model which is acceptable in view of the various sensibilities and interests at stake. This is admittedly a difficult task, but we are convinced that this is a challenge of major importance for the credibility of external action by the Union, and we will, of course, seek to take advantage of the various possibilities offered by our simultaneous presidencies of the European Union and of the Western European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, remaining on the subject of the Union’s external relations, I would like to make some further comments on this area in my speech and to emphasise certain additional aspects of the Portuguese Presidency’s programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that Europe’s efforts to equip itself with solid and effective internal institutions must always go hand in hand with close attention to events outside the European Union. Europe has always gained from preserving an active and open external dimension and from refusing to turn in on itself and thus shying away from the challenges of the outside world. We now need to be forward-looking in our external relations and to make our presence felt on the world stage in an effective manner. Accordingly, the Portuguese Presidency intends to implement a set of actions which will promote and strengthen Europe’s presence in the world, both by following up the traditional relationships already in existence and by promoting new initiatives in areas that we believe have an essential place at the heart of the European agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">We will, of course, be paying special attention to the grave situation in the Balkans and to relations with Russia and Ukraine, and in particular to the sources of tension affecting this area close to the European Union. Furthermore, we intend to ensure that the Mediterranean area remains one of the priorities of our external agenda, to which end we will be taking various initiatives under the Barcelona process and we will be seeking to guarantee visible intervention by the Union in the Middle East peace process. One important initial step here was my recent tour of this region, during which, accompanied by the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy and by a representative of the Commission, I visited Syria, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">It remains our intention to develop an integrated political dialogue with Africa as a whole, and to ensure that the process established under the Lomé Convention progresses satisfactorily in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Latin America will rightly occupy a special place in this framework for external action, in view of the increasing importance of this region for Europe and the complementary interests that now link us to that part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The transatlantic dialogue with the United States and Canada will also be an important part of our agenda, particularly as regards our joint participation in the Euro-Atlantic institutions and, above all, our commitment to relaunching the debate within the World Trade Organisation in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many other initiatives I could mention, especially in the multilateral context and in the framework of bilateral political dialogue. However, I shall restrict myself to the new initiatives of a summit with India and ministerial meetings with Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not wish to make this speech very much longer, in order to allow time for questions, which I will be delighted to answer. Nevertheless, I would not like to finish without mentioning two key priorities which will underpin our work, and also one issue directly related to the working of this Chamber. The first issue is justice and home affairs. This is probably one of the most promising areas for increased EU activity following Amsterdam. In this field we are expecting concrete proposals from the European Commission which will enable us to make the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice a reality, thus living up to our citizens’ expectations of the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is food safety. We are, at present, involved in an extremely delicate situation at European level: an atmosphere of suspicion now prevails, which has implications for the internal market and is having a negative impact on the area of consumer protection, as well as affecting our external relations. We believe that it is important to reverse this trend. It has therefore become essential for us to provide a harmonised framework for work at European level, in particular by establishing an agency able to coordinate the various national dimensions. The concept recently proposed by the Commission in its White Paper will be appropriately addressed during the Portuguese Presidency, chiefly through a report to be submitted to the Feira European Council in June.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to make it clear that the statute for Members of the European Parliament and their assistants will be properly dealt with by the Portuguese Presidency, as we consider it essential to resolve this important issue, which impinges on the dignity of everyone’s work in this institution. We will do our best here to ensure, by means of a dialogue with yourselves and by working together within the Council, that we can obtain a fair and balanced solution to this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the main messages that I would like to convey to you on behalf of the Portuguese Government as the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union gets under way. I shall, of course, be delighted to give any additional explanations that you may require. Many thanks for your attention.</p>

I am glad that his visit to the Middle East went so well. I am only sorry that I was not able to be with him since I was, at the time, seeking to get to Thessaloniki for the first meeting of the Reconstruction Agency. But I have to put the emphasis on the word "seeking" since I spent most of Monday at Munich airport.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to speak at length today, not least because I do not want to pre-empt the speech that Mr Prodi will deliver here next month. That speech will cover not just the next six months, but the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me echo the presidency, however, in saying that the Commission will naturally continue to set great store by its accountability to this Parliament. We also support the presidency's efforts to make the Council of Ministers more effective. As a Commission we are already engaged in a major reform exercise which we shall be discussing with Parliament in the next few months. But I want to focus my remarks primarily on issues that fall within my remit as External Relations Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency will have broader interests. It will have to guide the first phase of the Intergovernmental Conference. It will also have to follow up on the many commitments made at the European Councils in Helsinki and Tampere. For example, on enlargement, formal negotiations with the six newly admitted candidates will begin in February. At the same time the rhythm of negotiations with the other candidates must be maintained and the pre-accession strategy for Turkey has to be established.</p>
<p class="contents">In all these areas the Commission will be working flat out. Other major initiatives will be the European Council in March on Employment, Economic Reform and Social Cohesion for a Europe of Innovation and Knowledge, and the minister referred to that. We intend to follow up this Council with an action plan, E-Europe for the Information Society.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own field, the presidency rightly identifies progress on the formulation of the common European security and defence policy as a key priority. Minister Gama rightly drew attention to the importance of closing the gap between Europe's economic strength and our political influence, not because of some post-imperial vainglory but because our citizens expect us to do that and the world wants us to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency will see the establishment of the interim Political and Security Committee. I have proposed that the Commission should create a small crisis centre designed to enable us to react more swiftly when required, primarily in the delivery of aid. The Commission also considers it a priority to establish a rapid reaction fund, designed to provide quick financing for ad hoc crisis prevention and crisis management activities. This should cover, for instance, the rapid deployment of police forces and of human rights or election monitors, and support for civilian relief work, for security for institution-building and for media reform and public information campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to be heavily committed in the Balkans supporting Bernard Kouchner and the UN-led administration in Kosovo, developing our relations with the opposition in Serbia to encourage a change of regime, supporting the democratic government in Montenegro, continuing the difficult task of building a multi-ethnic Bosnia, supporting the new government in Croatia and drawing Albania and FYROM closer to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I will just make three general points. First, we need to do all that we can to ensure that our finite resources are used to best effect. I have dwelt before on the slow and inefficient delivery of our aid programmes. I am getting a reputation for being obsessed with this issue – a reputation which I am honoured to have. Anyone who comes to my office will see that the carpets are already well-chewed and the walls well-climbed in frustration at the length of time it takes us to get things done. It is intolerable, it has to change and it will change.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said before, I have the honour to work with officials who are very good, but are having to operate procedures which are lousy. That is why we have launched a review of the delivery of our external aid programmes and I hope to bring proposals for change before you in the spring. I am delighted that this is a subject which you clearly attach priority to.</p>
<p class="contents">We are drawing up a new regulation covering our assistance to the Balkans. The intention is to simplify our procedures and to speed-up our assistance. We will be reporting with Javier Solana to the Lisbon European Council on our policy in the Balkans and ways to deliver our help better.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday, the European Reconstruction Agency was launched in Thessaloniki. It will have a vital role, first of all in Kosovo and subsequently, I suspect, more widely. I hope it will be able to follow in the footsteps of our Task Force in Pristina which is now near the end of its assignment. The Task Force has shown that the Union can do a seriously effective job and fast, with the right leadership, with the minimum of red tape and by delegating authority to the people in the field. Commending its work is not a demonstration of complacency about the position in Kosovo. There is a huge amount for us to do there in order to live up to our promises and our ideals.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a further point that is relevant to the question of resources. Member States must be ready to make hard choices about what the Union can and cannot do and to recognise frankly that sometimes they make it harder for the Commission to be efficient because of the conditions with which they burden our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">This will be a critical year for Russia with the election of Yeltsin’s successor. Chechnya will, of course, loom large. We will keep our policy under review. The Commission needs very clear guidance from Member States as to how to use the instruments at our disposal: the common strategy, the partnership and cooperation agreement, TACIS, human rights and democracy programmes, food aid and so on. We are considering with the Council how to implement the decisions reached at Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Middle East there may be grounds for hope. The pace of developments in the Middle East peace process has accelerated recently despite the setbacks this week. We will have a debate on this shortly. Let me just say that we are conscious that the European Union has, and will continue to have, a major contribution to make and not just by digging deeper in our collective pockets, although our financial contribution has been and will continue to be substantial.</p>
<p class="contents">Closer to home, we need to breathe new life into the Barcelona process and I look forward to the conference that will be organised later in the year on the EU-Mediterranean partnership, just as I look forward to the EU-Africa Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will be able to work with the presidency in fostering a growing political and economic relationship between the European Union and Asia. The Commission will shortly be producing a communication with Indonesia. We hope that our discussions with China on WTO entry, difficult though they may be, reach a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that, thanks to the presidency's initiative, we will be holding a summit with India. I believe that we should be working to strengthen our relationship with what is, after all, the largest, greatest democracy in the world, a country where, in election after election, more people vote in free and fair elections than in the whole of Europe and North America put together.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament, understandably, has always taken a close interest in how the European Union supports human rights and democratisation worldwide, including through the hundred million euro available under the European initiative for democracy and human rights. I share that interest strongly. Many changes have taken place in recent years, not least the adoption in 1999 of the two human rights regulations. In the first half of this year the Commission intends to adopt a communication setting out its approach to policy in this area, including the official management of our human rights and democratisation programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament asked the previous Commission to assess the European Union's participation in election observation missions in recent years – an experience which can be best described as "mixed". In response to this request and to the changed legal and budgetary environment provided by the new regulations, the Commission intends to adopt a communication before Easter, setting out some proposals for rationalising and improving our activity in the areas of election observation and assistance. That, I know, will be a subject of particular concern to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">It is plainly going to be a busy six months, a period in which we can, I hope, make a difference. I look forward to working with honourable Members and with the new presidency, whom I congratulate on their programme. I look forward to working with them to achieve that objective.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, both the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Patten have spoken of the need for proper cooperation between the institutions. I emphatically support that and can say on behalf of our Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats that we want to work as closely as possible with the Council Presidency. Generally speaking, we already do so with the Commission and good contacts have been initiated. I hope that we can continue to cultivate these good contacts and this cooperation during the six months of the Portuguese Presidency and achieve joint success in the end. Because when you, as the Council Presidency, are successful, then it is our joint success, the success of Europe. So let us work well and closely together.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this is the second Portuguese Presidency. We all have confidence in you but please, be ambitious! The biggest project which you will start under your presidency is the Intergovernmental Conference. We should like to encourage you to make your contribution, go beyond the Amsterdam leftovers and undertake an ambitious programme. We encourage you to be prepared to make proposals under your presidency, as the Helsinki Summit expressly authorised you to do, so that we can get beyond the three areas left over from Amsterdam because sorting out these three leftovers will not suffice in order to describe the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference as a success. We must get beyond that and I should like to encourage you to exercise your right to submit new proposals to the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to go into the details now, although it would be very interesting to do so. That is reserved for the debate, however, and Messrs Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen have submitted a report whose general approach we share. So be ambitious. We must, of course, insist on one thing. The Helsinki Summit spoke of both observers in relation to the European Parliament. I should like to ask you from the bottom of my heart to do everything during the practical arrangements for the conference to ensure that the two representatives of the European Parliament have, as far as possible, equal rights at this conference and are given the necessary opportunities, including the necessary technical and working opportunities, to have a proper say at the Intergovernmental Conference. I ask you sincerely, and from the bottom of my heart, to ensure that this is the case. We shall also be rating your presidency on the degree to which you comply with this request.</p>
<p class="contents">We also thank the Commission for the fact that Commission President Prodi supported the proposals by our President Nicole Fontaine for a broad approach at the Intergovernmental Conference and a suitable status for the two European Parliament representatives in Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall be embarking on new negotiations with six countries under the Portuguese Presidency, five central European countries and Cyprus. Our group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats has always called for central Europe to be considered as a single entity and we hope that progress will be made in the negotiations over the coming months, which will certainly be very difficult. We should like to ask you, therefore, to give high priority on the European continent to questions of internal security which are very important indeed, both per se and to the acceptance of enlargement in the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">You made a brief reference to Turkey. The European Parliament has acknowledged candidate status for Turkey as decided in Helsinki, but we are now asking for the same standards to be applied to practical relations with Turkey as are applied to the countries of Central Europe. To give you an example: if there is a Hungarian minority in Slovakia or Romania and we insist that they be able to preserve their identity, then we expect the same of Turkey in its handling of the Kurdish question. We want to see progress here so that the identity of the ethnic minorities in Turkey are preserved and we ask you to take the necessary initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As far as Russia is concerned, we need stability on the European continent. The security of our continent will depend to a large extent on stability in Russia. This should not mean, however, that we keep quiet about certain events. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is our duty in the face of events in Chechnya to raise our voices loud and clear and to say to Russia that, if it continues to behave in this way, it is distancing itself from the values of human dignity and human rights of the European continent. Do not be too diplomatic when you express our concerns about human rights in Chechnya to Russia. We must make our voice heard.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten rightly referred to the Mediterranean area. Our Group is agreed that relations with the Mediterranean area and the situation in North Africa and in the Middle East are as important to the European Union as developments in Central or Eastern Europe. We accord them a high priority and we want a dialogue of cultures, but we would also ask you not to be too rash in extending invitations to personalities from the Mediterranean area to visit Brussels. We need to consider if it would perhaps be better to extend such invitations at the end of the peace process, but I do not want to go into that here.</p>
<p class="contents">One final comment: we were pleased to hear you also refer to the status of Members. Parliament has made a proposal, which comes not from our Group but from Mr Rothley, but which we emphatically support. We want proper, uniform status for all Members of the European Parliament and we want to safeguard the dignity of Members, and I emphatically welcome what you said on this; however, it must be a uniform status which applies to all Members of this European Parliament. If you can make a start on this and the other items on the agenda, if you are successful, and we hope that you are because this is not a party political matter, then it will be a success for Europe and for all of us and for stability, security and democracy on our continent. Our Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats wishes you every success in this respect.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seguro (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on behalf of the Socialist Group I would like to welcome you, Mr Gama, and to congratulate you on your speech and on your presentation of the Portuguese Presidency’s programme. I would also like to say that we believe cooperation with the Council is not just about the kind of cooperation dictated by institutional criteria, it is also about the kind of cooperation we believe the content of the programme presented by the Portuguese Presidency deserves. The same applies to cooperation with the Commission, but in this particular case I have in mind the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that this programme provides a balanced and ambitious vision of how the European Union should tackle the challenges it faces: emphasising external relations, by means of a strategic policy of relations with various parts of the world, and with particular stress on understanding developments in Latin America and within Mercosur. But priority also needs to be given to enlargement and to the need to strengthen the common European security and defence policy. </p>
<p class="contents">However, alongside this important vision in the Presidency programme, European problems, that is to say the problems of the countries that constitute the European Union, are also a priority and a concern in this programme. In this context, the area of freedom, security and justice is a priority, as is concern regarding food safety, consumer rights and environmental issues, as part of a vision of development that is sustainable internally and which does not need help from outside.</p>
<p class="contents">Of all these different points there is one, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that deserves our special praise, and that is the priority the Portuguese Presidency is giving to social affairs and employment issues. The Portuguese Presidency has not simply been content to incorporate the legacy of other presidencies into its programme: instead, it wishes to leave its own legacy, and this legacy is one that we Socialists and, I am sure, most Members of this House, will consider an important one. It involves not just making the European Union a dynamic and competitive area of the world but, first and foremost, remaining faithful to its civilising values and defending the European social model. At the beginning of this new millennium, the greatest tribute that we can pay to the founders of Europe and to the real project of EU solidarity is perhaps this desire for competitiveness based on innovation and knowledge. I am delighted to note, from the way this document was presented last week by the President-in-Office of the Council and from the way it has been drawn up, that this point is likely to be not just a priority for one presidency, but an EU objective for the foreseeable future. We would accordingly like to offer our congratulations on this choice of priority and to state our willingness to cooperate in developing it and in ensuring that we move from words to deeds in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the Intergovernmental Conference, which Mr Poettering has already mentioned. The European Parliament was deeply disappointed with the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council – disappointed both by the Council’s attitude towards the European Parliament and by the agenda it set. When it comes to revising the Treaty, the European Parliament does not want to be relegated to the role of a mere observer of the Intergovernmental Conference’s work. We have opinions, we have work to do, we have experience, and we want to use this experience to help Europe and the European Union develop and become stronger. And the agenda and the content have not been set at the whim of the European Parliament or out of stubbornness. There cannot be an IGC every year, and we now have an opportunity to give some impetus to various topics on the agenda. I do not mean that this applies to every topic – we cannot achieve wholesale reform, but we can make progress in some areas. Issues such as defence policy, citizens’ rights – which may have to be dealt with in parallel, in the Convention on the Charter of Fundamental Rights – and the question of the European Union Human Rights Commissioner, are all issues which, in our opinion, could form part of this agenda, alongside others to be examined in greater detail. That is why I am delighted to see that the presidency has declared that it is in favour of a substantial agenda. Whether we call it a substantial, comprehensive or weighty agenda, I am delighted to see that the Portuguese Presidency is willing – seriously and without “wilfulness”, as the President-in-Office put it – to work with the European Parliament to increase the awareness of the other governments and to include more topics in this agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot expect the Portuguese Presidency to do all this work on its own. Each one of us, working in our own countries and alongside our colleagues in our national parliaments, has a duty to increase the awareness of the other governments, so that we can reach a consensus on this subject. The question I would like to put to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is to ask whether, if we make progress and if this House can give its opinion in good time before the IGC is convened on 14 February, the Portuguese Presidency intends to present a proposal for the agenda of this new IGC to the Special European Council in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I wish you good luck. Your task is by no means an easy one and as Mr Barón Crespo said, the Portuguese Presidency’s programme is highly ambitious. However, as a Portuguese poet once wrote “when a man dreams, the world leaps forward”, and it is when we have grand ambitions that we will be able to make progress, even if it is only in small steps, towards making the European Union more solid, more united and, above all, stronger for all its citizens.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I should like to take advantage of this opportunity on behalf of the ELDR Group to make three suggestions to the incoming presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, let me say with regard to enlargement that we strongly welcome the change in what I would describe as the "mood music" and the political ambitions surrounding the enlargement debate. This has been confirmed at Helsinki and it now falls to this presidency to advance that dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">For those candidate states already advanced in negotiation it is clear that we are getting towards the more critical and difficult parts of the negotiating process and for those just given the green light at Helsinki we must begin that work.</p>
<p class="contents">In that context, it is important to recognise and address some of the elements that are emerging clearly in terms of public opinion and debate. It is obvious in some of the candidate states that there is a certain slippage in public opinion towards the European project. It is important that we recognise and address this in terms of policy. There is, in some cases, evidence of an emerging "them and us" mentality and we must confront this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a suggestion to the presidency that beyond the ordinary channels of diplomacy through which you are committed in your statement of objectives to consult candidate states about their perspectives and the IGC, you should consider using the European Conference as a mechanism and a method in a public way to hear and engage in dialogue with candidate states on their views. We suggest this as a means of indicating at the highest political level the parity of esteem which we accord to candidate states. It is important in the view of my Group to be and to be seen to be engaged in creating a Europe of partnership and not a Europe through diktat. We must find mechanisms to establish that clearly in the minds of our candidate partners along the way.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to mention is the Intergovernmental Conference. It falls to you to undertake the extremely important task of establishing the agenda and launching the conference, sometimes, I suspect, a rather thankless and difficult task nonetheless. It is clear that the conference is committed to examining the Amsterdam leftovers. These are clearly necessary but in my view they are not sufficient in terms of an agenda ambition and I share the views of the other colleagues who have spoken here today.</p>
<p class="contents">One could almost feel the chill breeze of the closing door in Helsinki on the question of a wider ambition, but the conclusions left that door just ajar. Mr President-in-Office, I would ask you to place your foot firmly in that open door and to drive a more ambitious agenda. It is extremely important that we take an opportunity now through this IGC to try to put a bit of soul back into Europe. It is very clear that the current construction of the treaties fails to capture in a meaningful and accessible way the aspirations of contemporary Europe. The current Treaty fails to set out, in a clear and comprehensible way that any ordinary person can follow, how this place works. We must do a better job of explaining it by building it into the fabric of the basic documents and I urge you please to go back again. It may have been too soon in Helsinki to say "yes" to ambition. It will be too soon today to say "no". Go back and look at that and you will have the support of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly welcome your commitment to this idea of a Europe of innovation and knowledge and I look forward to contributing to that debate in this House and directly with the presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">We have done a lot of work with the United States on digital dialogue, especially at the moment in the area of privacy and data transmission, but it is inconclusive. We have a legislative forum between this House and the US Congress. We have regular summits between the Council and the United States and we have a receding window of opportunity with an outgoing administration to close off some of the dossiers. I would urge you, Mr President-in-Office, to take hold of this agenda and drive the transatlantic digital dialogue towards some specific and early conclusions and do not let it drift to be renewed at a later date under a subsequent administration. There is a real opportunity now and you can lock it down as part of your commitment to the Europe of innovation. Go for it. We wish you every success.</p>

Furthermore – and this will be my second point – you will also be chairing a conference on employment and economic and social cohesion, the importance of which is clear to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the Intergovernmental Conference, I must state the position of my Group and our proposals. With regard to the content, previous speakers have rightly underlined the inadequacy of Helsinki. Such a narrow agenda is not acceptable. At least four specific points must be included on the agenda. These are the legal status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and its implications for the people, the essential mechanism of reinforced cooperation, the gradual integration of the foreign and security policy, with particular emphasis on conflict prevention in the Community pillar, and finally, the revision of the obsolete Euratom Treaty. The objectives of this Treaty must be reviewed and incorporated within the EU Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the method, we have been fully aware of the limitations of the intergovernmental approach for some time now, as well as the limitations of taking decisions by unanimous vote. The Council has wrongly chosen not to change this method which is disappointing. Yet if the Council is to prove its claim of wanting a more democratic and stronger Union, then at the very least the European Parliament, but also the national parliaments, must be involved as much as possible. This House must participate to the same extent as the Commission because these are the two institutions which have a Community vision. It would therefore be logical to have an assent procedure at the end of negotiations. </p>
<p class="contents">Without this, I, like other Members, fear that the gulf between the people and the European institutions can only grow. We witnessed an important process in Seattle where there was a strong reaction from the people to a world body which is not understood and whose operation is perceived as being dangerous for society as a whole. The European Union should not be subject to the same process which I would personally regard as regrettable. You are soon to tour the capitals in order to convince your colleagues to extend the agenda and change the method. We will await the results of your efforts before deciding on the future of this Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point which I feel has not been sufficiently stressed. It is virtually essential that this conference is a success, otherwise the European Union will be stymied for good. I am particularly thinking of the tax issue, which we all hold dear. For many years, we have been incapable of taking ambitious decisions on environmental taxation because the unanimity rule prevented us from doing so. This brings me to the second point of my intervention – employment – as this type of taxation also generates jobs. Innovation, of which everyone is in favour, seems to be the keyword for the employment summit. Although innovation is clearly a factor in competitiveness, it must not be allowed to mask a reality which is darker and more worrying. Innovation can often play a major role, without doubt, but competitiveness is at times being achieved through dubious mechanisms which are leading to a sometimes significant deterioration in working conditions in Europe, an increase in risks, a worsening of the environmental situation and general stress. </p>
<p class="contents">This is not just idle talk. A recent report from the European Foundation in Dublin reveals that working conditions are poor or worsening for many workers. As for the environment, the 1999 report of the European Environment Agency shows that out of the 12 parameters studied, 11 are in a position of either status quo or deterioration. Furthermore, the sinking of the oil tanker <span class="italic">Erika</span> clearly shows that competitiveness in one economic sector may be achieved at the cost of a deterioration in working conditions, an increase in risks and a serious threat to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore time to review certain standards which are currently being used. This need is regrettably not very apparent in your document. As an example, innovation can go hand-in-hand with the goal of increasing productivity, no longer the productivity of labour, but the productivity of scarce and non-renewable resources. This is the fast track, not only to ensure sustainable development, but also to create jobs which are more stable, safer, less stressful and more promising for the future. This brings me back to my starting point. All this can only be achieved if we change the way the European institutions work. This is the objective which we must pursue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miranda (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to welcome the Portuguese Presidency and to say that we will be paying very close attention to the progress made on the most relevant issues and on this presidency’s priorities. These range from enlargement to amendment of the Treaties, from the future of the Lomé Convention to the EU-Africa Summit and from employment issues to the second and third pillars. And we will chiefly be doing this because of our concerns regarding a number of these issues, or rather the way in which they are being handled. This applies to enlargement, to which we do not have any objections in principle, but which we consider is being implemented in an irresponsible way, without any detailed analysis beforehand of the different problems that could arise in each country and ways of avoiding them.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there are now more serious doubts about considering Turkey as an applicant country, given that the government of that country is totally failing to address the Kurdish issue adequately or to cease its occupation of Cyprus. There are also serious concerns about the revision of the Treaties. Not so much because effective adjustments may have to be made to the Treaties in view of enlargement, but rather because we fear that there will be a temptation to move towards political inner cabinets for the European Union under this pretext, which would be mistaken and unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Africa, although this has not been confirmed here by the presidency, we have learnt with a mixture of satisfaction and a certain unease that preparations for the summit which had been announced here are to be set in train again. We are satisfied because we have always felt it both necessary and desirable to hold such a summit, particularly if it is geared towards launching genuine cooperation between our two continents in an appropriate way, but also because we have always said that it is essential to carry on doing everything to ensure that it takes place. However, we also feel some unease because it seems to us that there is very little time between now and April, which has been identified as the date for this summit, and this will inevitably make proper preparations for the summit difficult, and could even prevent it from taking place at all.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we have duly noted the presidency’s recent statement on Angola. Although this was rather late in coming from the Council, we see it as a step in the right direction, although, particularly because of the positions adopted in this House and in the Joint Assembly, we were hoping for a statement which condemned UNITA more strongly given its clear responsibility for all the tragic events in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">What really worries us, however, as much as if not more than the way some of the issues under the spotlight may progress over the next six months, is the fact that certain issues of great concern to us do not feature amongst the Portuguese Presidency’s priorities. Economic and social cohesion is being overlooked and is almost being demonised at Community level, and it really is painful to see the Portuguese Presidency also omitting any specific reference to promoting cohesion, despite coming from one of the countries which, in relative terms, is least developed.</p>
<p class="contents">The low turnout in the recent European Parliament elections confirmed that fundamental democratic deficits exist and indicated that the public was clearly distancing itself from the dominant neo-liberal approach to policy. In spite of this and despite our being on the verge of amending the Treaties, there is no provision for any institutional changes that would put an end to such deficits, and at the same time there is an insistence on such a policy approach without any specific attempt to effectively combat unemployment or to promote employment, which are issues of great concern to the public. We will not be appeased by a special summit on some pompous theme, because there have already been various summits on employment issues, and none of these has resulted in any will to change the prevailing monetarist policies. Furthermore, the objectives and deadlines are so vague and the programmes adopted are so contradictory and over-ambitious, that it seems to us that this is just a smoke screen rather than an event genuinely intended to bring about any marked change in the Community status quo.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have an opportunity today to analyse the programme you have presented and the intentions set out in it. In July, however, we will be able to carry out a rigorous, definitive and complete evaluation of the current Portuguese Presidency, and we will not fail to do precisely that! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every six months, it is as if we were starting all over again, recalling the same spirit – nothing more and nothing less.</p>
<p class="contents">The path that has brought us to this point, enabling us to achieve what was unthinkable 50 years ago, is the same basic path – and not some other path that we might have attempted to go down – that the present Member States and others that may be part of Europe in the future will be able to follow still further. The sensation of starting afresh is, of course, in many ways illusory. If we had a different Europe every six months, this would hardly be compatible with the continuity of dossiers. Nevertheless, it is a mechanism that allows for fresh new approaches and which reminds us of what Europe is based on: a partnership of states, a Europe of nations.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Portuguese Government’s expectations will become a reality, be it in a creative and lasting fusion of the Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne processes, in our relations with Africa, in advancing the modernisation dossiers – the information society and digital television – or in assisting the ultra-peripheral regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that in general we are being more daring as regards economic and social cohesion for the future, as this is a key objective of the Treaties that we are a long way from achieving, and it is also one of the objectives that is most attractive to the enlargement countries. We recommend prudence combined with realism in launching the Intergovernmental Conference. The key question in the debate on Europe today is participation: effective participation by the public, and keeping pace with real public opinion in the Member States. Various references have been made to the low turnout in the European elections. This does not call into question the legitimacy of this Parliament, but it should make us all the more humble when it comes to democracy, and curb our urges to transform the nature of the EU or the structure of the Treaties and their checks and balances. Rather than changing everything, we should be trying to improve what we have, starting here in this House, with the way we debate, vote, convey our opinions, communicate and conduct our relations with our colleagues in the national parliaments. I think a certain amount of modesty is required. For that reason, I do not go along with the suggestions that Parliament’s opinion could be delayed as a reaction against alleged shortcomings in the statute. That would be deeply irresponsible, as that is not what is at stake. The real issue, given that we are dealing with treaty amendments, is the lack of advance participation by national parliaments, an area in which we will be following the progress of the presidency programme with interest. The problem here is that there are only two observers, from the major political groups, instead of one from every group. The problem of participation should be solved by widening participation, not by insisting on more of the same old faces.</p>
<p class="contents">I must not finish without making two crucial observations about recent events. Today, speaking as one Portuguese to another, I am not speaking in a spirit of criticism, but rather one of unavoidable disagreement. Firstly, disagreement with the decision taken not to extend the embargo on arms to Indonesia. This is a deplorable and deeply inappropriate decision. It seems that we are already forgetting about the bodies that are still being dug up in East Timor, about the remaining sources of uncertainty, and about the cynical duplicity of the Indonesian military authorities. What has happened is something we have always criticised: the utter weakness of a decision taken in haste instead of under clear conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we also disagree with the recent statement on Angola. This is another deplorable act. It is biased, unbalanced, and will not help to resolve a tragic and protracted conflict. Although we do not think that UNITA has done much to earn our respect in recent years, this does not mean that we support war, and that we are unaware of the very serious accusations about a murky war economy which is damaging for Angola itself. It does not mean that we prefer a party which is aiding or even collaborating in the pillaging of resources and prevailing over the misfortune of a people who have suffered decades of war, nor does it mean that we accept the criticisms coming from outside the country, which are unacceptably biased.</p>
<p class="contents">There can only be one objective for Angola, and that is peace; there is only one way to achieve it, and that is a peaceful one; and there is only one subject of debate, which is humanitarian radicalism. None of the sides involved in the war in Angola can justify the suffering to which its people have been subjected. Absolutely not! However, since I have now commented on this important aspect, I would like to wish the Portuguese Presidency every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is because in Brussels, in light of the events in Timor and Macao, you informed Europe that its fate could be as an organisation of the past without any future.</p>
<p class="contents">The opportunity afforded by the timetable gives you a role you are familiar with, as your namesake, Vasco de Gama, was also an explorer. You are to start preparations for the IGC, but first you must deal with some other outstanding issues. For example, there is the cooperation agreement with South Africa and the special agreement on wine. Port, ouzo, grappa and sherry are being pirated by South Africa which refuses to respect its undertaking. What are you going to do? Another issue to be dealt with is the euro which is working as a common currency. So why change something which works? With VAT, the transitional period has been extended. Why not do the same for the euro?</p>
<p class="contents">Among the new issues is the employment summit in March. If we do not fight against excessive globalisation, immigration and taxation, these problems will not be solved, unless we wait for a miracle of Fatima. What are you going to do in this respect? Then there is the Intergovernmental Conference. We anxiously await its results, particularly as some want to move towards establishing a European Public Prosecutor’s Office. You are going to make justice a priority, yet you have in your country the murderer, Sid Ahmed Rezala, who France allowed to escape and Spain released. We will closely monitor the decision you take regarding him.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally there is the opening up to the East. In the West, Europe starts with you but how far east will it go? To the border with Iran, to the Caucasus, from Lisbon to Moscow?</p>
<p class="contents">You must ask some solid questions on all these issues, Mr Gama. We will see whether your French socialist comrades who will assume the presidency after you can provide some solid answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 10 February, Portugal will submit a proposal for inclusion in the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference. On 14 February, the Conference begins. On 24 February, the foreign ministers meet, and subsequently they are to meet in this way each month in order, at all events, to discuss five important subjects. </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is the question of majority decision making. In how many of the 65 areas in which we at present require unanimity will there, in future, be majority decision making so that the democracies in our Member States can be voted down by ministers and officials behind closed doors in Brussels? Secondly, there is the composition of the Commission. There will still be a Commissioner for each country, but the small countries will be offered junior portfolios more often than not. Thirdly, there is the question of the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers, the composition of Parliament and the Court of Justice. The five largest countries will perhaps obtain 25% more votes in the Council, even if every country, of course, loses as many with the enlargement of the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there will be reinforced cooperation. Portugal and other federalist countries will press for a majority of the Member States’ being able to develop the partnership, even if some countries should be opposed to it, and this will essentially entail the abolition of the right of veto on important issues. Fifthly, there is a legal department which will deal with everything which the Member States submit and, at the Porto Summit in June, it will be possible to widen the agenda to include what was decided at the Helsinki Summit. </p>
<p class="contents">All this will lead to a new Treaty on European Union, replacing the Treaty of Amsterdam by the year 2003. It will be adopted in Nice on 8 December this year, but it will hardly be <span class="italic">nice</span> unless the voters reshuffle the cards. That is what we in my Group here in Parliament, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, are urging should happen, as is our common intergroup of like-minded people which is called SOS Democracy, for it is SOS Democracy that is needed and not more bureaucratic power in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without doubt, a difficult task stands ahead of him and he will not even be able to reap the fruits of some of his work, such is the nature of the presidency.

Under the rotating presidency system, Portugal holds the presidency for the current six months. This system ensures that each Member State makes a fair contribution to the building of Europe, as long as the presidency is exercised in an effective manner whilst seeking a prudent balance between national positions and the interests of Europe as a whole. Rotation evidently means that the majority of objectives to be achieved are the subject of consensus between the Member States and the public in each of those states. Otherwise we would have a succession of diverging presidencies either lacking in strong ideas or subject to hidden agendas, which would be unacceptable. I have great hopes for the Portuguese Presidency. I hope that it will help to answer the key political question: where is the European Union going and how is it to get there? Only then can we move on to institutional reform, which is a condition or a consequence of enlargement, and which has to be achieved while respecting the balance between the nations, powers and policies of the European Union, which have been so painstakingly pursued for decades.</p>
<p class="contents">Construction is a slow and difficult process, whilst destruction is a quick one, so this question must be approached with great caution. It could trigger off the disintegration of the European Union. Some may ask why Portugal should tackle something so complex and ambitious. My response is this: if someone needs to do this, why not Portugal? </p>
<p class="contents">Once the key issues have been decided, we can move on to other dossiers. Our view of the European Union is incompatible with some solutions. I cannot accept talk of enlargement at any price, which some people – who are perhaps exaggerating – advocate. I cannot accept that when it comes to redistributing power, and power is what this is really all about, we should think of handing it over to an inner cabinet made up of the strongest states, or that only they should have places on and power in the European Commission. I do not accept the idea of my language not being an official language. I do not accept the idea of dismantling the common agricultural policy or that this policy should continue to benefit some and ignore others, just as I reject the loss of solidarity and the failure to seek genuine convergence in levels of development. Economic and social cohesion, which is a treaty principle, must be reinstated at the forefront of the Union’s concerns and should inform all its policies. I do not accept the continuation of the present financing system any more than I accept the lack of a common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot of talk about the citizens’ Europe. If we want to gain their commitment, we need to inform them, sign them up to powerful ideas and meet their expectations. The inferior role which the European Council conferred on the European Parliament at the Intergovernmental Conference is no way to recognise its representative function. Nor is deciding one month the opposite of what the European Parliament judged fit the previous month, as happened in the case of the embargo on sales of arms to Indonesia. How can we rouse the public’s interest when they so often seem to be alienated? Let us try to respond to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside my fellow citizens, my view of the European Union is from its western border in the Azores, one of the regions designated as “ultra-peripheral” in the Treaty on European Union. What I would like to see from that standpoint, whilst continuing to live there, is equality of opportunities and approximation of living conditions. I do not see enlargement simply as the sum of the various countries’ ability to meet foreign policy challenges: I want to see sharing and solidarity, and the same scope for personal fulfilment where I live as in the north, the east, the south and the centre. I am not only interested in the major dossiers: I believe that the treaties create a framework in which people matter, and I therefore closely follow the impact of lesser European Union decisions on my region, which are still major decisions for my fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now we would like to know what measures are to be taken for the ultra-peripheral regions. What is the future of milk production, on which our economy depends? We have unrivalled conditions for producing milk and know how to do this in an almost perfect symbiosis with nature.</p>
<p class="contents">You will have realised that I have great hopes of the Portuguese Presidency. I hope that it will help to follow a path which involves maintaining delicate balances, and that it will advance the most important dossiers while putting its own stamp on them. I hope it will involve the public, and heed their legitimate aspirations. And I hope that by serving Portugal it will serve the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is true. But these three subjects are very well known to our Member States. They studied them in depth during the Amsterdam negotiations. They know exactly what the issues are. They do not need a whole year's study. They need a deal. They need a night, a week maybe, of negotiations and a package to be agreed. That leaves the rest of the year – almost a whole year. That is twice as long as the IGC that negotiated the Single European Act in 1985. It is as long as the IGC that negotiated the huge Maastricht Treaty. That IGC lasted a year. It is therefore perfectly possible to address other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody is actually asking for an all-embracing IGC with a hundred issues or more; with a Christmas tree where everyone puts on their favourite decorations. We are simply asking for a limited number of essential subjects to be added to the agenda; subjects which really ought to be addressed in what is the last IGC before enlargement, the last time we will have these negotiations without having nearly 30 Member States around the table making any agreement even more difficult than it is at present. That chance must be seized. It would be the height of irresponsibility not to seize this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Helsinki gave you, the Portuguese Presidency, a mandate to propose to add items to the agenda. That means, in the words of Mr Cox, – the Liberals always steal the best lines from other people's speeches – that the door is ajar. We firmly intend to put our foot in that door to make it stay ajar and open further.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank goodness the door is ajar, because otherwise this Parliament would almost certainly have been tempted to give a negative opinion on the convening of the IGC or even to delay giving our opinion and thereby delay the start of the IGC, maybe even to withdraw our representatives from the IGC. But the fact that the door is ajar means we still have a possible way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">What makes the difference for my Group is the attitude that has been shown by the Portuguese Presidency. You clearly share our concerns about the narrowness of the agenda. You clearly also would prefer the agenda to be widened and you have given us an undertaking to do your best in that respect, just as you have given a commitment to us just now to ensure the widest possible interpretation of the Helsinki provisions concerning Parliament's participation in the IGC. That makes a big difference as far as my Group is concerned. We welcome that. But like my colleague, Mr Seguro, I would ask you to specify clearly that you intend to make proposals to widen the agenda already to the first meeting of the European Council in Lisbon in March, and not wait until June. That would be very important in helping to convince this Parliament to give its opinion in time for you to be able to launch the IGC on Saint Valentine's Day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It cannot have escaped you that this Parliament wants to see an extended agenda with appreciable institutional reforms in the interests of a more efficient and democratic EU. We can talk a great deal and at length about this. </p>
<p class="contents">I want, however, to take up another question which, for some unfathomable reason, ended up at this point on the agenda. I know that it is an urgent matter for Portugal, and it is a source of considerable disquiet for my Group, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. We look with dismay at the deterioration of the situation in Angola. With growing concern, we have seen how the UNITA guerrillas are stepping up their military activities and indiscriminately attacking civilians, most recently through the massacre of over a hundred civilians in Bié province. </p>
<p class="contents">We also look with great alarm at the way in which freedom of expression in the country is being restricted. At least twenty journalists were arrested last year, in spite of the fact that the regime in Angola had given an assurance that it respected the freedom of the press. There are a number of individual journalists who, on what are dubious grounds to say the least, are waiting to be tried, accused of slander by the president. We hope that they are able to obtain open, fair and prompt trials. </p>
<p class="contents">The people of Angola have suffered for far too long from this hopeless civil war which has led to thousands of people being killed and maimed and becoming undernourished and to more than two million people being made homeless. For the civilian population, the situation has become an emergency. </p>
<p class="contents">The EU has an historic commitment to Angola and is a great provider of aid. It is high time that the EU joined with the UN in increasing pressure upon Savimbi to resume the collapsed peace negotiations, and also in more firmly impressing upon the regime that they must stop behaving like vandals and respect freedom of expression and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We Liberals assume that these issues will be given high priority in connection with Portugal’s work on the new partnership between the EU and Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The way in which your people, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, empathised with East Timor gives us hope that you will help lay a foundation for renewed peace and cooperation with Africa. </p>
<p class="contents">We were really disappointed with Helsinki and the narrow IGC agenda and we hope that you will widen it as much as possible and use it to benefit reinforced cooperation. Today and in future, Europe must be able to function as a democracy. This is impossible without reform. Enlargement would then equate with a watering down of the Union. On behalf of our Group and, more specifically, on behalf of the European Free Alliance, I would ask your presidency’s attention for the regions and cultural communities which, strictly speaking, are not Member States but which are constitutionally authorised to carry out a number of activities in respect of which they should be able to cooperate with Europe. Mr Gama, we urge that this is done directly. To our disenchantment, Helsinki, in a country which is still known for its pleas for transparency, took a step in the opposite direction in the much vaunted annex 3.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to note that, this week in Parliament, we spoke with great concern about the disparities in welfare between the regions in Europe. Unemployment in our poor regions is hardly dropping. How will we realise the huge ambitions of enlargement if we cannot even summon up respect for cultures and for languages in Europe itself, and if we are not even able to bridge the yawning gap in welfare between our own regions? I am aware that you are interested in and understand all this and I wish you every success in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This concerns the first Europe-India summit which, quite significantly, no one has mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a fundamental initiative. My fellow Members, as they did with the Soviet Union, currently favour continuing discussions with China. Yet the majority of Western companies are in the process of withdrawing from this country. We are continuing to give the red carpet treatment to Beijing and yet are blind to the fact that we could achieve, as you wish, a strategic agreement with India.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the IGC, Mr Poettering was obviously in a humorous mood this morning when he said that if the three leftover issues were resolved during the next Council, this would be a success for the European Union. You would really have to be short-sighted not to realise that if we do not tackle this fundamental question of constitutional codecision and that if we do not devise a mechanism which is worthy of parliamentary discussion, then the EU will soon, with 28, 30 or even 32 members, end up totally paralysed.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore invite you, Mr Gama, not to pay too much attention to this long list of points to which several Members want to add and of which you are already aware. You should, if possible, restrict yourself to introducing this one point which can guarantee that the European Union does not become paralysed in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I have something to say to the Members who want a gesture from you on the question of our two representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference. It is time that we realised that we cannot strengthen institutional dialogue through representatives, but that we have a duty to demand that the European Union is based on proper parliamentary mechanisms. There must be a dialogue between Parliament and the Council which is worthy of this name and is not solely composed of small victories in forcing insignificant points, or not such insignificant points, onto the agenda of an Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I am pleased that Portugal welcomes the pending enlargement of the European Union. This also allows scope for widening the agenda of the next IGC. Apart from the three Amsterdam leftovers, urgent, far-reaching reforms are required to be able to embrace the new Member States. In addition, the Presidency gives priority to reinforcing the CFSP. Last week, during the joint meeting of the American Congress and our Parliament, it transpired that there is also concern on the part of the Americans as to who will be footing the bill for the CFSP. Will this be at the expense of the budget which the EU countries are now handing over to NATO? </p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency is proposing an additional summit to deal with employment policy, among other issues. I reiterate our view that it would be far preferable to organise this at local level. As regards economic reforms, I recommend we take Ireland and the Netherlands as our examples. These countries have now put their own house in order and are, as such, worth imitating. </p>
<p class="contents">Quite a few sections in the work schedule deal with food safety. But what exactly does the Presidency want? </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would ask how the Presidency is hoping to achieve agreement on the statute and how it views the independent investigation of experts into the weighting of EP Membership. Will the Presidency defend the outcome of the investigation in the Council? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has said so, and all the political groups in this Parliament have said so. It is insufficient, but the Helsinki conclusions also leave open the possibility of resolving this insufficiency: I believe that this is the task of the Portuguese Presidency at the moment and it is what Parliament is currently asking for. It is not a very ambitious task; it simply requires common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">We need the Intergovernmental Conference to deal with other issues, because we do not want Intergovernmental Conferences to take place every three or four years. We want this Intergovernmental Conference to resolve these issues for some time to come.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, Mr President, there are essentially three issues which should be introduced into the conference agenda. The first refers to the role of Europe in the world. The institutional aspect of the security and defence policy, which has seen great progress in recent times, and which enjoys majority support in terms of European public opinion, should finally come together in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue which we should consider is reinforced cooperation. Enlargement, our objective for the next few years, and the European Union’s historic challenge, will require flexible formulas in terms of implementing our policies. I believe that we all understand the arguments for this. Therefore, in order to facilitate enlargement, that agenda will have to include a discussion of reinforced cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is another issue which seems to me to be important. A few weeks ago we began a novel exercise which, in the eyes of the European citizens, will be of supreme importance: the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Tampere conclusions talk of the possibility of a declaration, or its inclusion in the Treaty. I believe that, in the end, we will have to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty. We will thereby achieve something important: we will link the European Union with the citizens. I will express it in your beautiful language, in the words of a Portuguese poet. We should link human rights with that “<span class="italic">comboio de corda que se chama o coração</span>" [“clockwork train known as the heart”].</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have an important task ahead of you and this Parliament trusts you to carry it out. Mr Seguro has made an appeal and I would also like to hear the Portuguese Presidency’s commitment with regard to the question from the Member from the Socialist Group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We European socialists are confident in the ability of Antonio Guterres’s team to bring the European Union back onto the track of sustainable economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is suffering from several major problems. Firstly, unemployment is still too high. We have a rate of employment which is lower than in the United States of America and Japan. Public and private investment in Europe is inadequate. The requisite budgetary consolidation has forced many Member States to reduce infrastructural investment while the private sector has not always taken up the baton. Venture capital investments in the USA are double what they are in Europe, and the Americans invest three times more than the Europeans in creating new businesses. In the USA, 80% of venture capital goes on new technologies compared with only 27% in Europe. Japan invests 2.9% of its GDP in research and development, the USA 2.8% and Europe only 1.8%.</p>
<p class="contents">Researchers represent only 2.5% of the labour force in our companies compared with 6% in Japan and 6.7% in the USA. We have a lack of brainpower as we have fewer postgraduate students than the USA or Japan. Nearly half of European students working for a doctorate in the USA remain there to work. In the technology sector, there are between 700 000 and 800 000 vacant jobs in Europe without the qualified staff to fill them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Americans have the same problem in this respect. Yet, last year, the US Senate allocated nearly 500 000 four-year immigration visas to highly qualified workers. Europe cannot organise such a brain drain. We must invest more in training, education and innovation. Innovation and knowledge are nowadays the main sources of wealth of countries. The Portuguese Presidency must be congratulated for pressing for a Europe of innovation and knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council has just announced that there will be no Lisbon process, which is commendable. On the other hand, the Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne processes must be combined in a single coordinated action with precise and verifiable objectives. The Dublin growth and stability pact has all the stability and none of the growth. Stability is necessary but it is not an end in itself. By improving world economic prospects, we can expect a Lisbon pact for growth from the Portuguese Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is especially good news after the rather disappointing outcome of the European Summit in Helsinki. My Group is of the opinion that the agenda of this IGC should be extended further so that the European Union is actually able to operate effectively with over 20 Member States in future. This is why we are pleased that the presidency wants to set up five working parties which will look into the major bottlenecks. But, as many have already highlighted, the agenda with just the three leftovers from Amsterdam is far too light-weight. My Group also demands that the European Parliament be a full partner in the negotiation process, as fervently argued by Mrs Fontaine and others in the past. </p>
<p class="contents">In the next couple of weeks, the Presidency will be visiting all the capitals of our EU Member States. We demand that, during its whistle-stop tour, the Portuguese Presidency widens the agenda of the IGC according to the recommendation of the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report. I am of the opinion that the Portuguese Presidency, after this trip, should come and report on the outcome of these discussions during the February part-session in Strasbourg. I would remind the presidency that Article 48 of the EU Treaty stipulates that the IGC cannot start before the European Parliament has issued its opinion. I do not rule out that the European Parliament will not issue this opinion until it has become clear how the European Parliament will be more involved in the negotiations and once the agenda has been widened. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the topic which will be tabled in March is of key importance, but let us not restrict it to the democratisation of the information society. Let us, above all, look at where America performs better than the European Union and, in this sphere, adopt best practices from the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much welcome the document produced by the presidency this week as part of the preparations for the special summit in March. It presents a commendable, coherent approach, an holistic approach which is very welcome, all the more so because it takes into account a number of the important proposals we have made in this House in recent years. These include the need to improve coordination between the employment strategy and the broad economic guidelines. I look forward to the implementation of the proposals you will agree in March and hope you get the support you need.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one thing prevented my joy from being complete and that was in relation to the convergence of social protection. Many of us in this House hoped to see a Luxembourg-type procedure on convergence in social protection but I am afraid the language of the document falls far short of that, talking instead about joint analysis, cooperation and the exchange of best practice. That is not enough to bring about the modernisation in social protection systems that we need within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to specific social dossiers, there are two I would like to look at very briefly. One very important one for us is the general framework on information and consultation. I hope progress will be made on that dossier during the Portuguese Presidency. But there is also the modernisation of the works council directive, its review and amendment. In recent months I have been visited by workers from Michelin in France, Ford in Portugal and yesterday by ABB-Alsthom workers affected by that merger, workers who have been denied their rights under the works council directive. It needs to be updated and it needs to be implemented by the Commission. The Commission is failing in its duty. If we are serious about partnership at work and the improvements that can bring; if we are serious about innovation and productivity, we need to review the legislation in this area and make sure both sides of industry show proper respect for each other in that process of partnership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My Group hopes that you will, in fact, be able to complete most of it, especially in the area of internal security. I should like to raise two points which I consider are particularly important. First: optimisation of the Schengen system of security at external borders. Secondly: improving asylum policy and combating illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to start by referring to an actual situation in Belgium at its external borders. We all know what has happened. Surprisingly, internal border controls have been introduced in Belgium, almost overnight, causing hour-long jams and problems with both passenger and freight cross-border traffic, angering citizens and damaging the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason was the imminent legalisation of some 75 000 illegal immigrants who have been waiting for a decision on their asylum applications in Belgium for three or four years or who have already been illegal residents in Belgium for five or six years. I should like to point out that the measures taken by Belgium comply with the law and the Treaty. But they also show that this is not the answer to the problems which have arisen and that we must find new approaches and that, in the final analysis, the answer lies in a community arrangement. For the rest, Belgium took a similar decision here as France, Italy and Luxembourg have done in the past. The Council is responsible here, hence our requests.</p>
<p class="contents">What I should like to see, what we should all like to see is for you to optimise Schengen as a security instrument, for you to re-regulate the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls, for you to give Member States preliminary information, together with information on how long such controls will last, and for you to implement all this only in absolutely exceptional situations and for you to implement fast and complete communitisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, fast, uniform asylum procedures do, of course, need to be introduced and EURODAC needs to be introduced immediately as a matter of urgency, so that the jurisdiction of the states can be laid down and so that we have efficient instruments against illegal immigrants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be amusing but, unfortunately, our time for such statements is limited and I must postpone that until this afternoon. What we are discussing here is the annual report on the area of freedom, security and justice. I therefore have the following request to make of the Portuguese Council Presidency. The Council, not the Council Presidency, denied Parliament a written report on the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. An oral motion was tabled, but we have no written reply from the Council, on the grounds that it will suffice if the Council makes an oral statement here today. This behaviour is typical, not of the Council Presidency, but of the Council officials who behave like an authoritarian state towards this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Authoritarian states tend to say: we the authoritarian representatives shall decide what is and what is not good for the purposes of representing the people. That is precisely what we in this Parliament frequently experience in connection with the area of freedom, security and justice. We have heard this morning from the Portuguese Presidency that it is prepared to work together with the European Parliament in a highly constructive manner in this area and we emphatically welcome this. In my view, everything that the Portuguese Presidency has submitted shows tremendous openness towards the parliamentary institution of the European Union. And that is how it should be; we must be clear, especially in the area of intergovernmental action, which is, of course, still in the Treaty, that, as we extend the area of freedom, security and justice, the European Parliament takes on a central role wherever action is taken which, although intergovernmental, has a direct effect on individual citizens and where national parliaments are less involved than previously.</p>
<p class="contents">So when a Council Presidency says, as the Portuguese Presidency has done: yes, we acknowledge that, then I think that Parliament cannot but emphatically support that and say, if only all Council Presidencies behaved thus, then relations between Parliament and the Council would improve at this level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My first question concerns the decision-making process for the common agricultural policy, which casts the European Parliament in a marginal and purely consultative role. Now, at a time when the CAP is increasingly being seen as a rural policy, as the main pillar of land-use planning, and as a means of protecting the environment, our heritage and jobs, it is unthinkable that Parliament should have a purely consultative role, which, apart from anything else, means that it is excluded from decision making on 40% of the EU budget.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is about the need to speed up the establishment of the recently announced European food safety agency. It is important to be clear about whether we are solely concerned with the European risk assessment and risk management body or whether we are trying to substantially strengthen the common food quality and safety policy, including veterinary actions. If that is the case, there will have to be a considerable increase in resources, either at European Union or Member State level. And if the latter is the real option, which I judge to be the case, then I have to say that I am not happy about the European Commission’s announcement last week, in which the main approach seemed to be to create “another” scientific body, without any powers, and isolated from any joint campaign on all fronts and in all parts of the agriculture and food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">The third question which I would like to raise concerns the fisheries agreement between the European Union and Morocco. I really am concerned that the Commission is getting the negotiations off to such a slow start, and I am equally worried about the Council’s slowness in conducting this process. And I have to say that I am also worried that I cannot find any reference to speeding up negotiations on this agreement anywhere in the Portuguese Presidency’s programme. I have, on the other hand, seen a reference in the programme to examining the cost-benefit analyses for fisheries agreements with third countries, which is usually the argument used in the European Union by people opposing the fisheries agreements between the EU and third countries. I would welcome a reply from the presidency on the questions that I have just asked. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It set standards, and I and all of us here, Mr President, hope that your presidency will be equally successful. You have presented a large, ambitious programme. I should like to refer to a foreign and security policy aspect. I have some questions to ask and I would be grateful if you could give me a detailed position on these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">First, Turkey. I supported candidate status for Turkey from the beginning and I welcome the result from Helsinki. Will the presidency now support this candidate by drawing up a list of measures and a timetable and allowing it to be included in negotiations on the same footing as the other twelve candidates? Is the presidency prepared to take an initiative to solve the Kurdish question – I am following on here from Mr Poettering, who referred earlier to the Kurdish question – for example, by supporting a conference such as the Madrid conference for the Near East?</p>
<p class="contents">On the common security policy: Cologne and Helsinki raised our hopes in this regard. Now specific action needs to be taken. It must be action which can be accepted by all EU Member States, including those which do not belong to NATO. I have the feeling, Mr Gama, that you are orientated towards NATO and are wondering how we can create a structure which fits in with NATO. But that is not the issue. First we need a European structure; then we can ensure that it is compatible with NATO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The last two presidencies formulated objectives and arranged mandates which were perhaps not terribly extensive. You have the task of implementation. That may give you satisfaction in the end but it is a hard task which you have been set, especially the last point which Mr Sakellariou referred to, i.e. the question of implementing a European foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament will support you fully in this. Of course, we are keen for it to complement NATO but we are also keen for Europeans to develop their own capacities in this area so that we can meet the challenges. You also have the task of restarting the Barcelona process, while developments in negotiations in the Near East afford totally new opportunities. I have the impression that the parties involved are now much more amenable to a European role in this area than was previously the case. I wish you and Mr Patten every success in dealing with this task.</p>
<p class="contents">Other points, of course, are the Intergovernmental Conference and the ratio between enlargement and the European Union’s ability to act, problems relating to the risk of overstretching and the decisions which we need to take at the Intergovernmental Conference. You are bound by a mandate. On the other hand, experience has proven that when one of the parties involved tables a proposal during negotiations, it is very difficult to prevent that proposal from being discussed. In other words, practice and the possibilities granted give you the opportunity to interpret that mandate in a wide sense. I think that it would be most helpful as regards the decisions which we in the European Parliament have to take in our position, if you, for your part, undertook to interpret your mandate in the wider sense. Then we would have a better opportunity for setting out our ideas of democracy and the European Union’s ability to act on the negotiating table. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I must do so nonetheless. I have read your programme of work and I have listened to you very carefully. I can only wish that there were as much ambition in the areas on which I work here in the European Parliament, in the areas of environmental policy, consumer protection and health policy, as there is in the others. I understand that a presidency cannot work everywhere and be ambitious everywhere at once, and I respect the fact that you have placed the focus elsewhere. Nonetheless, I cannot let you get away with it so easily, as I am sure you will understand, and I should like to make a few comments on this.</p>
<p class="contents">You have set great store in your written programme and in what you have said today on food safety. I think that is important. Parliament will be dealing with the White Paper on food safety. The Minister pointed out that the summit in June will address this White Paper. I hope that you have sufficient respect for the European Parliament to wait for Parliament to debate the issue and adopt its resolutions and I doubt that this will be the case by June. We shall, of course, gladly try to do so in order to accommodate the Portuguese Council Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">You also set great store by the water framework directive. Here too I ask you: if you would only accept the proposed amendments which Parliament will be adopting at the beginning of February, then we will be well on the way to agreement. Allow me to say something else. You mentioned that you want to link environmental policy with regional planning. I support you in that with all my heart. You have the opportunity to ensure at the Intergovernmental Conference that the new Treaty gives Europe powers in regional planning. Then you will have us on your side straight away. But will you implement it? I doubt it. However, I shall support you nevertheless.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say this to you. Please take care to ensure in the areas of environmental policy and integration in other policy areas that an undertaking to do this is given and proven. Please pass this on to your colleagues in the Member States and please ensure that the legislation is transposed. That is not always the case with environmental legislation. And if you do that, then, although you have perhaps not announced as much as others, you will have done your job properly and I wish you the best of luck with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For me, the digital revolution is, amongst many other things, above all, a revolution in the system and culture of distributing goods and services. This means that we need to establish positions on certain specific issues which are contained in your programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we need to reflect anew on the balance between public and private regulations, on the balance between the law and what is normally called ‘soft law’. The reason is that in digital time – as someone said the other day at the Madrid Conference – one year is equivalent to two months, and four years, which is a reasonable time for the handling of a normal directive, is equivalent to 24 years. That is excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to give consumers and small and medium-sized businesses confidence, and create a climate and culture of taking controlled risks, although this may seem contradictory. For consumers, we have to implement excellent Commission initiatives, based on Tampere, in the field of the extrajudicial settling of disputes, but we also have to treat consumers as adults. For small and medium-sized businesses, we have to reinforce the dialogue which you are proposing, with companies and citizens, within the framework of the internal market. But there are also very specific things, such as taking a clear stance, in accordance with business culture, on Article 15 of the new Brussels and Lugano legislation, without which we could spoil this great project of an ‘E-Europe’.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly – and here I agree with what Mr Cox said – we have the challenge of transatlantic dialogue. We will not achieve anything if we do not lessen the distance which separates us from the United States, in coordination with them. Therefore, on this issue, I believe we need tremendous coordination, tremendous cooperation and, of course, tremendous drive.</p>

<p class="contents">In November, this Parliament adopted a resolution which defended ever closer cooperative relationships between Morocco and the European Union, within the framework of the Association Agreement. There could be no justification for a reduction in cooperation, in terms of fishing. The fishing sector is a very sensitive sector. The <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster has just demonstrated this. Portugal’s maritime tradition and her excellent relations with Morocco should be used during this six-month period to promote the negotiations on the new fisheries agreement, which are currently at a standstill. The fishing industry is concentrated in the most under-privileged regions of Europe and it needs this agreement urgently. We need a progressive economic, social and territorial policy so that the benefits derived from the current economic boom are not directed to the most buoyant industrial sectors.</p>

The first is a link between transport policy and the Intergovernmental Conference. Several Members have already said that we do not want an Intergovernmental Conference which just deals with the leftovers from Amsterdam; what we want to a limited, not an exaggerated, degree, is a comprehensive discussion about the new powers needed to ensure that this European Community remains operational. And that is where you as the Portuguese Presidency can do something quite decisive for European transport policy, security and the environment in Europe. You can implement what Parliament decided in November, namely that the introduction of uniform European air traffic safety regulations is a fundamental task which must be taken care of at European Union level, by putting it on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to centralise everything. Operational authority should remain with the Member States or private organisations, but the regulatory function must be taken care of uniformly at European level. The present fragmentation in air traffic is resulting in delays, late flights, danger to passengers and endless and unnecessary environmental pollution. If you want proof of European added value, then look no further than uniform, European air traffic safety regulations. We may have an internal market on the ground, yet there is fragmentation in the skies. It does not work. As the European Parliament, we shall stand firm and I hope that you will support this, Mr Gama.</p>
<p class="contents">You can also do something for the environment, the economy and transport by quickly formulating a common position on the railways package. The Finnish Presidency managed to overcome the French government’s resistance to the opening up of rail traffic in December, but now I have a feeling that they are again playing for time. As the Portuguese Presidency, you have a huge opportunity here if you formulate this common position quickly. We are waiting for it. We want to shift freight from the roads to the railways. Please help us to do so! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know who is behind the fact that it was not possible to implement the Lusaka Agreement. It is UNITA, in the first place. The world has also, therefore, introduced sanctions against UNITA. There is also the risk of this conflict spilling over into the region generally, due to the fact that government troops have gone into neighbouring states and that UNITA has joined forces with armed groups in other countries. </p>
<p class="contents">As I say, at a humanitarian level, this is the world’s largest humanitarian disaster, with two million internal refugees and dreadful suffering on both sides. We therefore want Portugal, and especially its government with its democratic, anticolonial tradition, to also state before Parliament what measures it intends to take in order to contribute to a solution.

<p class="contents">For Europe – which we want to help to build and strengthen, thus creating a Union in which everyone feels represented and with which they can identify, a Europe which is not just for the few or in which the big fish suffocate the small ones. If we are to achieve such a Europe, at a time when we are considering treaty amendments, we must once again make sure that the fact the presidency is held by a small country does not mean that it will be any worse or less efficient than when the presidency is held by the larger countries. </p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the Portuguese Presidency will be good for the citizens of Europe who want Europe to address their problems and not just their bank accounts or consumer goods, and who want Europe to focus on safety, on fighting drugs, on combating crime, on controlling illegal immigration and on adopting measures to establish the area of freedom, security and justice. I am certain that you will agree with me, Mr Gama, when I express my confidence in the great competence and high calibre of the Portuguese Commissioner, António Vitorino, and I hope that the Council will be able to make concrete progress in the areas entrusted to it as measured against the scoreboard agreed in Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that it will be good for the Portuguese who will remember the excellent job Portugal did when it held the Council Presidency for the first time, exactly eight years ago, and who hope that the Socialist government can live up to this record of prestige and efficiency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You accept the voice of European citizens as a part of the European decision-making process, which is something we appreciate. We hope, and take into account the fact, that this positive attitude will be maintained throughout the six-month period. </p>
<p class="contents">In the legal sphere, measures need to be taken by Europe. You emphasise the question of victims of crime. This is a question which symbolises the citizens’ legal situation from a great many perspectives. It is a question of no longer discriminating against those citizens who make use of their freedom of movement. I have fought for a long time specifically to strengthen the protection afforded to victims of crime. If states are not prepared to defend individuals and to mitigate the consequences of violence, then we shall never be able to create the type of security about which everyone is talking in such splendid terms. </p>
<p class="contents">Without individual citizens’ rights, established by treaty, and adequate resources for the police and judicial system, we shall not obtain that freedom and security which Europe’s citizens expect. You can urge on the process by openly making use of the results table and showing that we need to see progress. Time limits for the measures could increase the pace of progress. </p>
<p class="contents">You must set necessary priorities in your ambitious programme. In this context, I would emphasise victims of crime, organised crime and the use of a scoreboard. I hope that you wish to confirm that it is these questions and the question of citizens’ rights which are at the very top of your list of priorities. At the same time, I want to wish you luck and every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, Europe carries considerable historical responsibility in this respect and it would be really irresponsible to leave the black continent in the care of the Americans. I hope that the Euro-African Summit will take place and that the Union will, at last, manage to adopt a common position regarding the conflict in Central Africa. It is only logical that Portugal’s attention should be mainly focused on Angola. </p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to make some comments concerning the statement on the Angola war, in which the rebel movement UNITA is held to be the main culprit. It is indeed correct that Savimbi wrecked the first peace agreement when he lost the elections in 1992. It is also correct that UNITA has used the period of demilitarisation to re-arm itself and is responsible for gross human rights violations in the current war. We need to continue to come down hard on this. </p>
<p class="contents">But this does not put Angola’s leaders in the clear. After all, it was the government that, in late 1998, declared all-out war on the rebels and did not spare the citizens in this war either. It is also a fact that the government also re-armed itself on a massive scale during this period of peace. Human rights organisations such as <span class="italic">Human Rights Watch</span> and <span class="italic">Global Witness</span> have accused the government of large-scale corruption, the use of billions of oil dollars for military deals, involving – would you believe it – Portugal among others, and of repressing the opposition and the press. </p>
<p class="contents">Africa's second largest oil-producing country has one of the world’s worst socio-economic indicators with undernourished children and cholera epidemics reaching the very heart of the capital. Europe must continue to demand a dialogue without starting to think along military lines. Portugal could play a key role in this, not by taking a unilateral stance but by reminding both parties of their responsibilities. In this way, a ray of light can finally reach the dark Angolan tunnel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We witnessed this during the Finnish Presidency and I am sure that Portugal will also succeed in this work.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the greatest challenge Finland left Portugal is finalising the tax package relating to the code of practice on tax. When Portugal first informed the Member States of the priorities for its presidency, after the Helsinki Summit towards the end of last year, I was quite disappointed with the way the tax package was spoken about, as if the effort to reach a compromise had already been abandoned. Last week in Parliament, the new chairman of Ecofin, Pina Moura, was showing a considerably tougher attitude and he restored my faith in the fact that, as with the previous country to hold the presidency, Finland, Portugal too considers it important to harmonise taxation in the Member States as set out in the tax package. It was also gratifying to hear that, in the future too, the tax package would be discussed as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a hopeless case. In a resolution adopted at the Helsinki Summit, the Member States achieved consensus with regard to the principle that all the citizens of the Union should pay an appropriate rate of tax on the income from all their savings. This tax can actually be put into effect in many ways. It is also therefore essential to call attention to the various obligations to divulge information, thus ensuring fair and comprehensive taxation. I hope that the Council will appoint a high level working group on tax as soon as possible, as was referred to in Helsinki, and will continue from the point reached at Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the tax package, pressure is growing for the creation of a harmonised energy tax system that has a neutral impact on the overall tax burden. For my own part, I warmly support this aim, as long as the reforms are undertaken without jeopardising European industrial competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The third challenge with regard to taxation is connected with VAT. Our target is to switch to a definitive VAT system as soon as possible. I hope that this will also be kept in mind during the Portuguese term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in the PPE have great hopes for the planned summit on employment. What the Christian Democrat Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr Juncker called for in the run-up to the employment summit in 1997 also applies to the planned special summit in Lisbon. It must not be a literature summit, whereby Juncker was referring to the endless non-binding declarations made by numerous summits. On the contrary, the heads of government achieved a quite specific result under the Luxembourg process, i.e. coordination between employment policy guidelines and national action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">However, really important successes have failed to materialise since 1997. Above all, there are shortcomings in the practical implementation of the guidelines. The 1999 joint employment report cites a lack of activity by Member States in reforming the tax and social benefit systems and in participation in lifelong learning, together with shortcomings in promoting social partnership to modernise the way in which work is organised. Employment policy has been extremely important to Parliament for many years. Unfortunately, again in 1999, the Council and the heads of government adopted hardly any of our proposals, for example on the so-called European employment package from Cologne or on the Guidelines 2000. I would ask the Portuguese Presidency, as it has announced in its discussion paper: please do better, please take greater account of our positions.</p>
<p class="contents">New economic impetus, competition and flexibility need to be brought into line with vital demands for social security. The success principle behind the social market economy is the model of the future for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Enlarging eastwards is important. We want to construct a political Europe, but we need to take a careful look at the large Mediterranean basin itself – and Portugal, like Italy, is a Mediterranean country – in order to create a major Mediterranean policy as well and balance the expansion to the east with expansion to the south. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European Council is concerned, we should briefly consider three issues in greater depth. You mentioned employment, and this is of the utmost importance for us. It is top of the list of urgent issues. We can fight it by assisting small and medium-sized businesses, boosting tourism with the help of the development policy and sharply reducing the tax burden. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, justice – as you stressed – matters a great deal to us. The policy on European justice is of major importance. There are slow trials, unfair trials – and Italy, unfortunately, holds the worst record for these – and in many European countries there is even politicised justice, with some magistrates using their power, not for the purposes of justice, but for political ends, often to attack the opposition and minorities. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by focusing on a third point, following on from employment and justice: the drugs crisis. This is an important social question of particular concern to us because it involves millions of young people. The fight against drugs must be one of the issues that the Portuguese Presidency, the European Commission and Parliament are committed to. We must combat the established drugs, but we must also and above all combat the new drugs, without giving in to the temptation to liberalise drugs and without giving in to the temptation to legalise and authorise the therapeutic use of substances, such as heroin, which Parliament has already rejected. Millions of young people pay great attention to what we are doing: they follow what goes on in Europe carefully, and expect Europe to give them an answer on this major issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first concerns south-eastern Europe and the Mediterranean area. Everyone knows that the region is in turmoil and it would be remiss on our part to believe that these problems can be overcome during the six-monthly term of office of the Portuguese Presidency. All the same, I call upon the presidency and the Commission to do their utmost to enable the European Reconstruction Agency for the Balkan region, located in Thessaloniki, to fulfil its task in the best possible way. I not only hope that Turkey will awaken to the fact that candidate country status presupposes conformance to Community ways, but also that the presidency and the Commission will remind Turkey of these obligations. </p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns the Intergovernmental Conference. Incorporating the Charter of Human Rights into the text of the revised Treaty is the right course of action as this is of major interest to the citizens of Europe. The agenda should also be widened and there should be a legal basis for common defence and foreign policy. In particular, I would like to remind you of something which Parliament supported in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report, i.e. that there should be new chapters for important and particularly high-profile issues such as tourism and culture. </p>
<p class="contents">And finally, speaking in my capacity as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I believe your programme, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is heading in the right direction. Nevertheless, we had hoped for a more ambitious programme from you. In particular, I would like to stress that for us it is essential that, during the Portuguese Presidency, the issue concerning a package of measures for liberalising railways is settled once and for all and that a solution is found to the problem of deficiencies in the air traffic system. In other words, we should move on from the current intergovernmental system of Eurocontrol to a single governmental system, initiated by the Commission, so as to put an end to the ever increasing strife suffered by passengers flying within Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Foreign Minister Gama’s opening sentence in his address to us this morning touched on the importance of public opinion and on reassuring the people of Europe. I have just one question which the President-in-Office could perhaps touch on in his reply. Would he give a reassurance that his concern about public opinion includes public opinion in the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe. He may not feel that this is the appropriate time to give details of what initiatives he has in mind to ensure that not only is the momentum of negotiations maintained, but support in the applicant countries is also guaranteed.

We need to reconcile the Union’s enlargement with the institutional reforms that will guarantee Europe’s political role, as requested by Parliament at the IGC. </p>
<p class="contents">Europe has the single market and the single currency at its disposal. Nevertheless, it is right to address unemployment more vigorously and again put forward the objective of harmonising tax and social policies, which are fundamental elements of social cohesion. We must strengthen competitiveness in an increasingly globalised economy that must rise to the growing challenge of the IT revolution. We need new strategies for research, innovation and training. The document adopted by the Commission yesterday has opened a crucial debate on these matters. </p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement of the Union, which is mainly towards the east, is a real prospect for every European country. Nevertheless, I agree with the Portuguese Presidency that this political priority must not diminish our interest in the Mediterranean, since peace and development there will have a direct influence on Europe’s future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During this presidency, we will be working a great deal with the European Parliament, and also with the Commission, with the High Representative, Javier Solana, and also with the Western European Union, of which we also hold the presidency at present. We hope that this cooperation will be fruitful in all areas. We will be taking away with us from here a conviction that the Portuguese Presidency’s basic framework has the support of a general consensus in the European Parliament, and this is important, in that it will encourage us to work in a more coherent way.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to employment and innovation, this House is clearly extremely interested in the Special European Council in Lisbon. It is interested in – and committed to – the idea of making Europe an area of social cohesion and, at the same time, the most dynamic economic area in the world, in the century that has just dawned. This will enable Europe to cope with globalisation and to democratise information technology, by creating a knowledge economy free of the rules and stigma that govern a purely production-based economy. This also applies to enlargement, which is a historical milestone marking the end of the cold war and the building of a reunited Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Turkey, we will be rigorously examining this dossier in order to simultaneously carry out screening of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, apply the Copenhagen criteria and achieve the strategic objective of giving Turkey a fixed course for approximation as compared with Europe. I know that there are some doubts in the European Parliament about this, but I would also like to allay your fears by assuring you that any other policy would be even worse for Europe: it would be very negative and would have serious consequences for what we want to achieve as a Union, both internally and internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Intergovernmental Conference, I believe that it has been possible to achieve mutual trust between the presidency and Parliament in terms of involving Parliament in a more substantial and real way, with more continuity in the negotiating process. And we are open to this idea. In the letter that I sent to the President of the European Parliament at the start of the Portuguese Presidency, I was at pains to make it clear that we are willing, as a presidency, to take part in meetings of your Committee on Constitutional Affairs, or even in the plenary, if this House would, at some point, like an in-depth debate on the topics to be dealt with at the Intergovernmental Conference. This would comply with the separation of powers and the respective responsibilities of each institution whilst, I believe, stimulating the debate in Europe on institutional reform. We do not have any reservations at all about this kind of approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do we have a closed mind about the Helsinki agenda. The very terms in which it was formulated make it possible to include certain new items. I discussed these items myself with colleagues during my tour of European capitals. The State Secretary for European Affairs will also be doing this now. I wrote to my European colleagues, the Foreign Ministers, at the beginning of January to ask them what items their respective governments saw as potential candidates for adding to the agenda of leftovers. The aim of this was to give us a clear picture of this issue at an early stage, in our presidency role and for the Intergovernmental Conference, a picture that we can also share with the European Parliament. I also wrote to my colleagues in the applicant countries, both those in the first wave and the second wave of enlargement, who we would like to see united with us one day, asking them too for their views on the Intergovernmental Conference, because the worst thing that could happen to European enlargement would be for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to perceive it as a kind of preventative measure against new members. This would lead to an atmosphere of great distrust. The measures that the conference will have to adopt are measures to make Europe work better, and certainly not measures to prevent countries wishing to join from one day making their voice heard in the European decision-making system. That is why it is important for them to participate from now on, and for us to listen to their opinions. And that is why it is not unrealistic for us to think, as one Member of this House has already said, of having a clearer idea of the scope of the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference by the time the Lisbon European Council is held, as long as there is a consensus on this.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe is to assert itself on the world stage, it needs to have a common security and defence policy. The European Union will never have a worthwhile foreign policy if this ingredient is missing. Over the next six months we will be taking decisive steps to make this happen. In September, we will be carrying out the first exercise in which NATO will transfer capacity to the Western European Union and this will take place under the political guidance of the European Union. But those Members who do not represent countries which are members of the Atlantic Alliance may rest assured that the aim of this exercise will, at all times, be to increase European security, not to reduce it. And to this end, it will always involve very careful and judicious relations with those of us who are not members of the Atlantic Alliance, but who will be able to have access to all these systems whenever they want to take part in them. If they do wish to do so, they will be totally on a par with the other partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to comment on certain other foreign policy items that Members have raised, in relation to the EU-Africa Summit. We did not include it amongst the Portuguese Presidency’s specific objectives, as when we took over the presidency, we believed that this objective had not been sufficiently prepared, and we did not want to frustrate people in Europe by setting an objective for which we could not offer any guarantees whatsoever. Our approach is this: we will carry on taking steps to ensure that this idea can be revived at any point, should it prove possible to do this in good time, and if it is logistically feasible. Otherwise, we will continue to examine this subject with our partners in Africa and we will create a basis for the issues to be discussed and for policy to be developed in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the issue of the embargo on arms to Indonesia. In September, at the most dramatic point in the events occurring in East Timor, the European Union decided, for a limited period, which was to come to an end in January, to impose an embargo on arms to Indonesia. This resolution did not include any mechanism for its automatic extension, and the consensus reached at Council level was that this was not the time to rush into a new arms embargo on Indonesia, but that it should also be made very clear that the Member States of the European Union are subject to a very rigorous code of conduct which lays down very strict rules governing the final destination of arms and their use. A very clear consensus emerged for us to stress that this subject would be kept under review, with the option of an embargo mechanism remaining available to the European Union at any time, just as it had been in the past, should it prove necessary to act and to adopt this approach in the event of a dramatic situation arising and calling for corrective and limiting action.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Angola, this is a country with huge resources but – and this is something of a rarity in Africa – quite a small population, both in relation to the size of the country and its resources. The situation in Angola has led to conflict and instability, and it has also led to serious food shortages and major humanitarian concerns. One of the parties has not adhered to the Lusaka Agreement and one of the essential aspects of the Angolan situation has been the refusal of one of the parties to demilitarise itself and to convert itself into a civilian party with the usual institutional arrangements. It is important for this to happen, and the European Union’s approach is accordingly to encourage everyone in one of the camps, UNITA, to adopt a political approach rather than a military one. However, there are also requirements that everyone recognises. I was in Angola about four days ago and spoke not only with the President and with members of the government, but also with members of parliament from all the parties, including members who sympathise with what we would today view as UNITA’s various aims, and I reached the conclusion that the need for improvements in the Angolan system is recognised by a great many of these. Some of these improvements are under way and there is a need to encourage their implementation: improvements in the financial system and improvements in national accounting, and in its transparency and rules. On this subject, the start of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and the possibility of signing an initial agreement in the near future will undoubtedly create the right conditions, through the Paris Club, for creating a multilateral mechanism for monitoring settlement of Angola’s debts. This will allow the European Union to unblock the generation of funds agreed upon years ago, during the Angola Round Table, but which are still being held back at presents for reasons we are aware of. I also have in mind improvements in the institutional system, with a constitutional reform on which the debate is now starting, and which is, of course, based on the values of pluralism, the rule of law and freedom of the press. In this respect, I wish to emphasise the importance of the debate to be held in the Angolan Parliament on the rights of journalists and the fundamental need for an independent press in a modern political system. It is obvious that this will assist Angola’s reintegration into the international system and an improvement in the United Nations’ own systems, which is extremely important. In this connection, I would like to highlight the fact that negotiations have been concluded between the Angolan Government and the Secretary-General of the United Nations on opening a United Nations office in Angola which is committed to, and involved in, humanitarian aid, and which will inevitably have important consequences for the people of Angola. Therefore, alongside the need to demilitarise one political party, there is, on the other hand, a need for institutional improvements, improvements in the financial system and improvements in the links with United Nations bodies in general. The involvement of the European Union in this process is obviously of the greatest importance, both in the context of immediate humanitarian aid and in the context of drawing up a programme of support for reconstruction and rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for reasons of time and because of the addition of a new item on the Middle East to your agenda, I absolutely cannot speak for any longer. However, I would like to conclude by saying that the presidency is delighted to have confirmed during this debate that there is general agreement with the basic principles we have put forward, and that we have been able, I believe, to define a <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> with the European Parliament. I am quite sure that this will make an important contribution to improving the general workings of the Council and Parliament.</p>
