<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Färm (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV) </span>Mr President, let me start by thanking my colleagues, particularly those on the Committee on Budgets, and the Committee on Budgets’ secretariat. They have done a fantastic job with this budget and I think this is an excellent opportunity to draw attention to the incredibly hard work carried out by staff in this context. I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council, who through a long line of trialogues, conciliation, working groups and other contacts have helped to ensure that we now have<span class="italic"> </span>a good draft budget for 2003 to vote on. I would also like to emphasise that on the vast majority of points we in the Committee on Budgets have reached broad agreement, which is naturally also an enormous strength for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin with some fundamental reflections on the EU’s budgetary system. I have to say that after having worked on this budget for approximately ten months, I am of the firm opinion that the EU’s budgetary system is in <span class="italic">great </span>need of major reform. We will gain a number of improvements in the form of the new Financial Regulation. There will also be a number of improvements in the form of the ABB system, the system of activity-based budgeting.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been able to tackle a number of points ourselves by improving the internal work of Parliament itself. I have put a great deal of effort into obtaining a better dialogue with the committees. Now, dialogue between, on the one hand, the Committee on Budgets and, on the other hand, the committees and their rapporteurs for the budget takes place as a practically permanent process, beginning with the guidelines in the spring, including the new work carried out this year with special working groups to monitor this year’s budget and extending to the amendments ahead of the first reading. I therefore believe that we have reduced the traditional conflict where the various committees do not think that the Committee on Budgets is paying sufficient attention to their political priorities and where the Committee on Budgets in turn has often considered that the committees are fighting for unrealistic budgetary demands.</p>
<p class="contents">This year we have come further than before, not least when it comes to the traditionally problematic section on what are known as the A30 grants to various European organisations. This year through close cooperation with the committees and the political groups we have been able to submit a unanimous proposal from the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, we have also reformed the budget debate and have already held the major budget debate at the September sitting. This was an experiment which I think worked well but there is no doubt that it can be improved further.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these improvements I am still not satisfied. Here I would like to send a signal to our colleagues in the Convention. I think that it is unreasonable to make permanent a system involving a long-term budget plan which has such rigid principles for sectoral budget ceilings as those we are living with at the moment. Now, only halfway through the budget planning period, they are giving rise to an increasing number of ad hoc systems which risk making the budgeting methodology completely confusing.</p>
<p class="contents">During this year’s budget process we have already received proposals from the Commission on use of the flexibility instrument in three cases. In the July conciliation we agreed on more planned use of something which should really be an emergency reserve. We have solved the Commission’s problem of obtaining sufficient personnel resources ahead of enlargement by means of a complicated model of frontloading, which means that we hunt down unused resources for the current year and use them for costs which would otherwise have fallen in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Just today in conciliation with the Council we agreed on another new flexibility instrument, the EU Solidarity Fund, to deal with the effects of natural disasters, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, however, we have to ask ourselves how many such flexibility instruments and how many ad hoc solutions we will need before we realise on a wide front that the entire budgeting methodology needs reforming and to become more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets has also chosen which side it is on. We have chosen to consciously exceed the ceilings within <span class="italic">three </span>budget categories, partly to demonstrate the absurdity of the current locked system. I will return to this when giving more detailed reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Note that I am not looking to abolish the budget ceilings. I am not arguing that we should abandon the demand for budgetary restrictions. However, there must be something in between total abandonment and what we are living with at the moment, a rigid planned economy locked for seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in the future it will also go without saying that the codecision model must apply to the <span class="italic">entire </span>budget, <span class="italic">including </span>agricultural policy, and that <span class="italic">all </span>the EU’s expenses must be included in the budget, <span class="italic">including </span>the European Development Fund. This is an important area which I hope we can continue to discuss in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to mention a more general problem before going into the various budget headings, namely the implementation of the EU’s budget. This is becoming a serious problem. We cannot go back to the citizens, the taxpayers, year after year and tell them that every year we take EUR 15 billion from them <span class="italic">unnecessarily</span>, which we then pay back to their grateful ministers of finance. I believe that major work is needed on this issue if the Union is to gain credibility for its policies and its budget and if we are to be able to live up to all the promises we make through the budget. We must quite simply simplify the administration of the structural funds, which we can start doing right now in the current period. We have Commissioner Barnier’s word on this, while of course we can be even more radical ahead of the coming programme period.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we must improve the entire process when starting new multi-annual programmes. Time after time we are told that when multi-annual programmes are starting their third or fourth programme period we are now in the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, the third LIFE programme, etc. a whole year is often needed in order to start up activities at the beginning of a new period. This is completely preposterous. It sometimes means having to compress work intended to take five years into four years in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">A third area where I think we have to achieve an improvement in implementation and simplification is staff issues. This year we decided not to use flexibility for new posts in the Commission. This does not mean that these posts are not needed. In the long term I believe there will be a demand for more posts, partly to operate the new, more decentralised organisation in the external service, but of course this means that the Commission must thoroughly demonstrate that it is working effectively, that reform of the Commission is being carried out, that more efficient management is having an impact, and that, for example, the second step in what is known as the RELEX reform is really being carried out. Without these efforts it will be hopeless to argue for more Commission posts, even if we are convinced that they really are necessary in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now briefly like to address some of the actual problems in each budget area. When it comes to agricultural policy, heading 1, the committee has for many years argued for a fundamental change, the development of agricultural policy. As a demonstration we have even decided to exceed the budget ceiling by EUR 20 million for sub-heading 1b, rural development, to indicate our position in this respect. We consider namely that in the future, money, especially the excess money under heading 1, should be switched to the more proactive rural development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also propose that subsidies for the export of live animals should be reduced and accounted for separately. This will clearly show how much money is actually being spent on live animal exports. By the way, it will be very interesting to see whether the governments which have criticised animal transport, etc. now really seize the opportunity to follow Parliament’s line.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything we are proposing is in line with the Commission’s proposal for a mid-term review, even if in the resolution we have chosen to call it development of agricultural policy rather than reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Heading 2: the Structural Funds. I have already mentioned the problem with implementation. Therefore I will now only briefly take up the fisheries question. I fully understand that in the current situation the Danish Presidency is prioritising enlargement. This is the most important political question but nevertheless, fisheries policy must also be reformed. The EU must create sustainable fishing which can survive in the long term. While awaiting concrete proposals we have chosen to do two things. Firstly we maintain that last year’s promise of a further EUR 27 million to convert the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets will be met. At the same time we have chosen not to adopt a position on how this is to be funded in detail, we will return to that at a later date. When it comes to the budget item for fisheries reform we have chosen to set up such a budget item but not to allocate concrete amounts to it. It will be a ‘memorandum item’.</p>
<p class="contents">In heading 3, internal policies, I would mainly like to mention information policy. We do not accept the Council’s and the Commission’s proposal for comprehensive slimming down of information policy. On the contrary, we think that the union needs better support among its citizens. Here information is a necessary lubricant. Despite this, however, we are moving the money and our priority is clear, what matters is enlargement and the future of the EU. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point to the external authorities, the agencies<span class="italic">. </span>Here we have taken a more restrictive line. We have followed the Council’s draft budget in the vast majority of cases. This is because the Member States are on the boards of these agencies and should therefore reasonably take the consequences of these agencies’ needs into account in the Council’s own budget proposal. Unfortunately we have to say that this is not always the case. Therefore I believe that this is a matter we will need to discuss somewhat in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to pilot projects and preparatory measures, I think we have achieved a very good dialogue with the Commission on their implementation. We are now launching some new ideas, including an idea for a pilot project for co-operation between small and medium-sized companies in the EU, not only with the candidate countries but also with countries such as Russia, countries in the Balkans and in North Africa, which I believe will be very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to concentrate on heading 4, external policies. Ever since I entered Parliament in 1999 we have been forced to fight the same battle in this area every year. The Council and the Commission propose major new initiatives. This has concerned the Balkans and Serbia. This year it is Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund, support to the fight against AIDS and other poverty-related illnesses in the developing world. No one takes responsibility, however, for allocating the resources needed. I think this is absurd. The budget ceiling is simply too low. Costs have increased every year without any new resources being allocated. This year we have chosen to exceed the ceiling but to do it openly by means of an asterisk amendment, where we demand EUR 72 million more for heading 4 with direct reference to Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">We have built this proposal as far as possible on a combination of priorities from our two committees here, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this is what will be the main point in negotiations with the Council between the first and the second reading. It must be resolved if we are to achieve an acceptable role for the EU’s external actions. This also applies to the common foreign and security policy. It is unacceptable that this work is increasingly sliding over more and more from administrative expenses to operational activities but without the influence on the budget which the European Parliament <span class="italic">must have </span>in ordinary external relations. For this reason we have chosen to set the CFSP grant at the minimum level, 30 million, plus 10 million but we have allocated this through the Cards programme in order to be able to establish the European police task force in Bosnia. I believe this is an issue which we must discuss very carefully between the first and the second readings.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to say that this is the last budget for an EU with 15 Member States. Therefore, of course, starting to prepare for enlargement has clearly been the utmost priority even in this budget. I am particularly pleased to be able to say that we have resolved the majority of the problems with enlargement. We have resolved them in broad agreement. All the political groups have played their part, as have members from all the national delegations. I think this feels like possibly the greatest success of this work this year.</p>

<p class="contents">Throughout this year, the EU’s administrative budget, what we term heading 5, has been the budget’s major problem. We started the year with a large predicted deficit in the 2003 budget. This was said to be in the region of EUR 140 million. Although this was reduced in various stages during the spring, the Commission in its preliminary draft budget proposed that the flexibility instrument be used to the tune of EUR 66 million, primarily to cover the Commission’s costs in completing the preparations for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Council and Parliament opposed such a solution for different reasons. Firstly, because it is hard to see an administrative budget as the kind of issue where the flexibility instrument should be used. It can hardly be claimed that it is a case of unforeseen expenses or that enlargement is something that has suddenly come upon us.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason was because, together with other areas where the flexibility instrument has already been earmarked, this would use up half the instrument and thus make it impossible for it to be used in areas where significantly better use could presumably be made of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reason, which is not least important for politicians who feel a sense of responsibility, is that the budget limits are actually there to be complied with, even if it can be claimed with a certain amount of justification that the EU’s budget is far too rigid.</p>
<p class="contents">When we entered into this agreement between the Council and Parliament at a uniquely early point in Brussels on 19 July, we achieved at least three things. We read the whole budget and respected the given ceiling for heading 5, we knew how large the Council’s budget was to be and we had limited the European Parliament’s own budget. Within this framework, the priorities which Parliament had supported even in the guidelines were entirely feasible, these being primarily two things. The main and obvious priority was enlargement. In view of the decisions subsequently taken, we know that if the Member States comply with their undertakings on ten new Member States at the Council meeting in Copenhagen in December and if the agreements are signed in March, we will be able to have 147 observers from all these countries here at the European Parliament as early as April next year. The necessary decisions will be made in terms of property, premises, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The second priority was implementing necessary reforms. These will be required with or without enlargement, especially when it comes to Parliament. Here, the issues are primarily those key areas where every parliament, whether national or European, has to be strong. As far as the European Parliament is concerned, the issue is one of reinforcing the budget structure, not only of the Committee on Budgets but also of all the other committees in their important work on the budget. Furthermore, it is about strengthening Parliament’s legislative function. In a very short time, this has become a parliament with considerable legislative power. As such, the conditions under which this power is exercised must also be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Once all this was done, there remained two important issues to resolve within the framework of the 2003 budget. It was a question of distribution across all the institutions, with approaching enlargement as the main priority in this context too. It was also a question of finding a solution for the Commission’s unresolved problems regarding financing the preparations for enlargement. The latter is particularly important as, following conciliation, one party was clearly the loser, namely the Commission. As early as at the conciliation stage, both the Council and Parliament specifically promised to help attempt to solve the Commission’s problems ahead of enlargement. This promise has subsequently been repeated on numerous occasions both by me and other representatives of both the Council and Parliament. It is in this context that the concept of frontloading enters the picture as the instrument we came to use.</p>
<p class="contents">The initial step involved obtaining a figure from all the institutions for the amount of money remaining in the annual budget, that is, the budget for 2002. It is these funds which we can use in a second step to reduce pressure on the 2003 budget and which can be transferred to the Commission to ensure that we are able to meet the costs of preparations for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">At a meeting attended by the secretaries-general of all the institutions, we thus produced a total sum of approximately EUR 77 million remaining unused by all the institutions in total. The maximum amount the Commission can spend on preparing for enlargement amounts to approximately EUR 72 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words on Parliament’s own share of this frontloading<span class="italic">. </span>According to the proposal which both the Committee on Budgets and Parliament’s own Presidium supported last night, this amounted to EUR 43 million for the current year. This is money which in fact, in line with the far-sighted way of handling money which Parliament has used hitherto, we should have spent on early repayments on Parliament’s own properties. We will now postpone this by one year. This also means that we will receive some of this money back one year later. Of the EUR 43 million which will thus instead be transferred to the Commission, we shall, still in line with the proposal we have to reach an opinion on today, receive EUR 35 million back in 2003. In this context, let me mention that the original proposal was for EUR 40 million. We are thus now proposing that this be changed to EUR 35 million.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that Parliament’s share of this frontloading, seen over two budget years, will be EUR 8 million, a figure which I consider to be well balanced. It is generous but, at the same time, well balanced seen in comparison with all the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This shows that this frontloading, as I see it, is developing into a considerable success and could also be used in other contexts in the future. It creates the opportunity to use a budget over several years to make the best possible use of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier, I mentioned that we promised the Commission that we would contribute to attempting to solve the problems of the costs of preparing for enlargement. A promise is a promise and, as we know, it must be kept. We now stand here having implemented frontloading which gives us the opportunity to comply with what we promised. This is an excellent feeling.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, all this is also about a kind of investment in good relations. Enlargement will only succeed if we realise that it actually is something we must work on together. It is a joint undertaking. As the rapporteur, I am very grateful for the way in which all the institutions, large and small, have played their part in attempting to resolve this very difficult situation.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Färm, Mr Stenmarck, ladies and gentlemen, we have taken a massive step towards the enlargement of the European Union with the positive result of the referendum in Ireland. It is now up to the Council to agree on a common negotiating position for financing issues at the summit this week in Brussels, that is to say how much in the way of resources can be included in the European Union Budget for the new Member States as from 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">This once again clearly signals that the 2003 Budget will very probably be the last budget for a Union of 15 Member States. So we are pretty much on the eve of enlargement. That means that the 2003 financial year will not only present further challenges for the candidate countries, but also for the European institutions that need to make preparations. There have been some serious differences here between the Council and the Commission, because the Council only approved additional posts for itself for 2003 in the run-up to enlargement, but rejected additional posts for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is all the more incomprehensible that, in its own preparations for the Brussels Summit, the Council repeatedly highlights its expectations of the Commission for 2003 in terms of preparation for enlargement, for example in relation to the Structural Funds. But that requires staff too, of course. So the Commission has all the more reason to appreciate the fact that the European Parliament has taken the initiative to ensure that the Commission's requests are met.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my respect for all the rapporteurs, and in particular Mr Stenmarck and Mr Färm, for the way in which they have not only gained support for frontloading, but have also vehemently fought, every step of the way, for it to be implemented. I would like to thank you for your comments, Mr Stenmarck. You made a promise and you have kept it, which we really appreciate. Once again, I would like to express my very sincere thanks, on behalf of the Commission, to the rapporteurs and to the Committee on Budgets. This idea will now be implemented by means of an interinstitutional rectifying budget, and the very fact that there is an interinstitutional rectifying budget is an achievement in itself. So thank you for your support.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to expenditure on the common agricultural policy. As you know, the Commission has pursued the same line as the European Parliament, that is a restructuring of market-related expenditure and market organisation so as to strengthen support for rural areas. The Commission made this subject a key element of its mid-term review proposals. We cannot, however, agree to these proposals being implemented now, as the rules still prevent this and an increase in resources for the rural development programme go beyond the current provision in the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">You have, however, also proposed another amendment, and you, Mr Färm, stressed this again just now, to the effect that the budget headings for export refunds for animals should be subdivided so that refunds for live animals can be identified separately. I think that this could be considered, as long as the relevant legal bases allow it. I share your concern about the need for enhanced animal protection and it is also very much shared by the Commission as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">A third of the Budget will once again be devoted to structural policy next year. There was a debate in plenary in September about the implementation of the Structural Fund programmes, and Mr Färm has one again spoken very clearly about this.</p>
<p class="contents">You very emphatically call for the procedures to be simplified, to allow Member States to draw down funds more quickly and more simply. My colleague responsible for this, Mr Barnier, held a seminar on this in order to establish what scope there is here. This was a further indication of the fact that the Commission is very committed to this issue. However, we also need the Member States' cooperation, and it simply is not good enough if the Member States' estimates of the level of Structural Fund appropriations they implement in a year, that is how much they can actually use, are as wide of the mark as they have been in recent years. As far as this is concerned, I have to say that we have of course to jointly check whether the increased budget appropriations proposed here by Parliament are necessary for the Structural Funds next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is largely able to support the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets as regards appropriations for internal policies, for example in the case of measures in favour of immigration and asylum policy, measures in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises, and the proposal in the area of information policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the budget for external policies, however, I am not in complete agreement at present. One example here is the Global Health Fund to fight diseases such as AIDS. Of course there is no denying that the Commission rates the importance of this global fund very highly. But the issue now is what level of appropriations is needed for 2003, and also what the source of the funding is to be. The Commission has once again proposed that half of the appropriations should be financed from the European Development Fund. I would like to emphasise once again that by far the greatest proportion of appropriations for this global fund has up to now been financed by the European Union, that is to say partly from Community resources and partly from the Member States' bilateral resources. One priority area in the budget for external policies is aid for the Balkan states. A new feature of the 2003 budget is the addition of appropriations for joint police missions to Bosnia. The Commission has already for this reason added a further EUR 10 million to the Common Foreign and Security Policy budget. Parliament's proposal is that this additional sum should be removed again, or rather not inserted in the first place. I am, however, sure that by the time we get to the second reading of the Budget we will have been able to find a way to finance this important area of external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the new challenge for the EU Budget of providing appropriate aid for Afghanistan, the Commission welcomes the fact that the Committee on Budgets has agreed to insert a special budget heading. We also welcome this because the task of providing financial assistance to Afghanistan will of course recur in the budget over the next few years. It is, however, precisely because of this that we believe this financing should have a regular place in the budget, and should not be provided by calling on the flexibility reserve. Nevertheless, the Commission believes that there is a continuing need to use the flexibility reserve, not least to find a financial solution in the coming year for the issue of fisheries reform and to provide Portugal and Spain with the remaining resources needed to restructure their fishing fleets.</p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament's proposal is adopted, the 2003 Budget will represent 1.05% of the combined economic output of all the Member States, that is to say the same level as this year. I am mentioning this because there are still some very contentious debates going on about the Brussels Summit. However, if the proposal on the table for the financing of enlargement in 2004, 2005 and 2006 is adopted, this ratio between the EU budget and European economic output, even with another ten members, will not again reach the level it stood at in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">If we consider once again the size of the EU Budget and how small the increase currently envisaged is in view of enlargement, then I must say I do not really consider that the debate currently raging is actually justified. If anything, there is a danger that discussions on financing will focus too much on individual issues and perhaps get bogged down in them. We should, however, bear in mind that the enlargement of the EU is a very good investment in the future, an excellent investment. In view of this I wish at this point to appeal to the Heads of State and Government to agree on a common position in Brussels so that, following the yes vote in Ireland, we can stick to the timetable for the enlargement of Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elles (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I wish to join with the others in thanking our redoubtable duo, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, for their excellent work on behalf of Parliament during this budget procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">They have both outlined that we are now thinking of a Union which will be extended to at least 25 countries. For both Parliament and the Commission, enlargement is the main emphasis of this budget. I would like to express a personal view. I hope that in future we will avoid too many referenda and too many votes being taken on particular subjects. It might become contagious in this House and we might adopt a resolution and then consider voting again because we have reached the wrong conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I should like to refer to Parliament's and the Commission's budget. Our group has strategies for both these budgets, and they have by and large been implemented as we reach the current stage of the budget procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">On Parliament's budget, we would like to emphasise the need for extended provision for freelance translation – because this is going to be an important factor in the years ahead. We are pleased that early retirement has been extended to the political groups, and thank the Council for that – even if it is absent from this debate this afternoon. We would like full transparency in the Council in future and for all its legislative discussions to be open to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">These are questions which all our group supports.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Commission budget, there are four relevant points. Firstly, on payments and backlog, we would like to see a real effort being made to reduce the EUR 110 billion in commitments. We are asking, as stated in the resolution, for a report from the Commission as to how it is going to achieve this objective of eliminating outstanding commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on internal policies, we are still looking for better value for money and for some of the monies for information policy to be retained in reserve, because we would like to see savings on administration and human resources. We expect a report from the Commission on this subject by 30 April 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on external policies, we would like improved accountability. Therefore, we are supporting the appeal by our rapporteur for more information concerning the interinstitutional agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission on the expenditure of money on foreign and security policy. We would also like to know what kinds of expenditure the Council is expecting over the next five years, because we also agree with the rapporteur that it is unhealthy to think that the Council is going to be involved in large expenditure of funds which would not be subject to normal accountability and use.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, we are asking the Commission to come forward with some form of thought process. There seems to be some lethargy on the part of the Commission when it comes to thinking through what kind of priorities we should have for foreign and security policy in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, my group would like me to say that we want to see this reform process completed and we need to look at how this whole process is being conducted. We are convinced that progress has been made but we are not yet convinced that this whole programme of reform is going to be implemented. We would like to know that you are out there selling it to the general public and that these reforms will be completed by the end of next year, as the most recent reform document from the Commission stated.</p>
<p class="contents">But, before we approve the new posts, we would very much like to see the reform elements in place and to know you are convinced that this whole reform process will be completed. If this is not done so by the end of the current term of the Commission and Parliament, we will be in breach of the commitments we made to our electorate to ensure that real institutional reforms are carried out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament has had what you might call a Swedish experience, and I think that it has been a good experience. It has been very much geared towards consensus and has been imaginative and flexible in equal measure, and has for once closely examined structural aspects. I am sure that this Budget procedure also has structural side effects that need to be very carefully examined.</p>
<p class="contents">From this perspective, I would also like to make the following comment: we have heard several times that this is the last Budget for just 15 Member States before enlargement. But I hope that it is also one of the last Budgets before the convention secures full budget rights for this House, in the medium term at least, in relation to all types of expenditure policy and income policy. That is a request that we have made. You know that I have repeated this request during every Budget procedure; it has become a familiar refrain. I think it is important that we should help to democratise the Budget procedure here.</p>
<p class="contents">The hallmark of the Budget as we draw it up at present is that heated debates rage during the budget-setting process around every million, sometimes even every thousand euros, yet during the year we often have to shift funds around and restructure the Budget. This year alone we will probably draw up six supplementary and amending budgets. We will have between 70 and 80 carry-overs, which means that a great many appropriations will have to be moved around. Not only this year, but also in previous years, both during the budget procedure and right at the end of the year we have had to resort to frontloading in order to finance things that strictly speaking fall in the following year. We also demonstrate by means of this pragmatic approach that we are prepared to finance essential aspects of European policy, and that although we set a Budget at the beginning of the year, there is so much flexibility and room for manoeuvre that at the end of the year the Budget is no longer as reliable as might have been wished and assumed at the outset, when we were discussing certain issues so forcefully. That means that this form of budget setting at the very least needs reflecting upon. We should take this into account in the coming weeks, months and years when we are further developing our budget policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has said, the 2003 Budget is a thrifty one. We will be spending just 1.05% of GNP to tackle all the tasks facing the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If you look at the position of those countries that are net contributors, which are so often the subject of debate, you will find that the biggest net contributors pay no more than 0.3 to 0.7% of their GNP. That ranges from 0.3% for my own country and 0.7% of GNP, to finance this European policy. 0.3% for Germany!</p>
<p class="contents">So much for the heated debates that we are always having about how expensive this is all supposed to be! In the context of the Budget, we try to husband our resources carefully. We try to ensure that balances are maintained. That will be a job for the future – starting with balances in this continent. We need a financially balanced Europe in the long term. We need to make sure that our institutions are capable of functioning, not forgetting the prospect of enlargement, and also bearing in mind the maturing process that our institutions and the European Union as a whole are going through. These are long-term tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ensure that people in Europe who place their trust in us can rely on financial balance and are not taken unawares by short-term changes. I would like to make this point very specifically in the case of agriculture, but it also applies to regional policy. We are also interested in seeing reform of our regional policy and in unblocking the backlog of appropriations still to be executed. I would, however, like to say this, Commissioner: it is not enough for Commissioner Barnier to examine how Structural Fund bureaucracy can be dismantled. That is something that applies to all the EU support programmes. I would be pleased if the other Commissioners affected were to behave in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to strike a balance in our continent. But we as Europeans also need a balance between continents, because we are not just a fortunate island; we also have to think about relations between the continents. In the past we have repeatedly used our external policy to help other regions of the world. This has become ever more difficult, because new tasks have been added to the ones we originally embarked upon: financing, reconstruction, the Balkans, financing reconstruction in Afghanistan, and also the enormous task of improving world health, not least the battle against AIDS. That is not just an issue in Africa, it affects the whole world and that includes our own continent. Money needs to be earmarked for that.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot we could say about financing, Mrs Schreyer, but there is no denying that we have a responsibility here that we need to shoulder. It is hard to do all this. Category 4 has caused us major headaches this year, just as in previous years. We have to be flexible if we want to solve all the world's problems. But there is one thing we need to be clear about: Europe's citizens can rest assured that we will protect their interests in this continent. However, we are also keen to ensure that our continent occupies an appropriate position in the world as a whole. We intend to set budgets in conjunction with you in a thrifty and sound way but at the same time with an eye to the future.</p>

I should likewise like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terence Wynn. I also want to thank Denmark, as the country holding the presidency, for its excellent levels of cooperation, as well as Commissioner Michaele Schreyer. The draft budget meets most of the demands of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. It is thrifty and rigorous, and the payment appropriations account for just 1.04% of GNP, while 1.08% has been provided in the financial perspective for expenditure. There is therefore a margin of more than EUR 3 billion in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft budget now before us is also available in the form of an activity-based budget. This has to do with the Commission’s administrative reform. The Financial Regulation has been undergoing reforms that will come into effect from the start of next year. This entails a revision of the staff regulations, which Parliament is now debating. This is a complete package of reforms intended to boost administrative efficiency, promote the downward delegation of authority, and clarify personal accountability. These are objectives our group wholeheartedly supports.</p>
<p class="contents">The undoubted focus of the budget is enlargement. This budget will probably be the last to be drafted for a Union of 15 Member States. There is provision in it for some very important appropriations. The Committee on Budgets is proposing an extra EUR 699 million in pre-accession aid for the candidate countries to make it easier for them to face the challenges of membership.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem regarding administrative appropriations is insufficient margin for manoeuvre under heading 5. For that reason, the different institutions have started gathering funds out of this year’s budget to be able to pay the costs of accession in advance. For example, Parliament intends to lend the Commission EUR 43 million and the Council EUR 18 million. In other words, levels of cooperation have been exemplary, and my sincerest thanks for that go especially to the rapporteur for the budget, Per Stenmarck.</p>
<p class="contents">The most serious problem in administering the EU budget is outstanding commitments and unused payment appropriations. Outstanding commitments now amount to around EUR 107 billion, or more than the EU’s total budget for one year. The reason for this is the under-utilisation of payment appropriations. This particularly concerns the Structural Funds and external actions. Last year EUR 18 billion in payment appropriations remained unspent and the figure for the previous year was EUR 11 billion. Under-utilisation on this scale seriously undermines the entire administrative process with regard to the EU budget. In the spring outstanding commitments under the Structural Funds reached EUR 80 billion. Despite this, though, the Council reduced the amount in payment appropriations that was proposed by the Commission. That is why the Committee on Budgets increased payments by more than a billion euros.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is calling for a dramatic simplification in the administration of the Structural Funds. With these comments we are prepared to give the draft budget our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the reason why someone in a very authoritative position said the Stability and Growth Pact was stupid. Some of the representatives from France, Germany and Portugal in our group might agree, as might some Italians also. Stupid too is the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline, which was concluded in May 1999. That was the last job of the previous Parliament carried out for the present one. It is on account of this stupid agreement that the European Parliament is virtually powerless when it comes to budgetary policy. All we can do is sit around counting paper clips and spend our time in petty administrative tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi said of the Growth and Stability Pact that the reality that lies behind it is multi-layered and that the institutions should take this into consideration and act flexibly. The same has to be said about the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline. Heading 4, the section that deals with external actions, is especially stupid in terms of its inflexibility. We all know, everyone in this House knows, that the budget is in that respect ‘quasi-rigid’. A ceiling was fixed in the Interinstitutional Agreement, regarding which the Council is unwilling to be flexible. Parliament has had the onerous task of trying to fit new priorities that both Parliament and the Council think important under the 1999 ceiling. A few million has been discussed, and at the same time there might possibly be a billion in appropriations in heading 4 still not forwarded for payment. Thus, there is money in this heading which everybody knows is not being spent. One of the biggest problems with the budgetary procedure is how to include as an extension to the unpaid appropriations in this heading the new appropriations we want to pay, and which we need to pay, in order to fulfil the wishes of the budgetary authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Interinstitutional Agreement is terrorising the drafting of the budget, it must come as no surprise to anyone that if EUR 10 billion remains unused from this budget it will go back to the Member States. I call the Interinstitutional Agreement stupid because of its inflexibility, and the same goes for the Council that is perpetuating this inflexibility. I cannot, however, agree with the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, regarding the stupidity of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>

Mr President, it is customary for us MEPs to initially react a little critically to the Council's absence from our plenary. However, during our previous budgetary debate, the Council made a huge effort to sit here for four hours solidly, so I do not think we will take offence on this occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, however, like to make a suggestion to the Council. This morning, a video conference conciliation meeting took place with the Council for the first time, and we managed to reach agreement on the Solidarity Fund live on screen. Next time there is a debate in the plenary that coincides with its own meetings, the Council could perhaps follow it on screen, and it could submit its comments virtually. In fact, the Dutch Government could easily have done the honours. Since the Dutch Government has resigned and parliament still has not adopted a position on enlargement, it has been agreed that the Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister will be present in Luxembourg over the next few days but will certainly not be saying anything. Since this is not a first for us in Parliament, the Dutch minister could have easily kept his mouth shut here in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">But anyway, we are here to discuss the 2003 Budget. I should first of all like to thank my fellow MEPs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, for the work they have done, which has culminated in the first reading of the Budget that is now before us. In my view, they have acquitted themselves of their tasks as rapporteurs expertly, and they were, and still are, very approachable for all the groups. They are really not to blame, therefore, but I should nevertheless like to share with you the fact that I cannot muster any real enthusiasm for this budgetary debate or for the 2003 Budget that is before us. When I explain to people why I have chosen to sit on the Committee on Budgets, then I always use the argument that the EU's Budget covers all areas. As such, it pertains to structural funds, agriculture, environmental policy, research, social exclusion measures and the reconstruction of war-torn areas, and we are not talking peanuts, but about an amount in the region of EUR 100 billion. Of course, what I am saying is true, but it is only half the story. After all, the political battle we are fighting here today in the plenary is really not about shifting billions or about the overall picture, but about millions and about shifting the accents. This is due to both the rigid financial perspectives and the various pieces of legislation that have already been laid down and as a result of which our hands are tied.</p>
<p class="contents">Take agricultural policy, for example. When my group suggests bringing up the export subsidies for discussion because many farmers in developing countries are seriously hampered in their economic potential, then the argument of administrative assurance is used. The export subsidies form part of existing policy, and we in Parliament cannot simply change this in a budgetary debate. Which is right, of course. It is, however, also important for us to send out a political signal. We are a political forum, after all. As it happens, no substantive arguments have been put forward against our proposal to scrap export subsidies. Instead, that three billion has simply been approved, as have the enormous amounts for the production of European tobacco, which we happen to think is extremely harmful to public health.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is also very critical about the amounts set aside for the Trans-European Networks. After eight years, most of the projects are still in their infancy. Yet still nobody dares say in public that the EU subsidies may, to some extent, be money down the drain. We simply carry on undeterred, not always taking the best projects forward. The Member States themselves grant priority to national projects, while the value-added of European funding is surely the fact that they must be cross-border projects. The Commission is now having to come up with all kinds of emergency measures to support the real cross-border projects, although this is, of course, a somewhat bizarre situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, with regards to structural funding, Member States pursue double and often conflicting priorities, which partly explain the enormous delays in implementation. On the one hand, they are all out for getting as much out of the Brussels money coffers as possible, but at the same time they struggle to find national co-financing because those projects are not always a national priority. My conclusion is therefore that the Member States feel less responsible for European money or for the fact that it should be spent carefully and fairly, than they do for national funds. This is quite remarkable when you think that it is all money originating from the same tax payer.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area of doubt concerning correct spending is of a wholly different nature. I hope that Parliament will support me in this. It concerns the funding for Kedo. We touched upon this briefly last night. The European taxpayer is financing a nuclear energy plant in North Korea. My group is opposed to this as a matter of principle in any case, because we prefer to support sustainable energy. But anyway, this is the way things are, and I know that a majority in Parliament is in favour of it. However, it now turns out that North Korea is probably also developing nuclear weapons. It is clear to me that we should examine this carefully, and it also seems to make sense to me to place this money in the reserve and not to release it until we have clarity about the programmes pertaining to this plant. I should also like to ask the European Commissioner for her opinion and whether she is already intending to place this money in the reserve at second reading. These are all examples of money that is being spent but against which I would place question marks as to their judiciousness.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is also a category of credits which I think should be spent, or even more should be spent. One such example is enlargement. There is a fine Dutch expression that says ‘<span class="italic">goedkoop is duurkoop</span>’ [you get what you pay for], and I am leaving it up to the interpreters to find a sound translation for this. I am not in favour of wasting money, but I do believe in delivering on our promises and seizing historical opportunities. The situation happens to be different from the one we anticipated in 1999 when the financial perspectives were laid down in Berlin. Not six, but probably ten countries, will be joining, and not in 2002, but in 2004. The financial plan should therefore be adjusted accordingly. However, because of their 'accountant' attitude, the net payers are not interested. My group will in any event be endorsing the amendments which will enable this to be adjusted, as I am convinced that we will ultimately be paying a hefty price.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in category four has also changed. Regarding the reconstruction of the Balkans and Afghanistan, it has often been said that it is impossible to deliver on all promises in category four, unless cutbacks are made in various other priorities. For example, a downward adjustment was made to the multiannual programme for the other western Balkan countries due to the situation in post-Milosevic Serbia. What will we do if peace is established in the Middle East? What programmes will we be offering then? I have already listed the areas where I am quite happy to cut back by a few billion, but I should like to see a few million added here.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area where an extra few million would not go amiss is category five, administrative expenditure. It is no secret that I was unhappy with the deal concluded during July’s conciliation. According to this deal, Parliament and the Council look after each other’s needs, and it was agreed that the Commission would be served via a frontloading operation. This worked out well. The 500 additional positions for enlargement will probably be created. However, the political signal is rather unpleasant, in my view. The Commission is not a closing entry; it is necessary for a smooth enlargement process. Ironically, the people who are most critical of enlargement and of the capacity of the candidate countries to implement the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> are often the very people who refuse to allow the Commission to have sufficient staffing levels to implement and monitor the implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. In my opinion, the frontloading method is not particularly attractive, nor terribly transparent, as Mr Walter has already stated. Despite this, I should like to extend warm congratulations to the rapporteurs on the result, because in the final analysis, it is the result that counts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, I have taken the floor on several occasions in recent months to condemn what I consider to be the shortcomings and historic inconsistencies of the Community budget such as the RALs or the financing of internal policies and external actions, and also to draw your attention to the specific problems which have only come to light in recent months such as, for example, the ceiling for the administrative expenditure heading, which is too low, and, more generally, the inadequacy of the Financial Perspective agreed in Berlin in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I want to try and address the situation from a political perspective – if it can be described as such – rather than a technical perspective. At a historic time such as that we are currently experiencing, when the international system is continually changing, on the one hand, and with enlargement and the debate on the future of Europe taking place, on the other, I feel that we too, who are experts in financial matters, should start to think about the role we want the European Parliament to play.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is as follows: should we agree to be mere implementors of rules, rules for the most part written by others, or do we want to be able to change things? For example, how do we feel about the fact that the Council was able to obtain a legal basis from the Commission regarding the issue of natural disasters, for instance, which is an extremely important matter? Would we not also like to be in a position where we can contribute to the Commission’s work? Ladies and gentlemen, very often, we hide – and I am talking about us as a whole political class, of course – behind respect for rules and procedures without even attempting to make genuine changes to them or to the way they are applied. Changes that would be for the better, of course. This is the message I want to be conveyed as an addendum to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2003 budget is proving to be a good one, and I congratulate the rapporteurs on their commitment, all the effort they have put in and the results achieved, thanks, not least, to Commissioner Schreyer, the entire Commission structure, the secretariat and the draftsmen, but I can only emphasise that this is a technical budget in which our role has been primarily that of making the figures add up, lacking as we do the strength, the courage and the will to introduce genuine political measures.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be that we younger Members want to change the world sometimes, but, this time, I would be content just to change a few tiny elements of our European budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, at the Commission’s proposal, Parliament decided to set up a Solidarity Fund within the budget lines B2-400 and B7-090 during the previous sitting. I expressed our doubts surrounding this fund at the time, and I shall now confine myself to the budgetary aspects. This fund is, to all intents and purposes, virtual, for it is still empty. When a major disaster does strike, we will need to find resources in the Budget for this Fund retrospectively. This strikes us as highly improbable. Furthermore, if more than one disaster strikes in any one calendar year, the Fund’s upper limit (EUR 1 billion) may also create a problem. Imagine that a major disaster strikes in the spring, to which the Commission assigns EUR 700 million from this Fund. What would happen if another disaster on a similar scale were to strike in the autumn? There is the risk that the resources allocated for the following year would be released prematurely. This could be the thin end of the wedge. Given the uncertain origin of the Fund’s resources, we are faced with the undesirable situation whereby there is a Fund for which no provisions have been made in the 2003 Budget. This means that after a number of years, considerable pressure could be brought to bear on the Member States to make additional contributions. Given the current economic situation and the freedom in budgetary policy that some Member States allow themselves, I can foresee major problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to make a critical comment on the Budget for the Sixth Framework Programme on research and development. The funding of research from the EU budget brings with it ethical dilemmas, as is the case, for example, in research on embryos. In the fanatical fight to fund research of this kind, the entire framework programme will soon be in the balance because at second reading Parliament refused to make any more guideline statements about the funding of controversial areas. Moreover, the Council would have been better to start the debate on ethics sooner and postpone the ethical guidelines until after the programme had been accepted. This controversy demonstrates that the framework programme should have been restricted to facilitating cross-border cooperation. Active financial support is undesirable and superfluous. Why should we co-finance research that is likely to take place anyway?</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final comment concerns fisheries. The Commission and Parliament devote much attention to the Spanish and Portuguese fishermen who, together with their regions, are let down by the lack of an agreement with Morocco. Millions of euros have been spent on compensation, reducing the numbers of fishermen and re-training them in those regions. Other fishing regions are also starting to feel the pinch now. Apparently, biologists are now advising the Commission to ban cod fishing and to reduce other quotas. This would have a major financial impact in the Netherlands, among others. Would it not make sense, therefore, to shift the budget’s attention to fishing regions that have been self-sufficient to date? Financial support for those regions in the form of socio-economic programmes is desirable. This aspect, however, is still missing from this budget which spends millions on fisheries agreements with third countries, from which only a minority of countries and shipowners benefit. Speaking of solidarity, it would not hurt for the EU to devote more attention financially to a fishing industry that has not been able to make use of subsidies for the renovation and building of ships for years. This has caused unfair competition for many years. A fisheries sector that keeps to the quotas should be able to expect more from Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We distribute some of our funds indiscriminately, we set too few priorities, and we also finance ineffective actions, if you consider that we still allow ourselves the luxury of two parliamentary places of work and are therefore also paying for very questionable tourism for Members as well as a Convention that is costing millions. Europe needs new impetus. We need an offensive on the economy, including measures to make cheap capital – I mean venture capital – available above all to small and medium-sized enterprises. It is precisely here that effective initiatives are lacking in the 2003 Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an urgent need for action when it comes to introducing the Basle II provisions, above all when we consider that 45% of European small and medium-sized enterprises have little or no own resources. As well as changing the way in which aid is allocated in agriculture, in the future we will also have to change the distribution criteria in the Structural Funds. The standard of living in a region should not be used to assess the situation or be a factor in the amount of aid allocated. Companies or sectors that need support should all receive these funds, regardless of whether the company is located in the north, south or east. We must use the funds entrusted to us more efficiently and more carefully, if we also wish to co-finance enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of their spirit of openness and their quest for common positions, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Göran Färm and Mr Per Stenmarck, for the work they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Göran Färm is one more in a long list of rapporteurs who are faced with the fundamental dilemma of Category 4 of external actions, that is, whether the Council or the Commission should have the last word in terms of setting external political priorities, or whether Parliament should have its say.</p>
<p class="contents">Every single year we hold the same debate at first reading. The Commission presents a preliminary draft that cuts the Union’s traditional external priorities; the Commission cuts the appropriations approved by this Parliament the previous year and explains that the programmes in question have not been implemented satisfactorily. Then comes the first reading in the Council and, taking advantage of the previous explanation by the Commission, it cuts the appropriations intended for external actions even further, using the pious moral justification of budgetary savings and the principles of sound financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">Next comes the stage we are at now, in which Parliament reinstates the lost appropriations, restates the external priorities and reminds the other two institutions that this is an exercise involving three of us. I belong to the parliamentary majority that viewed the Berlin financial perspectives of 1999 as sufficient and correct. I voted for them and campaigned for them. I do not share the view of some Members that those financial perspectives should be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I recognise that we are in an increasingly complicated situation. New external commitments arise, which are happily taken up either by the Council or by Mr Prodi, or by both in unison – although that hardly ever happens. These commitments then have to be met within a very strict financial framework, made up of non-obligatory expenditure, which we MEPs are asked to respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Since not all commitments can be met, however, and not everything can be funded when money is scarce, we have to turn to the excuse of the poor implementation of certain geographical programmes. I do not believe that excuse is any good anymore. We MEPs vote for appropriations which originate from the money of the European citizens so that it can be spent to fund external aid programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, your task and that of the other Commissioners and the Council is to ensure that these programmes are implemented. You are the Community’s executive. I do not know whether it is the fault of Latin America or the Mediterranean countries, for example, that their programmes have a low level of implementation, but I do know that their needs are real. I know that the solution is not to reduce year after year the appropriations we approve, to reduce programmes, but, as we all know, to find new ways to improve implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that for next year – and this is a desire that we express every year at first reading – that the Commission, rather than cutting the money of the previous year, will even request more money in order to comply with the European Parliament’s traditional external priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in terms of applying cuts, the efforts of the Council are quite sufficient, since it is a great specialist in that area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say that because a lot of people are concerned about the way in which this budget will be voted on Thursday. I do not just mean the Commission and the Council, but colleagues from a variety of parliamentary committees.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make one point absolutely clear to anyone who shares these worries: this is, after all, a first reading to show we have political priorities and to put some pressure on the Council, it is not the end of the story. These concerns have arisen because of what the committee adopted. We exceeded the ceilings in three categories – in category 1b we will have to see how Parliament votes on Thursday. On category 2, we are duty-bound to find a solution with the Council. On category 4, we also need to find a solution together with the Council. That is why the decisions have been taken in category 4, to try to ensure that there will be real dialogue with the Council to solve some of the political problems in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">As others have said, the ceiling on category 4 has been a problem ever since we concluded the interinstitutional agreement. Every year since then we have had to use the flexibility instrument. Some may agree with Mr Seppänen that the agreement is stupid. I am one of those who voted for it. That might make me stupid, but the reality is that this Parliament agreed it, and we have to live with it and within its restrictions. I hope that when it comes to the next interinstitutional agreement we will have learnt lessons from this one, especially in category 4.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this time the needs in category 4 – especially in the areas of Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund – have to be sorted out. On the Global Health Fund, there are certainly big differences of opinion between the Commission, the Council and ourselves. To make it worse, at least one Member State is asking us to find the extra EUR 65 million, which complicates matters when we know what the Council's position is already.</p>
<p class="contents">When I say it has to be sorted out, I mean we have to find a real solution with the Council, not going into a conciliation or trialogues and playing the usual games. We have serious problems in these areas and we need a real sense of cooperation. It must be said that we have had a good working relationship with the Danish presidency. We should not condemn the Danish presidency for not being here. They have apologised to me and explained that they have other commitments. The fact that the President-in-Office sat for 4 ½ hours at our last meeting showed his commitment. They have been quite good in the way they have worked with Parliament. They have respected Parliament and Parliament's will. The Danish presidency has been good to work with.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Buitenweg said, the presidency has also been good today, even in the videoconference on the European Solidarity Fund. But let us hope that those good relationships can continue as we go into the next conciliation, prior to the second reading by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I also made the point at the Convention that, in contrast to the American War of Independence, where the cry was 'no taxation without representation', we in this Parliament have the luxury of having representation without taxation. That makes the Council often think that we are profligate with taxpayers' money. The message we need to give to the Council is that the budgets we vote here are serious and prudent, but they have political priorities. I hope that, in December, we will have achieved some of those political priorities.</p>

As we have already stated, the Group of the Liberal Democrat and Reform Party is fairly satisfied with this budget, which would appear to be rigorous and transparent throughout. This is part of our tradition. I would, however, immediately add that, in my view, it is also an excessively technical budget with only a very limited political dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept the basic lines, particularly those relating to reform and enlargement, of course, which I feel is the greatest challenge facing us. However, precisely because it is a challenge, we must take more decisive, political action, action which is, above all, more visible to<span class="bold"> </span>all the European citizens. I too, like the Committee Chairman, who spoke just now, feel that it is imperative that the procedure is reformed. The technical elements of the procedure need to be revised, it needs to be simplified and, in particular, its cultural and political dimensions need to be developed, with the Council’s powers defined in such a way that they are maximised, not reduced, to achieve a more effective, more focused<span class="bold"> </span>and, above all, more topical debate. There needs to be a basic philosophy underlying the European budget, a basic philosophy of shared, not concentrated, administrative responsibility – and I stress, shared: this is extremely important – and Parliament needs to have a greater political role, for it must discharge its mandate as effectively as possible. Parliament, like the Union as a whole, must be a visibly political institution and make political responses.</p>
<p class="contents">I will focus on just two technical aspects. The first concerns the issue of category 4, which my colleague has already touched on. I would add something further. It may be that we pay little or rather too little attention to the Mediterranean question, it may be that we pay too little attention to the issue of the Middle East. We go so far as to debate reconstruction, Afghanistan and issues concerning very distant countries, but there is a matter nearer to home which we will soon, all too soon, have to address more thoroughly and much more decisively.</p>
<p class="contents">I will mention one more issue: culture. The funds committed for young people, training and information are utterly inadequate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A series of issues were mentioned that are of the utmost significance for the future viability of our policies on agriculture and rural development. These include the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, consumer protection and enlargement. I hope that the Commission is sufficiently courageous and competent also to take account of these long-term objectives when it is implementing the budget and that it will not be distracted by more immediate political concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that sources of conflict, such as shortcomings in accounting procedures, fiddling and cooking of the books, are eliminated and that instead transparency and strict discipline are the order of the day when the budget is implemented. Both nationally and internationally, interested members of the public are presented with a confused and contradictory picture of agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As they currently stand, Commissioner Fischler's proposals have not met with the approval of a majority. More work therefore needs to be done on them. Despite the fact that the applicant countries have made huge economic and social adjustments, the Berlin decisions provide that the funds to be transferred to the accession countries, in the form of pre-accession aid, and expenditure on enlargement are to be maintained as laid down and made public. Several discussions in which I have participated have reinforced my view, in favour of the applicant countries, that the 25% rule for direct payments is politically unacceptable; in addition the applicant countries fear high losses and are demanding an accession rebate and a change in their quotas. This will have a major impact on the funding of the agricultural policy and the current financial perspective will have to be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">How much will enlargement cost? That is the question. How we are to respond to this in the 2003 Budget remains unknown. A vital question for the agricultural sector is 1.05% + X and for as long as it remains unanswered the implementation of the 2003 Budget will remain a dangerous business as far as agriculture is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to remember that the budget is there to support policy decisions taken either by the Council or by the Council and Parliament jointly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is inappropriate to seek to use budgetary procedure as a means of shaping that policy. I am referring in particular to certain recommendations relating to agricultural and structural funds. The proposal to reduce export subsidies is both misplaced and ill judged, especially since it is aimed at forcing a policy decision, mainly a reduction in the transport of live animals. The budget is not the appropriate instrument for such policy decisions, regardless of how one might feel about the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the substance is concerned, we should remember that we live in a global economy, with strong competitors for agricultural trade. In the current climate of depressed prices and policy uncertainty, we are going to place our farmers at a further disadvantage. Let me assure you that, if the EU decided to ban live animal exports today, the Australians would step in and take over our markets straight away. This is an important commercial consideration that must be borne in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Staying with agriculture, I share the concern of many colleagues over the proposed across-the-board reduction of EUR 275 million in agricultural spending. Clearly this proposal is out of touch with current agricultural realities. My own group has tabled a number of amendments which seek to undo some of the potential damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, the proposed quota of EUR 525 million in structural fund payment appropriations. As a representative of an Objective 1 region in the north and west of Ireland, I am very conscious of the benefit of every single euro invested in an effort to redress the economic and socio-economic imbalance in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would welcome any improvements that could be made to the implementation rates for structural-funded programmes and projects. We must tackle this by improved forecasting of payment requirements, but I firmly reject any notion that global amounts could in any way be reduced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If everything is stupid, the very rigour of this budget is stupid. If the Stability Pact is stupid, if it needs to be revised in order to make our countries and our economies less rigid, then, Commissioner, if anything can be described as great stupidity here, it is the stupidity which leads us, while ten countries are knocking on our door, to restrict ourselves with a highly complex budget that is pared down to the very minimum, forcing us to use all our ingenuity – and, in this regard, I pay homage to the skill of our rapporteur – in order to be able to make any provision at all for Afghanistan and many other subjects, a budget, lastly, that remains fixed and, if possible, even smaller than before. All this at a time when our States – and your President echoed this very eloquently – believe that we need to break the locks of laws that appear stupid, even to the States which are the guardians of these laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also, therefore, consider the budget in this light. I do not feel this budget takes account of the facts. I believe that, at this time of enlargement, the Convention certainly needs to consider a new European Treaty, it needs to consider giving Parliament more powers, as it could certainly use them, but also, most of all, it needs to consider the fact that 25 States cannot operate with a reduced budget designed for 15. That is what I wanted to say in relation to the current climate.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Thursday’s vote, I feel that, yesterday, in the Committee on Budgets, we envisaged a measure that I consider important. We have just learnt that North Korea is surreptitiously using the civil nuclear programme we are funding, at a high cost of over EUR 20 million, for military purposes, in deliberate violation of the agreements concluded with the international community. We believe we could strike a blow, when voting on the budget, by placing the appropriations concerned on reserve: this, Commissioner, could perhaps be a way forward, not least where the Council is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we have a budget which I believe to be innovative in other areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would certainly be right and proper for the Council to attend these debates. Even though we had a debate on the general principles of the Budget at our last plenary part-session, it would certainly be fitting for them also to be present when we get down to brass tacks – and at Parliament's first reading we really do get down to brass tacks. In this respect I am very pleased that we have tabled an amendment which, at least initially, places the funds for the increase in Council staff in the reserve and asks a few more questions. I hope that this amendment will also be supported by a sufficient majority. It is linked to conditions which the Council can fulfil by the end of the year so as not to jeopardise enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I actually wanted to start by thanking the Council for making this morning's Solidarity Fund event such a success and for enabling us to reach an agreement. In this context, however, I hope that the Member States concerned, and in particular the German Government, will now also announce their figures quickly. We have all made every effort to meet the budgetary conditions. We have now met both. We have Budget lines, we have a legal base, and now all we need is money. If the Commission is still waiting for information in this respect I find it more than shameful. It is the end of October and it actually ought to be available.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight just a few points, because my fellow group members have already addressed a number of issues. First, a fundamental comment: it is increasingly clear that the decisions made by the Heads of State and Government in March 1999 on Agenda 2000 and the financial perspective up to 2006 were a wish list of items, which may have been sensible in 1999 but which are no longer relevant to the challenges currently facing the Union. I should like to illustrate this using just two figures: if we are able, according to the financial perspective, to spend EUR 42 billion on the agricultural policy but can, after considerable effort, only scrape together a final total of EUR 47 million for common activities under the Common Foreign and Security Policy then this shows an imbalance in our political priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe's activities in Category 4, in particular its support for the peace process in neighbouring countries – an important task whereby we must help to transfer our European legacy of peace to other regions – are on very, very shaky ground. The decisions that were made in March 1999 do not help us to meet these obligations in the long term. I hope that something can be done here – we have of course tabled various amendments in an effort to shore up this work – and that we will at last be given a better chance to do justice to this important task which is incumbent on the European Union in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to address a second issue, one on which I also ask for the support of Members from the other groups. We have tabled an amendment stating that, in the work on the trans-European networks, special attention should be paid to eliminating bottlenecks to the enlargement countries. I would be delighted if a majority of this House could support this. We cannot have a situation where enlargement cannot at the end of the day take place in practice. It will admittedly happen on paper, but without the necessary infrastructure it will not be able to take place in economic terms. The Community is called on to act here. We are doing a great deal for those countries wishing to join us, but we must redouble our efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Stenmarck on behalf of the Socialist Group on a very solid and well-worked report. But I would like to go further and thank him on my own behalf for the good will and cooperation he has lent me in my temporary work as accidental shadow rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as has already been pointed out, the preparation of the budget by the other institutions for 2003 has demonstrated the great pressure which the administrative needs relating essentially to the costs of preparation for enlargement exerts on the maximum limit of heading 100.</p>
<p class="contents">My group fully supports the rapporteur with regard to the main objective, which is, quite rightly, to provide the institutions with the necessary means for a good preparation for enlargement to 25 countries, which is just around the corner. To this end, the rapporteur has tried to provide the institutions with adequate means to meet their priority needs.</p>
<p class="contents">My group also supports Mr Stenmarck’s strategy of frontloading, in other words, providing for the use of surpluses available from the present financial year 2002 to bring forward certain expenses forecast for 2003 and therefore relieve the burden on the 2003 budget, as the rapporteur explained at length during his speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I shall focus on a series of points that my political group sees as priorities:</p>
<p class="contents">First point. All the institutions – in fact, the European Parliament was the last – just before the vote in the Committee on Budgets, have presented, under pressure essentially from the Socialist Group, a budget based on a rigorous cost-efficiency calculation. And to use this twelfth language that Mr Wynn described as the Community jargon, the so-called ‘Activity Based Budget’ has been presented because it is clear that the institutions need a transparent system of financial management for the sake of efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to staff, I would like to mention two points. Firstly, my group has always supported the idea of the institutions having the necessary human resources, providing that the needs are real. We are therefore pleased that the Committee on Budgets has voted in favour of our amendment, in which we request a description of the functions and needs in order to be able to determine precisely what support is necessary in the case of institutional posts. But only for institutional posts. We therefore reject Amendment No 1 presented to the House by the Group of the European Peoples’ Party, which requests that it also be extended to Members of Parliament who have similar responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to pensions, I would like to say that this is shameful. I was general rapporteur for the 1999 budget and in that report I placed great emphasis – almost a separate report – on the urgent need to resolve the problem of the pensions of European civil servants. We are now in 2002 and we are still making the same appeal. Mr Ferber, I would also have liked the Council to have been present, since that is the first obligation it must fulfil.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, my group has always argued that the citizens need to be aware that the European Parliament is their home; a transparent home. We therefore support a pilot project to broadcast plenary sittings live.</p>
<p class="contents">And, Madam President, because there is no blank cheque here, with a view to the 2004 budget, the European Parliament’s Bureau should present us with relevant proposals in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It remains extremely regrettable that we are still more than EUR 3 million short on the landmine issue. Funds for this cause have already been cut back worldwide. The European Union should not take part in this trend. Some 50 people, mainly women and children, are still affected every day. An enormous amount of money is still required, particularly for the aftercare of the victims and the relatives. Moreover, we as Parliament must also meet the commitments entered into in 2001. We are now incurring payment arrears while the EU has proven that it can make an effective contribution specifically in this field. This is why the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has re-tabled my amendment. Our Parliament should recognise that the banning of landmines must also involve non-state players. Parliament is adopting a consistent stance by endorsing the amendment. A slight increase in the funds will result in a considerable reduction in the number of people suffering. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not, of course, opposed to the priorities that the rapporteur has outlined. As a matter of fact, I wish to congratulate the rapporteurs on their work. We believe, however, that other approaches could be pursued in order to achieve these priorities, without prejudice to and with total respect for the legitimacy and the competences conferred on us, and particularly which would give us an advantage in achieving these very priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important aspect of this situation is the revision of the financial perspective. Or, in the absence of such a revision, the full use of the prerogatives that the Treaties confer on us. It is, in fact, unacceptable to maintain and sustain a budget that is clearly inadequate for the set of priorities that we are coming up with.</p>
<p class="contents">Objectively, the means to achieve the ambitions that are being proclaimed are lacking. Parliament is constantly losing power and the result is clear to see, especially in heading 4, in which we are seeing a clear and ongoing pressure on cooperation with the least-developed countries, given the inclusion in this category of pre-accession aid for the candidate countries and sums for the reconstruction, first of the Balkans and now of Afghanistan. This situation must change.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I should like to say something about a particular case: that of East Timor. I shall start by saying that I agree with the sums decided on by the Committee on Budgets. I do not agree, however, with eliminating the specific line for that young and much-benighted country. This would send a damaging and destabilising political message to a population that gained independence only a few weeks ago and which is still facing all manner of shortcomings. This would be a political message that does not, furthermore, tally with the resolutions that we have adopted, or even with the Sakharov Prize that we awarded. In addition to which, making funds available under the Asia budget line at a time when the path of future cooperation between East Timor and the European Union has not yet been defined would clearly be an act of rashness. I therefore believe it is right and crucial that the situation that has been created should be rectified in plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Catastrophic, first of all, because it is based on a whole series of things which are unacceptable. For example, the bargain or British cheque. One night, at Fontainebleau – Mrs Thatcher tells this tale in her memoirs – President Mitterrand said to her ‘Madam, you will get your cheque’. In fact, however, since then, the United Kingdom has become a net recipient. It is as if a millionaire continued to go to the soup kitchens and considered that this was actually part of the Community acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">Second catastrophe: the RALs, for example, not only in the field of the Structural Funds, but also in the field of agriculture. The difference between the budget on which we voted and the appropriations actually committed, actually taken up, is such that, over ten years, European small farmers have lost out on almost the equivalent of an annual budget.</p>
<p class="contents">This budget is not only catastrophic, however. It is also nostalgic. Everyone has said it, this is the last time there will only be 15 of us. As the Hungarian President rightly said to us earlier, in a Europe with 25 Member States, there is no question of having two speeds, with some countries receiving 100% of the agricultural subsidies and some, initially, only receiving 25%. The balance of political powers will be such that we will not be able to carry on this way.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2003 budget, however, is an initial response to this need, and that is why it is historic. Not historic because of a number of pretentious things such as the APS – annual political strategy – or ABB – activity based budgeting. These things have existed since the 1960s with the planning, programming, and budgeting system. No, if this budget is historic, it is because it is the first to exceed EUR 100 billion, the first in budgetary history to reach three figures. And although it took 43 years to get there, it will take barely ten years to exceed two hundred and reach the EUR two hundred billion mark. In this respect, sooner or later, these two hundred billion will, of course, force us to establish a European tax.</p>
<p class="contents">We must welcome this budget, it is the last easy budget, the last simple budget. In future it will be open season on taxpayers, although it is true that, for our British friends, this will replace fox hunting, which has now been outlawed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to points which might seem minor but which concern Parliament’s use of its power of initiative. With due regard for the interinstitutional agreement and the Financial Regulation, the European Parliament is about to vote on new pilot project and preparatory action initiatives, which I believe will be useful for European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point concerns preparing small and medium-sized businesses for enlargement. I feel this will be an important signal to industry which will make that network of small businesses which is so vital for our economies feel more involved. I am convinced that practical measures would have much more effect than a series of information campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">The second initiative which I would like to mention concerns a programme known as ENEA, dedicated to the elderly, which seeks to repeat the success of the Erasmus and Socrates programmes in the context of the movement of the elderly. The innovative nature of this programme lies in the fact that it could develop as an interface<span class="bold"> </span>between culture, social policies and health and that, if Parliament endorses the pilot project, it will be providing the Commission with the opportunity to create a programme which will encourage dialogue between elderly people from 25 different countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I would like to mention is the environmental initiative, which, by means of the funding of reforestation measures and the creation of a seed bank, will allow us to promote the mechanism for clean development laid down by the Kyoto Protocol. This project seeks to promote positive measures at European level to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere, while creating an operative structure for the collection and preservation of seeds and plants, many of which would otherwise be lost as autochthonous species,<span class="bold"> </span>and the use thereof for the purposes of ecological restoration. This will also create employment, for the diversification of farming will certainly pose problems and require new goals to be set.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must, of course, now inform Parliament without delay of the measures it intends to take to comply with the recommendations of the budgetary authority if all this is to be put to the vote on Thursday and again in December.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck once again for their work, and I hope that the Commission will continue to seek that close cooperation which we have enjoyed in recent months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to draw your attention to a curious phenomenon: the implementation of the Structural Funds, which represent one of the most voluminous headings, is much greater in the poorest countries of the Union than in the wealthy countries, which is contradictory by anyone’s standards. Logically, it should be expected that the more developed countries should have better implementation and better administration, but this is not reflected in the data they present us with. Perhaps more specific questions should be asked of the Council. When considering this issue, we cannot be homogenous and assume that everybody is equal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking on a personal basis, but also as permanent rapporteur for the financial perspectives. I would therefore like to focus on two points. Firstly, I would like to ask the Council – which, although it is absent, I hope will read the Minutes – whether it intends to comply with what was agreed last year in relation to the contribution to the programme of restructuring the fleet which traditionally fished in Moroccan waters, and which we agreed to restructure as a result of the lack of an agreement with that country.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s budgetary authority, that is to say, the Council and this Parliament, agreed in December 2001 to include, and I would stress, ‘in the 2003 budget at the latest’, the EUR 27 million still required to finish the programme. However, in the draft budget, the Council has eliminated a budgetary heading that the Commission had included to this end and I would therefore ask what this means. Does it mean that the Council does not intend to respect its commitments or does it intend to concoct an excuse? And do not dismiss me as lacking trust, since what I have is experience. I have being fighting this fight for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Budgets propose to you two possibilities which, furthermore, may be complementary. On the one hand, to carry out a transfer of appropriations in November which are not going to be used in Category 2. Up until 18 October, EUR 105 million remained uncommitted. The Commission now tells us that it could only use 9 million. I would ask it to make an effort with this 105 million, and then we will see what it can achieve. Otherwise, we should really mobilise the flexibility instrument laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement for the next financial year. This is not very orthodox, it is true, but it could be accepted, since there is an exception laid down in the article of the Agreement. Furthermore, I hope that the Council, as it sometimes does, will fulfil its promise and that we can come to an agreement before December.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the cut in traditional policies on third countries. Ladies and gentlemen, in heading 4 they are constantly asking us to increase our aid to new countries, and this is done to the detriment of old ones. This also implies a consideration by the Council of the total amount for this heading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two agencies have the problem of being physically situated in countries where the rate of inflation is higher than the EU average, and this erodes their budgets and, therefore, their ability to carry out their tasks. One of the agencies is that in Dublin, which is engaged in developing the social dialogue, partly in the candidate countries. The other agency is that in Turin which develops vocational training in the Balkans and within the framework of the MEDA and TACIS programmes. The Commission’s budgeting does not take account of this problem of inflation, and I believe that more new agencies are at present being established in order to ensure there is the necessary administrative expertise. The agencies differ greatly from one another in the ways in which they are set up and in the tasks they have, and I therefore hope that, in the future, we can obtain a budget reading that better takes account of the agencies’ different structures and different needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rigour is the watchword. Budget headings are removed and reduced, and I feel we are far from a budget that meets our needs and expectations. Apart from the fact that the increase in this part of the budget is only superficial, since account must be taken of the inclusion of pre-accession aid for Cyprus, Malta and, in particular, Turkey, the general trend conveyed by the figures is not an indication of a great desire on the part of the Union to shoulder its responsibilities with regard to the South.</p>
<p class="contents">How odd it is to set the objective of eradicating poverty and, at the same time, cut funds for development aid. The cuts are clear: less for food aid, less for Latin America. They are particularly serious for the Mediterranean and the Balkans, without counting the possibility of further cuts which will have to be made if funding for aid to Afghanistan is not found from other resources. Who can we convince that this so-called reallocation of funds to other headings will lead to more appropriations, greater effectiveness in responding to the needs of the people concerned? Without a proper review of the Financial Perspectives, the pressure on heading 4 is becoming untenable.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the abolition of the Development Council, such a budget would send a very bad signal. Another example is the negotiations which have just begun with a view to the signing of economic partnership agreements with our ACP partners. Considerable adjustment efforts are asked of them; that is a financial constraint which cannot be sustained by the ACP countries themselves or by the EDF, but which requires supplementary funds to be specially allocated by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to lend my support to my group’s proposal to create a specific heading for aid to Palestine. Some claim that the projects funded by the European Union should be abandoned, if they are destined to be systematically destroyed. Several months ago now, Commissioner Patten estimated the destruction of such infrastructures by the Israeli army at EUR 20 million. Nevertheless, the Union must certainly not give in to the law of the survival of the fittest and must act as required by law. That is what Commissioner Patten has constantly reiterated, calling for a serious and concerted effort required to reform and rebuild the Palestinian Authority, as the only viable interlocutor in future peace talks. This will be achieved through the political and budgetary transparency of this objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, I should like to concentrate on making a number of comments on the text that we have agreed with the Council on future cooperation in the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In future negotiations with the Council, the Committee on Budgets is proposing to introduce an institutional mechanism providing for greater parliamentary involvement before the Council makes decisions on foreign policy spending commitments. As you know, in recent years we have been repeatedly confronted with the problem – particularly because of the crises in the nineties – of the Council making spending pledges and then Parliament having to find emergency funds from somewhere by cutting the amounts allocated to other foreign policy priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we want to have a mechanism whereby the Council involves Parliament at an earlier stage, and here we are proposing firstly that Parliament be consulted when possible joint actions are being examined, if necessary on a confidential basis. Secondly, we are asking for Parliament to be informed by the chair or representative of the chair of the Political and Security Committee about any mandate and above all about the financial impact of a joint action. Thirdly, a joint work plan should be drawn up by the Commission and Parliament setting out priorities for the coming period.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an offer to the Council and only if the outcome is satisfactory will we authorise the funds for the policing mission in Bosnia at second reading. Initial indications are very positive and I believe that this is a very important step towards also subjecting the Common Foreign and Security Policy to parliamentary scrutiny in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Previous speakers have highlighted particular points and added new ones. I wish to do the same and highlight one small point, one that Mrs Buitenweg has already mentioned. My particular concern, as incidentally has been the case for some time now, is small and medium-sized enterprises and above all micro-enterprises. We cannot invent a new priority every financial year, so I am sticking to this one.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I will also repeat what many of you know, but it will not do any harm to remind you of it again: 99% of all companies in Europe have fewer than 50 employees. They employ more than half of all workers and are also responsible for around half of the European Union's entire turnover. On average each company employs five people. It is small and medium-sized enterprises that are very innovative and growth-driven. They therefore play a decisive role in the fight to increase jobs and reduce unemployment. That, for a social democrat, is what counts!</p>
<p class="contents">We are already doing a certain amount at European level to increase the competitiveness of SMEs; let me remind you of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship. However, we want to do even more. The project 'SMEs in border regions' should be replaced by a project on 'SMEs and enlargement' and – a number of social democrats have in any case spoken strongly in favour of this – we want a project that helps SMEs to implement the concept of 'Corporate Social Responsibility – a business contribution to sustainable development'. So far these proposals have tended to be directed more at the large companies. This comes as no surprise: after all they were involved in drafting them. We do not consider this to be wrong, far from it, but now we want them to be extended to include guidelines for our small and medium-sized companies. We want a pilot project on SMEs and social responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every year I am shocked at the huge amount of work they have to do. What are my general comments on the budget? It is widely known, also from previous years, that I am a great fan of carrying out what we have agreed as far as possible. We should thus remain committed to the financial perspectives. This year too, there are a number of budgetary items which go beyond these financial perspectives. This is particularly the case in category 4. We should, in my opinion, adopt a flexible stance for once. As far as the necessary expenditure for Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund is concerned, I believe we should use the flexibility instrument and confer with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Whenever I discuss the budget, I cannot help but mention agricultural spending. I have once again tabled a host of amendments, and I hope that if they are approved by the plenary, the Council will be prepared to adopt them. We currently have an FMD investigation committee, which has made a number of recommendations on which you will be able to vote later on this year. However, a number of things are already clear. It is unacceptable for us to slaughter animals on a large scale again in the future, as we have done in the past. This is why I have tabled amendments for developing better vaccines and better testing methods, distinguishing between infected animals and inoculated animals, and so on. Also, in my opinion – which is incidentally universally endorsed – agricultural production should focus on quality. The public, however, should know what quality is. Europe needs to develop its own quality system which is readily recognisable to its customers, and funding has been made available for this purpose, provided the system is effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the cost of controlling animal diseases, I believe that it is unacceptable for us to earmark a relatively small amount in the budget for this purpose every year, while every year it becomes apparent that if a real epidemic were to break out somewhere, it would cost billions. In my view, we need to develop European insurance systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have noticed that cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament has been good to date. I hope that this will continue to be the case in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Also the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terry Wynn, for the way he expedited the votes in some highly-charged discussions recently. It is good to get all the work through so rapidly, and I thank him for the way he did that.</p>
<p class="contents">My committee was mainly concerned with four areas. The first was OLAF, Europe's anti-fraud office. I believe that we have sorted out the problem all the parties in this House had in finding a suitable wording for an amendment about OLAF's funding for the coming year. But we still have concerns about the dialogue between the Commission and OLAF in the budget process. Realistically, I am particularly worried that it poses questions about OLAF's independence; it is part of the Commission in this process and we can amend its budget in that way.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area was export refunds, something on which Mr Mulder, the previous speaker, is an expert, as is Mr Casaca from the Socialist benches, and a subject I know very little about. I understand that they are relatively happy with the outcome of the amendments they tabled in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we were interested in the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, concerned about the valuation of the euro because so much could have been counterfeited. Perhaps we should have been more worried about the bizarre comments by the President of the Commission and tabled an amendment about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and more importantly, we were very concerned about the reform agenda within the Commission and that is why I draw the attention of Members across all the parties to the amendments to the Färm Report, especially in relation to Commission reform. The Commission's former chief accountant has drawn our attention to a number of concerns about the computer systems and how to ensure that our taxpayers' money, our national governments' money, is being spent correctly if the computer systems used do not support each other or provide proper figures.</p>
<p class="contents">No doubt we shall come back to this in future debates, but those were the main concerns raised by the Budgetary Control Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was the case and continues to be so where other areas as well as the Structural Funds are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We have received many comments on this issue, almost all of them expressive of indignation but hardly any of them proactive. However, a number of solutions have been put forward this, as in past years, including the placing of funds on reserve, and we heard this proposal reiterated just a few minutes ago. I believe that this particular medicine would do more harm than the illness, and so I feel that the right direction to take would be that of simplification.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been said that Commissioner Barnier has set a major project in motion in this field and involved Parliament. Proposals have been developed which, if implemented without delay, will make it possible to limit the loss<span class="bold"> </span>of<span class="bold"> </span>Structural Funds appropriations by Objective 1 regions. However, that is not enough: we need to streamline<span class="bold"> </span>the all too numerous bureaucratic elements and the endless succession of requests for documentation and controls, and we need a consolidation of funds which responds to the current situation through the integration of development measures. This is crucial for enlargement too. A stronger Union does not necessarily mean a more ineffective Union – quite the opposite: the simplicity of the rules and the application of the principle of subsidiarity will make the European budget a flexible political and accounting tool which is free from the burden of the RALs, and, most importantly, it will result in a closer, more intimate relationship between the European Union and the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is also true that the committee feels that the EU budget for 2003 is considerably more modest than it has been in recent years. As we all know, this is due to the fact that the considerable information initiatives financed by the EU budget ahead of the introduction of the single currency are now behind us. However, I will return to this issue in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee proposed a very modest number of amendments to the budget and I was greatly disappointed that these were almost entirely rejected by the Committee on Budgets. As I said, the requirements were very small and should have been acceptable, particularly in the case of the committee’s position and proposal regarding the PRINCE programme and in particular its sub-section B5-3061: information initiatives relating to the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">There was broad agreement within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that the information initiatives should be concentrated on those countries which have not yet introduced the single currency and, to a certain extent, also on candidate countries, which will introduce the single currency one day. The fact that this amendment was rejected becomes even more regrettable when we consider that at least one, and perhaps more, of the current Member States is highly likely to hold a referendum on the single currency next year. With this in mind, it seems logical that the funds should be earmarked for these countries, rather than being spent on information initiatives of questionable benefit in the countries which have already been highly successful in introducing the single currency. It is difficult for me to see what use information measures may have in these countries where the euro is already a reality and part of everyday life. As Wim Duisenberg, chairman of the European Central Bank, says, the Central Bank has never had any problem selling its product.</p>
<p class="contents">I share this view and believe that these measures can be taken by each country which has introduced the euro without any contribution from the EU budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are working to overcome the constraints of the Community budget as best we can and find the best possible arbitration. Having said that, I cannot prevent myself from thinking that we placed these constraints on ourselves. The now regular reduction in the Community budget as a percentage of GDP seems to me to be of particular concern. Once again, we do not appear to want to equip ourselves with the means to fulfil our ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation of heading 4 is a prime example of this. The Council, in the context of large multinational conferences, undertakes to support various very worthy causes: the reconstruction of Afghanistan, campaigns to fight AIDS, etc. Then, when it returns to Brussels, it does not seem to want to give us the means to keep its promises. We owe it to ourselves to remind the Member States of their duty to ensure coherence and, in particular, to fulfil our ambitions with regard to enlargement. More generally, I believe that the current Financial Perspective system has shown that it is no longer capable of fulfilling the needs of Europe. I would not like you to think, however, that our draft budget is bad. On the contrary, I believe that, in many areas, we have succeeded in making progress and finding compromises that are acceptable to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that, as regards heading 1, the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets clearly reflect our wish to make the common agricultural policy fairer, more just and more sustainable, and to strengthen its rural development pillar. The budget must first and foremost fulfil the citizens’ expectations. The amendments proposed by my group with regard to the ‘information and communication policy’ chapters are along these lines and are essential to the future of Europe. The same is true of support for small businesses and craft trades. As Mrs Haug stated in our various speeches, that must be a priority. Employment depends on it. These appropriations cannot be refused year upon year. I would nonetheless like to thank our two rapporteurs for having instigated new methods of budgetary debate, for greater transparency, because all this is indispensable with a view to increasing citizens’ awareness of European politics in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has managed to enshrine our desire for a WTO parliamentary assembly in the budget. This is, I believe, a historic act. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is deeply proud that this has been achieved, at least in this reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should also like to thank Mr Färm very much for his understanding of the problems facing small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly in border regions, where I believe that this initiative will be very well received and to which it will offer huge benefits for the future, particularly with a view to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I see a further problem. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy adopted the sixth framework programme of research unanimously. Since this was agreed with the Commission and the Council, however, a new problem has arisen. On the one hand, we have a development on Basle II that poses a serious threat to the creditworthiness of small and medium-sized enterprises, and at the same time enlargement is imminent and the economy is currently in a very poor state.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Walter has already said, quite rightly, that we need to strike a balance and that at present things are out of balance. We are losing revenue. So, what do we need to do to improve tax revenue? We need to prevent even more companies from going bankrupt because bankruptcies threaten to cause a huge increase in unemployment. This trend could be exacerbated if we do not prepare for the introduction of Basel II in good time. I myself am an economist, but I believe that the sixth framework programme really does need a Basle II-related research priority – creditworthiness for small and medium-sized enterprises. I would strongly urge Mr Färm to support us on this important matter, because we need new instruments so as to continue to guarantee the stability of Europe, and what we need is a stability pact for SMEs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Incidentally, we held a very extensive debate yesterday on the issue of the three percent, and Mr Prodi should, in my view, simply advise all countries to adopt the EU’s budgetary system, for if they were to do this, they would never suffer any shortages again and always have surpluses. This is the problem we are facing: the system is such that surpluses always arise. Countries can easily adopt this system, but the only problem is, of course, that certain wishes cannot be met. The system is ruthless and we have to live with it.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we have come up with a number of sound solutions to make the system more workable than it has been in the past. After all, we can protest loudly at a lack of funding, but if you consider what is returned to the Member States, then this always strikes me as a little strange. We should do something about this. This has also been laid down in the interinstitutional agreement, and this should also be taken into consideration. We must simply be able to manage the funding we have at the moment better and not commit everything without giving it a moment’s consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We are reasonably pleased with the outcome of, and particularly with the project on, mobility for the elderly which was included in this budget at the instigation of Mr Podestà. I am unhappy about one point, namely the way in which foundations – and I am mainly referring to the foundation in Dublin – are being treated. If the costs in one country rise faster than in the rest of the EU, there is a certain rule in the Community that provides for this. This is the way it is. It is impossible for the Committee on Budgets, and especially the person responsible in the Committee on Budgets, to say in such cases: 'Oh no, this does not concern us at all; we simply do not give this money; they will have to draw on their own reserves'. These reserves do not exist, which is just as well. This is only a minor point and I do not want to spend too much time talking about it, but it is still important that we do something about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the whole Parliament – not just the Committee on Development and Cooperation – has been clear that development is a political priority overall in this year's EU budget, with support for the global fund against AIDS, TB and malaria.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council in its May resolution says it is committed. The Commission says it wants to retain its board seat. Yet the EUR 120 million contribution last year is reduced to a proposal of just EUR 35 million for next. No, Parliament does not want the European Union to provide the minimum possible. It recognises that AIDS/HIV is the most serious challenge to humankind today; that the United Nations has declared at least 7 billion is needed worldwide; and that proposals amounting to 5 billion have already been tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">The global fund represents a bold new approach – fast-moving, participatory and accountable.

We call for an appropriate sum for cancer equipment in the Republic of Belarus, which is still significantly affected by the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in adjacent Ukraine. Up to 23% of its territory was contaminated; about 2 million people – including 500 000 children – live in the radioactively contaminated areas. The sickness rate in the contaminated areas has grown dramatically. For instance, the number of children under the age of 18 suffering from thyroid cancer is 50 times higher now than before the accident. Among the adult population, the growth of the number of thyroid-gland cases has increased fivefold.</p>
<p class="contents">The most effective method of controlling these tumours is high-dose-rate brachytherapy, which minimises exposure to radiation of healthy organs and tissues during radiation treatment of malignant growth. High-dose-rate brachytherapy requires high-tech equipment and, due to the high acquisition and maintenance costs of this equipment, Belarus needs assistance.

Secondly, I also wish to express our serious concern about the disbursement of funds from the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We got off to a very slow start in 2000, for which the Member States were mainly to blame and the same applied in 2001. We know that the Commission is trying to do something about this and that Commissioner Barnier has tried to do something about this, especially with his recent communication and the meetings he has been holding with Ministers from the Member States. However, the Member States must do what they can. Someone commented, and I entirely agree, that the situation is worse in the rich Member States than in the poor. So they must do what they can to ensure funds are disbursed quickly and, of course, the Commission must monitor developments closely so that we can put a stop to this problem because, if things go on as they are, I am afraid that, in the end, a big chunk of Structural Fund resources will go to waste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Regrettably, three of the committee's amendments that I consider to be important were rejected or altered. They are being put to the vote again in the plenary. They concern firstly cooperation with third countries on migration. Here we want the commitments to be increased by a further EUR 5 million. I am convinced that the only way to improve the situation is to step up cooperation and that means more funds from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, they concern the European Refugee Fund. I do not think that I need to dwell on this as the issues are actually already well known. The third point is the Celex budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the situation has changed immeasurably since the attacks on the USA, we have done a great deal without demanding a dramatic increase in expenditure. I therefore think that all of our demands – these three points – are justified and would ask you to bear this in mind when you vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just ask to look through the stubs on their chequebook or the entries on their credit card account and you will find out. This afternoon we are actually looking through the stubs of the Commission's chequebook and what do we discover? EUR 2.4 billion spent on olives but EUR 240 million on the Socrates Education Programme for the European Union. As budget rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, I cannot but help notice that we spend one tenth of the money on education that we spend on olives.</p>
<p class="contents">On information for enlargement, the Commission proposed EUR 14 million in the budget – a good sum you might think, until you see that the subsidy proposed for bee keeping was EUR 16.5 million. I am not criticising support for bee-keeping, but I think that this Parliament was right to increase the amount that the Commission wanted for information on enlargement from EUR 14 million to EUR 21 million.</p>
<p class="contents">If people in the candidate countries and the existing countries do not understand enlargement, then we shall only have repeats of the problems that we experienced in Ireland. On that EUR 21 million, the Budgets Committee accepted the proposal from the Committee on Culture that EUR 1 million should be set aside for training future MEPs from the candidate countries. We had the President of Hungary here this morning, which shows that clearly politicians from the candidate countries are looking forward to joining this Parliament and they need training to be able to do that properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that we have been able, if this budget is now passed, to reinstate the amount of money for <span class="italic">e</span>-learning, namely EUR 17 million as opposed to the Commission's proposal of EUR 9 million.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just that our budgetary priorities are wrong, the system is also wrong. I will pay tribute to the support we have had from the budget rapporteur this year and from the Commission, but the Council is absent this afternoon. It has been absent from discussions with the committees looking at the proposed budget. It really should be ashamed of its position in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that these diseases create enormous difficulties and problems for millions of people and that years of development work are quickly eroded due to these diseases causing so much sickness and death.</p>
<p class="contents">As long ago as in the 1990s it was possible to make forecasts, particularly regarding the spread of HIV, suggesting that in certain cases up to 25% of the adult population in some countries would be infected. These forecasts were dismissed. I must say that both the international community, including donor countries and individual countries in the South, took these problems far too lightly. Until very recently, the Commission has also done very little within the framework of its aid. As we now have a new directive on how these issues are to be handled, and particularly as we are increasing the budget, there is now an opportunity for us take on much greater responsibility on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to stress the importance of us ensuring that the global fund which has just been set up has enough money so that the EU and Europe are able to have a proper and stable influence on this work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These amendments, Commissioner, pertained to three areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The first group of amendments related to violence against women, including genital mutilation, rape, the stoning of women etc., in a large number of countries worldwide. We have for the first time included a clause in the budget that stipulates that the aid we provide to a number of countries can be suspended if they fail to respect women’s rights. I welcome this and thank the Committee on Budgets. This is the first area that has been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">A second area is about women and decision-making. In many Member States, a great deal of progress has been made in the field of political decision-making by women. Trade unions and employers, however, have done very little to promote the presence of women in their organisations. This is nonetheless necessary, for trade unions and employers have more or less acquired the status of legislator in a large number of Member States: agreements concluded by them have the force of law. They have thus acquired a great deal of power but have not made as much effort to bring women to the fore as our national parliaments and our national political parties have. This amendment has also been adopted, for which I thank the Committee on Budgets. An amendment that has not been adopted – and I will call on the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou in this connection – is the amendment on more flexible standards for the financing of projects intended for women. The standards are very high at the moment. Many women’s organisations are unable to comply with them. This is the only amendment that has not been adopted. I should nevertheless like to express my thanks on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
