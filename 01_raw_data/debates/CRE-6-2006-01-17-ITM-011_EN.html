<p class="contents">Gas imported from Russia accounts for over one quarter of that consumed in the European Union, and, since up to 80% of that is transported via Ukraine, the uninterrupted and continuous supply of gas from Russia via Ukraine to the European Union is absolutely vital to households and businesses. The fact is, though, that there was up to a 50% shortfall in supply in some EU Member States on the first and second days of January this year. A diplomatic initiative on the part of the Commission and the Austrian Presidency of the Council helped to put a speedy end to this situation. This leads me on to mention Moldova and Russia, and to ask both of them to return to the negotiating table in search of a longer-term solution to the problems existing between them. It appears from reports in the media that an agreement has been reached for a period of three months, but that is certainly a very short-term solution.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters now is that we learn the right lessons from what has happened. As I see it, there are three things we need to do if Europe’s supply of natural gas is to be secure in the long term, and I shall now set out what they are.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is a need for diversification in the sources from which natural gas is supplied and the routes by which it is transported. Plans are in hand for a series of new pipelines with the capacity to transport a total of 140 billion cubic metres per annum, and these must be built without delay. One project that looks likely to be successful is the ‘Nabucco’ pipeline, 3 300 km long and running from Austria to the area around the Caspian Sea via Turkey, which, when finally completed in around 2020, will be able to transport up to 31 billion cubic metres of natural gas along a new route into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to push forward the use of liquefied natural gas. The current capacity of existing facilities amounts to some 60 billion cubic metres per annum. Projects are up and running in certain countries to establish new terminals or extend existing plant. It is to be expected that capacity will increase to 160 billion cubic metres per annum by 2010. The European Union should aim for a five-fold increase in the quantity of LNG that it imports by 2010, which will enable it to receive supplies from other regions not capable of being connected to the EU by means of a pipeline.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, thirdly, a need for greater transparency on the hydrocarbon markets in order to make prices less volatile and to ensure stable prices that reflect the market, while also improving the quality of information on the quantities of natural gas imported, and in this a considerable level of investment is essential. It is crucial that there should be as inviting a prospect as possible for investment in energy if businesses are to be prepared to actually make these investments at all.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short term, we will have to give consideration to how we avoid situations of this sort coming about, or how we can deal with them without fallout. One option, to be sure, is greater integration of the supply network in the European Union, which would have the effect of simplifying the exchange of gas within the Community, thus reducing the dependency of individual Member States on certain states by which gas is supplied or through which it has to pass. Having more gas traded within the Community does, of course, presuppose the availability of gas in the necessary quantities and that is why we also have to work at supporting the establishment of liquid wholesale markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Another short-term instrument is without doubt the storage of gas reserves to bridge the gap when supplies are interrupted for up to two months, although account will need to be taken of specific national requirements, such as whether to use geological voids, power stations or industrial premises for storage purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Austrian Presidency will give priority to energy policy and in particular to secure energy supplies. Security of supply, alongside competitiveness and of course sustainability, is one of the pillars on which European energy policy reposes, both at national and at Community level. Europe must redouble its efforts to be equal to the challenges presented by energy policy, for by 2030 the world will be using 50% more energy and Europe will become even more markedly dependent on the importation of fossil energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">All things considered, if we want to guarantee the European public and industry a secure supply of energy, we will have to opt for an approach that incorporates various strategies. Within the European Community, we will have to further diversify energy supply by making more use of renewable energy sources, which may entail a three-fold increase in the use of biomass by 2010. European energy supply is to be founded, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, on the cost-effective use of renewable energies. Other options for Europe will include the use of coal with clean technologies and, in the long term, of hydrogen.</p>
<p class="contents">The Austrian view, however, is that the use of nuclear energy is not an option. Where supply is concerned, it will be necessary to press on with our efforts to create a European single internal market and increase investments in energy supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to consumption, on the other hand, energy efficiency in the Community needs to be improved. There are at present great disparities between the Member States in terms of energy efficiency, defined as energy consumption per unit of the gross domestic product. As our basis for this, we can take the agreement between Parliament and the Council on the directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services.</p>
<p class="contents">What happened at New Year also showed how important are the European Union’s relations with its partners. These partnerships need to be sustained consistently both at multilateral level – whether through the dialogues in the International Energy Forum or under the energy treaty with South-Eastern Europe – and at bilateral level as part of the EU’s dialogues with Russia and the OPEC. Willingness to cooperate is an absolutely essential element in securing energy supply.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, then, a multiplicity of options available to us. It is for us to make effective and speedy use of them. As securing the European Union’s future energy supply is in the interests of all Member States, I am convinced that we will succeed in doing that.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andris Piebalgs, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament for finding time today to debate the security of energy supplies and particularly gas. In a way, it is a continuation of the debate we had on high oil prices last year. The current price of oil is more than USD 60 per barrel.</p>
<p class="contents">The gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia triggered the debate on the security of supply to the European Union. The gas dispute hit the headlines at the beginning of this year when Russia stopped its supply to Ukraine for a day and a half. That also had an impact on the EU through a reduction in the amount of gas reaching the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is reassuring in the short term that an agreement was reached between Ukraine and Russia, we must be under no illusions. The issue has not gone away. Commercial negotiations between the two sides will continue in order to find a price adjustment formula that is mutually acceptable. We have also seen the repercussions internally in Ukraine, with the vote of no confidence in the government last week. Nor must we forget that the gas price dispute between Russia and Moldova was resolved only yesterday, with more detailed negotiations in the near future. I firmly believe that everyone needs to learn the lessons from the events at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what are the lessons the EU should draw from this dispute? Firstly, in the context of this particular dispute, the EU was, and should be, proactive. We not only maintained close bilateral contacts with both parties throughout the dispute but also urged them to resolve this dispute. While it is evident that the EU could not and should not take sides, we made it clear to both sides that it was in their strong interest to come to an agreement rapidly. In such a situation it is very important to have close cooperation between the Council – in particular the Presidency – and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the dispute has underlined the usefulness of the energy dialogues with Russia and Ukraine. Those dialogues have provided us with the contacts necessary to impress our concerns and views upon both parties in a framework of mutual trust and common interest. At the same time, it clearly underlines the need to give greater momentum to dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this dispute has underlined the importance of and the need for a clearer, more cohesive and proactive EU-wide energy security policy. While it is true that the Commission and Parliament have argued for this for many years, the time is now right to make real progress on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress the importance of developing a common approach to energy, which was highlighted at the Hampton Court informal summit and in the meeting between the Presidency and the Commission at the start of the Austrian Presidency. In his speech today, the President-in-Office clearly indicated the importance the Presidency attaches to this particular issue and that many concrete and clear proposals have been made.</p>
<p class="contents">During the crisis we witnessed a certain lack of transparency in the European gas market that has made it quite challenging to monitor and assess accurately how this shortfall was being handled. The 2004 directive concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supplies, once fully transposed, should assist. Addressing those kinds of issues is one of the objectives of the energy market observation system which is under development in my services.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, this incident has thrown into sharp focus our increasing dependency on external energy supply. The necessity of adopting and developing a common EU approach will be addressed in a green paper on energy policy that the Commission is currently preparing. Clearly, the development of a common approach to the external energy dimension will be a fundamental element in the green paper.</p>
<p class="contents">This external energy dimension should be based on a diversification of different energies, as well as on different energy sources, routes, suppliers and transit networks. There is a clear need for more investment in LNG terminals, in gas pipelines for diversification of supplies and gas storage facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">While the EU has been engaged, via its technical assistance programmes, in promoting the development of new supply routes, and upgrading and enhancing existing routes, it is clear that other major energy consumers also take a very proactive and political approach to this issue. Europe will have to learn some lessons here, although one should not underestimate the complexity of this task.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also, of course, the internal aspects of an EU energy policy to consider: firstly, the need to ensure that an internal EU-wide energy market is a practical reality. There is still some way to go to achieve a real internal market in both electricity and gas. Then there is the need to facilitate the necessary infrastructure investments required to ensure that the various national energy markets in the EU can really become more integrated. Here it is important for us all to recognise that this calls for the necessary means also to be provided including, where necessary, financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to ensure that sufficient policy and financial support is given to research in priority areas and to ensure that more efficient energy technologies, including cleaner coal and renewable energy technologies, can penetrate the market. We need more actively to pursue policies and measures that can achieve real energy savings and efficient use of energy and thus diminish our external dependency.</p>
<p class="contents">We have adopted ambitious legislation. Now it is time to implement it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need to improve energy security measures to enhance the solidarity mechanisms to face the challenges of possible disruptions to energy supplies. One should keep in mind that this particular dispute, as it affected the EU, was resolved in a very short time, but we must be prepared for longer-lasting disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, this dispute has again been a real wake-up call for us all. While it is true that energy is just a commodity, it is a commodity that is fundamental for our continued economic development and wellbeing. We must learn the lessons from this episode, which I will sum up as a need for a common European energy policy. This policy needs to be clear, coherent and effective both internally and externally, corresponding to the goals of security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability.</p>

The PPE-DE Group welcomes the fact that the security of energy supply and sustainability of energy production and consumption are one of the Austrian Presidency’s priorities. It is high time, since energy security is becoming increasingly important for the overall security of the European Union, and especially its economic security.</p>
<p class="contents">Any difficulty, even temporary, that has the effect of reducing supplies of energy from third states also causes serious disturbances in the economic activity of the Union. We were recently made aware of how the problem of energy security does not solely concern the areas of industry or economics. Energy has been used as a weapon and foreign policy instrument, and hence should be discussed in the context of foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent energy crisis between Russia and Ukraine has exposed the vulnerability of many Member States of the European Union that are to a dangerous extent dependent on one supplier. It is absolutely essential, therefore, for the EU to extend joint action to the energy field and take steps to create a proactive energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that all the efforts taken at national level are not sufficient as they do not guarantee the long-term interests of the Union as a whole. Action at EU level is therefore clearly justified, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. Moreover, if we treat the idea of a common market seriously, we should endow economic operators, not to mention citizens, with equality in energy security and supply.</p>
<p class="contents">In this light we assess very positively the Presidency’s plans to finalise the decision on the trans-European energy network early this year. We should, however, move beyond that. One of the main principles of European integration – that of solidarity – encompasses the obligation to assist all those States that are in danger or in difficulty, and that includes problems relating to energy supply shortages. The Union should take concrete steps towards the diversification of energy sources and supply and the sharing of reserves. All potential avenues for enhancing the Union’s energy self-sufficiency should be explored.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor should we forget the principles of transparency and equal access. The EU should propose a code of conduct on relations with its main energy suppliers. We should make all the necessary efforts to establish new sources of financing for all the undertakings aimed at increasing the EU’s energy security, both from the EIB and from the EU budget itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not just think about ourselves. Energy security should constitute one of the cornerstones of the Neighbourhood Policy. Reality calls for courage. Close cooperation in the energy field and the possibility of sharing energy reserves constitute one of the most effective and indispensable confidence-building measures both within the Union and between the Union and its neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="contents">Our citizens will appreciate the tangible results of our actions to secure energy supplies. The PPE-DE Group will be tabling a resolution on this for the next part-session in Brussels.</p>

<p class="contents">For a start, the big consumers – the EU, the USA, China and India – must do more to have a joint effect on the market, rather than only competing against one another for energy supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should turn our attention to infrastructure, and give thought – not as a state, but with our firms and businesses – to having the infrastructure owned and managed on a common basis, so as to avoid monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have to do something about the situation in which the WTO has procedures for settling disputes on everything from textiles to shrimps, but not on products as important as gas and oil.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we need to develop the infrastructure, one example being the Nabucco project, to which the Minister referred, which is very important and which the European Union should support.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, all the Member States must diversify and come up with proposals on the basis of which a single European project can come into being.</p>
<p class="contents">My sixth point is that renewable resources must, of course, be given priority. I share the President-in-Office’s scepticism about nuclear power, but the debate will go ahead and we have to ensure that it takes into account all the positive aspects and points of criticism and does not leave out the issue of how to dispose of the waste.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly cannot – and this is my seventh point – insist on a single energy policy with every country; only by taking national differences into account can we – particularly in the eyes of the outside world – justify a single energy policy. You, Commissioner, will recall how, at the hearing, I asked you for a programme that combined energy policy and foreign policy. I made the same request of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, but nothing, unfortunately, has as yet been forthcoming. I really would press you to put forward such a programme as a matter of urgency, in the Green Paper at the latest, so that we will have a consistent policy that we can defend to the wider world.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by making it quite clear that, while we want – and need – partnership with Russia, its latest actions are unacceptable. We need Russia to treat its neighbours fairly, for they are our neighbours too.</p>

<p class="contents">EU Member States assure their energy resources by concluding bilateral agreements. Russia is taking advantage of such agreements, including the forthcoming German-Russian gas pipeline, and is dividing the European Union by providing individual Member States with different degrees of access to energy supplies. Individual countries are easier to influence than the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">By constantly emphasising the importance of Russia as a strategic partner and its exceptional position among other countries, the European Union is granting Russia concessions. The main reason for such concessions is the growing dependency of the EU on Russia in terms of energy. However, the recent issues with gas supply between Russia and Ukraine show that Russia may resort to the same tactics in supplying gas to European Union Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The alternative sources of energy which must be used in order to avoid absolute dependency on Russia, that is, Norwegian gas resources, are limited and will not be able to meet the growing demands of the EU economy in the future. Is this, then, not the right time to reconsider nuclear energy, the most ecological form of energy, as an alternative to dependency on the unpredictable supply of energy from Russia?</p>
<p class="contents">Another very important issue being widely discussed in the EU is common energy policy. With the European Commission as the energy supply partner representing the interests of all 25 Member States, Russia would have to show more respect. Russia will not be able to completely cut off the supply of gas to the EU; it would simply not have any other way to dispose of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I invite everyone not only to discuss the development of a common energy policy, but also to take actions to develop the common energy policy and, in particular, a single energy system without delay, thus ensuring energy as well as political security for the entire EU.</p>

Ukraine, and later Moldova, found themselves in a situation that had been brought to the point of crisis, but Europe did not. Europe was able, as it has been before, to rely on stable trading relations with Russia. As I see it, what this situation has shown us was that we in the European Union cannot regard Ukraine as nothing more than a safe transit country, but must rather, by means of energy policy, help it to free itself from dependence on Russia and thereby improve its prospects for the future. A great deal of change is needed here.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from that, I see this whole debate as an object lesson in the weaknesses of European energy policy, which are more or less marked from one Member State to another. A coordinated approach could, without a doubt, help to improve the situation in the Member States and across Europe. We have now learned the real value of natural resources. It has to be said that we right across Europe, are, to say the least, wasteful in our use of gas, and of oil too, and this was the subject of more vigorous debate at the time of the Iraq war. For some considerable time, our squandering of these raw materials has been something we have not been able to get away with. If we want to learn the right lessons from this, then we must, I believe, be much more consistent in doing as Commissioner Piebalgs suggested at the time he took office. We have to pursue natural resource productivity and energy efficiency if we are to be less dependent on others; I would be dead against striving for a fully self-sufficient Europe, which would be a naive approach in terms of the overall debate, but we do have to work towards a Europe that makes adequate use of raw materials. This is something we have been talking about for decades, for as long as there has been a Club of Rome, so let us at last come up with something of some practical use. Let those who think that the use of nuclear power is the right response to the reduced – or indeed finite – supply of gas, just for once put forward a serious case for their chosen approach; how many reactors do they want to build over the next few years, and where? What do they propose to do with the waste that has been produced in Europe for decades? A few weeks ago, we debated the report on the decommissioning of power reactors. Right now, the whole business of nuclear waste disposal is a disaster area. If that is to be the shape of the future, then I urge them to make their case in clearer terms, but please can they spare us a debate on lifetime extension of the sort that is resuming even on the subject of the reactor at Ignalina? If you really do want to do no more than extend the working life of superannuated technology, then you are increasing the risks inherent in energy production rather than delivering us from them.</p>

It is estimated that in 2030 humankind will still be producing 80% of its energy using fossilised fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">The earth has a confirmed 179 trillion cubic metres of gas deposits. A quarter of the gas is in Russia, and another quarter in regions less stable, in Iran and Qatar. It can be estimated that at present consumption rates the EU’s own supplies of gas will be enough for just six or seven years. The use of Norwegian and North African gas for the EU’s needs increases the time perspective for gas consumption by 20 years, but it is 50 years in the case of Russia. If the EU is planning to satisfy the entire growth in its energy requirements in the next few decades by means of gas, there are no alternatives to imports from Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The next few years will see the development of cheaper methods in the liquefaction of gas, which will allow for a wider range of possibilities in importing gas. At the same time it will also make them narrower in scope. Liquefied Russian gas can then be sold to the United States of America, which needs gas, without the need for a pipeline. America’s own gas reserves will not be enough for even 10 years. Western Europe has been dependent on the gas pipeline that comes from Russia via other countries. The planned pipeline at the bottom of the Baltic Sea will reduce this dependence. The project is understandable, because some of the countries the pipeline now passes through are hostile towards Russia. We in Finland have not had the slightest problem with the gas supply in 40 years.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something in the gas agreement between Russia and Ukraine that needs explaining. Who owns the supply company Ros-Ukr-Energo? On the basis of published data, I have worked out that it unaccountably benefits from the agreement to the tune of USD 600–800 million a year. The oligarchs in both countries have been involved in this, and what is the role of these countries’ presidents in generating huge sums of hidden profit?</p>

The Member States expect the Community to provide them with assistance in finding a solution to this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community should pursue a cohesive and integrated policy on the above-mentioned supply networks, as well as on natural disasters, pandemics and the terrorist threat. Such a policy would make it possible to safeguard the security and diversification of supplies. It is unacceptable for one Member State, Germany for example, to form a coalition with Russia on such matters, since this harms the interests of other Member States, including those that only recently joined the EU. This is one of the rare instances when the European Union should respond, and when it should respond promptly and decisively. A passive attitude on the part of the EU means that it consents to the principle of solidarity being destroyed, and that effectively it has no influence when it comes to the economic and political problems that are of real importance for Europe. That being so, there is no reason why the Union should not go on issuing meaningless resolutions and statements or directives that work to the detriment of Europe’s citizens.</p>

The recent gas crisis is a test of sorts for the European Union. Its effects were intended to be felt, and indeed were felt not only by Ukraine and Moldova, but also by eight EU Member States, including Germany, France and Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">By provoking such a crisis, Russia has forfeited its status as a stable and reliable partner. The only question that remains is what conclusions will be drawn by the European Union and the individual Member States. Will they decide that the construction of the Baltic pipeline should continue, although it will make Europe even more dependent on Russia, or will they realise that what is needed is a genuine diversification of gas supplies for Europe as a whole and a system of energy solidarity for EU Member States and their immediate neighbours?</p>
<p class="contents">Russia hopes we will draw the first of these conclusions. All those who no longer harbour any illusions about the new Russia’s imperial policies hope for the second. I shall take the liberty of making one final comment namely that the House’s difficulty in adopting a common resolution on this matter is an embarrassment for Parliament.</p>

Current international political events and also economic factors, including the constant increase in the price of oil, are forcing the European Union to sit up and take notice of a situation that is both obvious and familiar: we have a structural energy supply problem and an increasing level of dependence. World demand for energy is rising, global resources are not limitless and, in any case, our Union does not have enough to meet its own needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events have shown how the energy supplies on which our economy is currently based can be put in jeopardy, and that is a risk that we absolutely must not take. It is essential to promote a closer international synergy, including through signed agreements such as the European Energy Charter, which creates a cooperation framework between Europe, Russia and Mediterranean countries. Energy cooperation with third countries is, in fact, a core element in the European supply strategy and helps to consolidate stable international political relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, clear, well-defined, concrete, lasting agreements must now be made, particularly with Russia. It is now urgent, therefore, for Member States to put into practice the recent recommendations on implementing energy saving measures, which will require a serious commitment on the part of the EU institutions, the Member States and every individual citizen. Furthermore, we must at last hold that complex and comprehensive debate on choosing technologies for the future and on the production and use of alternative and renewable energies. Despite the various crises, some of them recent, that have marked Europe’s economy over the last 40 years, this debate has, unfortunately, not yet been held. This is a delay, a failing and a gap that we must try to make up for as quickly and as urgently as possible.</p>

<p class="contents">This situation between Russia and Ukraine has served as a wake-up call to those who may not have been aware how dependent the EU Member States are on imported fuels in general and on natural gas from Russia in particular. However, it is important that we retain a sense of proportion about this matter. The trade in gas between Russia and EU Member States remains commercially viable just as long as each has something the other wants. The import dependence of the EU Member States and the related increasing dependence on natural gas is hardly a secret.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy have long been aware of this situation and have been debating the need for measures to address this dependence. Ten years ago, I submitted a report to Parliament on prospects for gas supply in Europe and was criticised by the industry for suggesting that we could become over-dependent on gas if it provided over 25% of our energy requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind the House of the wide range of measures that are already in hand which address our security of supply needs: both legislative measures, such as the TENs Directive, and actions by the industry in building pipelines, storage and LNG facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take note of Russia as it flexes its muscles internationally, but I suggest that a measured, practical approach to maintaining diversity of supply and encouraging appropriate investments to that end must be our response as a long-term solution.</p>

That is quite an achievement. The amount of gas used by the Member States and stocks vary greatly; in other words, the degree to which one is susceptible to a crisis varies very much. The further east a Member State is, the more dependent it will be on gas from Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has put pressure on Russia to abandon the practice of the dual pricing of energy, including gas, which goes on inside the country. We regard it as a condition of WTO membership. I therefore do not believe that the dual pricing of energy can last very long in Russia’s foreign trade either. Of course, in business deals it is permitted to grant discounts to good, regular customers in general, and that happens in many other sectors, but it obviously depends on the relationship between the seller and the buyer.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning off the gas tap was certainly the wrong solution and a very unwise one. Such things are not done in European trading; it does not go on very much in less significant areas, let alone in such major contexts. The situation with regard to energy in the European Union is continually on the verge of a crisis. It only takes a storm on the other side of the ocean or the Ukrainian event to start a crisis or even a panic. We must have viable and diverse energy sources quickly, with a wide range of supply arrangements and networks of conveyance, and time is of the essence: our bedrooms could get cold at any time.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need the Commission to produce an energy crisis programme. The resources that we now have are not sufficient. How are we preparing for a longer cut in the power supply, Commissioner? What kind of solidarity mechanisms could enter the framework, and does the forthcoming Green Paper deal with energy crisis issues? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will provide not only enormous opportunities for the European energy industry, including renewables, but also a window of opportunity for tackling climate change, boosting growth and creating new jobs. In order to achieve this we want more transparency, better regulation, a renovated and functioning grid, a European energy strategy, debate on self-sufficiency and solidarity between Member States, and rules that enable consumers to decide on their own consumption in a workable way.

<p class="contents">While one can debate the point to one’s heart’s content, the dispute between Russia and Ukraine was, at the end of the day, one between a supplier who wanted more money, and a customer who was unwilling to pay up. Both sides in the dispute had known that for ages. If, so to speak, a political course is set that makes this sort of crisis inevitable, without the attempt being made to find a solution in good time, then both governments have been negligent.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I do indeed welcome the Commissioner’s announcement that a Green Paper will be appearing, I do of course hope that it will not contain such old ideas as the negotiation of codes of conduct for the countries by which energy is produced and those through which it passes, new pipelines or even nuclear power. Rather, I believe that we have to rely, as is already being done in many countries, on other sources, such as biomass, the sun, wind, water, geothermal energy and cogeneration, while also, at the same time, saving energy, making more efficient use of it, and reducing subsidies for long-established fossil fuels. That is something we have to bring about.</p>
<p class="contents">The supply of energy is a service of public general interest, and we ought perhaps to consider whether responsible policies ought not to be regarded as a higher priority than attempts at liberalisation or the use of liberalisation measures as a solution to this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the reasons why oil prices have tripled is that the EU has failed to adopt an intelligent energy strategy. The rise in oil prices works to the advantage of the large fuel companies, but it works to the disadvantage of the EU Member States and of the citizens of these Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a mistake for individual Member States to attempt to reach an agreement with Russia, as Germany has done, sacrificing the interests of the Baltic States, Poland, Austria and other Member States in the process. Along with the EU’s passive attitude, this has encouraged Russia to blackmail Ukraine by threatening to cut off gas supplies. There is an urgent need for the EU to draft and implement an energy security strategy as soon as possible, and indeed this can be viewed as a test of the extent to which the European Union is still a community.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s energy security strategy should be based on the criteria of the weakest link, which can be summarised as follows. The efficiency of a system can be measured by its resistance to crises in those countries and regions which are most dependent on one supplier, or which have the worst transmission and distribution systems, or the highest generation costs in relation to national income.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern should focus in particular on neighbouring and transit countries. To echo Hamlet, ‘to be or not to be’ is the dilemma we face with regard to energy security in the EU. In this context, I regret to say that no provision whatsoever has been made for a common European energy security strategy in the EU’s 2007-2013 budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Christmas greeting from the Russian President to gas consumers in Ukraine was in no way a surprise. With its interruption to the gas supply in the very middle of winter, Russia reminded not only Ukraine but also the world’s energy markets, that power currently lies with energy suppliers. Energy consumers will have to take this into account for an unforeseeably long time. I would like to express my gratitude to Commissioner Piebalgs, who during the Russia-Ukraine gas crisis made use of the European Union’s influence early enough to prevent an energy crisis in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the conclusions to be drawn following the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute, the European Union must itself display and must ask the other countries in Europe for total openness regarding information about developments in gas prices. I believe that recent events give the Commission special authorisation to implement the legislation that has been passed, to implement decisions for the acquisition of alternative, energy-efficient resources and the creation of a truly liberalised energy market, and to secure the integration of European energy networks. Naturally, today almost all the speakers have mentioned this point: the need for a genuinely common energy policy for the European Union’s common market, which would facilitate long-term political stability not only in Europe but also in the global energy market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is largely because, to date, even at time of intense internal upheaval, Russia had always shown itself to be a reliable energy partner, and at no point in the past have the Member States of the Union seen their supply of gas interrupted or reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Those three days of crisis were sufficient to bring countries such as Italy to the point of releasing their strategic reserves and, above all, for the Union as a whole to realise once again that its supply system is extremely vulnerable. The time has therefore come to consider seriously the possibility of investing in alternative supply routes, improving dialogue with stable partners, such as the Republic of Kazakhstan, for example. We must begin to think about importing gas from that country via Turkey, for example, which is a candidate country and hence an extremely secure one.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must maintain and enhance, at European level, research and development in new energy sources and achieve more efficient use of those we already have. Naturally, Mrs Harms, we cannot ignore any primary energy source. Not one. We must look beyond ideological preconceptions and face reality. If you want to commit energy suicide, you are free to do so, but your sacrifice must be an individual one. Do not expect us all to commit suicide against our will.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I shall end by calling upon the Commission to carry on putting pressure on the Member States to create a common energy policy, and this crisis has shown us beyond any doubt that we need one. Let us not wait until there is another crisis and then take measures that are more drastic and that may well be too late. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My concern is that attention be called to the foreign policy aspects of what we have witnessed in recent weeks, when Russia threatened to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">This did not come as a total surprise to those who, like me, have worked with those countries for many years. After all, Russia has previously threatened to use energy as a weapon with a view to exerting political pressure on its immediate neighbours and has even, if you ask me, done so on one occasion. Obviously, the outcome of what happened also came as a shock to the European Union and forces us to have this discussion today.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, I will keep it brief. There are three conclusions that are important for us where those foreign aspects are concerned. Firstly, we should diversify our supplies, our sources. Given that most of the countries from which we get our energy are unstable, the more countries we can use as sources the better.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must reconsider the pipeline situation in Europe. We are particularly vulnerable since most gas is supplied via Ukraine. Are there any possible alternatives?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must make it absolutely clear that in the longer term, we can safeguard our energy supply only if we can join forces with partners who are reliable and democratic.</p>

First of all, the European Union must promote the more efficient use of energy in its external policy by making this one of the priorities of the EU’s Neighbourhood Programme. It may even be worthwhile to establish the criteria for the energy efficiency as a condition for the provision of European Union support. In so doing, we will also facilitate democratisation processes in the neighbouring countries; our experience with reforms in Lithuania shows that modernisation of the economy provides the stable background needed for the development of democratic processes.</p>
<p class="contents">In European domestic policy, greater attention should be paid to the development and implementation of an innovation centre dedicated to the new generation of small-scale energy plants based on nuclear and other technologies. We already have a successful aviation project, the remarkable Galileo programme; therefore, we can no doubt also have an innovation centre for the implementation of energy programmes. Such a centre could operate in countries with the greatest dependency on a single source of energy.</p>

On the contrary, it is a consistent policy and has everything to do with politics. First, Ukraine had a contract, signed in 2004 and lasting until 2009. It was terminated because Ukraine elected the wrong president and because of forthcoming parliamentary elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the Russian Government is the majority shareholder in Gazprom, a monopoly headed by the deputy prime minister. It is not a company. One cannot speak of market prices and a government-controlled monopoly in the same breath.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the one-off issue: Moscow stopped oil and gas deliveries to stymie Lithuania’s independence movement way back in 1990. After independence, the Russian Government used the same weapon to punish the Baltic States for not joining the CIS and for demanding the removal of Russian troops. When Lithuania tried to privatise the Mazeikiu oil refinery, again supplies were cut off so that Russian investors could move in. It successfully followed the same policy when it came to Georgia, which gave up its gas pipelines.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Russia has consistently used a government-owned monopolistic energy company to put political pressure on countries – market practices and existing contracts be damned. Empiricism is wiser than wishful thinking. The experiences of the new Member States, and of Ukraine and Moldova when they adopted a pro-EU stance, clearly show the dangers of lacking a robust EU policy on energy security.</p>

In the absence of sufficient information, we refrained from apportioning blame in any way and did not want under any circumstances whatever to express agreement with any one party to this dispute or even to betray the least hint of it. What is clear is that the situation could very well become critical, for one new Member State had problems with the energy supply to its industry from day one, but we and the Commission are deliberately not talking in terms of a critical situation rather than of a crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not lose sight of the fact that dependence on fossil energy sources and on imports thereof cannot do other than markedly increase; the Commission estimates that the proportion of our energy that we derive from these sources will, by 2030, increase from just under 50% – which is what it is at present – to something like two-thirds. It will be possible to influence this to some degree by the use of renewable energy sources and by improving energy efficiency, but I do not myself take the view that we can bring about any fundamental about-turn in this trend. The presidency looks forward with great interest to the Green Paper, or rather to the appearance of the first parts of it in time for the Spring Summit. When, if not now, are we to discuss the development of a common European energy policy? What prompts us to go further down this road is the gas issue, Russia, Ukraine, and the problem of supply, as well as oil prices, climate change and many other considerations too.</p>
<p class="contents">Both I personally, and the presidency as a whole, endorse the Commission’s proposal for the creation of a two-month reserve similar to that which already exists at another level for oil. Your House will have an opportunity to discuss the details of this later on. As I said in my statement on Moldova, we have sought in many respects to give priority to that country in our neighbourhood policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite Mr Swoboda’s assertion that having Russia as a member of the WTO would open up certain possibilities in this respect, even then, it would be possible to do but little within the space of 36 hours. What is interesting is that Russia has not ratified the Energy Charter, and so there can be no recourse to the dispute resolution procedure for which it provides. It is, then, energy efficiency that must quite clearly be given priority, along with renewable energies and the fostering of the awareness that we must, in various ways, and to an even greater extent than before, address the issue of gas imports.</p>
<p class="contents">It remains for me to observe that, over the coming years and decades, Russia and Russian natural gas will become the backbone of the European Union’s gas supply. Speaking as an Austrian, I would like to point out that it was an Austrian company, OMV, that was, in 1968, the first to conclude a supply contract with Gasprom, which has been absolutely reliable for nearly forty years. We need to win trust, and perhaps, to some extent, to rebuild it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already, in my speech, discussed the alternative route in the shape of the ‘Nabucco’ pipeline through Turkey. Absolutely necessary though it is to diversify supply, this cannot be accomplished overnight; we must learn our lessons from the critical situation that lasted for 36 hours. With this in mind, I am grateful to your House for this very important debate and will close by highlighting the importance that we attach to this chapter as an item on the agenda for the Spring Summit in March.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andris Piebalgs, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span>Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Parliament for this debate, which clearly indicates there is general support for developments towards a common EU energy policy that respects subsidiarity. It is interesting that the first calls for such vital developments were made 30 years ago, during the first oil crisis. At that time, for obvious reasons, they came not from Parliament but from the Council. The situation today is definitely more complex than it was then, and will probably have longer-lasting consequences in the energy area than was the case 30 years ago. Given these circumstances, the Council, the Commission and Parliament must act.</p>
<p class="contents">On the security dimension, I would like to mention two particular aspects. Firstly, enlargement definitely brought new challenges for the European Union. Security of supply was certainly a far bigger challenge for the new Member States than for the older Member States. Secondly, the paper we are preparing at this stage has two authors: Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and myself. Therefore, the issues that Mr Swoboda raised will be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">We also look into action at times of crisis. As I mentioned, this crisis was very short and some speakers referred to it as a mini- or even non-existent crisis. One should not underestimate the importance of the situation, because some countries did feel an impact. In most countries, the only impact felt by citizens was a media one. However, in some countries economic measures were taken in respect of the supply of gas. It was a real crisis and we should look at how we could react more effectively in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we should act immediately. We already have a lot of instruments that could be applied vigorously. On energy efficiency, we have a building directive entering into force which should be applied vigorously. The same applies to combined heat and power, and renewable energies: we have legal instruments and we should apply them. The same is true for renewable energy. The Commission will do everything possible. It is already taking positive steps, such as trying to mobilise all possible resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the New Neighbourhood countries, with which we have very good relations. Unfortunately, it is true that energy issues have been neglected. A memorandum of understanding with Ukraine on the implementation of energy policy was signed only this year during the summit. Therefore, we really need to help not only to deal with external supply issues but also with energy consumption, because the energy intensity in those countries, and energy losses, are tremendous, and no country could bear the energy costs arising from that situation. The same applies to Moldova.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has done a good job in Ukraine, but it could intensify its activities. We could draw on other resources to strengthen these and harness New Neighbourhood instruments for strengthening policies. We will do this, and do the same as regards development policy, because otherwise there can be no solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank you once again for this debate. I am sure that this will not be the last time we debate these issues, and I draw a lot of inspiration from such debates.</p>
