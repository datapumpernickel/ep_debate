However, as chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, I would like to say that I do not consider Amendments Nos 2 and 25 to be admissible, pursuant to Rule 125 of our Rules of Procedure. In my view, these two amendments aim to replace at least two, if not three, paragraphs of the resolution presented to us and, as a result, I do not believe that they are admissible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that Parliament is not doing itself any great favours by seeking to push its Rules of Procedure to their limits in order to fulfil political objectives. Having said that, I am completely in favour of a statute for Members of the European Parliament and believe that it should be introduced as soon as possible, but not by means of a violation of Parliament"s procedures and of our Rules of Procedure.</p>

<p class="contents">I also want to raise another point of order. I have the official voting list at hand. I see that on paragraph 1 you want to begin with Amendment No 2. Let me point out that my group tabled an Amendment No 27 to delete paragraph 1. There can hardly be an amendment that departs further from the text than one that deletes a paragraph. So I would ask you to begin by voting on Amendment No 27.</p>

So everyone will naturally know what they will have to vote on later. This is not a matter of judging votes in advance; we are trying to comply with the Rules of Procedure. And in my view, an amendment that seeks to delete a paragraph always departs further from the text than an amendment that seeks to replace it. As a result, as the rapporteur said, we will vote firstly on Amendment No 27, which seeks to delete the paragraph from the rapporteur"s resolution. I am very sorry, but I must comply with the Rules. We are therefore going to begin with the vote on Amendment No 27. Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very long vote ahead of us and we must get through it peacefully. We are not going to open a debate on the Rules now. Once again, I am sorry, but we must proceed with the vote.</p>

However, we will not take part in the vote on the amendments for a fundamental legal reason: we are national Members representing 15 different nations, not a single European nation.

My first report in this House concerned the basis of Europe"s development policy towards Asia and Latin America. In that report, or in the Commission"s proposal, there was no mention of women, displaced persons and certainly not the environment. None of this was there. The words simply did not appear in the text. Today they lie at the very heart of Europe"s development policy. We have just voted on my latest report in which we introduce a budget heading for environmental policy in the context of development policy. I should like to thank all my colleagues for the way we have been able to work together over the past 10 years.</p>

<p class="contents">I simply want to tell him, on behalf of the French Socialists, that we voted in favour of his appointment today by a large majority. However, I would like to remind him that we are committed to a Europe of the heart, a Europe of solidarity, and not a Europe of markets alone. We have already experimented with the formulas of a lesser role for the state and the blind belief that the rules of competition or liberalisation generate employment. We no longer believe in them. We know that to create jobs again we will need further growth and growth that will actually generate employment. And we would call on Mr Prodi to present us with proposals in that direction. Equally, in terms of a social Europe, our people would not understand why no progress was being made.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one final comment, Madam President. At a time when a war is breaking out in our continent, we do not understand how religious diversity is not respected. As far as we are concerned, the principle of secularism is a founding principle of our Union. Non‐discrimination as regards religion has been enshrined in our Treaty. We will judge Mr Prodi on his respect for this commitment.</p>

His speech before Parliament was marked by the most traditional form of liberalism; it was dull and lacking in any vision for the future. There is nothing in his statements that refers clearly to the need to defend and update the European social model. There is nothing about the need for a new pact that balances the forces of labour and the holders of capital. There is nothing about the redistribution of wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">The social Europe does not concern him. But it does concern millions of Europeans. He is not proposing any serious strategy to promote employment, preferring to suggest that we simply follow the same monetarist macro‐economic policy we have been following for years, a policy that has proved ineffective in terms of establishing sustainable growth and significantly reducing unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">He made a long plea regarding the need to continue with deregulation and the liberalisation of all sectors of the economy. I did not hear him defending general interest services or public services. In short, his commitments have very little to do with the hopes and expectations of the people, who have demonstrated their desire for change and elected Socialist or Social Democrat governments in most of our countries. Mr Prodi is telling them that tomorrow will be just like yesterday. We cannot accept that.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also surprised to see Mr Prodi making an explicit reference to Christian values as a form of heritage that should be defended in Europe. Of course, I am not raising any objections to these values, nor am I denying Mr Prodi his freedom of conscience, but I support the principle of secularism – which rightly guarantees this fundamental liberty everywhere and for everyone – and I therefore expect a President of the Commission to uphold this principle. But I have my doubts about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi has the right to be a Christian Democrat, but I expect the European Union, where most of the governments are left‐wing, to be led by someone who is likely to embody these ideals and these policies. That does not seem to be the case.</p>

This is a war in Europe initiated and conducted in violation of every principle of international law, in contempt of the United Nations. The Treaty establishing the Atlantic Alliance states that it is a defensive organisation, but NATO"s war in Yugoslavia actually perverts the nature of that vocation.</p>
<p class="contents">So a dark and bloody conflict has broken out on our continent, and now no one is in any position to predict the outcome or calculate the consequences for the future of our European peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">By calling for an the immediate end to the ethnic massacres and the bombing, in the name of the ‘European soul", President‐designate Romano Prodi could have taken an influential and balanced role, decisive for the future work of the Commission. He did not do so, he identified himself with the interventionists, and lost a precious and long‐awaited opportunity.</p>

Unfortunately, I was not mistaken then, as events have now demonstrated.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the political will indicated by Mr Prodi to reestablish the balance between the institutions will bear fruit so that the Commission can reassume its essential political driving role as a body independent of the national governments and private interests. To do this, the European Parliament must also fulfil its role in order to avoid the return to an intergovernmental Europe with a ‘governing body" consisting of the large Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must indicate my extreme surprise and condemnation of the way in which Mr Prodi, on page 11 of the verbatim report of proceedings, characterised the European consciousness, which is at the root of the integration achieved in the last 50 years. He described this as being exclusively ‘<span class="italic">erede della cultura umanística e della cultura cristiana</span> " meaning that it has its origins in humanism and Christianity. This characterisation diminishes the origins of European civilisation by specifically disregarding the contribution of the Jewish and Muslim cultures. The use of the term ‘<span class="italic">cristiana</span> " or ‘Christian" is not only an unacceptable falsification of history but also, given the current events in Europe, an unpardonable political error.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, you appeared as the saviour of a foundering institution, as the person who could provide the charisma needed for the job. But your obviously strong personality cannot be separated from the objective of your politics. Moreover, having listened to your comments and to your programme, I am extremely concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning of my term in office, I have fought to change the prevailing philosophy within the Brussels executive. I have fought to ensure that the liberal Europe, the Europe of markets, gave way to a social Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">After listening to you yesterday, I am disappointed that not a single reference was made to the social Europe. There was not a word about the concept of public services; instead, we listened to a eulogy to economic liberalism.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, you refuse to distinguish between the market‐based Europe and the social Europe. But you must be aware that our people cannot support the European idea if the only option available is a market where the role of the individual is obsolete.</p>
<p class="contents">You will have the difficult task of establishing Europe in a new millennium, and I cannot get used to the idea that the twenty‐first century might represent a negation of the social Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">You succeeded in the formidable task of enabling your country to join the euro. I hoped that, with your appointment, you would establish the proper social dimension that Europe requires. I did not hear this in your speech and you have disappointed me.

<p class="contents">Mr Prodi has not been sufficiently convincing in his acknowledgement of the need for a social Europe. All we have heard is that tired old tune about full liberalisation and more growth being the solution to Europe's problems. He has not voiced the desire to make active use of the new provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty with regard to the environment or employment. Mr Prodi's future plans for the development of Europe also go too far in a federal direction. Amongst other things, he is seeking to extend European cooperation in the fields of defence and foreign affairs. His ambitions in the sphere of equal opportunities have unfortunately also been non‐existent. Mr Prodi has not outlined any plans for greater equality between men and women either within the college of Commissioners or in the Directorates‐General.</p>
<p class="contents">Romano Prodi's ambitions in the human and social sectors are therefore too slight to persuade me to vote in favour of his nomination.</p>

I warned him about accepting the best and the worst in terms of the heads of the various departments; unfortunately, the worst prevailed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi"s speech could not have been more disappointing. He talked to us for a long time about the Europe of money. He did not say a word about the Europe of people. He did not provide us with any hope that we might be able to put an end to the new world order imposed by the Yankees. There was no condemnation, or even regret, in relation to the unacceptable military attack against a European nation by a NATO that is blindly killing women and children.</p>

His appearance in the European Parliament was not enough to reassure me that he would be the right person to lead the Commission during the next five‐year term. Mr Prodi"s bottom line is the formation of a Federal Europe, which is difficult for me to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Most worrying of all when Mr Prodi was here in Parliament were his ideas on employment, the regulation of the labour market and the public sector. He repeatedly stressed the need to deregulate the labour market and to increase the practice of bilateral agreements between employers and workers. He considered the public sector to be too large in scale and called for rationalisation and cost‐cutting measures. Meanwhile, he had nothing more than pious messages of hope for increased employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi sets great store by a common defence policy for Europe. He failed to give adequate guarantees that non‐aligned EU Member States would be able to remain outside the military alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I did not consider I could vote against his appointment, as that would mean a serious delay in appointing the new Commission. With the situation as it is, it is important that the new Commission should begin work as soon as possible.</p>

Due to their style and beliefs, other people were better qualified to preside over the Commission. However, his experience in Italian politics, his acknowledged personal and political integrity and his capacity for establishing dialogue and unity are basic virtues which can breathe life into the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">Through his speeches in Parliament, he has gradually outlined his beliefs on Europe. These contain many positive aspects, particularly the desire to guarantee the independence of the Commission and to carry out a root‐and‐branch reform of its administrative practices. We would also highlight the importance which Mr Prodi has placed on Mediterranean policies, which he regards as being just as important as enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, his will to help make the European economy more dynamic and reduce unemployment and, essentially for us, the defence of economic and social cohesion. We note, however, that the social side was virtually totally absent from his speeches, which is worrying. Overall, there are reasons why we have high expectations of the new Commission President and this is why we are voting in favour of his appointment. We now hope that our expectations can be reinforced and that Mr Prodi can be the President the Commission needs following the period of weakness we have seen with Mr Santer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese Socialists support a strong Commission which is capable of mobilising the will of the European people and which respects these people and their legitimate interests, particularly in small countries such as Portugal. We also demand an independent Commission which, within the structure of the Community institutions, can contribute to achieving a balance between all the Member States, whether small or large and whether in the south or north of Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">However, his speech yesterday worried me and I have now decided to abstain. Parliament, and in particular my group, the Socialist Group, has often highlighted the need to balance the economic and monetary pillar with a social pillar and a firm commitment to a political Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">Romano Prodi has indicated that he is in favour of the EU developing on federal lines into a kind of United States of Europe. He has repeatedly stressed the need for a common defence and hence the militarisation of the EU. In his address and in answers to questions, it is noticeable that he has often compared the EU to the USA, with a view to establishing a ‘balance over the Atlantic'. We are opposed to the development of an ‘EU state' and believe that European cooperation should, for the most part, be based on intergovernmental cooperation between independent nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The appointment of the President of the Commission and the Commission provides us with a good opportunity to carry out reforms which would reinforce democracy in Europe. The EU should have a modern administration and transparent legislation along the lines of the Nordic model. This would mean open Council meetings and public access to official records, whereby everyone would be entitled to examine public documents and records in all the EU institutions and to speak out freely, in other words to be able to inform the media and those outside the EU institutions about mistakes and wrong‐doing in the administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, reforms to increase openness should be extended to the system of appointments in the EU institutions. An appointment should only be made following an application and on the basis of qualifications, not political patronage. All employees should be aware that proficiency and merit, not friendship and connections, are the requirements for being appointed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should be decentralised in order to allow staff to exercise responsibility and authority. The concentration of responsibility in the hands of a minority should be broken. Staff reforms should be carried out in order to weed out EU privileges. It is indefensible that an employee in the EU earns three times as much for doing the same job as he or she would in a Member State, and enjoys diplomatic status with immunity from punishment and other fringe benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">The salary of the President of the Commission should also have been reduced before an appointment was made. Commissioners should receive the same salary as ministers in the country which they represent. Moving expenses should be paid on the basis of an estimate and not in the form of two months' additional salary of around SEK 360 000.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should concentrate on the big issues, distinguish between what is trivial and what is important, and carry out genuine decentralising reforms which would result in matters that should not be dealt with at EU level being handed back to the Member States. All these reform proposals should be implemented, but no such promise has been given.</p>
<p class="contents">Our vision is one of free European people in a democratic and diverse Europe. We do not want a United States of Europe, but a Europe of nations.</p>

He did not say a word about social dialogue, about public services or about the need to establish the core of fundamental social rights we require to prevent relocations through fiscal dumping. The fact that Mr Prodi was actually nominated by 11 Socialist or Social Democrat governments proves that the social Europe is not the priority and that the liberal approach has not been discarded.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I am convinced that the rights of the people of Europe will only improve if we build a strong, political Europe based on the principle of secularism. To achieve this, we must reopen the divide between the right and the left, turn Parliament into a truly political body and stop looking for consensus, as the governments did when nominating Mr Prodi. That is why I am opposed to his nomination as head of the Commission.</p>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, apart from some general statements and the promise of rigorous and transparent management, his speech gave me greater cause for concern than for anything else.</p>
<p class="contents">After Jacques Delors and the very liberal Commissioner, Mr Bangemann, he in turn is conforming to the myth of the overriding power of the Internet and information highways and is promising us paradise through the fact that ‘we can bridge the gap between us and the United States".</p>
<p class="contents">To respond to these global challenges, we must inevitably ‘reform the welfare model" and ‘review ... the rules governing labour markets and professional markets to lower the barriers preventing access and ... make the employment situation more responsive to economic growth".</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, as Mr Prodi goes on to tell us, this will only happen if we can ‘make public administrations lighter of touch". In spite of the first stinging failure of the MAI, Mr Prodi himself is taking up Commissioner Brittan"s ideology: ‘The EU should continue along the path of multilateral liberalisation within the World Trade Organisation. Our aim is to prevent all attempts at protectionism ...". Following the example of the United States, will the future Commission look on our social and environmental clauses as protectionist? It is vital to include them in our trade mechanisms to ensure that globalisation is based on cooperation and solidarity with the poorest regions and countries.</p>
<p class="contents">But the final blow to a progressive European project is perhaps his idea of European culture: he seems to consider this in terms of the past and believes it to be our only heritage. For the future, he turns to ‘the power of American culture", which ‘in the broad sense and as expressed in symbolic form by the media is actually believed by some to be capable of acting as a single point of reference for a Europe in quest of its soul. There is nothing discreditable about such a supposition ..." In other words, just a few months before the WTO negotiations, Mr Prodi"s Europe is surrendering before having even waged the political war.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberal European hymn sung by Romano Prodi is based on the flexibility and adaptability of work, mistrust of public services and allegiance to American culture.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, I voted against his appointment as President of the Commission.</p>

Nonetheless, some general ideas need to be explained in detail so as to avoid ambiguities in the institutions" interpretation of them. I fully agree that we need to define the political and administrative responsibilities of the European Commission. The Commission should review its files, where it would find questions and motions for resolutions that I tabled proposing that rules for legislative procedures and for administrative justice be drawn up in order to define responsibilities and provide our citizens with legal certainty. In the doctrinal tradition of national democracies, the responsibilities of the government and the administration are clearly defined.</p>
<p class="contents">Another fundamental issue is that of preserving the overall responsibility of the College of Commissioners. The individual responsibilities of the Commissioners can and must be defined, yet we must not entirely discard the principle of collective responsibility. To accept the individual condemnation of a Commissioner would mean the death of the independence of the European Commission. I have also on various occasions defended the need for the Commissioners to meticulously respect their ethical commitment to maintain the necessary independence from their governments. The Commissioners must oversee the EU"s common interest; they must not use their post first and foremost to defend their country of origin. Nationalist statements by Commissioners should be dealt with by the President, who should ask them to leave the Commission. In the same way, the Commissioners" private offices must have a supranational structure, as I have maintained for years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must also resist the destructive urge to try to represent the main political trend in the European Parliament, even though some prominent figures may promote it. This would disrupt the nature of the institutions. The European Parliament has no reason to support the European Commission because of its political stance. Compared to national parliaments, the great asset and advantage of the European Parliament is that we are all part of the opposition here. No political group is obliged to keep the Commission in office. The legislative arm must have complete freedom to monitor the executive arm. In addition to this, the Commission should not in any way relinquish its power to initiate legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, I am a committed federalist, and I have every confidence that your future activities will continue to enhance the unique nature of the EU institutions and prevent it from being interfered with.</p>

As a democrat I have to accept the result of the vote on the Rothley report even if I do not agree with it. As a parliamentarian I have to accept that we use procedures sometimes as a way of either promoting or shielding ourselves from particular votes.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to express my deep sense of disappointment that yesterday, at an early stage, when my group presented to other group presidents the possibility of trying to find a reasonable way forward, whereby the Council would meet tonight and then, tomorrow, we could decide on the issue in a more definitive way, some colleagues used procedures in this House to block that possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I express in particular my grave disappointment at Amendment No 27 in the name of Mrs Green and Mr Cot, who removed Article 1 from the Rothley report and <span class="italic">ipso facto</span> removed from it the possibility of the Liberal amendment. That amendment genuinely sought to address many of the fears that Members had expressed as deficiencies in the Council's response. For example, it put MEPs on an equal footing with national parliamentary representatives in the matter of various allowances and expenses. It included clauses on the acquired rights, the so‐called ‘grandfather clause". It included options for early retirement, which many Members said they wanted. It included the full protection of the acquired pension rights, the existing pension rights of Members, and other elements as well. In all of that it was a genuine attempt to recognise that the Rothley report <span class="italic">simpliciter</span> of last December clearly will not win unanimous approval of the Council; that the Council's text of last week clearly will not win the support of this House. And this <span class="italic">via media</span> which we sought to bring forward – and as democrats we have to accept the win or loss – was blown out of the water by a procedure which disgusts me.</p>

We believed at the time, and we still believe, that the Members of the European Parliament represent their respective nations and that they should continue to have the status of national representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 3 December, the Council has examined Parliament"s draft and has unfortunately approved its key principles. In its view, the Members of the European Parliament should from now on be paid out of the Community budget and not by their countries of origin. Moreover, they should pay income tax to the Communities, under the same conditions as those that apply to European officials. Only a temporary derogation is provided for to maintain the national system of taxation for those countries which request it explicitly.</p>
<p class="contents">This amended draft is equally unacceptable. It is totally incredible that the Members of the European Parliament might be paid by someone other than the people they represent. It is equally incredible that they might be subject to a tax system that is different from that of their fellow citizens, particularly if this is also a less severe tax system, as would be the case here. This reform is obviously designed to draw Members away from defending their people in order to encourage them to defend the supranational system that will support them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is somewhat difficult to understand the deep‐rooted motives of the Council when it accepts a text that is so opposed to the interests of the Member States, unless it, too, agrees tacitly to the establishment of a European superstate. This interpretation unfortunately seems to be correct, as it is backed up by many other indications. Once again, we see that the governments are playing a double game and establishing – by indirect methods – a system that the people would not accept if they were consulted in full knowledge of the facts.</p>

I voted against Mr Rothley"s proposal because I am sorry we did not accept the Council document, which meant that we missed a major opportunity finally to obtain a statute at the end of this legislative term. You all know how difficult it will be to make progress on a statute during the new term. It will be wellnigh impossible. I fear that Parliament"s action has merely relegated the Statute to a kind of shunting yard. I thought it was right for us finally to get some movement into the Statute, and the words ‘equal pay for all" apply just as much to the Council; its members also do the same work but have different salaries. There are hundreds of journalists who do the same work for different pay.</p>
<p class="contents">I regarded the compromise as viable even if – which is not, of course, a good thing – it would have meant that Swedish, Danish and British Members were taxed under their national rules. But I got the impression that was not the issue at all; rather it was to go on relegating the Statute for Members to the shunting yard. I very much regretted that.

Although many people have expressed their disgust, I do not know how we are going to go back to the electorate and justify that basically things are remaining the same. The Liberal and Green amendment was deliberately sabotaged by people who do not want to see the system changed. Although I would have had major problems with the idea of an EU tax system – it is not something I could support – or that our salaries would be increased, we need to deal with the way in which expenses are dished out in this Parliament. What is wrong with having a system whereby you have to account for what you spend? We now have to go out in June to look for votes from the electorate. The one thing that everybody is focused on is how the repayment system works in this Parliament. We have to look for change. Today was a prime opportunity. We missed that because of political manoeuvring within Parliament. It is going to very difficult for us to justify our position. That is why I voted against the Rothley report. I would have had major problems with a salary increase or with the idea of an EU‐wide tax system. That is the thin edge of the wedge. I do not agree with a harmonised tax system or with – as Mr Berthu said – many of the harmonisations that are going on within the EU.</p>

I did vote against the Rothley report because I take the view that, with all its faults, we should have accepted the proposed Statute for Members that came from the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I take that view with some regret because Mr Rothley is a very distinguished Member of this Parliament who has contributed a great deal to its work. In general I am always very sympathetic to the idea that Parliament should defend its rights and its position <span class="italic">vis‐à‐vis</span> other institutions. But on this occasion, particularly in view of the coming election, I took the view that it was better for us to get this matter behind us. I have always taken the view that Parliament must rigorously and ruthlessly defend its constitutional and legal rights. When, however, it is a question of its own personal rights, the rights of its Members – particularly the financial rights of its Members – Parliament would be well advised to tread more softly. There is a difference between the two. If I had to be asked what Parliament needs, I do not think it is more formal powers, I think it is to come closer to the minds, hearts and spirits of the electorate. I am afraid the postponement of the Statute may stand in the way of that.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that you, Madam President, have a different view. I am sorry, on this last occasion, to have to differ. I have always had great respect, both political and personal, for you. But unlike many who voted against the Rothley report I did so because I believe the European Parliament should be more powerful, more influential, should play a larger role in the European Union. It was my view that by voting against the Rothley report I could serve that political goal.</p>

<p class="contents">On a personal note, regarding the Rothley report, I would like to say that the truth has been revealed. The majority of Members of this House – 376 Members – have shown that in actual fact they did not want the system for reimbursing travel expenses to be changed. That is what is at issue here.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution adopted on 3 December stated that thanks to the Treaty of Amsterdam, for the first time in its history the European Parliament was in a position to adopt itself a single statute for Members, and that this statute should enter into force as soon as the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam provided a legal basis for its adoption. This gave the impression that we were prepared to adopt a statute.</p>
<p class="contents">However, given the rejection today of our Amendment No 18, which stated that we would do our utmost to ensure that this statute entered into force at the beginning of the next parliamentary term, Parliament is showing its true colours, and on the very day and in the very week when a new system for the reimbursement of travel expenses is being adopted, a system which is supposedly based on expenses actually incurred but is actually somewhat similar to a lump‐sum system.</p>

We have pressed for a transparent system of payments for travel expenses, an equal salary for MEPs from all countries, and a proper method of direct payments for staff.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has said that it will look at the detail of implementation of the Statute alongside Parliament and we look forward to playing an active role in those further negotiations over the new few weeks.</p>

This majority, which invoked all sorts of legal arguments, was concerned first and foremost with maintaining our salaries and privileges at all costs.

As the only Swedish member of the committee, I was closely involved, over a six‐month period, in following and contributing to the discussions, in particular through the tabling of an amendment reflecting the Greens' viewpoint. This expressed our opposition to the detachment of MEPs from their own voters and Member States by such things as the introduction of EU salaries, EU taxes, EU pensions and so on. I do not think, therefore, that it is desirable to have a statute which regulates these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we need to tackle the excessively generous allowances, for example those covering travel and office expenses, and to introduce a system whereby only the costs actually incurred are reimbursed. Under the Rules of Procedure, this can be done at any time and without the introduction of a statute. It is therefore unacceptable that Parliament has hitherto done nothing about it, since it would have been a simple matter – had the will existed. In view of these considerations, I voted against the report.</p>

The remuneration and taxation of MEPs is therefore a national affair. We are consequently opposed to a uniform European statute on Members" remuneration. We advocate that the current remuneration and reimbursement system should be discontinued, since it means that Members of this Parliament are paid large sums in expenses which have not been incurred. It is therefore necessary to establish a new system of remuneration and reimbursement, whereby the reimbursement of expenses must be accompanied by a bill, and payment is dependent on the Member signing a declaration that the expenses have actually been incurred in connection with the exercise of their mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">On 26 April 1999, the Council drew up a draft Statute based on the European Parliament's text. In this draft, the Council sets out a series of proposals regarding the Statute, stating amongst other things that the payment of reimbursements will be based on vouchers, and proposals are also made regarding the establishment of conditions of employment for assistants. We believe that the Council's text is a distinct improvement on the European Parliament's draft Statute, which was adopted on 3 December 1998. We shall therefore support those parts of the draft which tighten up the current arrangements for reimbursement and lay down proper conditions of employment for assistants. We wish to emphasise, however, that Members' salaries must be taxed at national level, and the revenues must therefore go to the Member States. We are opposed to an EU tax system, and we therefore cannot support the Council's ‘should" clause in Article 8(6), which states that the revenues should be paid back into the EU's budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the adoption of the Statute is yet another step towards a United States of Europe, with the European Parliament as a co‐legislator. Mr Rothley's draft report shows this quite plainly, and it is a clear example of how far removed the European Parliament has become from the interests of the people. The only reason why we can support parts of the draft for the new Statute is that we believe that it is a vital step towards remedying the European Parliament's long‐standing squandering of our taxpayers' money.</p>

Article 190(5) of the Treaty establishing the European Community gives Parliament the power to ‘lay down" this statute.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of our Spanish, Portuguese and other colleagues are in favour of this, not only for ideological reasons, but also perhaps for the sake of convenience. In fact, on the basis of national statutes, there was discrimination between the German Members, whose thriving economy allowed them to receive substantial allowances, and our Portuguese colleagues, whose moderate economy meant that they only received moderate allowances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Members of the National Front in the European Parliament are opposed to this European Statute for legal reasons which serve to nullify it.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the Parliament in Strasbourg are, in fact, the representatives of 15 different nations; they are not the elected representatives of a European nation. They represent the 15 national sovereignties and not a European sovereignty. Furthermore, the European Parliament"s legal basis originates in an international treaty and not in an internal legislative text. It is an intergovernmental institution and organisation, not an institution that is based on a constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Our legal status is therefore international rather than constitutional. That is why the Statute for Members is a political strike against the legal texts on which Parliament is based. It is the first element of a European federal constitution and it is being introduced in a surreptitious and clandestine manner. And that is the last straw as far as a parliament is concerned. A parliament represents the people. Yet here the European Parliament is progressively imposing on them a federal constitution within its powers while the people"s backs are turned.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all the more serious since if national Members were paid out of the European budget from now on and paid taxes into that budget, they would no longer have any financial or fiscal links with their people. How then would the Members of the European Parliament be able to represent their country of origin when their links with it are being gradually weakened?</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, we already have the European currency, and tomorrow it will be the European state.</p>

We would have liked to see the guarantee extended for up to five years; that would have meant that the principle of sustainability was finally also introduced <span class="italic">de facto</span> . It would have meant that producers would have tried to produce long‐life products. What I very much regret about the compromise is the fact that when the directives are implemented it will now be possible for the Member States to introduce a two‐month complaint period. And I will be calling on the German Government not to make use of this; indeed it has already announced that. It would be a bitter setback for consumer protection. For how can it be that someone from France, for instance, goes shopping in Germany, relies on a two‐year guarantee but then finds that because he bought the goods in Germany he should have lodged a complaint within two months?</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that is what we were aiming at with this report. Indeed Mrs Kuhn is just as sorry about this provision. Yet the report is a small step in the right direction. I only hope that many Member States will not make use of the possibility that has now been established of a two‐month complaint period. If they do not, the report will be a step in the right direction because it will mean that consumers can have the guarantee extended to two years. I believe it is very positive that we have also managed for the first time to establish a one‐year guarantee for second‐hand goods; that is a step towards greater sustainability and greater consumer protection. However, I hope that also means that we do not apply this two‐month complaint period, because in the case of many goods defects are only found after two months have elapsed. Then consumers would get little out of this two‐year guarantee. So I can only appeal for this not to be applied.</p>

I believe that a directive on the subject can be justified if it brings real benefits to consumers who buy goods across borders – but this directive does not do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the directive fails to deal satisfactorily with the situation where a consumer buys goods in one country, then goes home and finds that they are defective. In that situation he or she still has to return them to the place where the original purchase took place in order to obtain a refund, repair etc. It would have been far better – and have brought real benefits to consumers – if the consumer had the right to negotiate such compensation/repair etc with a representative of the company – where one exists – in his country of residence. As it is, the directive deals with this problem only through the hope, expressed in preamble 13, that producers of consumer goods marketed in several Member States will attach contact addresses in those states; there is also the prospect of future revision of the directive held out in preamble 20. The directive may well therefore raise hopes of cross‐border consumer rights that it does not fulfil.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem with the directive is the way that it deals with second‐hand goods. Article 1, paragraph 3, allows Member States to exempt second‐hand goods sold at auction where consumers have the opportunity of attending the sale in person. But preamble paragraph 16 is very confusing: it says that the nature of second‐hand goods makes it generally impossible to replace them, so that the consumer's right of replacement is generally not available for these goods. It goes on to say that for such goods Member States ‘may enable the parties to agree to a shortened period of liability", that is shorter than 2 years.</p>
<p class="contents">I take this to mean that second‐hand goods, except those sold at auction, <span class="italic">are</span> covered by the directive, and that some form of consumer guarantee <span class="italic">will</span> have to apply to them although Member States may make it last for less than 2 years. I wonder whether the Council has appreciated the impact of this on the second‐hand market? What haggles will now take place over the ‘shortened period of liability"? Will this kind of haggle add a new dimension to car boot sales (which are not auctions) with lawyers setting up their tables at such sales in order to resolve disputes? If the consumer's right to repair etc is not ‘generally available" in relation to second‐hand goods, will each Member State specify where it is available? If so, we will see 15 different systems springing up.</p>
<p class="contents">I await these developments with interest, but cannot give the directive my support as it stands and have therefore abstained in the final vote approving the text.</p>

One of the major achievements of the European Union has been the creation of a single market in Europe encompassing over 370 million people. As a result, businesses, employees and consumers from my own constituency in the North West benefit from a market over eight times larger than the UK alone. A bigger market generates more business and more business generates more jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers benefit from more choice and more price competition. However, I want to ensure that when my constituents take advantage of the single market and buy abroad, they enjoy the same level of consumer protection as they have in Britain. I want them to have the same right to repair, replacement, reduction or refund in Milan as they have in Manchester. In short, I want to make cross‐border shoppers contented border shoppers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Labour Government has long been committed to more information for consumers, so that they can make informed choices about the products they buy, and the right to redress in case anything goes wrong. Under the British presidency, for example, we pushed through a long‐awaited agreement on consumer guarantees establishing rights for consumers when they buy goods anywhere in the single market. This is in stark contrast to the Tories, who, during the BSE crisis, brought the EU to a halt rather than provide proper protection for consumers.</p>

That is not just a great success for consumer protection but also a major contribution towards a more ecological agricultural policy. Of course it was also a major success on balance for our group, since the Greens" amendment was the only one to obtain an absolute majority and therefore led the Commission as also the Council to shift their position. The decision to establish the precautionary principle here is groundbreaking and in our view it would now be sensible to extend it to cover schoolchildren and young people. It also means that we have to radically rethink the concept of the average individual, for this principle is based on the assumption that harmful substances are measured against an average human being weighing 80 kg. That certainly cannot protect the health of children, the frail and the old.</p>
<p class="contents">We are particularly glad that we have now managed for the first time to lay down the highest standard in the European Union in a binding way for all EU Member States, namely the zero detectability level, which <span class="italic">de facto</span> means organic farming, as laid down in Germany. We have shown that we do not have to dumb down harmonisation to the lowest common denominator but that it is quite possible to set a binding highest standard for all the EU Member States. We must take particular care of the youngest members of society. Here we have managed to establish the precautionary principle and we hope this will prove possible in other areas too. I see on my right my colleague Mrs Irene Soltwedel‐Schäfer, who was visited on this very day by people affected by the BSE scandal. I can only urge that if we make the precautionary principle a binding one – as we have managed here – we should also take it as our yardstick in many other areas.</p>

<p class="contents">The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations urges the European leaders to maintain this embargo on BST. This hormone is produced from genetically modified bacteria; it certainly has a damaging effect on the health of cattle and very probably also on the health of humans who consume the meat. We must apply the precautionary principle here, just as we should apply it to all the genetically modified organisms whose import into Europe has unwisely been authorised by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">But we must go even further. We must determine where the responsibilities lie in the present context and put forward proposals to correct the situation. It is important to note that the rules of international trade that are applied by the WTO and that prevent us from making proper use of the precautionary principle were ratified in the agreements concluded at the Uruguay Round by Europeans themselves; they were led astray by poor advisers, such as the European Commission, which undoubtedly was overly influenced by foreign interests.</p>
<p class="contents">That must be corrected first and foremost by way of institutional reform and at the next international negotiations. But I was truly alarmed by the fact that during the debate on Monday evening, Commissioner Brittan did not show any sign of regret and indicated that he considers the laws of free trade to be almost like divine laws, superior to all. What is even more alarming is that the President‐designate of the next Commission, Romano Prodi, stated yesterday morning in this Hemicycle that the next international negotiations should open, and I quote, ‘a further round of liberalisation". These people have not really understood anything. With them, we are heading towards a catastrophe. Instead, what we need to do now is to establish in international trade the free choice of the people and the primacy of national sovereignty, as expressed in a democratic manner.</p>

I personally find it most regrettable that the Commission commissioned this study so late. We have known for years that there is at least one hormone that is suspected of being carcinogenic and that the other hormones have particularly adverse effects on young people during puberty. We know, and that is the crucial point, that consumers do not want hormone‐treated meat. Consumers want healthy, natural food. That is why this is a very positive decision, for it would have been a retrograde step to have simply introduced labelling, as we have sadly done in the case of novel foods even though the consumers have objected to genetically modified foods.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also planning to extend the moratorium on genetically manufactured bovine growth hormones. Here too it would be high time to issue a ban, as Canada has already done. All the studies conducted by the Scientific Committee show the dangerous and explosive effects of treating animals with hormones. There are many other indications to support these findings and we must also finally get away from the situation where the WTO only addresses the question of residues, for when they decide to buy goods, consumers also have the right to object to a certain kind of production. So it is most welcome that the Commission has taken this decision; however, we should have already indicated the health hazards much more clearly and plainly in the past.</p>

I was most impressed by the strength of feeling Parliament has expressed towards you. What also pleases me is the fact that this House has demanded unanimously by 525 votes – which is indeed rare – for the ban on hormone‐treated meat to be maintained. We in the Committee on Agriculture have succeeded in turning a proposal that tended towards giving preference to labelling into maintenance of the ban instead.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the scientific findings have confirmed our fears. The outcome of the decision by 525 votes will impress the Council and make it now maintain this ban on hormone‐treated meat and resume the discussions in the WTO panel, so as to make it clear that we are not in the mood to burden our people with this highly dangerous hormone‐treated meat.

<p class="contents">In the cases of hormone‐treated meat and the sale of seeds produced genetically – known as genetically modified organisms or GMOs – the European Union is not being allowed to respect the concerns of its consumers. Clearly this type of argument is sometimes used to conceal protectionist commercial practices. However, this is not the case with the European Union at this juncture given that BSE has severely shaken consumer confidence. This means that the European authorities are taking precautions to respect these concerns, which are more profound in Europe than in other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Indications exist of the harmful effects on health of consuming hormone‐treated meat, together with suspicions that some scientific results are being concealed from European decision‐makers. The EU must therefore remain firm in its position that all scientific data must be provided.</p>
<p class="contents">The insensitivity of the WTO in this respect confirms to us that the WTO rules on sanitary and phytosanitary protection (SPS Agreement) do not serve this purpose and must be amended at the next round of negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of bananas, the EU is not being permitted to grant a trade concession to small countries which used to be its colonies – the ACP countries – where bananas represent the mainstay of their economies. This is particularly serious as this EU policy is included in the spirit of the Lomé Agreements which date from 1963 and which therefore significantly predate the current Multilateral Trade Agreement resulting from the Marrakesh Agreement of 1994. What is this all about? Is it because the US is a banana producer? Of course not. It is simply because the US wants to defend its companies which have a monopoly over the banana trade with their dollar bananas and which are in competition with the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, if the WTO were to force the EU into completely liberalising the banana trade, there is absolutely no doubt that sooner or later the support system for Community banana producers would come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call on the Commission to remain firm in defence of our interests and not to be afraid to stand up to international pressures. It must take due note of all these cases in order to take the necessary precautions in the next round of WTO negotiations.</p>

Now we have it in black and white. The hormones used on bovine animals are extremely harmful to man, especially to children. There is open talk of carcinogenic effects, of premature puberty, of immunological damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Our only answer to that must be to maintain the ban on hormone‐treated meat from the USA. Any further speculation about labelling, about compensation payments, any ideas about coming to an arrangement with the WTO rules, are simply obsolete.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also the answer I expected from Sir Leon Brittan. But I found that he did not utter a single plain word on the subject of hormones in his statement. And his view that this is primarily a legal and economic question rather than one of public health is quite outrageous and irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, the legal situation is clear, as are the economic interests. And in the interest of public health we should really call on the US Government to introduce a ban on hormone‐treated meat in the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">After bananas, hormone‐treated meat is the second source of major dispute between the USA and the EU. In the case of bananas too I emphatically ask for an end to the surrender to free‐marketeering. We must not just give in on bananas simply so as not to annoy the US Administration. We cannot take yet another step back from our development policy principles.</p>
<p class="contents">We must use the need to change our common organisation of the banana market in order to give special support to a means of production that is socially, ecologically and developmentally friendly – in every possible area. During the coming WTO round these reforms, including the reform of the GATT which is also implicated in the banana dispute, must come at the top of the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">But we must not just wait for the outcome of that round. Here and now we must continue the EU panel against the USA"s extra‐territorial legislation, against Section 301, and under no circumstances must we break it off. And we must take vigorous steps against the measures taken by the USA, which has <span class="italic">de facto</span> been imposing punitive tariffs since 3 March even though the panel"s ruling did not come until much later.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Commission"s task here not to protect free trade but to protect those who suffer in the name of free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">We Greens hope that you will support the amendments to that effect that we tabled to the compromise resolution, so that we can vote for the compromise.</p>

We must break away from the current thinking behind the liberalisation of trade, which does not give any consideration to social or environmental rules. We must also block the political, economic and monetary hegemony of the US, which is actually imposing the interests of American companies as if they are in the general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of hormone‐treated meat proves that health and consumer protection requirements are not being taken into account and that the precautionary principle holds little sway in the face of prevailing economic interests. Europe must continue to uphold its ban. Furthermore, the dispute over aircraft noise is evidence of their refusal to take account of our higher environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The social aspect is less evident in the trade disputes. Yet unfortunately, the dominant logic today of opening up the markets, where social and environmental rules are disregarded, is systematically damaging this social aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">The banana issue reveals that the interests of multinational firms are a thousand times more important than the development of nations; the market is prevailing over the solidarity that needs to be developed within a political community.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also evident that the US agricultural trusts are making enormous profits by growing bananas in Latin America, while the people in those countries are not seeing any improvement in their situation.</p>

<p class="contents">Although these three disputes only relate to a small percentage of the trade between the United States and the European Union, they are very good examples of its economic, political and social consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, as far as the banana dispute is concerned, the Member States of the European Union are losing their ability to conduct a specific and privileged policy towards certain developing countries with which we had historical links, all in the name of liberalism and the globalisation of trade. This has very significant social repercussions in some of those countries: the Member States of the European Union are following the WTO and progressively losing their sphere of influence, particularly in terms of the African continent. This is to the benefit of South America, whose agricultural resources are exploited or developed mainly by companies dominated by American capital.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the marketing of hormone‐treated meat is concerned, there are undoubtedly repercussions that we can determine in terms of imbalances of production in an agricultural sector which, following the BSE crisis, has a structural surplus and has become much weaker. However, the consumption of hormone‐treated meat clearly has significant effects on human health, although we are not aware of their full extent. We know, for instance, that the consumption of hormone‐treated meat is damaging to the development of adolescents during puberty. The World Trade Organisation, whose rules were negotiated by the Commission and imposed on the Member States, scorns the precautionary principle and the principle of health and safety that each Member State must be able to preserve in order to protect the health of its people.</p>
<p class="contents">These two examples prove that the GATT agreements that led to the World Trade Organisation harm the interests of the people of the Member States of the European Union. I am calling for a complete reorganisation of the way in which the WTO operates, and this should take place in the context of the new round of negotiations due to begin at the end of the year. We must establish the principle of fair trade between the European Union and third countries and restore the precautionary principle. After the dispute over hormone‐treated meat, we all know that the United States will attack the European Union over genetically modified organisms.</p>

It is just further evidence of the tendency towards militarising the European Union. This report talks about supporting the Franco‐British Declaration at St. Malo and also of the speedy integration of the Western European Union into the EU. It is quite clear the Western European Union is a military alliance. It believes in nuclear weapons and is committed to the nuclear deterrent. You would think that at the end of the 20th century we should be trying to get rid of these military blocs because they are not relevant, as far as I can see. We are breathing new life into the Western European Union, which should have actually been defunct last year.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country we have been reassured over and over again that the European Union is not being militarised, yet many reports which have gone through this Parliament in the five years I have been here clearly indicate that is the direction it is going in. I do not believe that any kind of militarising of the EU is in the interests of the people at large, either within Europe or within the world as a whole. We are only setting up a new military bloc, which I do not believe is a good idea. Governments throughout the EU should be honest with their electorate, especially in neutral countries like my own, and say: ‘This is really what is going on here. Are you in favour of it or are you against it?" It is quite clear that if something is not done now, at this stage, we are going to have a defence aspect to the EU. Helmut Kohl said he believed that at the end of the line to European Union lay a European army and European police force. The public has not been told this. It should be. I am fundamentally opposed to any kind of European army or European police force or to a European defence identity within the EU.</p>

For too long, it was practically nonexistent and Europe has looked like a political dwarf in the international arena by adopting minimalist positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Spencer"s reports show that the European Union is beginning to assert itself as a political power, and they clearly express the European Parliament"s desire to contribute in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the European Union"s political action is obviously still inadequate – and this is particularly evident in terms of security and defence – we must qualify this statement in light of the recent events in Kosovo. The European Union has shown that it can take initiatives, for example by organising the Rambouillet Conference. It can make its voice heard and is not playing a supporting role to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam will enable us to give fresh impetus to the CFSP. The appointment of a High Representative for the CFSP will render this policy more visible and more effective. I support the rapporteur"s suggestion that we should organise a hearing within the Committee on Foreign Affairs before this High Representative takes up office.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the new instrument of common strategies allows us to provide the CFSP with fundamental guidelines. The General Affairs Council should adopt such a strategy with regard to the Russian Federation and submit it to the Cologne European Council. I am completely in favour of this timetable, and because this issue is so urgent, we must not postpone its adoption. The crisis the Russian Federation is currently experiencing, in institutional terms and also in economic and social terms, means that there can be no delays. The events in Kosovo should spur us on to establish intensive dialogue with the Russian Federation. It plays an essential role in the European defence structure, and this is a key element for stability in the continent of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should be consulted on the content of this strategy. Since this is not provided for in the Treaty on European Union, I hope, like the rapporteur, that an interinstitutional agreement will be drawn up to provide for this consultation. I share his indignation as regards the assessment of Parliament"s powers in this matter. The amendments introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam do not change anything in that respect: with the exception of the financing of the CFSP, Parliament"s role is confined to information and consultation. The presidency failed to present in time to Parliament its annual report on the main aspects and basic choices of the CFSP. That is sufficient evidence that there is no desire to involve Parliament in this policy.</p>

There is also the question of the United States Congress"s decision to develop under certain conditions an anti‐missile defence system that, from the Russian point of view, challenges the ABM Treaty".</p>
<p class="contents">What does our rapporteur have to say in the face of these two harmful actions by the United States? As far as he is concerned, ‘all these developments support the case for intensive dialogue between the European Union and the Russian Federation". So on the American side, we have actions. And on the European side, we have words. There could be no clearer proof of Europe"s powerlessness in the face of the American superpower.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States benefited so much from the division of Europe after 1945 that it seems to be doing its utmost to create the conditions for a new division, this time between Western Europe on the one hand, and Orthodox Europe on the other. There have been countless hostile acts against the Orthodox civilisation in Europe – contempt, accusations of chauvinism, total ignorance of a different culture – and the bombing of Serbia is symptomatic of this attitude. The aim is to create a new division within Europe that we would not be able to deal with in any other way. The countries of Europe must reject this logic, with the mutual support and cooperation of the Russian Federation, in the interests of peace and prosperity for all.</p>

We support the line that all the EU Member States should develop and reinforce their political and economic relations with the Russian Federation, since development in Russia is important for Europe as a whole. Contributing to the improvement of democracy in Russia is central to such a strategy. However, we believe that the neo‐liberal policies encouraged by the West have played a part in creating serious social problems in Russia, such as unemployment and increasing class conflict. The fostering of relations with Russia should therefore be based on a policy which helps to strengthen democracy and reduce social inequality in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">The main theme underlying this report is that the EU should strengthen the common foreign and security policy, something we are opposed to. In our view, such a development would amongst other things lead to the non‐aligned countries – such as Sweden – becoming more dependent and having fewer opportunities to act autonomously, which would be a drawback in terms of common security in Europe and the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the above arguments, we decided to abstain in the final vote.</p>

We are happy to adopt many of its recommendations and therefore voted in favour of it. The rapporteur is right to go for a strict budgetary policy. It must only be possible to take on extra staff in specifically justified cases. The buildings must be paid off over the shortest possible period of time in order to keep interest payments to a minimum. The rapporteur also rejects direct subsidies out of the EU budget for setting up and operating a supermarket and the catering services in the Parliament buildings. These are all recommendations which we firmly support.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to raise a number of questions. We support the move to a new personnel policy under which promotion would be performance based. This encourages motivation. But the big question here is who judges this performance? Can we guarantee that the appraisal will be objective? We must do away with favouritism and political appointments based on personal preference. The Santer Commission came to grief as a result of cronyism. Let this serve as an example to others.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say a word about the salaries of Community officials. If a statute is accepted for Members of Parliament, there will be a huge discrepancy between the salary levels of MEPs and officials. Not that we as MEPs should be dissatisfied. But it does indicate that the salaries paid to officials are excessive. This is something we need to debate.</p>
