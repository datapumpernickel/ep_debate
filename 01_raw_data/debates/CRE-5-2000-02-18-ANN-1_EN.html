<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>At present, there is a ban on the use of the bovine growth hormone (BST) within the European Union. However, there is a loophole regarding the importation of milk and milk products produced from cows given this hormone.</p>
<p>How soon can the proposed Authority deal with this issue?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Council has decided to provide a joint answer to the questions by Mr Seppänen, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo and Mrs Scallon, as all three concern food safety and the establishment of a European Food Authority.</p>
<p>1. In reply to the questions by Mr Seppänen and Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, the Council wishes to stress that, following the Commission's submission of its white paper on food safety, a wide-ranging debate has been taking place on the Commission's suggestions concerning a European Food Authority. The principle of such an authority has been warmly welcomed by the Member States. The Commission is preparing a timetable under which it is hoped that the Authority will be set up in 2002. Mr Seppänen will no doubt agree with me that it would at this stage be premature to speculate on a geographical location for this new Authority.</p>
<p>2. Following on from answer No 1 and in reply to Mrs Scallon, the Council considers that the European Food Authority, once set up, would certainly be competent to deal with matters related to the impact of growth hormones on milk and dairy products. On 17 December 1999, the Council adopted a decision to prohibit the marketing and administration of growth hormones for livestock, on the basis of scientific considerations related to animal health and welfare. As is stated in the final recital of that decision, it has been established, by the report of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare, that BST can adversely affect the health and welfare of animals.</p>
<p>Concerning the problems related to human health, the Commission, when it adopted the above decision, stressed that the Scientific Committee (Public Health) had, with respect to consumer risk assessment, drawn attention to the lack of available data, and that should scientific developments confirm the existence of the risk the Commission would submit suitable proposals to the Council with a view to ensuring appropriate risk management, which would also cover imported products.</p>
<p>In the present state of scientific knowledge, there is no justification for a ban on public health grounds on imported dairy products obtained from BST-treated cattle. Such a ban would not be compatible with the Community's international obligations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Modern information technology makes an important contribution towards eliminating the disadvantages of peripherally located regions. The Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration of the European Community therefore puts a distinct emphasis on the development of the necessary technologies: Euro 3.6 billion have been allocated to its Specific Programme ‘User-friendly Information Society’, during the period 1998-2002. This programme is closely co-ordinated with activities supported by the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Presidency of the Council has given full consideration to the regional dimension of the development of the innovation and knowledge society. The Special European Council of 23-24 March in Lisbon, ‘Employment, economic reforms and social cohesion – for a Europe of innovation and knowledge’ is called upon to define, at the highest level, a new strategy for growth, competitiveness and employment. Its key question is how to develop a society of innovation and knowledge with more and better employment perspectives and increased social cohesion as between the different regions of the European Union. The preparatory paper submitted by the Presidency contains the blueprint for an ambitious but realistic approach to the challenge of the innovation and knowledge society. By reinforcing RTD activities, enabling broad access to Internet, speeding up the construction of trans-European broadband telecommunication networks and ensuring the wide dissemination of the necessary information technology skills through education and training of the population, it aims to remove most of the remaining problems, particularly prevalent in the peripheral regions, with regard to access to innovative technology and information.</p>
<p>The Commission submitted its Communication ‘Europe, An Information Society for All’ on 17 December 1999; this will also be discussed at the Special European Council. This document calls for an ‘Europe’ initiative with the ambitious aim of bringing everyone in Europe – every citizen, every school, every company – online as quickly as possible. Both the Fifth Framework Programme and the Regional Funds are called upon are called upon to contribute to financing the efforts required.</p>
<p>The Presidency further intends to initiate a political debate on the Commission Communication ‘Towards a European Research Area’ at the informal meeting of Research Ministers on 6-7 March, with further, more formal discussions taking place at the Research Council on 15 June. The Commission’s paper, which sets the pattern for future thinking on the European Union’s RTD policy, suggests strengthening considerably the role of the regions in research and training in science and technology as well as creating centres of excellence and enabling the transfer of knowledge to the economic sector at regional and local level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0063"></a>

<p>The Council would like to remind the honourable Member that the process for amending the Treaties is laid down in Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union, which stipulates that the government of any Member State or the Commission may submit to the Council proposals for the amendment of the Treaties on which the Union is founded, that amendments to be made to the Treaties are adopted by common accord in a conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States, and that the amendments shall enter into force after being ratified by all the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the importance of the opinion of political bodies below state level in discussions on amendments to the Treaty, but it is bound to recall that as the law stands, these bodies can only play a full role through national governments, in accordance with the constitutional requirements of each Member State.</p>
<p>With regard to information, political bodies below state level will be kept informed of discussions in the conference by their respective governments, in accordance with the processes applying at national level. Bodies below state level in each Member State will in this way be able to benefit from information coming direct from the conference, which has taken certain measures to ensure that its work is as transparent as possible. Accordingly, all official documents from the conference, together with all documents from public or private bodies transmitted to it, will be made available to the public using the most rapid and efficient means of communication.</p>
<p>With regard to any proposals or suggestions emanating from political bodies below state level, it will be possible for these to be taken into account in the same way as proposals from other public or private bodies which are not directly party to the conference.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the Committee of the Regions’ debates and opinions on topics discussed by the conference will of course reflect the concerns and wishes of bodies below state level in the Member States in respect of general questions of concern to them.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0073"></a>

<p>Will the Council state to what extent it has considered the impact of enlargement on the future of supplies of natural gas and coal in the European Union and does it believe that the accession of new Member States will make a positive contribution to securing alternatives to nuclear energy or will it lead to an increased dependence on nuclear energy?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council considers that security of gas supply in the EU is of growing importance in view of the increasing EU dependence on energy imports. The priority of the Council attaches to this issue has been underlined in the Council conclusions of May 1996. Since then, the Commission has presented a Communication on EU Gas security of supply in November 1999, which the Council is examining with great attention under the Portuguese Presidency. The conclusions which will be presented to the Energy Council in May 2000, will take into account all aspects of security of supply, including the impact of enlargement.</p>
<p>As concerns the ongoing enlargement negotiations, specific attention is being given to nuclear issues. On 7 December 1998, the Council adopted conclusions on nuclear safety in the context of the enlargement of the European Union which give a clear message to the candidate countries. In particular, they emphasise the necessity of the earliest practicable closure of reactors which cannot be upgraded to international accepted levels of safety at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p>The Council is convinced that the accession of new Member States will contribute positively to the achievement of the objectives of energy policy: security of supply, competitiveness and protection of the environment. Furthermore, the Council recalls that the enhancement of the external dimension, including the enlargement process, is part of the strategy for integrating environmental aspects into energy policy that was submitted to the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999.</p>
<p>In this strategy, the Council sets a high priority on the promotion of new and renewable sources of energy, which will contribute to an increased use of environment-friendly renewable energy sources and thereby lead to diversification of energy sources.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0075"></a>

The measures proposed include the preservation of working capacity, lifelong learning, and the introduction of flexible working formulas, to enable older workers to continue their professional life on a basis of active participation.</p>
<p>The guidelines for 2000 also stress the need to encourage a partnership approach, bringing together the Member States and the two sides of industry, with the aim of developing opportunities for lifelong learning, especially in the information technology and communications sectors and with particular stress on ease of access for older workers.</p>

<p>The decision on the employment policy guidelines for 2000 was approved by the Council in late 1999, and will be adopted formally within the next few weeks, following which it will be published in the Official Journal.

The Council especially emphasises the need for effective exploration of the whole range of employment possibilities created by the new technologies.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Member States will be expected to implement a reference framework targeted on maximisation of the job potential of the services sector, especially industry-related services. This is particularly relevant in relation to the information society and the environmental sector - an especially interesting source of new jobs whose potential should be vigorously explored (also with a view to developing job quality).</p>

<p>The Council further wishes to stress that on 17 December 1999, jointly with the representatives of the Member State governments, it adopted a resolution on the potential for job creation and the social dimension of the information society. In this resolution, the Council called on the Member States to take maximum advantage of this sector's major job-creating potential as part of the fight against unemployment, which is, without any doubt, one of the greatest challenges facing the Union at the dawn of the third millennium.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0083"></a>

Whilst enormous progress has been made, especially with regard to the Code of Conduct on business taxation and the Directive on the taxation of interest and royalty payments, it was not possible to agree conclusions on the three elements of the “tax package” before the Helsinki European Council on 10 and 11 December 1999.</p>
<p>In view of this, the “tax package” dossier was presented to the European Council which, in its conclusions, requested the Council to establish a high-level working group with the remit of finding solutions to the present problems, in particular with regard to the Directive on the taxation of savings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On 31 January 2000, by way of follow-up to the above-mentioned conclusions of the European Council, the Council set up a high-level group on taxation. This group is to present to the Council an overall report on possible solutions to outstanding problems as well as on the Code of Conduct on business taxation and the Directive on the taxation of interest and royalty payments.

<p>1. The Council is aware that the human rights situation in Syria is not acceptable, despite the progress made in recent years. The Syrian Government signed the Barcelona Declaration in 1995, in which it undertook to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. More recently, in 1998 and 1999, Syria has freed hundreds political prisoners with long sentences, including Lebanese citizens. The Council is pleased that these prisoners have been freed, but remains concerned about the remaining prisoners of conscience, about reports of torture, the continuation of the state of emergency and the absence of freedom of expression. The Council is also pleased that Syria is considering signing the Convention against Torture and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.</p>
<p>2. The Council remains concerned about political prisoners and continuing reports of torture. This applies in particular to the five human rights defenders of the Committee for the Defence of Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria (CDF), who are still being detained despite having completed prison sentences of eight to ten years imposed by the Supreme State Security Court in 1992. Just as for other countries, these cases are being monitored through joint reports by the Heads of Mission in Damascus. The conclusion of the agreement, which should include a framework for regular political dialogue, should permit these reports to be stepped up and to be presented on a regular basis.</p>
<p>With regard to the future EU-Syria Association Agreement, this should include the section on human rights. The Commission recently confirmed this as being the European Union’s position during the latest round of negotiations on the association agreement, having stressed that respect for human rights is an essential part of all Community agreements with third countries. On this occasion the issue of the state of emergency was also raised, and there is an expectation that Syria will ultimately abolish this law, in particular once it has signed a peace agreement with Israel. During the visit which the High Representative, Javier Solana, paid to Syria in January 2000, there were again discussions on EU-Syria relations and the Middle East peace process (MEPP).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0096"></a>

<p>The Council is concerned about violations of human rights in Turkey. Referring to the cases mentioned by the Honourable Member, it is aware that Dr Ayan, a psychiatrist working at the Izmir Office of the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey, was detained with 74 others on 30 September 1999 in a village near Izmir, when they tried to attend a funeral of a prisoner killed in Ankara Central Closed Prison.</p>
<p>The Helsinki European Council decided that Turkey is a candidate State destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria as applied to the other candidate States. Compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria is a prerequisite for the opening of any accession negotiations. The Council underlines that stability of institutions guaranteeing human rights and respect for and protection of minorities is one of the Copenhagen political criteria. The Council believes that its decisions in Helsinki will encourage Turkey to take further steps in the field of human rights and democracy.</p>
<p>As has been the case for the other candidates, and building on the existing European strategy, it was agreed in Helsinki to establish for Turkey a pre-accession strategy to stimulate and support its reforms. This will include enhanced political dialogue, with emphasis on progressing towards fulfilling the political criteria for accession with particular reference inter alia to the issue of human rights. In practice, in all the political dialogue meetings with the Turkish authorities at the level of Foreign Ministers (Association Council scheduled for 11 April) and Political Directors (meeting scheduled for 30 March), as well as the Joint Parliamentary Committee meetings (scheduled for 21-23 February), the Council addresses human rights issues.</p>
<p>It is in this framework that the Council can best address cases such as the ones referred to by the Honourable Member, including asking for further information on the circumstances of detention and for speedy clarification of the charges.</p>
<p>The Council underlines that, in the spirit of the European Parliament’s request made to the Council in the context of the EP’s assent to implement the final phase of the Customs Union, it continues to closely monitor human rights and democratic developments in Turkey.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0108"></a>

<p>1. The Council does not share the honourable Member’s view that the Y2K problem was merely a major hoax. The risk of electronic and computer systems malfunctioning in such vital areas as electricity and water supply, transport, health care and so on was very real. For this reason the Council believes that the authorities responsible in these areas were right not to underestimate the danger that this computer problem posed, both economically speaking and as regards human safety. Notwithstanding this, although an EU-level coordination effort was mounted in order to address this situation in a coherent way, it is impossible to quantify the cost of this operation, as it was supported by all the public and private bodies concerned in the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p>2. On the other hand, the Council shares the honourable Member’s concerns about the development of a number of endemic diseases which were thought to have been eradicated, and about the spread of certain viruses and infectious diseases such as AIDS, which are jeopardising the already fragile health systems of many developing countries. Unfortunately, the EU is not in a position to provide a definitive response to scourges of this kind. Nevertheless, I can assure Mr Theonas – and the major debate on development policy held in this House today is proof of this – that the EU is once more doing everything in its power to provide these countries with aid to encourage, as far as possible, their economic development and to alleviate the problems their population suffer. Contrary to the honourable Member’s statement, development aid and food aid provided by the EU itself and through its Member States are fortunately far greater than the amounts that were allocated to tackling the Y2K bug, and are amongst the highest per capita levels in the world.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0113"></a>

From the SIZO 37/01 prison in Kaluga where he is being held, Mr Neverovskii has once again, in an appeal published in Libération on 7 January 2000 and elsewhere, denounced Russian policy in Chechnya, while urging young Russian conscripts to ask to undergo the civilian service provided for in the Russian constitution as an alternative to military service. In an emergency resolution passed on 20 January, the European Parliament declared that it was 'stunned at the sentencing of (…) Dimitrii Neverovskii ' and called on the Russian authorities to 'review urgently the case of Dimitrii Neverovskii in the light of the Russian constitution'.

<p>In order to deal with the present situation, the Council firmly supported the establishment of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), and has contributed to the appropriate budget. Furthermore, it has assumed responsibility for the fourth pillar of UNMIK, which is concerned with economic reconstruction and recovery.</p>
<p>To assess progress made to date by UNMIK, it is important to be aware of the extremely difficult circumstances in which it finds itself operating: the large number of refugees and people from Kosovo itself who have been made homeless and who have had to be rehoused; the destruction of the majority of the infrastructure; the radicalisation of all sections of Kosovo’s population both before and during the war; the collapse of the economy and the total absence of internal income from taxation; and the implosion of administrative structures at local and provincial level and of the police force and the judicial system, because of the war and because of ten years of neglect following the removal of Kosovo’s autonomous status by Belgrade. In this context, UNMIK, in conjunction with the other international bodies and organisations involved, has been able to make very substantial progress in achieving the objectives of UN Security Council Resolution 1244.</p>
<p>The Council also supports the decision of Bernard Kouchner, the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, to create a provisional joint administrative council which should gradually bring all ethnic groups into the administration of Kosovo. To date, Kosovo’s Serbs have refused to take part in this or other similar bodies. The EU has appealed to Kosovo’s Serbs to reconsider their boycott, and to help in this way to build a multiethnic Kosovo and to guarantee a place for themselves in the new administrative structures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0120"></a>

<p>You will recall that in April 1999 the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO ruled that certain aspects of the Community banana regime were not in conformity with WTO rules. Since then, the Commission has conducted intensive contacts with interested parties with a view to putting forward a proposal, which would be generally accepted as resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>In absence of a solution acceptable to all parties, the Commission has submitted to the Council in November 1999 a proposal amending the EC banana regime. The proposal, on which the European Parliament has been consulted, is currently under examination within the Council. This document states that the discussions of the Commission with interested parties would continue during the period in which the Council and the Parliament are examining the proposal. By the time the Council is ready to take a decision, that is to say by the time Parliament expresses its opinion, the Commission will make a report on the outcome of the discussions with the interested parties. At present the Council is not aware of any progress in direction of an agreed solution.</p>
<p>The Council has consistently taken the view that the dispute with the US over the EU’s new banana import regime should be dealt with according to the relevant multilateral rules established within the framework of the WTO. As regards the concessions suspended by the US in the banana case, the EU is challenging before a WTO panel the compatibility of these sanctions, in particular because they were applied before a multilateral ruling was issued by the WTO.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0126"></a>

<p>1. The European Union is obviously aware of the various aspects of this process. As Elian Gonzalez is too young to take legal decisions, the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service (INS), which is part of the US Department of Justice, had to decide who could legally represent him. In addition to Elian’s father, a great-uncle and three attorneys claimed this right of representation. Having interviewed these persons and assessed the relevant facts, the INS determined that Elian’s father, Juan Gonzalez, who resides in Cuba, was the only person legally authorised to speak on behalf of his son in respect of his status as an immigrant in the United States.</p>
<p>2. Furthermore, according to the INS, there is no doubt that Juan Gonzalez has a genuine and continuing father-son relationship with his son. Juan Gonzalez also made it very clear to the INS that he wished Elian to return as quickly as possible. On the basis of these facts, the INS considered that Elian should return to be with his father, and stated that it was inclined to take the necessary measures for this return to take place on 14 January 2000. The INS emphasised that this decision was based on the facts of the situation and on the law, be it either US law or international law, which both recognise the privileged relationship between parents and children. Moreover, family reunification is an important principle in American immigration law and in INS practice. Janet Reno, the US Attorney General, publicly confirmed the position of the INS.</p>
<p>3. Before the family reunification could take place, the attorneys in Miami brought an action in the Federal District Court against the INS decision. US District Judge Hoevler has set a hearing for 22 February 2000 to determine his legal jurisdiction in this case, which is provisionally set for 6 March. The US Department of Justice and the INS have stated that they will defend this action. For its part, the European Union has no authority in this matter and will accordingly not intervene.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0091"></a>

<p>Will the Commission support this call and give an undertaking to seek an agreement in the ongoing negotiations with the Member States whereby 25% of the total budget available for new plans and programmes will be set aside for local development and employment schemes in each of the seven years covered by Agenda 2000?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission confirms that between 1994 and 1999 local development schemes represented approximately 10% of the total Structural Fund regional operations (approximately 15% including Community initiatives and innovative measures).</p>
<p>The concept of ‘local development’ covers a great range of types of operation, and so is sometimes difficult to consider in isolation. In addition, local development is not the primary goal of some types of operation (aid schemes for investment in business, training, infrastructure, etc.) which affect clearly designated areas or social groups.</p>
<p>For the period 2000-2006, the Commission has framed guidelines<a href="#defann_26_3" name="refann_26_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> intended to assist Member States in preparing future programmes. Local development and employment schemes are incorporated into several Community priorities (particularly in the sector devoted to regional competitiveness and the sector given over to the promotion of employment).</p>
<p>The new Structural Fund local development objectives (1 and 2) for the new period, representing approximately 80% of the funding (approximately EUR 160 billion for the given period) will continue to have considerable impact in regional and local development. The new Objective 3, although horizontal, will also play a role in promoting employment, including at local level.</p>
<p>The success of the approach advocated by the European Commission in the 89 territorial pacts for employment has made it possible to raise the awareness of political and economic operators and to promote this approach within regional programming (for example, Objective 1 Italy and Spain).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Commission considers it difficult to commit itself to a specific threshold to be achieved as far as local development is concerned. It does, however, note that Member States have clearly appreciated the value of combining endogenous development approaches with equipment operations or more sectorially based economic operations.</p>
<p>Consequently, it is probable that local development schemes will continue to increase in relative volume and their effectiveness will be acknowledged.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission, using Cohesion Fund appropriations, is funding together with the Greek authorities the project to increase the capacity of the Mornos Aqueduct linking the Mornos and Evinos reservoirs with the water treatment plants serving Athens.</p>
<p>The installation of an 8km pipeline in the bed of the River Sarantapotamos, which the Honourable Member is referring to, which is not associated with any classified area or any area proposed as such by the relevant Greek authorities under Nature Community legislation (Directive 79/409/EC<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the protection of wild birds and directive 92/43/EC<a href="#defann_28_2" name="refann_28_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the protection of wild fauna and flora), is one element of the major project to reinforce the Mornos Aqueduct.</p>
<p>The Commission is extremely concerned to ensure that the environment is protected. It pays particular attention to the conditions for the implementation of projects, especially environmental conditions, and requires that directive 85/337/CEE<a href="#defann_28_3" name="refann_28_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> be respected on the assessment of the impact of some public and private projects on the environment prior to the approval of cofinanced projects, and that the specific studies that are necessary be drawn up.</p>
<p>I can inform you that the project under discussion here, i.e. increasing the capacity of the Mornos aqueduct, has undergone an assessment of this type, in compliance with Greek law which incorporates the relevant directive. This appraisal has been concluded, by interministerial decision, conditional upon compliance with environmental conditions. This stipulated two alternatives for the installation of the pipeline: either its installation in the bed of the River Sarantopotamos or the construction of a tunnel.</p>
<p>According to the Greek authorities, the first option still requires forestry studies and feasibility studies to be drawn up (granting of permissions for access roads). These studies are still in progress. The definitive technical solution is to follow.</p>

<p>The Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that the project will in principle be co-financed in the context of the community support framework 2000-2006. The exact amount of Community contribution will have to be agreed in the framework of the preparation of the relevant operational programme for the period 2000-2006.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is aware, a condition for the Community financing of specific projects is their compliance with the relevant provisions of Community legislation. However, the simple fact that a complaint has been submitted to the Commission contesting the legality of the award procedure for a specific project, does not constitute proof that a breach of the relevant provisions has taken place.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to note that, as the honourable Member already knows, it has received two complaints contesting the award of the Thessaloniki metro contract to the current contractor. As regards the first complaint, which was submitted in 1997, the Commission decided to close the case after receiving the clarifications and assurances from the Hellenic authorities.</p>
<p>The involvement of the Ombudsman concerns this complaint, which is evidently different from the second complaint, which was submitted to the Commission at the end of November 1999 and is currently under consideration. In that respect, the Commission does not intend to wait for the Ombudsman’s decision on the first complaint before assessing the merits of the second one.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to inform the honourable Member that it is in the process of finalising its examination of the second complaint. In this context, the complainant has already forwarded a copy of the concession contract (as published in the official gazette of the Hellenic Republic) to the Commission in order to facilitate its assessment of the case.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The Netherlands government had agreed to the proposal but Spain had not, for reasons of principle.

Is the Commissioner making preparations for submitting a proposal for a European energy tax pursuant to Articles 40 and 43 of the Treaty?

<p>The Commission put a proposal to the Council in March 1997, the main thrust of which is the need to modernise the Community system for the taxation of mineral oils and to extend its scope to all energy products.</p>
<p>The main aim of the proposal is to allow the Community to reap the full benefit of the single market and in this way, to meet its environmental objectives.</p>
<p>This proposal has been under discussion for three years in the Council. A compromise document presented last May by the German Presidency, which constituted the minimum acceptable to as many as fourteen Member States, was finally rejected due to strong opposition in particular from Spain.</p>
<p>As said to the Commission on 25 November 1999, during the discussion with the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, leaving one Member State out it would be ‘an ugly thing’, due to distortions to competition which would benefit the Member State staying outside. The Commission announced the intention to contact Madrid in April, after the upcoming Spanish elections, in order to explore whether a solution could be found. It remains committed to this position.</p>
<p>For these two reasons the Commission has not authorised preparations to apply the energy taxation proposal on the basis of the Treaty provisions on closer cooperation under Articles 43 to 45 of the EC Treaty and Article 11 of the EC Treaty. It takes the view that these provisions should not be used to implement a common framework of taxation such as for energy products.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to make the point that, pending the achievement of a political solution with Spain, it is important to continue discussions at expert level in order to tackle remaining technical problems, such as state aid, minimum taxation level for all energy products, tax exemptions or reductions and tax reimbursements. These issues are equally important and their discussion should not be postponed until a political solution is found with Spain.</p>
<p>It is also important to emphasise that the use of fiscal instruments is not enough to ensure the achievement of all Community commitments in the area of environment and the internal market. They need to be accompanied, in a balanced way, by other instruments of legal, technical or voluntary nature, in order to ensure the achievement of these commitments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0082"></a>

<p>Since 1 January 2000 the PSW (Dutch Pension and Savings Fund Act) has stipulated that pension capital may only be transferred from one pension scheme to another if there is a change of employment. This means that on reaching personable age a person entitled to a pension can no longer transfer his or her capital to a different insurance company, since there is no question of a change of employment. The most important reason for this provision in the PSW is to prevent the flight of capital abroad.</p>
<p>Does the Commission agree that this has the effect of distorting competition since the pensioner can no longer choose, on reaching pensionable age, the company which offers the most favourable annuity for the capital accumulated?</p>

<p>The question of the Honourable MEP refers to a law that entered into force in the Netherlands on 1 January of this year. Additional time will be needed in order to enable the Commission to assess the impact of the law on Community provisions. At this stage, only the following preliminary remarks can be made.</p>
<p>Two questions are in fact being asked. Does this provision distort competition? Does it infringe Single Market rules with regard to the free movement of services and capital?</p>
<p>As regards competition, European rules only apply (except the state aid rules) to anti-competitive behaviour of undertakings – i.e. entities that exercise an economic activity. The prohibition at stake is laid down by the Dutch State in the Dutch pensions and savings funds act. It follows that, even though the prohibition may possibly distort competition, the European competition rules do not appear to apply. It is only in case the Dutch State, by adopting the prohibition, has been involved in anti-competitive agreements, decisions or concerted practices or undertakings, that Article 3, 10 and 81 of the treaty may apply.</p>
<p>From a single market perspective, if the law prohibits the transfer to both domestic and foreign providers, there would apparently be no discrimination on the basis of nationality. Infringement of the free movement of services principle would seem difficult to prove.</p>
<p>As the provision prohibits residents to move the capital accumulated from one country to another, one could argue that the application of the free movement of capital principle is hampered. Such restriction would have to be justified by one of the general exceptions of the EC Treaty applicable to the freedom of capital movements, and in particular, could possibly be based on Article 58 which allows Member States ‘to take all requisite measures to prevent infringement of national law and regulations, in particular in the field of taxation and prudential supervision of financial institutions’.</p>
<p>The matter will be examined further, the Honourable Member will be kept informed of any action the Commission could launch in this regard.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0115"></a>

<p>The question is about cross-border credit transfers in euros: the Honourable Member is surprised at the fact that, given the same initial amount, the recipient may receive an amount which differs from one Member State to another and sometimes even from one bank to another.</p>
<p>Concerning the use of conversion rates between the euro and national currencies, as established by Community regulation<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, all the information available to the Commission indicates that they are being applied properly by banks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the use of these fixed conversion rates has resulted in exposing a whole range of charges previously hidden in exchange rates. Some of these charges, such as the exchange charges, have disappeared, but others, such as the handling and transfer charges still remain. These charges can differ greatly from one bank to the next. The introduction of the euro has thus had a considerable impact in terms of transparency regarding the costs of cross-border operations.</p>
<p>The Commission has known for a long time that cross-border operations involving small amounts are expensive. Following a number of studies in 1993 and 1994, it proposed a directive on cross-border credit transfers <a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> which came into force on 14 August 1999. The directive requires a high level of transparency to be provided for clients with regard to costs and to the time necessary for a cross-border credit transfer. In particular it stipulates that, unless otherwise indicated by the party authorising the transfer, the recipient must receive the amount sent in its entirety.</p>
<p>More generally, the Commission agrees with the idea that the surcharge for cross-border operations is not compatible with the proper operation of the internal market. A single market, a single currency, and a single payment area are necessary. On 31 January 2000 the Commission therefore adopted a general communication on this issue of payments of small amounts within the internal market. The purpose of this communication is to find practical solutions to ensure that cross-border payments are as reliable, fast and inexpensive as domestic payments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The sinking of the Erika highlighted the environmental risks associated with the operation of oil tankers. The Commission has therefore started to draw up a communication on oil tanker safety.</p>
<p>As regards the possibility of controlling vessel access to Community waters, it is important to point out that the Community is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which does not permit measures to prevent access on the basis of general criteria such as the flag a vessel is flying.</p>
<p>The Commission is nonetheless convinced of the need to intensify vessel inspection within the Community both by Member States, in their capacity as port States, and by classification societies. Without prejudging the specific content of the communication, it is anticipated that vessel inspections carried out within the framework of the directive on the inspection of vessels by the port State will be intensified. In particular, greater attention must be paid to aspects relating to the structural condition of oil tankers.</p>
<p>The Commission also intends to propose strengthening the directive on classification societies and to take the necessary initiatives with a view to establishing charterer liability in the event of an accident.</p>
<p>The Commission further intends to propose measures to expedite the removal of single-hulled tankers which entail greater risk of pollution in the event of accident. The use of single-hulled oil tankers will be prohibited within the Community as of a given date to be established in Community legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0030"></a>

ESBO contamination may be on the increase as the substance is being used increasingly to replace more hazardous plasticisers such as DEHA. ESBO has thus partly replaced DEHA in soft plastic film.

<p>The Commission has been informed of the results of a recent enquiry carried out in the United Kingdom<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This study examined the migration of epoxidised soya bean oil (=ESBO), which is used as a plasticiser in the manufacture of gaskets for the lids of glass containers used for baby food.</p>
<p>The results of this study showed that, generally, the level of migration of ESBO is largely below the legal limit (=60 mg/kg of food) applicable for this substance, according to the Directives 90/128/EEC<a href="#defann_36_2" name="refann_36_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and its Fifth amendment 1999/91/EC<a href="#defann_36_3" name="refann_36_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, both based on the opinion of Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). Moreover, the results of the UK study are quite in line with results obtained previously in another enquiry carried out in Sweden<a href="#defann_36_4" name="refann_36_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, where all the samples were below 60 mg/kg of food. In the UK enquiry however, 5 of 137 samples exceeded the legal limit. The implications of these results should be examined by extending the enquiry to other samples, representative of the current production. The Commission has already contacted the Joint Research Centre (Ispra) informally, in order to study the possibility of planning a large enquiry at Community level, as soon as possible. As a precautionary measure, the British authorities have asked producers to reduce the levels of ESBO migration because of this exceeding of the legal limit value, and the special characteristics of the consumption of food by babies.</p>
<p>Further to the previously mentioned experimental study, the Commission intends to collect all the data published on this specific issue, and to supply it to the Member States and the European professional organisations, in order to draw this new issue to their attention.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission agrees with the Honourable Member, and with the British authorities, on the appropriateness of writing to the producers of this type of plasticised gasket to ask them to reduce ESBO migration into baby food.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission agrees that efforts need to be increased in order to promote renewable sources of energy but at the same time, energy efficiency needs to be enhanced more vigorously. The Kyoto commitment is binding and therefore requires effective measures which lead to concrete and quantifiable reductions of CO2 emissions. Increased use of renewable energy sources and improved energy efficiency are the main tools available to meet the Kyoto commitment.</p>
<p>So far, measures at Community level have concentrated on actions of financial support (for research and demonstration of new technology, pilot actions to test new methods and for targeted information and training), and on voluntary commitments and agreements on both renewables and energy efficiency together with considerable cooperation, networking and exchange of experience. Many of the voluntary initiatives taken have been under the auspices of such Community programmes as Altener and SAVE and involve Member States agencies, institutions and local and regional governments, industries and branch organisations.</p>
<p>Recent indications from programme evaluations together with new statistics on energy intensity and on the use of renewables, show that there is a need for even more activity at Community as well as at Member State level. While continuing and possibly increasing financial support for research and demonstration, (a call for tender is currently open with a deadline for submitting proposals by the end of May 2000) pilot actions, information dissemination and voluntary agreements with Member State governments or industry, further regulatory measures have to be considered. One example is minimum energy efficiency standards for tradable goods. At the same time continued development of technology, infrastructure, the removal of market barriers and the creation of a level playing field for renewables are important tasks. The Commission is currently preparing a draft directive aimed at creating a framework for access for renewable energy to the internal electricity market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0101"></a>

<p>A top priority for the commission is to ensure that it meets the European Community's commitment to reduce its emissions of six greenhouse gases by 8% during the period of 2008 to 2012 in comparison with their levels in 1990. The Commission in 1999 issued a communication entitled ‘Preparing for implementation of the Kyoto Protocol’<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which examined possible ways of implementing the obligations of the Kyoto Protocol. The further elaboration and implementation of common and coordinated measures (CCPMs) together with, and as a complement to, national policies and measures will play an important role.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to use all its available legal and financial instruments and to propose new ones if necessary. Comprehensive information on this subject will be provided to the forthcoming Environment Council and to the European Parliament.</p>
<p>CO2 emissions form energy use if the most important greenhouse as. The Helsinki European Council considered the integration of environment into energy policy one of the key measures that can contribute to developing a sustainable energy system and to meeting the Kyoto target and beyond. The increased penetration of renewable energies would play a key role.</p>
<p>The measures and initiatives proposed by the commission in the White Paper ‘Energy for the future: Renewable Energy Sources’ are under implementation, following the Action Plan attached to the White Paper. Furthermore, new Community regulations regarding other policies (regional fund-ERDF), agriculture fund-Agenda 2000, development funds, etc.) now include measures aimed at promoting renewable energy sources. Also, efforts at national level in the Member States are considerable. The Commission is preparing a progress report on the implementation of the White Paper and the Campaign for Take-Off that will be issued during the coming months and transmitted to the European Parliament and the Council during the second quarter of the year. The Commission is also preparing a draft directive for a framework for access for electricity produced renewable energy to the internal market for electricity.</p>
<p>Taking into account the European Parliament and Council resolution on the White Paper, the Commission launched the ‘Campaign for Take-Off’ in April 1999 which is aimed at concentrating efforts in the key sectors (solar energy, wind energy and biomass) as well as attracting investments. At the same time, the promotional actions of the Campaign are on-going: the RE Partnership scheme is being implemented and Renewable Energy (RE) Partnerships have been signed with the industry (BP, REPSOL, etc), municipalities (Malmo, Vaxo, Bologna, Barcelona, etc.), and industry associations (geothermal, etc).</p>
<p>Concerning the ALTENER Programme, now being incorporated into the Energy Framework Programme, about 240 projects (on RES) have received Community support in 1998/1999. Calls for proposals are designed to support the renewable energy sources Strategy and the Campaign for Take-Off.</p>
<p>The statistical data provided by Member States to the European Statistical Office are now completed and consolidated up to the year 1997. The share of renewable energy sources at the end of 1997 was:</p>
<p>10.7 per cent of total primary production;</p>
<p>5.8 per cent of total inland consumption;</p>
<p>8.1 per cent of total inland consumption according to the substitution principle;</p>
<p>14.0 per cent of total electricity generation.</p>
<p>In the White Paper of 1997, the indicative objective is laid down as 12% for the contribution by renewable sources of energy to the Community’s gross inland energy consumption by the year 2010. As outlined above, the strategy in order to achieve this objective is to implement the Action plan of the White Paper.</p>
<p>Energy sector statistics (not yet consolidated) show that the trend of continuous increase, mainly in wind and solar but also in bio-mass, will be confirmed in 1998 and 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to set up an efficient monitoring system in order to permanently monitor progress achieved. If the trend falls short of the expected results, the Commission will propose further measures in order to achieve the Community indicative targets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The honourable Member touches upon the very important issue concerning the transition of radio to digital. This transition, which is expected to last several years, has to be seen across the whole audio-visual sector and is very closely associated with the so-called ‘analogue switch off’, the timing of which will vary from one Member State to the next. Any action, therefore, should have to be decided in due course and take into account not only any possible market failure but also to ensure that Member States are not discriminated against on the basis of their technological development and therefore their capacity to respond to any potential programme of support.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0038"></a>

<p>The Honourable Member refers specifically to an export credit guarantee by the British government to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu dam in Turkey.</p>
<p>Issuing insurance guarantees by governments for large, long term export transactions to third countries is commonplace throughout the world. There have been moves within the Community to harmonise progressively the differing systems inside the Community – e.g. by Directive 98/29/EC which entered into force on 1 April 1999. In addition, detailed rules have been agreed at the OECD for export credits of two years and more. World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules prohibit export credit guarantee programmes where they operate at premium rates inadequate to cover the long term operating costs and losses of that programme, and may, therefore, be considered a subsidy. The Commission would like to point out that there has never been a dispute in WTO regarding distortion of competition in relation to export credit guarantees granted by Member States.</p>
<p>As regards the specific transaction referred to, the Commission is aware that co-ordination has taken place between export credit agencies (ECAs) in order to ensure that all ECAs involved would put the same environmental conditions in their offer.</p>
<p>The Commission has no current plans to introduce proposals for further rules, but will continue to play an active part in negotiations at the OECD, in accordance with the conclusions of the G8 Summit in Cologne in 1999.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0043"></a>

<p>The Commission wishes to remind the Honourable Member that one of the chief objectives which the Community has been striving to achieve for a long time in the wine and spirits sector is in fact championing the protection of designations of origin and geographical indications as well as renowned traditional designations. The aim is to protect them at both Community and international level.</p>
<p>At Community level, in 1989 the Council adopted a regulation which affords exclusive protection to the geographical and traditional designations used for spirituous beverages sold within the Community.<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Under the terms of this regulation, the traditional designation ‘ouzo’ enjoys exclusive protection within the Community regarding spirituous beverages flavoured with aniseed manufactured in Greece and complying with defined particular specifications.</p>
<p>At international level, the Community has signed bilateral agreements for the protection of designations for spirits, including ‘ouzo’, with Mexico and Switzerland. The EC/Mexico agreement has been in force since 1 July 1999<a href="#defann_43_2" name="refann_43_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> whilst the EC/Switzerland agreement is currently being ratified. In current negotiations with a great many third countries, particularly the countries of eastern Europe and Canada, the Community is also promoting this objective to ensure that the term ‘ouzo’ is protected as a designation reserved exclusively for Greek products.</p>
<p>More particularly concerning the overall agreement between the Community and South Africa on trade, development and cooperation, signed on 11 October last year, Appendix X of this agreement in fact lays down specific protection conditions regarding the designations of origin ‘port’ and ‘sherry’.<a href="#defann_43_3" name="refann_43_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> This appendix does, however, also stipulate that a separate agreement on wines and spirits shall be negotiated between the two partners. In these negotiations which were held alongside the negotiations on the main agreement, the Commission left no room for doubt as to its determination to ensure that the protection of the Greek designation ‘ouzo’, and indeed of other terms (‘grappa’, for example), should form an integral part of the ‘wines and spirits’ agreement. To date, the South African delegation was not prepared, as a matter of principle, to grant such exclusive protection to Greek products alone. The implications of this situation are currently a matter for intense consultation between South Africa, the Council and the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is aware of the reports on traces of cocaine in banknotes. Using banknotes as ‘paper straws’ for inhaling cocaine is a well-known way of administering this dangerous illicit drug. In the British study the Honourable Member is referring to 5% of the banknotes examined showed high levels of cocaine indicating that the notes had been handled by drug dealers or used to inhale the drug. The traces have then been transmitted from note to note e.g. in bank sorting machines. Mass spectrometric analysis, as such, is a reliable method to analyse traces of drugs but it is impossible to draw any conclusions on the availability of cocaine based on these kinds of studies alone.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member knows, the European monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction (EMCDDA) and Europol produce regularly statistics and analysis on the drug situation and trend in the drug use and drug trafficking in the Union. Based on this information, there does not seem to be any rapid rise in cocaine availability or use in the Union. Seizure statistics from Europol show a slight decrease in the amount seized in 1998 compared to 1997. Europol also collects information on the street price and purity of cocaine as an indicator of availability. The price and purity levels have been relatively stable in most Member States.</p>
<p>According to the latest figures from EMCDDA 1-3% of the whole adult population in the Union and 1-5% of young adults have tried cocaine. However, there are some signs of increased availability of cocaine, especially in metropolitan areas. The EMCDDA and national focal points are developing systems for early detection of new trends in drug use.</p>
<p>The Commission has already been active in developing methods for physical detection, drug profiling and biological monitoring of drugs and precursors. This is a priority in the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities (1998-2002). The Community Programme on drug prevention funds projects that cover also prevention of cocaine use.</p>
<p>The new Drug Strategy (2000-2004) endorsed at the Helsinki European Council last December states that accurate and reliable information is a prerequisite for effective action and rapid reaction to the threat posed by drugs at local, national and Union level. The Commission, the Member States, Europol and EMCDDA will continue to work together in accordance with their respective roles and competencies to achieve this goal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0050"></a>

<p>Glyphosate is a plant protection product currently being evaluated in the framework of the first review programme of existing active substances undertaken under Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92. The objective of the evaluation is to determine whether it can be included in a positive list of substances (Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on the placing of plant protection products on the market) that can be used in plant protection products in the Community. The Regulation provided that any interested party could submit before 30 April 1995, to the Rapporteur Member State (for glyphosate, the RMS is Germany), technical or scientific information with regard to the potentially dangerous effects of the substance or its residues on human and/or animal health and/or on the environment.

This was submitted on 1 February 1999 to the Commission and the other Member States.</p>
<p>According to the usual procedures provided for in the Regulation, the monograph was immediately forwarded for an expert consultation (peer-review) with specialised experts from five Member States to examine in detail all areas of human health and environmental safety (physico-chemical properties, toxicology, residues, ecotoxicology, fate and behaviour in the environment). Data gaps were identified and new data was requested, supplied and reviewed. The process also allowed that any other relevant new information be taken into consideration or be considered during further discussions with all Member States in the framework of the Standing Committee on Plant Health and its working groups. The monograph and the results of the peer-review for glysophate will be discussed by all Member States in the Evaluation Working Group to any other parties.</p>
<p>The monographs were always considered as draft documents reflecting the views of one Member State on (usually) incomplete data-sets. The Commission considered it inappropriate to release such draft documents because (i) they are intermediate documents in a long, thorough review process; (ii) they do not reflect the views of the Commission; (iii) being based on incomplete data packages, they might be misleading if not read together with the results of the technical and scientific information requested and supplied after their preparation; (iv) release would require clearance under the standing rules of the Standing Committee on Plant Health and (v) they represent the views of one Member State and these views often change on the basis of new information, of peer-review, and of exchanges of views with other Member States. Moreover, the volume of the documentation involved would place another huge burden on scarce Commission resources. Since 1996, the Commission has received about 65 such draft assessment reports. They range in size from about 300 to more than 1000 pages.</p>
<p>In all cases, before it takes a decision, the Commission consults the Scientific Committee on Plants and seeks the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health. Moreover, when a decision is taken, a review report with the most important information (overall conclusion, particular use or risk management conditions, major endpoints on identity, physico-chemistry, toxicology and environment) is made publicly available. The background information which includes the draft assessment report of the Rapporteur Member State, the report of the peer-review and all comments and clarifications submitted after the peer-review are kept available by the Member States, as laid down in all Decisions taken so far on inclusion of active substances in the positive list. As a final assurance, in all cases a decision on any active on any active substance can be reviewed at any time if there are indications that this should be done.</p>
<p>The current practice of not making available the monographs is now under review in the light of a number of factors, including the need for greater transparency in Community decision-making. The recent proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0030">COM(2000)30</a> final) regarding public access to documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission will inform this review.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member will be informed of the outcome of this review process in relation to the release of monographs submitted to the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

There is some dispute as to the degree of hazard represented by these flame retardants, but they are sometimes compared with known environmental toxins such as DDT and PCBs. Sweden is preparing a ban on the substances. Denmark and Sweden have called on the Commission to take action in this respect.</p>

<p>The Commission is following closely the issue of risks to health and the environment posed by brominated flame retardants.</p>
<p>The use of certain brominated flame retardants in textile articles intended to come into close contact to the skin has been prohibited in the Community for several years. These prohibitions were introduced in 1979 and 1983.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Commission proposed to ban the marketing and use of all 10 substances that are now under discussion because of possible risks to health and the environment. However, the European Parliament chose not to deliver an Opinion during its first reading and in 1995 the Commission decided to withdraw its proposal because of lack of political support.</p>
<p>These brominated flame retardants are currently the subject of risk assessment under Council Regulation (EEC) no 793/93 on the evaluation and monitoring of the risks of existing substances. Once the risk assessments have been finalised and reviewed by the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment, the results will be published in the Official Journal. Based on the results of these comprehensive assessments, the Commission will propose, if necessary, appropriate risk reduction measures. The Member States responsible for the risk assessments under the Existing Substances Regulation have been urged to complete the work as soon as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0056"></a>

<p>The Council and Parliament have recently agreed a Commission proposal for a Regulation on Orphan medicinal products, which provides some financial support to stimulate the research, development and marketing of medicinal products to treat rare diseases in humans. However, it is recognised that the main incentive introduced by this Regulation is market exclusivity for products that are designated as orphan medicinal products.</p>
<p>There are certain similarities between the human and veterinary sectors in the problems of availability of medicines for small markets. To certain extent, the lack of availability of veterinary medicines to treat ‘minor diseases’. In both cases, the research and development of potentially valuable medicinal products can be hampered by the absence of potential profits, which makes these areas unattractive for investment by the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>The Commission is prepared to consider adapting the approach adopted in the Regulation on orphan medicinal products to the development of veterinary medicinal products. However, it would have to be convinced that such a development would in reality stimulate the availability of veterinary medicines for minor species. For the time being, it is clear that there are major differences between the markets for human medicinal products and the markets for veterinary medicinal and such a project could not be undertaken without a clear assessment of both the costs, benefits and market implications of such a proposal. The Commission is currently working on a proposal to amend Council Regulation 2377/90<a href="#defann_52_1" name="refann_52_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and Council Directive 81/851/EEC<a href="#defann_52_2" name="refann_52_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, in order to address the problem of the existing lack of veterinary medicines for minor species and for certain indications (minor uses). This proposal will be sent as soon as possible to the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Finally, in the context of a general evaluation of the veterinary medicines approval system, the Commission has recently started the process of evaluating the entire system of authorisation and supervision of medicinal products in the Community. Based on this evaluation, a proposal for modifications to the existing system will be made to the Council and Parliament in 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has become increasingly concerned in general about the welfare of animals. The Commission’s responsibilities towards animal protection have increased under the recent amendment of the EC Treaty. The Protocol no. 33 of the EC Treaty on the welfare and protection of animals requires the European Institutions and Member States to consider animal welfare a priority when drawing up transport, single market and research policies.</p>

<p>Concerning the importation of animals and in particular horses from third countries it should be noted that the greater part of the journey has often taken place before reaching the border of the Community. On this subject, the Commission is currently re-examining its position with regard to enforceability against operators who neglect the welfare of animals before they have reached the Community’s frontier.</p>
<p>A working group of the Standing Veterinary Committee has recently been established to consider particular problems in the enforcement of the Directive in respect of long-distance transport operations.</p>
<p>Concerning the experience of Member States derived from the application of Directive 91/628/EEC, a specific report will be presented to the Council and to the Parliament during the first quarter of inspections performed by the Food and Veterinary Office.</p>
<p>The Commission may consider amending current Community legislation on the basis of the conclusions of this working group.</p>
<p>The Commission will also, in due course, take decisions as to whether to open further infringement procedures under Article 226 (ex-article 169) of the EC Treaty against the Member States involved in respect of the most severe cases of inadequate enforcement of the rules of the animal transport directives.</p>
<p>In relation to the principal Eastern European third countries involved in the transport of livestock to the Community, various informal contacts have taken place in relation to animal welfare and the relevant legislation of those countries has been obtained.

These vessels are approximately 7000 gross registered tons and their annual catch capacity can be over 50,000 tonnes.</p>

<p>Research on climate change has continued to be supported by Framework Programmes during the last two decades. In line with the Swedish research, the other European climate models also predict an increase in global temperature and variability of precipitation while uncertainties remain as regards the regional impacts of a climate change.</p>
<p>The Key Action on Global Change, Climate and Biodiversity of the ‘Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development’<a href="#defann_56_1" name="refann_56_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> research programme of the Fifth Framework programme for research and technological development (RTD) targets the objectives of quantifying climate change prediction on decadal and seasonal/inter-annual variation time scales and to assess its impacts. In addition, it also includes a dedicated theme on Mitigation and Adaption to Global Change. The research under this topic comprises both socio-economic and natural sciences.</p>
<p>A coordinated research effort is already underway by forming clusters of relevant research projects. These projects provide input to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the international programmes (e.g. International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, the World Climate Research Programme, and the International Human Dimension Programme).</p>
<p>Mitigation strategies with regard to various impacts resulting from climate change will require a complex blend of geographical, social, economic and scientific information combined with carefully developed policy and instruments to implement that policy. The Commission is aware that these important aspects are likely to need further consideration in the future.</p>
<p>In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 8%, the reduction target foreseen in the Kyoto protocol, the Commission is currently in the process of identifying a number of policies and measures, especially in the area of transport and energy.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to launch the European Climate Change Programme (ECCP) in which all relevant stakeholders will be invited to cooperate towards the elaboration of a package of Community-wide policies and measures to the fulfillment of the Kyoto obligations as a first step.</p>
<p>Indeed, scientific evidence suggests that further reductions will be needed to mitigate the increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere thereby mitigating the impacts of climate change both in many developing countries, as well as developed countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European sea port policy is currently undergoing a number of developments mainly as a result of the Commission’s ‘Green Paper on Sea Ports and Maritime Infrastructure’ which was, in its outlines, endorsed by the substantial number of comments received from interested parties, by the Council and by Parliament.</p>
<p>The first immediate result of the Green Paper has been the Commission proposal to include sea ports in the Trans-European Network. This proposal is currently in the legislative process. We expect a positive outcome soon.</p>
<p>Peripheral areas have a specific treatment in the Decision 1692/96 on Community guidelines for the development of the Trans-European transport network – (TEN-T). The development of linking infrastructures to peripheral areas is set as a priority in Article 5(b).</p>
<p>Section 5 of Annex II of the existing TEN-T Decision fixes the criteria and specifications for port projects of common interest, paying particular attention to the development of intra-Community maritime links with island and peripheral regions of the Community.</p>
<p>In addition ports located in Objective 1 areas can benefit from Community Support Framework programmes and the Community Initiative Interreg actions for the period 2000-20006.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, the Commission intends to take initiatives in particular on access to the port services sector and on public money flows to and within ports whilst fully taking into public service obligations.</p>
<p>Inextricably linked to ports is short sea shipping.

<p>In its initial preliminary draft budget for 2000, the Commission proposed appropriations for the School Milk Programme of EUR 53 million. It subsequently raised this amount by EUR 31 million to EUR 84 million when it presented an amending letter to the preliminary draft budget in October 1999. The final amount adopted by the Budget Authority was EUR 83 million. However, this amount is unlikely to be sufficient to cover expenditure for the scheme under the current aid conditions.</p>
<p>In view of the tight budgetary framework and taking account of the conclusions of an evaluation study into the operation of the scheme, the Commission has recently submitted a proposal to the Parliament and the Council on a co-financing of the scheme. The proposal suggests an equal distribution of the financial burden between Community and national budgets, while allowing Member States to finance their share through a contribution from the dairy sector.</p>
<p>As to the possibility of extending this type of programme to other groups in the society, the Commission is not considering such initiative at the moment, notably in view of budget limitations.</p>
<p>It is important, however, to note that besides the school milk programme, a further EUR 211 million is foreseen in the 2000 agriculture budget for the distribution of food to less well-off groups in society.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0085"></a>

<p>Relations between the EU and Libya, which have been troubled for years, were once again put to the test by Romano Prodi's invitation to Muammar Gaddafi, which was ultimately withdrawn without any justification of substance. Ongoing promotion of cooperation with Mediterranean countries is a basic EU priority. Phasing Libya into the Mediterranean cooperation programmes is absolutely vital and the EU institutions must therefore make a cautious and measured attempt at rapprochement with Libya. Hasty and superficial moves only produce negative results which run counter to the objectives of a long-term policy. Apart from the lack of clarity about the practical arrangements involved, there are huge question marks over the haste with which Prodi's invitation was issued and the unsatisfactory procedure used.</p>
<p>Can the Commission explain the grounds for the invitation? What procedures were followed and what were the circumstances under which it was issued?

<p>The possibility of a visit by Colonel Gadhafi to the Commission was first mooted over Christmas when he phoned the President.

<p>Several contacts took place since this conversation through regular diplomatic channels in both written and oral forms. The outcome of these contacts and an additional telephone conversation between the President and Colonel Gadhafi was that Libya reaffirmed its firm intention to adhere to the Euromed process and declared its willingness to proceed to a ‘serious dialogue’ with the Union to that end.</p>
<p>The Commission is therefore, in close cooperation with Council Secretary General Javier Solana and the Member States, in the process of exploring the concrete formula of such a dialogue with the Libyan authorities.

<p>There is not an even flow between the fifteen Member States in terms of the numbers of students who chose to spend some time studying in a Member State other than their own, assisted by the Socrates programme. Consequently universities in some Member States receive far more students than those in other Member States. As a result there is a financial imbalance and these universities, in the interests of European cooperation, bear a disproportionate share of the costs. This imbalance, in recent years, has meant some universities having to restrict incoming numbers with consequent damage to longstanding partnerships.</p>

<p>The Commission has always stated that a cornerstone of the Erasmus programme is a good balance of flows between countries and disciplines, and that participating countries should try to guarantee a certain degree of reciprocity. This principle is clearly reiterated every year in the guidelines to the national agencies in charge of Erasmus to help them draw their national action plan for the mobility of students, as well as in the guidelines for the universities applying for an institutional contract within the framework of the SOCRATES/ERASMUS Programme. However, mobility flows cannot be totally controlled as they also reflect cultural trends and the attraction exerted by specific cultural and linguistic environments. It is precisely to try to cope with this imbalance in flows that the Commission has launched in 1996 a pilot scheme to organise intensive linguistic preparation courses in the less widely taught and spoken languages.</p>
<p>Given the fact that Erasmus student mobility is largely managed in a decentralised way, the Commission has to rely on the national relays for the promotion of the programme. The Commission provides support to the Socrates/Erasmus national agencies to organise information campaigns targeted to the largest number of potential applicants for the mobility scheme. National authorities supervising the higher education, national bodies in charge of its internationalisation and, in particular, the national agency running the Erasmus mobility programme, have also a role to play in offering incentives to partner institutions in the Erasmus programme so that they promote more efficiently the outward mobility. This can be done through a more active information policy – raising awareness, in particular, about the less favoured countries of destination – an a better linguistic preparation to allow more students to go abroad. The Commission works closely with its partners in that direction.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0090"></a>

<p>The EC Treaty includes sustainable development, as one of the Community’s objectives and transport has to play a key role in achieving this. This requires a strategic approach.

Intelligent transport systems and innovative services (traffic management, traveller information, on-demand buses, tele-shopping, etc) can help to reduce transport demand, but only as part of an integrated policy package and combined with demand management strategies.</p>
<p>Demand management has been addressed by the Commission’s transport/environment expert group in support of the Council integration strategy.

<p>The Commission is well aware that the human rights situation in Syria remains far from satisfactory, despite progress in recent years. It recalls the Parliament’s determined stand to delay approval of the 3 and 4 Financial Protocols between the Community and Syria in the early 1990s. This contributed to increased awareness on the Syrian side that human rights are of particular concern to the European Union in its relations with third countries.</p>
<p>Since then, the Syrian Government has signed the Barcelona Declaration in 1995 and released thousands of long-term political prisoners, including Lebanese citizens, most recently in 1998 and 1999.

The Commission and Syrian negotiators openly discussed all issues pertaining to the human rights clause of the agreement. The Commission made clear that respect of universal human rights constitutes an essential element of all our agreements with third countries. It also raised the issue of the emergency law. The Syrian authorities indicated that the emergency law is not meant to be permanent and that Syria is in the process of eliminating it once the causes behind it would disappear. This could be connected to a final peace agreement with Israel. Syria is also considering joining the Conventions Against Torture and on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. These are encouraging developments.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission remains aware and highly concerned about political prisoners and reports of torture. This applies in particular to the human rights defenders from the peaceful Committees for the Defence of Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria (CDF). While two CDF members have been released recently, there are still detained after serving eight-year prison terms imposed by the Supreme State Court in 1992. As in other countries, such cases are covered by a Community monitoring provided through joint reports by the Damascus Heads of Missions. This could intensify and become more regular with the conclusion and eventual ratification of the agreement;</p>
<p>The responsible member of the Commission will be visiting the Middle East including Damascus in early April. Discussions on human rights and the negotiations for the Association Agreement will continue then. But human rights will be also discussed in other countries of the region. At the same time, the Commission will also work on starting a new set of MEDA Democracy projects in the region this year promoting human rights and democracy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0098"></a>

Such decisions should continue to be taken at local level. However, the Commission is of the opinion that there should be a common framework for the procedures leading to such decisions.

<p>The Commission is committed to improving and strengthening its business impact assessment system (BIAS) as part of its consideration of legislative proposals. These internal Commission working procedures, along with comprehensive consultation with outside interests, are part of the open and transparent Commission policy as established by the guidelines on legislative policy announced by the Commission in January 1996.</p>
<p>A business impact assessment appears as part of the documentation accompanying every legislative proposal, which has been identified as likely to have a significant impact on business. This is published as part of the document (COM), which is submitted to the Council. The Office of the Official Publications distributes these documents and they are, therefore, available to outside interests and scrutiny.</p>
<p>To answer the specific questions raised by the honourable Member:</p>
<p>In April 1999 the ‘Guidance Notes for DGs on Completion of Business Impact Assessments’ went to inter-service consultation, and had the agreement of the Directorates-General and the Secretariat-General. Within the new Enterprise Directorate General the system will be re-launched.</p>
<p>Business impact assessments should be carried out for any legislative proposal from the Commission deemed to have a significant impact on business.</p>
<p>The new Unit for ‘Regulatory co-ordination – simplification and impact of legislation on SMEs’ within the Enterprise Directorate general will take on the task of revising and strengthening the business impact assessment system. The commitment to carry out business impact assessments is firmly anchored in the new Enterprise Directorate General’s work programme for 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0110"></a>

<p>On 25 November 1999, the Russian mathematician Dimitrii Neverovskii was sentenced to two years' imprisonment – the maximum penalty under Article 328 – by a court in Obninsk (Kaluga district) for his conscientious objection to military service. From the SIZO 37/01 prison in Kaluga where he is being held, Mr Neverovskii has once again, in an appeal published in Libération on 7 January 2000 and elsewhere, denounced Russian policy in Chechnya, while urging young Russian conscripts to ask to undergo the civilian service provided for in the Russian constitution as an alternative to military service. In an emergency resolution passed on 20 January, the European Parliament declared that it was 'stunned at the sentencing of (…) Dimitrii Neverovskii ' and called on the Russian authorities to 'review urgently the case of Dimitrii Neverovskii in the light of the Russian constitution'. On 18 January, Mr Neverovskii was transferred to a solitary confinement cell. On 26 January, he embarked on a total hunger strike.

<p>Many municipalities and counties in Sweden have opted to allow competition for the provision of services that were formerly local authority operated and controlled. However, this has provoked widespread criticism, especially in the case of public transport. One point that has not been adequately clarified concerns the scope for returning such services to local authority control after the relevant contracts have expired.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider the return to local authority control of services which have been opened up to competition, and the operation thereof by local authorities, to be compatible with Community rules?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The question concerns the relationship between services of general economic interest and Community law. In essence, it is asked whether Community law would allow to re-monopolise certain communal and regional services which were previously opened to competition.</p>
<p>Granting and maintaining an exclusive right for the performance of certain services could be contrary to Community law, in particular the rules on the freedom of establishment of the free movement of services, as undertakings from other Member States are excluded from establishing themselves in the Member State concerned and providing the same services. According to the case law of the European Court of Justice, a monopoly can be justified by imperative requirements in the public interest or to the extent it is necessary for the necessary for the performance of a public service obligation in the sense of Article 86(2) (ex article 90) EC Treaty. The Court has made clear that the State measure in question must be apt to realise the objective pursued and has to comply with the principle of proportionality which means that it must not go beyond what is necessary to attain this objective.</p>
<p>On this basis, a monopoly for local or regional public services could for example be justified it can be shown that in order to guarantee that all consumers have access to certain essential services of high quality at affordable prices there is no less restrictive means than to grant an exclusive right to one single operator. However, where competition has already been introduced in a service of general economic interest but has rendered unsatisfactory results in terms of reliability, universality and affordability of the service, a less restrictive means to ensure these features could be to set up State regulation imposing adequate public service obligations on the competing operators providing the service in question.</p>
<p>As a separate point, with regard to State ownership in undertakings, Article 295 (ex article 222) EC Treaty states unequivocally that the Treaty shall in no way prejudice the rules in Member States governing the system of property ownership. In this respect, Community law is neutral and Member States, regions or communes are therefore neither hindered nor obliged to give up their stakes in public undertakings and privatise them. No are they hindered or obliged to obtain or re-obtain ownership in private or privatised undertakings thus turning or returning them into public undertakings.

<p>The Commission is aware of the problems faced by the ceramics industry in the area as well as in the Community as a whole. It should be recalled that the introduction of the quotas in question on imports from China was based on the following considerations:</p>
<p>a) the sensitivity of the Community industry concerned;</p>
<p>b) the increasing threat posed by imports from China to these industries made more acute by the particular characteristics of the Chinese economy;</p>
<p>c) the restructuring and rationalisation efforts carried out on a Community wide basis by the ceramic industry.</p>
<p>Having carried out a detailed analysis of the situation, the Commission in its 4<span class="sup">th</span> and 5<span class="sup">th</span> report to the Council recommended that the remaining quotas, including the quota on some products of the ceramic industry, should remain unchanged for 1999 and 2000, i.e. at their 1998 level, until and unless an equitable understanding with China in the context of its World Trade Organisation (WTO) accession, satisfying the Commission’s requests on their 385 remaining quotas on Community products, would materialise.</p>
<p>The Commission will be required to produce its 6<span class="sup">th </span>report on the existing quotas by the end of the present year and, as part of the analysis of the situation of the industry, it may be considered appropriate that Commission officials visit certain of the firms in the Community industry including those in Staffordshire.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0121"></a>

<p>On 5 July 1999 the Commission published the notices of competition COM/TA/99, COM/TB/99 and COM/TC/99.

These competitions are internal to the Commission and, consequently, need not be published in the Official Journal.</p>
<p>On 2 December 1999 – after prior consultation with Vice-President Kinnock – Mr Reichenbach, the Director General for Personnel and Administration, decided to prolong the deadline for submission of applicants from 30 July at 16.00 hours until 22 December 1999 at 16.00 hours. The Vice-President supported this decision fully. The Director General for Personnel and Administration took this decision in his capacity as Appointing Authority and in conformity with Staff Regulations.</p>
<p>Mr Reichenbach explained the reasons for his decision to the Joint Committee (Commission Paritaire) at its meeting of 17 December 1999. He reported that he had been concerned that several potential candidates for the competition had been denied admission purely on the technical grounds that they had not submitted all required identity documents in the precisely prescribed manner. The Director General took the view that these were not justifiable reasons for preventing admission to a competition and consequently extended the deadline in order to provide an extra opportunity for completion of formalities. He agreed to re-examine the number of successful candidates for each competition in the light of the number of additional candidates who would now be eligible for the competition, following the reopening of the deadline, in order not to disadvantage those candidates who had been accepted initially. He informed all staff of the above in a message of 12 January 2000.</p>

<p>When I was 8, my father was killed in a road accident. I was in the car with him at the time, and can still remember the childish distress I felt when I saw that he was no longer moving. At present, some 43 000 people are killed on the EU’s roads every year – a figure equivalent to the population of a fair-sized town. Portugal has made road safety one of its main objectives. In fact, protecting human life ought to be our number one priority. Portugal has said that a directive needs to be drafted concerning the blood alcohol limit for drivers.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal on this subject has been pending since 1988. Recently, the Commissioner responsible for transport, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, said, however, that this was a matter for which the Member States were responsible and that there was no need for European harmonisation.</p>
<p>I am shocked at this turn of events, as there is no question as to how dangerous drinking and driving is. It is calculated that introducing a limit of 0.05% in all EU Member States would save about 1000 lives each year. Young people are often involved! Must we decision-makers wait until something tragic happens close to home before we react? Cutting the alcohol limit in all Member States is vital, so harmonisation is needed.

<p>The Commission shares the Honourable Member’s concern that drinking and driving is still a major road safety problem.</p>
<p>For many years the Commission has investigated the problem of drinking and driving and the road accidents which it generates. The conclusion, from a road safety point of view, is that national and European actions to reduce the incidence of drinking and driving are a priority to make Community roads safer. Most experts will agree that what is required is a package of measures to tackle this problem embracing blood alcohol content (BAC) limits, effective and targeted enforcement, penalties, and re-habilitation programmes for serious offenders.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that lower BAC limits are an essential requirement to underpin national and European action to reduce illegal drinking and driving and that 0.5 mg/ml is considered to be a sensible general maximum limit. The adoption of such a maximum limit by all Member States would provide a clear and consistent message to drivers on Community roads that drinking and driving is a dangerous activity.</p>
<p>The original proposal for a BAC limit of 0.5 mg/ml, brought forward in 1988, remained unadopted simply because too many Member States objected to such a measure on the grounds of subsidiarity, even though they themselves were prepared to accept 0.5 mg/ml. Indeed, since 1988 some Member States have accepted 0.5 mg/ml in their national legislation. Against this background, the Commission is preparing a Council recommendation which would set out how should be proceeded to deal with this important road safety problem.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0130"></a>

<p>In an interview in the Commission's staff journal Commission en direct, which was followed up in the Danish daily, Politiken, on 25 January, Poul Nielson, the Danish Commissioner, severely criticised the way in which the Commission operates. He argued, for instance, that the Commission was inefficient, that free debate was stifled and that real power lay not with the Members of the Commission but with senior officials, who sabotaged their work. He felt that the Commission had a strong, hierarchical culture behind which anarchical network-based power games of a personal nature took place. He said quite frankly that he did not feel welcome as a Commissioner and accused unknown Commission officials of conducting a personal campaign of sabotage against him, for instance by having his furniture wait in containers for two months.</p>

This document contains an Action Plan, describing in detail 84 actions to be taken to improve the way in which the Commission works.</p>
<p>The Commission Opinion adopted on 26 January 2000 for submission to the Inter-Governmental Conference also makes clear the need to consider the revision of certain rules of the Treaty under which the Commission operates.

<p>The negotiations now starting on a new common organisation of the market in sugar are vital for the French overseas departments because the sugar cane industry, along with bananas and rum, is one of their main export sectors. Sugar is thus still the biggest crop on the island of Réunion, which produced nearly 200 000 tonnes in the period from 1990 to 1998. The Community grants substantial support to the sugar cane industry under the agricultural component of POSEIDOM (Article 17), but the term of validity of this aid expired on 31 December 1999. The French Government has proposed to the Commission among other things that a portion of the above funds be converted into aid for transport to refineries or distilleries and called for replanting aid to be renewed. Could the Commission say what action it has taken on these proposals and, more generally, what progress has been made in the moves to – as is to be hoped – renew what is essential aid for the industry as a whole?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is indeed proposing in its draft guidelines for the new Community Initiative for rural development for the period 2000-2006, LEADER+, to target small-scale local rural areas, with a population which must, as a general rule, not be more than 100 000.</p>
<p>A similar maximum population ceiling was used under LEADER 1 and II. The Commission considers that it is essential in order to secure the local character of those rural areas selected for assistance and also for the encouragement of active community based partnerships, both features which have been central to the success of LEADER in identifying new and innovative approaches to the development of rural areas, which may serve as a model for other areas. The Commission does not, therefore, share the Honourable Member’s view that LEADER+ should be applied to wider areas. The Commission considers that such an approach could compromise the local, bottom-up character of the Initiative, and would risk that the limited financial resources available were scattered too widely to secure a genuine impact. Further, it would run counter to the principle of concentration of resources which was endorsed by the Parliament as a guiding principle for the new Structural Funds period.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0135"></a>

<p>The Commission interprets the Honourable Member’s question as referring to its proposed amendment to Directive 91/308/EEC on preventing the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering<a href="#defann_86_1" name="refann_86_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This proposal<a href="#defann_86_2" name="refann_86_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> is a response to a range of concerns far wider than the aspects raised by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>As regards the specific question of the financial interests of the European Communities, the proposal extends the definition of criminal activity given in Article 1 of the directive to fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity damaging or likely to be damaging to these interests.</p>
<p>Extending the terms of the directive, as envisaged by the proposal, to professions and categories of business other than financial establishments involved in activities likely to be used for the purposes of money laundering, has a more general scope than the laundering of gains from fraud and other illegal activities harmful to the financial interests of the Communities.</p>
<p>When the financial interests of the Communities are involved, exchanges of specific information are envisaged by Article 12 of the proposal. They concern suspicious transactions and involve both the national authorities responsible for combating money laundering as well as the Commission. The Commission stresses the fact that only these national authorities have any responsibility in the matter, so as to comply with the obligation of confidentiality and the imitations upon the jurisdiction of the Commission.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the proposed amendment to the directive does not entail natural or legal persons informing the Commission of suspicions of fraud against the Community budget.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At the present time, Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and on the labelling of beef and veal and beef-based products does not afford the Commission the possibility of approving an identification system offering the same guarantees as those resulting from ear-tagging except for bulls intended for cultural and sports events. To this end, the Commission has adopted regulation (EC) No 2680/1999 of 17 December 1999 approving an identification system for bulls intended for cultural and sports events (See OJ L326, 18.12.99, p. 16).</p>
<p>Subsequent to establishing the elements of the system for the identification of bovine animals, the Commission has been made aware that the application of ear-tags in compliance with Community requirements may prove to be unsightly in some situations such as, for example, museum farms. So in the proposed Parliament and Council regulation establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and on the labelling of meat and veal and beef-based products, abrogating regulation (EC) No 820/97 (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=1999&amp;nu_doc=0487">COM (1999) 487</a>), the Commission no longer refers exclusively to bulls, but in general to bovine animals intended for cultural or sports events (Article 4(1), final sentence). It must however be stressed that, should the Parliament and the Council accept this wording, it will be up to the Swedish authorities, if they deem it necessary, to submit a request to the Commission with a view to the recognition of an alternative system offering equivalent guarantees for the type of situation described by the Honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
