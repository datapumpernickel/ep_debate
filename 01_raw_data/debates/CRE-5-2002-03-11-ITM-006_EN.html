<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Inglewood (PPE-DE)</span></span>  <span class="bold"><span class="italic">, </span></span><span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, in the aftermath of the Enron scandal, it is tempting simply to say that these proposals for the introduction of international accounting standards into the Community are an idea whose time has come. But it is wrong to see it simply in those terms, because there is more to it than that. If Europe is to match the United States economically, we need to create a single capital market; otherwise borrowing will also be more expensive here, which in turn inevitably favours the United States. One of the over-riding imperatives of Europe's economy must be to compete in the global market, and this change is a necessary precondition to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">In its consideration of these proposals by the Legal Affairs Committee, a very wide-ranging rewording of the text has been carried out which I understand is acceptable to both the Commission and the Council and which also meets the concerns of the committee. I therefore hope that if Parliament as a whole agrees, we may be able to deal with this proposal in a single reading, which will in turn convey a significant message around the globe. In particular, some important elements have been introduced and a number should be mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">These include the following: firstly, following President Prodi's statement to Parliament last month about the comitology aspects of the Lamfalussy proposal, the Commission has agreed that the relevant and appropriate principles contained in it will be applied <span class="italic">pari passu</span> in this instance. I would therefore be extremely grateful if the Commissioner will be able to confirm this to the House now, since it is an important and crucial point to Members.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in the special case of European Community companies filing their accounts in U.S. GAAP on a regulated exchange in a third country, they will be able to defer implementation of the relevant provisions of this Regulation until 2007 as opposed to 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it has been clarified that the agreed international accounting standards will be published in their legally binding form in the Official Journal in all the official languages.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, this proposal expressly excludes the mandatory application of international accounting standards as far as SMEs are concerned. It is of course open to Member States to apply them nationally, but that is a matter for them and not for us. In any event, as a result, I understand, of a Community initiative, the International Accounting Standards Council is going to consider the whole question of accounting issues and SMEs, which of course is something which is entirely separate from what we are discussing now.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to explain to the House that this Regulation is in any event contained within the parameters of the existing European Community accounting code and that the standards themselves can only be adopted by the International Accounting Standards Committee after a rigorous and transparent process agreed by the IASC in its own properly adopted and legally enforceable constitution. It should also be made quite clear that the Commission plays an important role – as do the Member States' standard setters – in the formulation of the standards according to the IASC's due process procedures. In addition, a wide range of affected sectors in Europe have a formal relationship with the Commission in this regard through EFRAG, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, which has been established for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said in my opening remarks, in the aftermath of the Enron collapse in the United States, this proposal is timely because it is highly unlikely that such a debacle could have occurred under this approach to accounting standards, which is purposive or teleological as opposed to prescriptive. But of course, in itself, that is insufficient to avoid fraud and misfeasance. Proper enforcement, as is always the case with all legislation, is essential; and elements to achieve that are distinct from but obviously associated with standard setting. In a world where accounting standards generally register low on the Richter scale of political newsworthiness, they have a much higher profile now than is normal. For Europe to pass this legislation and apply international accounting standards would be a major step towards establishing a worldwide set of accounting rules and, what is more, a set of worldwide rules in the establishment and creation of which Europe will play an important part. Mr President, this is the prize. It is now, I believe, within our grasp. If we in Parliament support this proposal, it will mean that Parliament is seen to be serious about business and commerce, and it will show the world that Europe means business about business. And that is the goal of the financial services action plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There were many bottlenecks, most of which, fortunately, we managed to resolve. For example, we managed to arrange for the approved standards to be translated into each of the official languages and to be published. The proposal was totally unacceptable on this score. If we can put this right, this will constitute a huge step forward. In addition, as Lord Inglewood has already mentioned, thanks to various other amendments, we also managed to delineate, and better stipulate, the way in which comitology was to be applied. Time constraints prevent me from elaborating upon other improvements, but I concur with what the rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has said in this connection. I would like to confine myself to asking the Commission the following. Small and medium-sized businesses do not yet know whether, and when, their national governments will extend the scope of this Regulation to include them. They feel a little neglected. However, I am of the view that it is certainly not a pointless exercise, immediately following the Council’s approval, to devote attention, in an organised manner, to the implications of the various options which the Member States can take by applying Article 5 and thus making an attempt to achieve coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of the harmonisation of taxation legislation, it is certainly useful, in my view, to enter into consultation about the new relationship, which is to be established in various Member States, between yearly accounts law, company law and tax law and to find out whether some of these issues could be coordinated at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Commission tell me whether it intends, with these issues in mind, to set up an SME consultation, and to start a debate to find out whether European initiatives are necessary? Secondly, I should like to appeal to the Commission to ensure that, if accountancy law is to be changed, this is done in such a way as to take the interests of the SMEs into consideration in an appropriate manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission's original proposal aimed, more or less, at the transfer of all the competences for IAS rules outside this House in the guise of a general authorisation, thus letting decisions be taken by other institutions and private international bodies. This was something about which many in this House had great misgivings. I am, then, very happy that it has been possible to travel along the track laid down by the von Wogau report in the form of proposals on the Lamfalussy reports, and find here a solution and a genuine compromise which, on the one hand, makes use of the opportunities offered by IASs, whilst on the other, though, the maintenance of Parliament's rights is also guaranteed. I can only say that I welcome that inordinately.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish the Commissioner the best of luck on his forthcoming trip to America and his talks with the Securities and Exchange Commission on how the Americans use IASs. It would be a great relief to our enterprises, and also a great step forward, if he were to succeed in getting the Americans, too, to accept IASs. Such occurrences as Flow Tech, Holzmann, or, most recently in America, Enron, make one thing clear, one thing that I will give the Commissioner to think about on the journey: I believe that even if we decide on IASs in this form, there is still a very great deal left to be done in the auditing field. I do not believe it can be right that there should be a few major international firms that, on the one hand, do highly intensive consultancy work and, on the other, themselves audit what they have advised the enterprise to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that what is necessary here – and this is one of the lessons that, for example, the Bush administration in America has learned – is further legislation to ensure that consultants do not audit and that auditors cannot be consultants to the same company. My plea to the Commission is that they do some thinking along these lines and approach Parliament with early and definite proposals, so that the financial markets really do improve and become safer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We believe that the Commission’s proposal is appropriate and that Mr Inglewood’s report goes into detail on certain aspects, in particular the reference to the commitology procedure and the explicit reference to the commitments made by the President of the Commission during last February in relation to the participation of Parliament in the development of the legislation on the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as Mr Lehne has said, the adoption of international accounting standards by the Community involves a second part, the negotiation with the competent authorities in the United States – not with the government of the United States, but above all with the Securities and Exchanges Commission – of standards which prevent European companies from having to conform to dual accounting requirements in order to operate in Europe and in North American markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Inglewood has introduced a series of amendments which, in our opinion, are aimed at improving the text of the directive, within the framework of the spirit of cooperation between this Parliament and the Commission. As Mr Inglewood has said, our hope is that an agreement can be reached soon between the Commission, the Council and Parliament so that the directive can be adopted very quickly without having to go to conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, therefore, the Socialist Group will vote in favour of all the amendments. We have certain difficulties in relation to some amendments and we will still have to examine whether they are compatible with our position and, above all, we await the Commission’s opinion with regard to certain aspects of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When this report first appeared it seemed to cover a small technical matter, but this is in fact a small technical matter with the ability to make a huge difference. It is of great importance, as has already been said, to the financial services action plan and to the better functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">As Lord Inglewood has already said, it is a proposal that, politically speaking, has come at the right moment. The collapse of a corporate giant like Enron and the reverberations of such a collapse for employees, for small investors, for pensioners, convince us that, if there is a way of helping prevent such misery for some of our citizens, then we should of course pursue it. These international accounting standards seem to hold out such a promise, both within and beyond the European Union. I hope that is so.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope also, as other speakers have said, that the system involving a regulatory committee – a technical committee set up within our institutions – will provide the openness and, most importantly, the democratic accountability that this Parliament seeks. Our society, our citizens, have a huge stake in the success and health of our large corporations. It is clearly our duty to ensure that the standards by which they are governed or regulated attain the best levels of corporate governance. This report is an important step in achieving that and I can assure the rapporteur that he will have the full support of the ELDR Group in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor on this subject, which is of the highest importance, even though it may not attract publicly the attention which it deserves. I should like to start by thanking Parliament for the interest it has shown in this report, and in particular the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and its rapporteur, Lord Inglewood, and also Mrs Thyssen, for their excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">Rapid progress has been made and I hope that the present proposal may be adopted in a single reading; several Members have already referred to that possibility; and the Commission hopes that indeed will be the case. If we succeed in this it will give a strong political signal that the European Union is not only serious about achieving an integrated capital market by the year 2005, as requested by the European Council in Lisbon two years ago, but also ready to lead on the development of international accounting standards. Comparable, transparent financial reporting is an essential building block for the realisation of integrated, competitive and attractive EU capital markets to complement the single currency and so strengthen the European economy. That will also show, in particular in our relationship with the United States, how determined we are about the way we want to see things develop in future. It should pave the way for the United States to accept international accounting standards for listing purposes. I shall certainly be pressing the case when I visit Washington in the second half of May.</p>
<p class="contents">After the collapse of Enron, concern has grown, certainly in the United States but also in Europe, about the quality of financial reporting by listed companies. One must of course avoid knock-on effects that might lead to a loss of confidence among investors, shareholders and other stakeholders, including employees, in the functioning of our capital markets. Long before Enron started to make headlines in the press, Europe made the choice of international accounting standards of high quality with the potential to become truly global standards. High-quality accounting standards are the bedrock of good financial reporting and the principles-based approach of IAS will ensure that accounts reflect economic reality, thus restoring investors' confidence that things are really the way they look. The aim of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to minimise detailed rules and exemptions will defeat a culture that boils down to "where does it say that I cannot?", one which the many thousands of pages of rules-based standards of the U.S. GAAP have fostered.</p>
<p class="contents">IAS will also provide the relevant and reliable information which investors and other stakeholders need to make meaningful cross-border and cross-sector comparisons throughout the European Union. Listed European companies have long been awaiting the signal which this Parliament is now ready to give, and for EU companies it clearly means that things have started in earnest and that they must start preparing a switch-over to international accounting standards without wasting any time. This major achievement also demonstrates that our institutions can work closely together when the time comes to deliver, and I greatly welcome this. In this respect, and in response to the remarks made by Lord Inglewood and Mrs Thyssen and also, I believe, by Mr Lehne, may I underline that the commitments undertaken by the Commission on 5 February, 2002 in President Romano Prodi's declaration to this Parliament on the implementation of financial services legislation fully apply to the present proposals as well. That is the case and will remain so.</p>
<p class="contents">Those commitments apply as well to the present proposal and a clear reference to this is made in Amendment No 4 as adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on 26 February 2002. The Commission can accept all the amendments adopted unanimously by the Legal Affairs Committee, notwithstanding the repeal of Amendment No 6, which amounts more or less to the repetition of a recital.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I conclude, may I reply to three specific points made this evening. Firstly, on languages, it is indeed important that the IAS endorsed by the European Union are made available in all official languages – at the moment 11, but pretty soon 19 – and then become part of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to SMEs, a point raised in particular by Mrs Thyssen, the Commission will engage in a debate about the accounting requirements for small and medium enterprises in the context of the modernisation of the accounting directives, for which the Commission will officially present a proposal before the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is the question of the consequences of the Enron debacle. I am planning to engage in a debate about the consequences of that debacle for auditing and we are, at present, discussing with Member States a document on auditor independence which I am sure Mr Lehne will be interested to read. As soon it is available we will make it available to Members of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, a strong vote in favour of this proposal would constitute a major contribution to international and European harmonisation in the accounting field by promoting a single set of accounting standards, namely the IAS. Adopting IAS for Europe would offer increased comparability of financial information to investors and shareholders and would contribute to a return of confidence in the efficiency and effectiveness of our financial markets. It is an opportunity for European leadership which I am sure Parliament will want to seize, as do the Commission and Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
