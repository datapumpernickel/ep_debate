<p class="contents">It has been apparent even from the very first minutes of this debate that the issue of the European Union’s relations with Turkey will have a major part to play. We see the relationship with Turkey as being of fundamental significance, and Turkey as a dependable and important partner. We have to make that clear without reservations, and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that involves not constricting this relationship or reducing it to membership, but instead bearing other options in mind as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The newly-elected chairman of the Socialist Group has now made it known to us that negotiations are to be commenced with Turkey, provided that it has complied with the necessary conditions by the autumn, and, in so doing, he has acted as if Turkey’s compliance or non-compliance were at present a hidden mystery, one to be revealed in the autumn when the Commission produces its report.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, not a shred of truth in this. Far from it; everyone in this Chamber knows that Turkey, at present, does not comply with the conditions for the commencement of negotiations. That is apparent from the dominant role that the armed forces still play there. It is evident from – and here I am resorting to charitable understatement – the problematic position as regards the rule of law in Turkey, and I am mentioning only two of the conditions. Let me tell you, Mr Schulz, that we cannot reckon on any change in this regard before the autumn. I fear, therefore, that it amounts to something very like misrepresentation, not to say hypocrisy, to assert that we are starting negotiations once the conditions have been fulfilled. Are you seriously trying to tell us that they will be by the autumn? The fact is that I cannot seriously believe that they will be.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that honest dealing with Turkey is also about nobody, come the autumn, fooling us into believing that the Turks already fulfil the conditions, so that we can negotiate with them. It is also about the issue of negotiations – and of when they are to get going – not having the inevitable conclusion that they have to be started; instead, we have to be honest and frank in our dealings with them.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it very important, Mr President-in-Office, that you should bear this point of view in mind as you set to work.</p>
<p class="contents">The second relevant point is that the European public have, as we know from the elections, considerable reservations about us. If I may adapt Berthold Brecht’s phrase, we cannot elect a new public in Europe; we have to live and work with the one we have. I am therefore firmly convinced that we have to seize the opportunity presented by the debate on the Constitution to bring Europe and its citizens closer together. The debate on the Constitution offers us a unique chance to do that. Implementing the Constitution and making the public more familiar with it is a matter of obligation for us all.</p>

The least that one can say is that the European Union is a long way from achieving its objective of becoming, by the year 2010, the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, throughout Europe there is growing concern about businesses relocating, about workers being blackmailed into accepting longer working hours, and about continuing unemployment. The recovery is all the more fragile for not being based either on internal demand or on sustained public investment; instead, it remains exposed to the impact of external factors such as the rise in the value of the euro and the increase in the price of oil.</p>
<p class="contents">More than ever, Europe needs a strategy for sustainable growth and employment, and for investment in research, in major trans-European networks, in education, in knowledge and in the environment. It needs economic and social cohesion. It needs the Lisbon Strategy. Yet certain people are trying to use the present economic slow-down as a pretext to return to an ultra-liberal programme, and to destroy the achievements of Lisbon and the integration of the various economic, social and environmental dimensions into the policies of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, your Presidency’s priorities cause us great concern. You say that you support the Lisbon Agenda, and we have heard you say so. Yet your priorities – and here again we have read what you have written and we have heard what you have said – show that your approach is very unilateral and does not take into consideration the coherence of the Lisbon Agenda, which comprises the liberalisation of the market, in particular in the services sector, deregulation, and the reduction of administrative costs.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the financial perspectives – another major area for action during your Presidency – you want to restrict the Union’s budget to 1% of GDP. Yet such an initiative is incompatible not only with the efforts which have to made in research, and on the subject of which Romano Prodi has put forward some proposals, but also with the policy of territorial cohesion in the new enlarged EU. You reject any revision of the pact to take more account of economic cycles and, in particular, public-investment requirements. As far as you are concerned, public-investment policies, employment regulations and environmental regulations are really no more than obstacles, unnecessary burdens and restrictions on growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We, on the other hand, believe that all these things make the EU more competitive, and we also believe that respect for the integrity of the Lisbon Agenda will be a test of your Presidency’s success and will determine what support we shall be able to give it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Presidency is working under the motto ‘realism and ambition’, and that is something that appeals to me greatly, because, over the past few years, we have witnessed a growing trend of ever more fresh priorities being added to the agenda, and while solemn declarations are made at every Council summit, in reality they often turn out to be hollow phrases and no action is taken at all. Public disappointment and scepticism should therefore come as no surprise, and no manner of promotion campaign can do anything about that. It is therefore time we rolled up our sleeves, and that also applies to the Lisbon agenda, because, a moment ago, I heard a number of speakers on the Left of the political spectrum, and, ironically, to the right of me, saying that this Lisbon agenda is not social. However, in my opinion, the interpretation of this Lisbon agenda is extremely social. We are faced with 9% unemployment in Europe and with unemployment among young people, some of whom will never get a job. It is high time we implemented this agenda, and I would actually like to point out that we can learn an awful lot from the ten new countries in the European Union, because although they have carried out many difficult and painful reforms over the past 15 years, they have, in the process, managed to accomplish greater economic growth, from which everyone stands to gain. I therefore find it incomprehensible and also irresponsible that some parties try to undermine the Lisbon strategy. Finally, agreements should also be made about EU funding. It is a well-known fact that the Dutch Government is in favour of drastic financial cutbacks, and I should like to find out from you how this fits in with the ambitions which you mentioned in the motto, because, in addition to an effective treasury, at the moment, what Europe needs more than anything else is vision, decisive action and political leadership, and I look forward to a successful Presidency.</p>

Both the current climate change threat and the current crisis in the prices of a series of commodities, like oil, copper and other resources show us that we urgently need a de-linking of resource efficiency, energy efficiency and the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has an answer to both these questions, and that is to strengthen Europe as a leader in environmental technology and services. Already today German and Swiss companies are leading the world in providing clean water and air. Dutch companies are leading the world in urban planning. Why? It is because Europe has the strictest and most ambitious legislation on these policies. Therefore, it is not by watering down environmental policy and regulation in Europe that we will give the necessary impetus for innovation in our industries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If, as I fervently hope, all twenty-five EU countries ratify the Constitution over the coming months, this twice-yearly examination of the Union’s priorities will be abandoned in favour of a system of presidencies lasting two and a half years, which will be more stable and therefore more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">The priorities of the Dutch Presidency include enlargement, the consolidation of the reunification of our twenty-five countries, and the continuation of negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania, and soon with Croatia too. Above all, however, in December the European Council will have to take a crucial decision on whether or not to open negotiations with Turkey. On this point, may I remind you of the position of the French MEPs belonging to the <span class="italic">Union pour un mouvement populaire </span>(UMP) and of many in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. We say ‘yes’ to a preferential partnership with Turkey, but ‘no’ to its accession to the Union. In adopting that position we are absolutely in line with the statements made by Hartmut Nassauer.</p>
<p class="contents">We are counting on you, Mr Balkenende, you who are leading your country with determination and success, to strengthen the European economy by freeing it from its administrative and fiscal obstacles, by giving back to our businesses the ability to adapt to a globalised market in a European Union marked by both freedom of movement and the defence of its humanist values. The famous European model will be neither an illusion nor a mere magic formula, provided that we equip ourselves with the necessary political resources. Political resources include financial resources too, because the European budget has solidarity: solidarity between new and old Member States of the Union, between more and less favoured areas, between net contributors and beneficiaries. I should like to congratulate the Commission on the courage it has shown in lifting the taboo of the British rebate, and I should also like to congratulate the Council of Finance Ministers on having approved, at first reading, an ambitious draft budget for 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">At the last elections, European citizens showed their desire to see the creation of Europe as a reality. Let us not disappoint them. It is a heavy responsibility, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and we shall be there at your side if you contribute towards making Europe a political and effective Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no rush. In fact it could be said that it is rather risky to make spending forecasts almost ten years in advance; and what is more, perspectives which – as we in this House know - become entirely rigid rules. However, we must begin now.</p>
<p class="contents">When I talk about negotiations, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am referring to negotiations with Parliament. I am therefore delighted with what you said earlier: with Parliament and not just between national delegations in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">If you wish to lay the foundations for proper negotiations, you must remember that, throughout the process of discussing the new financial perspectives, including at the point when they are approved, the European Constitution will not yet be in force. This Parliament will not, therefore, be content with simply saying yes or no to what the Council has discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">Without going into detail, since time does not allow it, I would like to say that the Socialist Group believes that the priorities within these new perspectives are, in short, cohesion between the different regions, which has become even more important with our recent enlargement, and the disparities in income it has brought; job creation and, finally, development aid for third countries, the current Category 4, the category which has grown least since 1999, the year when the current financial perspectives began, despite the many new obligations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of these realities is the accession on the first of May of the ten to the Union’s institutions, in other words, a big step towards the re-union of Europe. From this point of view, I would like to deal with two objectives of the Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">First: the Presidency’s programme lays down fast and effective integration for the ten in the Council’s decision procedure. This is important but it is not enough. In order to have a successful enlargement and for Europe and the European economy to strengthen itself by its own means and also to be an active player in the Lisbon process, it is essential to consider not only the technical integration, but also the existing hurdles and their gradual reduction and the deepening of the content of the integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Connected to that, is the second important objective: the preparation of Agenda 2007. The aim of the Presidency is to have the basic principles and directives discussed by December 2004. Well, we are facing interesting and exciting debates. However, it must be the objective of all of us to have the successful integration feature amongst the basic principles. If I were to re-formulate this sentence in the spirit of the Netherlands’ Presidency, then I would say that it is an ambitious but realistic objective to count the successful integration as a <span class="italic">primus inter pares </span>basic principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, you mentioned the brain drain to overseas. This particularly affects us Hungarians. We support all your endeavours that bring this opinion into the basic principles of the budget. Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to the Netherlands’ Presidency for having initiated a dialogue and communication from the richness and colourfulness of our European culture. We are indeed very strong in this. We wish you much luck! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why Lisbon laid down these criteria as a separate pillar in its development.</p>
<p class="contents">The work programme of the Netherlands Presidency appears to ignore this. It proposes a series of measures to reduce administrative controls of the market, to reduce costs, even hinting at increased working times, but it makes no reference to social viability. In other words, the Netherlands Presidency implies, in a way, that liberalising the market will automatically create jobs. This, however, is precisely the philosophy that Lisbon refutes, which is why it emphasises the rest. Therefore, what we want from the Netherlands Presidency is to hear specific policies on full employment and sustainable developments: simple things.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the financial perspectives are concerned, it is hypocritical of all of us to say that we need cohesion targets and market integration without, at the same time, increasing the budget of own resources. We cannot have it both ways. For us, 1.24% of GDP is the minimum threshold for financing the new European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as immigration is concerned, if I understood correctly and did not misunderstand the views of the Netherlands Presidency, you can address it primarily as a police matter and look on immigrants as criminal elements. In other words, you can instigate fear in immigrants, instead of primarily integrating them. However, the emphasis on police work, rather than on integration in the programme is particularly worrying: it is a vicious circle which will bring about racism and crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as terrorism is concerned, of course we all know what it is and we all want to combat it, but we cannot have a work programme of a Presidency of the European Union which only talks about police measures and makes no reference to the human rights and personal freedoms which these measures often infringe. We, in Greece, experienced this problem on a daily basis during preparations for the 2004 Olympic Games and we are trying to strike the right balance. The Netherlands Presidency should therefore do likewise and stop focusing solely on policing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mistakes made at the outset, or a failure to successfully carry out the programme of work, amount to liabilities for later Presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Yours is a double responsibility in that your Presidency of the Council coincides with the beginning of a new Parliament and the allocation of portfolios to a new Commission. While this is an opportunity for continuity and for adjustments, you have also taken on long-standing liabilities, and so there are two things I call upon you to do: one is to put a stop to the Council’s blocking of a decision on the Members’ Statute and give us, by the end of this year, the Members’ Statute that we have demanded. Secondly, we need a new system for travel expenses, for only then will we be able to practically implement the new travel costs arrangements that we have decided on.</p>
<p class="contents">The second burden you have shouldered is that of the declining turnout of voters to the European elections. What we need is for regions, Member States and European institutions to adopt a uniform strategy for information and communication. This is where the signing of the Constitutional Treaty offers you an opportunity; use it as the beginning of a professional information and communication campaign. Rather than have this great European project returned to the national level, see to it that there is a Europe-wide referendum. Use the Financial Perspective to plan political priorities up to 2013, use the consideration of the Commission’s report on Turkish accession to have a debate on the European Union’s geographical boundaries and on what it is capable of doing, and produce alternatives to full membership for Turkey. And, in order that we may speedily conclude the road-pricing directive, I ask you to bring the Council round to a single line on transport policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will also refrain from saying anything about the composition of the new Commission, even though I hope that, together with the Commission’s new president-designate, you will, in tandem, strive to form a strong team, and will also succeed in doing so. Needless to say, that should be a strong team of men and women. Neither will I say anything about the Constitution, the ratification of which, I do of course hope, along with many fellow Members here, will really be brought on track. I would like to sketch out three other points.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the financial perspectives. In Flanders, we have a saying ‘de gierigheid bedriegt de wijsheid’ – penny-wise, pound-foolish. There is a lot of truth in that, and I am convinced that people north of the border, and even in the north of Holland, will understand this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Lisbon objective. It is important for everyone, including Member States, citizens, trade unions and NGOs, to be convinced that the efforts required to achieve these objectives are actually quite small compared to the risks for the future generation of our possibly doing nothing quite comfortably. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are convinced of this, and I hope that you can propagate this conviction during your Presidency of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and lastly, I should like to say a few words about the service directive. Needless to say, barriers to the free movement of services in the internal market should disappear. That does not mean, however, that everything has to be thrown out, that all protective and corrective measures have to be done away with. In my view, at least part of this service sector is socially too delicate for such action. Mr President, your workload is considerable. I hope that you can achieve your ambition. Europe needs this. You can count on our constructive attitude and I wish you every success.</p>

<p class="contents">Can the presidency deliver? That is the question. As European debates become more idealistic and polarised many people are simply turned off, as evidenced in the recent European elections. Policies adopted by socialist governments have stunted the growth of economies and drowned us and our vital businesses in costly regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p class="contents">The world economies outside Europe will show no mercy to us, nor should we expect them to. They will exploit our weaknesses and our citizens will suffer as a result. The demographic time-bomb is ticking, as more people become unproductive too soon. Nonsensical ageism removes experience and expertise often where and when it is most needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The response from all of us must be direct and urgent. We must re-energise economies, cut the cost of the state, cut superfluous regulations, complete the single market, and encourage innovation to revive the manufacturing sector in particular. Above all we have to show the people that Europe is working in a friendly way: supporting them, not smothering them, giving them more freedom to improve the quality of their lives and the lives of those close to and around them, and to achieve their aspirations in the medium and long term. That is our first duty and we should discharge it.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Balkenende,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, let us begin by once again expressing our thanks and appreciation to Commission President Prodi and his Commissioners. You have rightly pointed out that much has been achieved over the last few years: the euro, enlargement, the new Constitutional Treaty and, in this, the Commission too has played an important part. For this, very many thanks, and I look forward to working with you until the inauguration of the new Commission. You have heard words of appreciation, from Mr Poettering for example, who is also proposing to upgrade you where the team photograph of the European Council is concerned – the same goes for the President of the European Parliament for that matter. It seems a good idea to me to take another closer look at this. I would also like to thank the speakers for their contributions. Thank you for the support you have expressed for the Netherlands Presidency, but also thank you for your critical observations.</p>
<p class="contents">When I spoke earlier, I said that criticism is not at all bad, it is part and parcel of democracy. Far more serious is indifference, and today I have seen no indifference at all, and that means that we are engaged on the same thing here today and for that I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Then Mr Watson told us that it is indeed a short Presidency – three-and-a-half months in fact – in part because of the summer recess. This means that we must work effectively during our Presidency, and of course it also means that, for this reason, we are glad to be working with you, for example as regards progress in the legislative process. On behalf of the Minister of European Affairs, I should also like to appeal to you to cooperate as much as you can on this legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">Then you said that you have just under ten minutes. I have had 26 speakers, which would work out at around 23 seconds per speaker. It seems better to me to combine the subjects somewhat, and I would like to do this with reference to three subjects that you also mentioned. I believe that there are three important things for the Europe of the future. First of all, credibility and fair play, secondly, being forward looking and thirdly, having time for the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, something about the subject of credibility and fair play: let us begin with the discussions of the Copenhagen criteria. If criteria have been laid down, then they must be taken seriously. This is true for a country such as Romania. I have spoken to Prime Minister Nastase about this. It is their move, and they will have to change their legislation and other things. The same credibility and fair play must characterise the debate about Turkey. I have listened carefully to you. There are different views in the European Parliament, but at the moment I would like to say: let us pay heed to consistency in decision-making and procedures. The term ‘<span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda</span>’ has been mentioned here, and it is all about an honest process in which we are strict in the verification of the criteria, but at the same time do not change the rules during the game. This means, moreover, that we shall listen with interest to the findings of the European Commission when the report on Turkey is published at the beginning of October and this will also set the tone for the decision-making in December. The Netherlands Presidency is working on a decision so that, in a few years, people will be able to say: it was a tenable decision and it was the right decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Again where credibility and fair play are concerned, a brief word about the Stability Pact. Many of you have spoken about this as well. As far as the Presidency is concerned, the Stability Pact is not simply a matter of a few criteria, it is about the goals that are sought with them, and I have, for example, heard that there has been talk of the future reliable funding of pensions; it is important to look at the objectives behind the Pact again and, partly for this reason, a declaration about the Stability Pact has been attached to the recently agreed Constitutional Treaty that once again confirms that it is a ‘rule-based system’ and that we must also take these criteria seriously. The debates will of course continue; the Commission is working on it, and we shall also be discussing it further at the level of Ecofin, and the debate about this will undoubtedly continue with you too. It is of course important that we take the rules seriously precisely in view of the credibility of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A third point concerns the ratification of Europe’s Constitutional Treaty. Many of you have spoken about the referendums to be held, the debates that will take place. Let me first consider what Mr Blokland has said. He says: are we not running too far ahead of the new constitution? I do not think that we can run ahead of it to the extent that no decisions are being taken that have a legal basis in the constitution. That means that you cannot run ahead of it, out of respect for the ratification process. On the other hand we can also see that 25 governments have ranged themselves behind the constitution, and the constitution is going to be signed in Rome on 29 October. That too is a political fact; we are going to have to take account of the ambitions in the constitution in our planning. This is true for example of the discussion of public access – Mrs Buitenweg spoke about this. It is of course true that matters will be settled once there is a new treaty, but we can see what – even running ahead of it – we ought to be able to do. There has also been some discussion of whether we should not work on a referendum on a single day. Moreover, I understand this wish. This point has been raised regularly by Austria too. I should, however, refer to the fact that the constitutional traditions are different. The position of a referendum is not the same in each Member State. For this reason too it will not, I think, be possible to organise everything on one day, simply on the grounds of the different constitutional traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is important that we have time for coordination, for a proper debate and, in that context too, there will be discussions with one another about it in connection with RASEP.</p>
<p class="contents">Where credibility and fair play are concerned, another brief word about the financial perspectives. We all know that this is a sensitive subject, with major differences of opinion. Reference has been made to a letter about the 1%. I am not standing here as the Dutch Prime Minister. I am standing here as the President of the European Council, who is responsible for a fair process in which the different arguments are exchanged. A process that must be characterised by openness and transparency. A process that will also have to be characterised by good contacts with your Parliament. I know that you appreciate the intensive involvement of Parliament and, as part of the conciliation, agreements were made on 16 July about contacts between the Presidency and the European Parliament. I think that there is a need to have an honest debate about posteriority and about priorities, about the question of how we could also do things differently in Europe, and I think that we should also heed the observation from Flanders, ‘penny-wise and pound-foolish’. I have listened carefully to you. On the other hand, we must also always see that we apply the funds as best we can, are efficient and that we also see how, sometimes with the same money, we can achieve more. All these elements must have their place in an honest and open debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to my second point: being forward looking. For I have so clearly sensed in your contributions that you are saying ‘let us have time for the Europe of the twenty-first century, time for the future’. Many speakers have spoken about the importance of the European economy and the strengthening of the economic structure and, in that context, you have asked for a lot of attention for the Lisbon process. Mrs In 't Veld for example has raised this in no uncertain terms. It is good to say again that the Lisbon process will have to be characterised by three elements: it is about growth and about the strengthening of technology, of knowledge and of innovation. Secondly, it must be about social cohesion, the social cohesion of which Mr Wurtz, Mr Poettering, Mr Schulz and others have spoken. I have also nearly already had a debate with Mr van den Berg, my esteemed countryman, who made a number of critical remarks. Moreover, after Mr Schulz had already said let us have time for social cohesion, you said again ‘how does that fit in with this agenda’?</p>
<p class="contents">May I remind you of Mr Kok’s report, the first Kok report of the employment task force, the ‘jobs, jobs, jobs’ report. In my view a good connection is made in that report between dynamism in Europe and social content and, in preparation for the discussion here and in preparation for our work, I have this week also had discussions with the representatives of the European trade union movement. I asked them whether they can identify with that first Kok report, the report of the employment task force, and I had a positive response to the content of this report from the Secretary-General of the European trade union movement. It seems to me that we could go a long way with the content of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is sustainability. When I spoke earlier, I referred to the importance of concern for the environment. This too is part of the Lisbon agenda; and, if we are talking about strengthening the economy, then, Mr van den Berg, this includes doing justice to reduction of the administrative burden. We all know that it is sometimes difficult to be innovative and to be successful even as a company. We may then do very well to take a look at this administrative burden. I am looking forward to a good debate with you about this very important subject, because we can talk about a treaty, we can talk about the citizen, but it is in the interest of this citizen that there are more jobs in Europe, that there are opportunities for our children and grandchildren and that, in 30 or 40 years, Europe will still be in a strong position, on the global stage as well. It is indeed a combination of growth, of social cohesion and of sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point, when it comes to Europe’s focus upon the future, concerns the Justice and Home Affairs Council agenda: doing justice to the constitutional state in Europe, responding to security and fighting terrorism. Mr Schulz has rightly said ‘make sure that the institutions are in order’. In this context you referred specifically to the director of Europol. Last Monday it was decided that the procedure should be restarted, and there is a commitment from all the Member States that, precisely because of the arguments you mentioned, a new director should be appointed during the Netherlands Presidency. You are quite right: if you are working on security, then the institutions have to be in order.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Of course it goes further when we talk about the Justice and Home Affairs Council agenda. There will have to be a follow-up to the Tampere process. We shall, for example, have to ensure that the discussion of asylum and migration can be moved forward. Mention has been made of whether we should not have more QMV, majority decision-making, and I think that it is good to say again that the general aspiration is of course towards QMV. However, we are of course dependent on the Member States and when there is more room for manoeuvre, then this area too will become easier. I have listened carefully to you, to Mrs Buitenweg for example, who is critical of a directive relating to asylum. We were aware of your point of view, and here you have raised it once more in no uncertain terms. The point now is that there is a directive requiring asylum seekers to have a right to an actual legal remedy. Moreover, the question of whether an appeal must have standard suspensive effect is left to the Member States, as you know. How does that happen, because the different legal systems vary enormously? Which is why this formula has been chosen. If, moreover, there is no question of a standard suspensive effect of an appeal, then the directive requires that the Member States determine when an asylum seeker can ask for suspensive effect. With regard to the question of whether it is possible first to expel asylum seekers and only then to allow them to lodge an appeal, I would say the following: the directive states that all regulations must be in conformity with international law, including the European Human Rights Treaty. The standards that are contained therein and in the jurisprudence of the Court will therefore have to be observed.</p>
<p class="contents">Then it is good to refer to another point, the point about the constitutional state, and in this context Mr Schulz has referred to Guantanamo Bay. This subject has your interest and rightly so. The European Union has always demonstrated its concern about the situation in Guantanamo Bay and, on several occasions and at several levels in its contacts with the United States, has spoken out in favour of the treatment of the detainees meeting the standards of the Geneva Conventions and human rights. Just last week there was consultation at official level between the European Union and the United States in which the US explained the setting up of combatant status review tribunals following the recent judgments of the American Supreme Court. The EU representatives passed on the concerns that remain on the European side, including those relating to the creation of a new category of detainees, the so-called hostile combatants. You are aware of this. In its contacts with the United States, the Netherlands Presidency will keep seeking attention for the concerns that exist regarding the status and treatment of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I come to my last point, and you have said it clearly, it is about the Europe of the citizen. How does the citizen experience Europe? What does Europe mean for welfare, for the prosperity of citizens? I then discern two voices. One voice says: we see mistrust in the citizen, there is euroscepticism. Is there sufficient support in the population, for the implementation of the Lisbon strategy for example? That was one sign, the critical comment. On the other hand there are also voices – Mr Eurlings’ was a very clear one – in favour of an efficient Union with the ability to take action, and I would like to underline his words; if we want Europe to mean something to the citizen, then we must make progress in the areas of security, asylum issues, the economy, subjects that must be taken up with vigour, and I believe that you gain the trust of the citizen when Europe is a living force that can operate with authority and that contributes to the resolution of issues that concern the citizen. That is what it is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">What appealed to me in the words of Mr Poettering was that he said let us also have time for the psychological dimension, because we have a Europe of 25, and Member States and people must be able to identify with the other Europe, and it is good to bring this psychological side closer from time to time, because we are so accustomed to talking in terms of what does Europe cost me, what does Europe do for me, how are the finances doing? However, let us also have time for the question of what makes us Europeans? What is the psychological side of it all? What are the values in Europe that bind us? Often we have far too little time for this. I noticed in 2002 on the eve of enlargement that there was a kind of enthusiasm about us becoming one again and, afterwards, we were talking worldwide about Iraq and difficult issues, but let us ensure that the European fire lives in people, that Europe is not something abstract, something belonging to bureaucrats in Brussels and Strasbourg or even to ourselves, but that it is something that lives in the hearts and minds of people. In my view that will also be the attitude if you talk about values in Europe. We shall take initiatives on this point. Freedom, solidarity and respect.</p>
<p class="contents">You are dedicating yourselves to the community of values of the twenty-first century and, as President of the European Council, I am very conscious that, when it comes to progress in the area of the fight against terrorism, a powerful implementation of the Lisbon strategy, having time for the follow-up to Tampere and all those other subjects, we can only be successful when we have a high level of cooperation between your Parliament, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council, and therefore I am so delighted with the contributions you have made this morning and this afternoon, not only your observations of support, but also your critical observations. I have listened carefully to the critical observations; they were probing, and we shall take them into account in our Presidency. If we are having a discussion here, it is not for its own sake or because we are working simply as politicians. We are doing all this with a view to the interests of citizens. This is what it is all about, and this is what we are dedicating ourselves to.</p>

<p class="contents">I thank Prime Minister Balkenende for his speech, his response and especially for the cooperation with which his term has begun. We have started to work together and we are in perfect agreement as to our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to make two recommendations. First, when we talk of the Financial Perspective we really must remember that the Commission has made an incredible effort to put on the table the minimum resources needed to achieve the objectives that the Member States have given us and to use these resources in the best way possible. Secondly, the Commission has listened very carefully to the dialogue of cultures. Over these years, we in the Commission have been deeply committed and have succeeded in setting up the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for a Dialogue of Cultures, which will begin its work under the Dutch Presidency. I ask you to launch this instrument, to use it and to really make it a forum for the active dialogue that we need.</p>

<p class="contents">The speedier and more efficient promotion of capitalist restructurings, the changes in the labour market and to working times, further privatisation of public-sector services, pressure for new reductions to pensions and leaner social security systems and insistence on the Lisbon strategy and anti-grass roots policies in general demonstrate once again that the ΕU only serves big business.</p>
<p class="contents">The shaping of the Tampere strategy and the promotion of new measures to repress the grass-roots movement which blatantly infringe personal and social freedoms, such as personal files on workers, monitoring all telecommunications, handing data over to the USA and strengthening the prosecuting and intelligence authorities on the pretext of terrorism, are all meeting with vigorous reaction on the part of the workers and the legal world.</p>
<p class="contents">The strengthening of the mercenary European army, its now definitive presence in the Balkans, the creation of direct intervention units and the synchronised defence of the new order and imperialist interests by the EU and the USA, run counter to the will of the people for peace and social progress.</p>
