This sound ecological principle is enshrined in European law. The Spanish government tried in vain to block this framework directive on water because of its National Hydrological Plan. This megalomaniac and wrong-headed plan of the Aznar government aims to pipe water from the River Ebro over 900 kilometres down the coast to Southern Spain. The cost will be in excess of EUR 18 billion between now and 2008. The Aznar government wants Europe to give an annual subsidy of EUR 1 billion. This injudicious plan contravenes both the spirit and the letter of the framework directive on water. It contravenes the habitat directive on 82 counts and the birds directive on 108 counts.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the Aznar government will label this plan a national economic priority, but it will also have to prove to the European Commission that there are no alternatives. However, there <span class="italic">are </span>alternatives! Desalination of brackish and salt water will be 50% cheaper for Central and Southern Spain than the Aznar plan, and apart from that is much more flexible, small-scale, and demand-oriented. Another method would be to introduce cost-covering prices for water and to irrigate plants individually rather than submerging the fields and allowing between 90% and 95% of the precious water to evaporate. Israel provides a good example of this. This is why the European Commission should reject the Aznar plan and stop the flow of EU funds into it.</p>
<p class="contents">This Aznar plan is 200 times worse than the plan for an industrial estate between Aachen and Heerlen. On the German-Dutch border the European Commission has rightly cut off the flow of EU funds because of the threat to the hamster population. Surely it cannot be that the European Commission as the Guardian of the Treaties is operating a double standard?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware that the Aznar government asked 83 Spanish scientists to carry out studies into this injudicious water plan and that that same government is now refusing to publish results it deems unfavourable? Does the Commission approve of 60 villages in Spain being wiped off the map? Does the European Commission find it acceptable that a landslide could dislocate the operation of the Itoiz dam and threaten the Ascó nuclear power station? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that we are here to try to provide some answers and, more importantly, to be able to discuss with the Commission a particularly important subject, which is the uneven distribution of water resources on European territory, which is related to variations in geographical, geological and climatic conditions, but which also results from human activity such as urbanisation, deforestation and pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to uneven distribution, it is logical to consider the possibility of carrying out water transfers in some regions. It is unacceptable to let some areas run dry, when other areas have adequate resources to help them.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament mentioned this idea in January 1998 in its resolution on the technological feasibility of trans-European hydraulic networks.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow Members in the European Parliament and I believed, quite rightly in my view, that trans-European hydraulic networks, which would carry out large scale inter basin water transfers, could perhaps be an appropriate solution, enabling water resources to be shared within the European Union. In addition, however, and it is important to stress this, it is obviously completely out of the question to take over a Member State’s water resources unless that Member State gives its express consent.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost three years after the vote on this resolution, questions are still being asked. Basically, the European Union has no experience at all in establishing such networks. In order to bridge this gap, prospective studies should be carried out on the feasibility of this work, as well as an analysis of the physical impact that this type of trans-European hydraulic network would have on aquatic environments and other areas protected under Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">To this day, information on possible conclusions of these studies has not been passed on to us. I find this deplorable, and I do not know if the Commission will have anything to tell us today about this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to bear in mind the irreversible nature of any projects that might be undertaken. It is hard to imagine these facilities being challenged in the short or medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, essential to investigate every possible way of improving existing structures and, wherever possible, to apply the principle that it is advisable, first and foremost, to optimise our water management, rather than to invest money. It is, therefore, important, in the long term, to establish a system in which responsibility is assigned for the quantity and quality of the water transferred, if there is a need for it to be transferred, and to establish a process to monitor this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, and I am in agreement with my fellow Member on this particular point, we have the framework directive on water, which has come into force. We must ensure that it is implemented correctly in national law and that it is respected in the potential and more technical context of water transfers being carried out between Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As spokesperson for <span class="italic">Convergencia Democrática de Cataluña</span> in the European Parliament, I would like to express that my party, and also the Catalan Government, of which we are a part along with <span class="italic">Unió Democràtica de Catalunya</span>, do not agree with the proposals from the Spanish laid down in the aforementioned plan. In the case that most directly affects Catalonia, we suggest an alternative based on transferring one fifth of the volume of water proposed by the Spanish (specifically from the river Ebro, which has been mentioned here) the use of desalination plants (which have also been suggested here as a valid alternative), better use of what is available in the current channels and finally, transfer from the Ródano.</p>
<p class="contents">And this is where this plan enters into a European dimension. We have been saying for years that one of the most serious problems that the most-developed societies, such as European societies, have to solve, in the medium and long term, is the shortage of water caused by the development of our urban centres and the locations of our new economic activities, which requires a new type of water management. We cannot escape from this reality and we also need to consider it from a European perspective, because the situation demands it.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not understand the resistance against limiting transfers between basins, while maintaining State borders. In the case of Spain, there is complete opposition from the Spanish to this possibility, but it is, however, accepted for Portugal. We therefore stress that water management needs to have a European perspective, that transfers from basins irrespective of the borders between the Member States need to be considered because, among other things, the aim of the European Union is a Europe without borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">‘Much of the policies, legislation and standards needed to achieve our objectives for water quality and use have already been put in place. The main challenge is ensuring the full and proper implementation of the existing legislation and achieving the integration of the Community’s water quality objectives into the other sectoral policies such as agriculture, industry and regional policy… Member States also need to take steps to ensure that they are integrated into local planning and land-use decisions… national, regional and local authorities need, amongst other things, to introduce measures to improve the efficiency of water use and to encourage changes in agricultural practices necessary to protect water resources and quality.’</p>
<p class="contents">It goes on to cover some aspects of saving water, efficient use of water, land-use planning and other aspects. It is true that this debate has arisen here because there have been a great number of floods in Europe that are probably the result of bad water management, but it is also true that currently the biggest plan proposed in Europe for radical change in water management is in our country. We are focusing on saving water, efficiency, different agricultural practices and land-use, which is what the forthcoming Spanish water plan should be. We are very concerned, Commissioner, that directives such as the framework directive on water, the habitat directive, the directive on environmental impact assessment and the birds directive can be violated. These four directives are now the backbone of the forthcoming sixth environment action programme. If they were violated, the European Commission would be helping to make it impossible for the sixth plan to be implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It applies the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive does not prohibit water transfers per se. However it imposes a binding legal requirement that they should not harm the environment. It seems particularly important in this context that since the directive entered into force on 22 December 2000 a strict non-deterioration clause has applied, which should prevent a repetition of past errors. The possibilities for derogation are restricted and subject to mandatory conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive points out the importance of integrating the protection and sustainable management of water into other Community policy areas. When a Natura 2000 may be affected, the normal procedure as provided for in Article 6 of the Habitats Directive should be applied in sequence: a search for alternative solutions, assessment of the overriding public interest and as a last resort, compensatory measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The water framework directive will bring radical changes to Europe’s water industry. But the directive is also an opportunity for a thorough rethink of our various national water industries and water legislation and for opening up new fields of business for national suppliers and undertakings. Water offers industry tremendous opportunities to create more value added for all by opening up the markets. Increased efficiency through new forms of cooperation between private industry and municipal suppliers in the planning, construction and operation of plants is the first essential step in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">A second step must then be to increase value added through exports. Know-how in particular, where some Member States already have a number of strong undertakings, offers the opportunity of increasing exports by paying more attention to canvassing foreign markets – but obviously exporting only to an ecologically acceptable extent. Everyone would gain from that. Municipalities and consumers would save on costs. Producers would find new markets. I believe everyone would gain from exporting water in the same way as other countries export their gold in the form of oil; we in Austria, for example, have white liquid gold in the form of water. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sornosa Martínez (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that this House has had another opportunity to talk about the Spanish water plan and about Community legislation, and I say another opportunity because, as you will recall, a total of three oral questions have now been put in my name on this issue, but I also regret that in the end the initial question agreed with the Verts/ALE and GUE/NGL groups was not included on the agenda in its original form, and was replaced by these individual questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the content of the previous answers from Mrs Wallström, I must point out to Mrs García-Orcoyen that I am surprised at the sudden change of position that there appears to be between the Commission’s reply to us and what the honourable Member says she was told. I would like to ask Mr Liikanen to clarify this on behalf of Mrs Wallström. Mrs García-Orcoyen said, as was reported by various Spanish media, that the Commission had answered to her that the Spanish plan did not violate Community legislation. I must ask you, honourable Member, not to distort the Commission’s position. What Mrs Wallström has been saying is that the Commission has not made any statement on whether or not the Spanish national water plan violates Community legislation because it considers it to still be a draft and that it cannot therefore make a decision, as it does not have all the necessary information to rule on this. I ask you please, Mrs García-Orcoyen, not to say something that is not true.</p>
<p class="contents">However, regardless of whether or not the Spanish national water plan, as it stands, violates Community legislation, we are going to take a brief look at it, not only because of the effects of the planned work on LIFE areas, on fauna and flora (and I thank the GUE/NGL group for picking up this issue from my previous questions) but also because of many other aspects that can be seen. Would you like an example? The framework directive says that no movement of water can take place unless there has been a rigorous prior assessment of the need for it and unless all the possible alternatives have been exhausted. Yesterday in Spain we found out that the government is now considering reducing the transfer from the Ebro by half through measures such as saving water in agriculture and re-using it. We strongly doubt that this reduction is a counter-proposal. It seems more like an alteration of concessions in order to ultimately distribute the same volume of water. However, whatever the case, it goes without saying that measures such as saving and re-using water are considered to be fundamental in the alternative plan put forward by our party the <span class="italic">Partido Socialista</span>. If the transfer could supposedly have been done from the start with the same amount of water that is now being proposed – i.e. half the amount – does this not show that the government did not look into all the socio-economic implications, the alternatives and the availability of the resource in detail before its proposal?</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, you are aware that the framework directive says that participation from citizens is very important and, so far, associations such as ADENA, <span class="italic">Ecologistas en Acción</span> or groups of experts have not received an official response to their very well-documented allegations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also talk about the deterioration of water, which is dealt with in Articles 1 and 4 of the framework directive. These articles establish the objective that the current state of water should not deteriorate, and it also says that this should be complied with from the entry into force of the directive, i.e. 22 December 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">This implies that the current Spanish national water plan is not compatible with the framework directive because, as the work involved is planned, there will undoubtedly be serious changes to ecosystems and to the quality of the water.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me to briefly explain the Group of the Party of European Socialists views water management. We believe that water is a common resource and therefore something that is governed more by solidarity than by market forces. Any water plan should be more than a series of infrastructures and transfers. Transferring water should be the last resort, to be done only when all possible alternatives have been exhausted and when it has been proven that it does not damage the environment. Any water management measure should be accompanied by parallel plans on irrigation and forest resources, and taking into account climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that there is a great deal more that I could say, but I can assure you that what Mrs Wallström did say in the February part-session is that the European Union will never fund, and will never agree with, any plan that does not respect the environment.</p>

<p class="contents">Plans cannot be established by law behind citizens’ backs and without taking into account their opinions, the opinion of social agents and of the scientific community, the territories affected, through development considerations, which focus more on concrete than on where to get water from and actually assessing who needs it and why.</p>
<p class="contents">As Andalusians, from one of the driest areas in the European Union, with very considerable water requirements, due to the two main economic activities, agriculture and tourism, and with absolutely unpredictable weather, we are concerned about the efficiency of the project, the cost/benefit relationship, the real possibility of these projects supporting the area and not causing conflict between communities. Our hydrological plan would always start with the word ‘save’, and the last words would be ‘transfer’ and ‘desalination’.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the best reservoir is saving. Our duty is to ask for water, but also to demand that efforts first be made to make the best possible use of the existing resources, valuing this scarce resource as it should be valued, improving irrigation in agriculture, investing in optimising the efficiency of distribution networks – which are in many cases obsolete and have major leaks – regaining control of hydraulics and regenerating soil and vegetation.</p>
<p class="contents">Special attention needs to be paid to underground water, preventing it from being over-used, to sewage treatment and to the essential environmental impact studies, particularly in areas such as mine, where specially protected natural areas are a precious asset to be preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">These plans also need to be in line with the Community directives on water, Natura sites, habitat, birds, etc., in conjunction with the national irrigation plans that should be in accordance with the forthcoming review of the common agricultural policy and rural development in order to deepen essential sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the opportunity to draw up a sustainable, innovative and model plan. Let us do so. Now, more than ever, we can’t please everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Water is a product that is essential to life itself. It is also a strategic factor for development and, as such, is an issue that concerns everyone, a point that has already been emphasised here and rightly so. If we accept this view, then today we must develop a joint vision for the planning and management of shared rivers. At European level and within the United Nations, the Helsinki Convention and, more specifically, its protocol on the protection and use of cross-border rivers and international lakes, represent a framework of international law that contains this vision and these new principles.</p>
<p class="contents">As is well known, Portugal has played an active role in the drafting of the directive on water management, in an attempt to ensure that priority was given to fundamental aspects concerning the protection and sustainable use of water, bearing in mind the climatic and geographic conditions of the Iberian Peninsula. It should be understood that Portugal has indeed played this active role. Portugal and Spain are in quite unequal positions, given that we are a downstream country, in other words, Portugal has no rivers that flow into Spain, but Spain does have rivers that flow into Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, when managing their water resources, our neighbours may adopt measures that affect Portuguese interests, but there is nothing that we, on the other hand, can do in terms of our water resources that would directly affect Spanish interests. The joint management of shared hydrological basins within the framework of international law imposed by the directive that I have already mentioned, is therefore a fundamental approach, which must govern the behaviour of those with political responsibility for this particular sector, both in bilateral negotiations and in a multilateral framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that Spain’s new hydrological plan is a step in the right direction, since it has stopped decanting water, mainly from the Douro and Tagus rivers, which are shared between Portugal and Spain. The directive in fact constitutes an extremely important protection network, since it adopts the coordination of the measures for hydrological basin management from the standpoint that these are not considered to be units defined by administrative or political borders. With the aim of establishing an integrated water management system which will make the best use of the appropriate objectives for the specific conditions of the European Union’s regions, the regulations of the framework directive will facilitate the implementation, both now and in future, with the cooperation of national governments, of hydrological plans that take account of such important factors as water quality, the preservation of sufficient water flows, the climate and the protection of biodiversity and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can also be sure that we are far from paying the subject the attention it deserves. Of course it would be an illusion to think we can solve water problems by pumping water from areas of supposed surplus to areas where there is a shortage.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are saying that parts of Europe sometimes have floods and that the water could perhaps be more fairly distributed, we must bear in mind that those floods are themselves the outcome of mistakes in water management. It is high time far greater attention was paid to local and regional water management. Water problems must, as a rule, be solved where they arise, and there they must be dealt with within an acceptable financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The neglect of one potential source of water has been criminal: the conversion of salt water into industrial and process water. The prospects in this sector are tremendous. Complete liberalisation of water will result in it being used by industry in a way that will bring enormous ecological problems in the long term. We must stop that before it happens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr de Roo, about two months ago you said that the Spanish Government and the Spanish Members voted against the framework directive. Either you were not at that vote or you did not realise that, without exception, we voted in favour of the framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this is a framework directive that – and I agree with what has been said here by several speakers – is going to promote a new culture in terms of water in European countries, based on criteria of efficiency and quality of water resources. No one can deny this, much less so the <span class="italic">Partido Popular</span> or the Spanish Government.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me, Mr de Roo, that your Group is particularly interested in the Spanish water plan. You could have put the question more directly from the start. First of all, I would like to know if you have read it. Do you have precise knowledge of the Spanish water plan or are you echoing other people’s positions and a political opportunism that could of course be risky?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think that Mrs Sornosa should tell me where she has seen me saying that I said that the Spanish water plan might contradict the framework directive. The water plan is currently an open draft, in the process of consultation with all the parties concerned, although none of them has wanted to make use of this facility. It is therefore difficult for it to violate any directive, and therefore, any information either for or against this – such as some that has appeared in the press – is absolutely unwarranted. This is what I interpreted from the Commission’s position and what I have maintained throughout. I never said anything else, Mrs Sornosa.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been talk in this debate about the matter of alternative plans and desalination plants. Unfortunately, I cannot answer all of that in detail due to lack of time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it is first and foremost, of course, something that must be decided in Spain itself. Taking a longer view, however, I have to say that the south’s water supply is our concern too. A question as important as this cannot be left to the Spanish alone. I can quite imagine that in 10 or 20 years’ time we shall have to be dealing with very different projects about which we dare not even think today.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is something else I should like to mention briefly, that is the growing willingness to privatise the water industry. People are thinking about it, and I expect the Commission is too. The Ministry of Economy in Berlin has now made a study of the pros and cons of these issues. Personally, I would be very reluctant to privatise water. I know that Great Britain already has experience of this, but it is at least a subject we should approach very cautiously. It would raise problems with far-reaching constitutional consequences for our Member States. To give just one small example, in Germany we have around 4 000 municipal water companies, in France 2 or 3 large companies. When we go for privatisation, this means that the small undertakings are simply bought up. That cannot be what such liberalisation is all about. It is something we surely do not want. I do not want to go into any more detail now, I have no time to do so, but I believe it is a subject we shall have to deal with more closely in the months or years ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Spanish national water plan is a general policy document to be followed by a large number of detailed projects. The national water plan is not comparable with a river basin plan under the water framework directive. Such river basin plans require as their basis a thorough analysis of the environmental impact and economic aspects – a task to be completed under the water framework directive by the end of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, a strict deterioration clause applies; impacts and measures that cause deterioration of a water body are prohibited, unless the Member State invokes one of the limited derogation clauses, which in turn are subject to meeting a range of conditions, including the environmental impact and economic analysis mentioned. Only on the basis of those facts will the Commission be able to fully assess whether the operational measures under the Spanish national water plan comply with the water framework directive and other directives, such as the bird protection or habitats directives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
