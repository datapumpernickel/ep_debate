If you saw the amendments provision which I have here, I am certain that its tabling on the part of the Tabling Office conceals a political expediency which I also denounce. To close, I repeat that, if it has not already made the change and does not intend to do so, the matter of the Tabling Office will be raised by me at the Conference of Presidents of the political groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the honourable Member can wait for a moment and listen to what I have to say, it may help inform him on any subsequent points of order he wishes to raise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to cover both the question of the extension of the European Agency for Reconstruction's mandate until the end of 2006 and the question of the Commission's proposals for helping Northern Cyprus. There is a connection between the two and I will make that clear in my remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to start by paying tribute to the Agency and to Richard Zink for the splendid work done since 2000 to help Serbia-Montenegro, including Kosovo and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The Agency was set up to deliver aid fast and effectively to communities which were in urgent need of it. That is exactly what it has done. The independent external evaluation of the Reconstruction Agency has concluded that the Agency has done an excellent job in fulfilling its original mandate. If the House remembers, it was a Commission Task Force for Kosovo, established just after the end of the conflict in July 1999, that laid the basis for the establishment of the Agency in February 2000. Since then its key positions have been held by detached Commission officials with long experience in managing our assistance. The Agency's record of success is the basis for the Commission's proposal to maintain it in its present format until the end of 2006, when the current assistance programme for the Western Balkans – the CARDS programme – also expires.</p>
<p class="contents">On the strength of this positive evaluation, the Commission has not proposed any other substantive change to the Agency regulation as it stands. We have, however, given a great deal of attention to the amendments tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in particular to the suggestion to submit a Commission report on the future of the Agency by June 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure the House will appreciate that the important debate on the new Community financial perspective for 2007-2013 will have an impact on how to deliver assistance to the Western Balkans. We therefore feel it realistic to set the end of 2005 rather than the middle of 2005 as a deadline. Also, as the committee has requested, and in order not to leave any doubt about the future of the Agency, we will ensure that any proposal to extend the Agency beyond 2006 should be made by the Commission by 31 March 2006 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">For formal reasons, we have not deemed it appropriate to accept as a legal requirement an obligation to report on the division of tasks between our delegations and the operational centres of the European Agency for Reconstruction. The existence in the same country of both the Agency and the delegations calls for close cooperation on the ground to ensure that our assistance effort is not dissipated in any way. We have made great efforts to ensure that any difficulties are addressed by making the necessary changes to administrative procedures. However, we will continue to be available to discuss with the Committee on Foreign Affairs any concrete issues that it thinks could hamper the Agency's work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to underline once again the very important job which the Agency has done. When I became a Commissioner in the autumn of 1999, there was considerable concern as to whether we would be able to deliver assistance sufficiently rapidly in the Western Balkans. The Agency did the job extremely well and I want to pay tribute again to all those who have been responsible for that.</p>
<p class="contents">In order not to jeopardise the effective performance and operations of the Agency in the Western Balkans, we have also found it sensible to go ahead with the original proposal to extend the time limit of the Agency's mandate and not to await the final outcome of the Council's discussions on the assistance package for the Northern Cyprus community and the extension of the geographical scope of the Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the current mandate of the Agency expires at the end of next month, the positive opinion of Parliament today is essential so as not to interrupt our assistance to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to Serbia and Montenegro, including Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the Commission's proposals for assisting Northern Cyprus, in the course of which I shall try to answer the point of order the honourable Member raised earlier. As the House is aware, the Council invited the Commission, after the failure of the referendum on the reunification of Cyprus in April 2004 – and I would like to wholly associate myself with everything that my colleague, Commissioner Verheugen, said about that – to bring forward comprehensive proposals to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community. On 7 July, the Commission duly adopted a comprehensive package of trade and aid measures, as requested by the Council. Although today we are only discussing the Rothe report on the financial instrument, I would like to stress again the political importance of the package, which aims at facilitating the reunification of Cyprus by means of financial assistance and trade under preferential conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a Council regulation establishing a legal instrument for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community creates a specific financial instrument for an amount of EUR 259 million, to be implemented from 2004 to 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I will explain to the honourable Member why it is we have argued that heading 7 is the correct heading for this assistance. The financial instrument aims to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging economic development, with particular emphasis on the economic integration of the island through approximation and alignment with the acquis, mainly through TAIEX, and by improving contacts between the two communities and with the European Union. Most of the activities will therefore be similar to the pre-accession activities financed under heading 7, which appears to us to be the most suitable financial perspective heading for this particular assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Priority will be given to investments in the field of infrastructure, transport – including links between the two communities – and environment projects such as waste disposal, sewerage and improvement of the water supply, water quality and the distribution system. Rural development, as well as measures concerning small and medium enterprises, will be another priority. Other objectives are social policy, labour market policies, vocational training and treatment of illegal immigrant workers, as well as reconciliation, confidence-building measures and bicommunal projects.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards implementation of the funds, different options have been carefully examined by the Commission. We finally propose that the Commission be enabled to entrust the European Agency for Reconstruction with the implementation of large infrastructure projects under this regulation, and amendment of the Agency Statute to this effect is considered in the Samuelsen report which we are also discussing here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agency option is clearly the most suitable as regards economy, efficiency and effectiveness. It would allow the Commission to rapidly deliver assistance to the Turkish Cypriot community after the regulation is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes Parliament's support for the financial instrument as expressed in the Rothe report on the proposal. Concerning the proposed amendments, I think the House is aware that these have already been discussed in depth in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets. The Commission is grateful for the proposals made by those committees and we can support the substance of the majority of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, also like to take this opportunity to underline that in our judgement it is regrettable that the Council has not yet been able to agree, after nearly four months of discussion, on the text of the financial instrument. Implementation of the assistance could start immediately after the adoption of the regulation and the Commission has already taken the necessary preparatory steps.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the solution to the Cyprus problem, the conditions still do not exist for a new international initiative. In my view the Annan Plan remains the only realistic basis for a comprehensive settlement. Concerning its possible role in any new process aimed at a settlement, the Commission remains ready to support efforts towards a settlement that would permit a reunified Cyprus to be fully integrated into the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To that end, the Council invited the Commission to bring forward comprehensive proposals, with particular emphasis on the economic integration of the islands and to improve the contact between the two communities and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also recommended releasing the EUR 259 million already earmarked for the northern part of Cyprus in the event of a settlement. In that light, as the Commissioner has just said, with a view to the economic integration of the island and improved contact between the communities, in July 2004 the Commission submitted a draft regulation establishing a financial instrument in which the opinion of the European Parliament is requested. It also submitted a draft regulation on direct trade between the northern part of Cyprus and the rest of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the mandate given by the Council on 26 April, the Dutch presidency committed itself to putting the proposals forward and made considerable efforts to that end. Both proposals were carefully considered in the Permanent Representatives Committee. Difficulties were encountered and concerns were expressed during that discussion on certain issues such as property and sovereign rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress was made after intense discussion, especially on the draft regulation establishing a financial instrument. The remaining point is the definition of the role of the European Agency for Reconstruction, and discussions are also continuing on the direct trade regulation. There are still substantial problems with this draft regulation and the Council and the Commission are working very hard to resolve the issue. The Dutch presidency is considering discussing this at the next General Affairs and External Relations Council. I would like to say that we are grateful for the constructive work undertaken by the parliamentary committees involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Dutch presidency is to provide real and effective economic opportunities for the Turkish Cypriot community, by promoting trade with the EU whilst respecting fully the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus. We trust that this will ultimately benefit the people of Cyprus throughout the island. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission's request for a prolongation itself came at a very late stage. Members will recall that Parliament in its previous resolution on the European Agency for Reconstruction had asked the Commission to present its evaluation report on the status of the Agency by June 2003 at the latest, in order to allow the EP to hold a debate on the future of the Agency and its adequacy in managing EU external assistance in some Stability Pact and stabilisation and association countries. The Commission did not follow Parliament's recommendation and only presented its report during this year's electoral period.</p>
<p class="contents">Further delays arose as a result of the change in the regulation with regard to the Agency's geographical area of responsibility, the intention of which was to bring assistance for the promotion of the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community within the remit of the Agency. My committee rightly took the decision to postpone adoption of this report and the one regarding assistance to the northern part of Cyprus until it received the relevant documentation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these shortcomings should not cloud the fact that an impressive job has been done on the ground by the Agency's staff. I have always been in favour of extending their mandate. They are doing a good job and need to know that they can sign contracts for buildings and pay salaries for next year. My concerns were directed at the lack of clarity and coordination in the division of tasks between the European Agency for Reconstruction's offices and the Commission's deconcentrated delegations, a matter which I have addressed in my report.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress made in developing an effective decentralised system for contracts and financial management systems for EU assistance as foreseen in the CARDS multiannual programme for 2005-06 for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia needs to be examined further.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be happy to incorporate a proposal fusing the ideas of two fellow Members by asking the Commission to submit by June 2005 a report on the future of the Agency after 31 December 2006. This should ensure that a prospective extension is not addressed with the same haste as in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that the remit of the European Agency for Reconstruction should be extended to cover the implementation of financial assistance for the northern part of Cyprus. I would propose that we adopt the relevant part of the Commission's text, in agreement with the rapporteur on the proposed instruments, to ensure consistency between the two reports. I hope that all Members will join me in supporting the extension of the European Agency for Reconstruction's mandate for the term proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to inform Parliament that I have asked for the oral question and debates on the future of the Western Balkans, originally planned to coincide with the vote on the European Agency for Reconstruction's report, to be postponed until the December part-session. It would be more useful to debate the future of the region when the new Commission is in place, as we had originally envisaged would be the case at this juncture. A debate in December would also save this important debate from drowning under speculation over the new team of Commissioners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">EUR 259 million have been earmarked to support the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community until the end of 2006. These funds were originally to have been released only after Kofi Annan’s plan had been adopted, with the aim of reducing the significant economic disadvantage suffered by the Turkish Cypriot community. After the vast majority of Turkish Cypriots voted in favour of the plan in February, but the Greek Cypriots against it, so that the plan could not be adopted, the Council recommended that the financial support instrument be implemented even without an agreement having been reached in Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">In my capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I can say, on its behalf, that our support for this plan is unanimous. At this point I should also like to express my sincere thanks for the excellent cooperation within the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The Community aid provided for in this regulation can and should help to achieve greater compliance with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, in order to prepare for the takeover which will be necessary after a solution to the Cyprus issue has been found, and indeed one of the primary aims of this financial support instrument is to promote such a solution. We greatly welcome the fact that around EUR 260 million has been allocated for projects relating to the environment, transport, telecommunications, water and/or energy, for restructuring measures, for example in rural areas, for measures which are of particular benefit to small and medium-sized enterprises, and for bicommunal projects which facilitate trust-building between ethnic groups. Measures can and should of course be planned for Famagusta, in order to make it suitable for habitation again, and you will be aware that relevant initiatives are underway in the town.</p>
<p class="contents">My report notes that the planned measures must not infringe the property rights of EU citizens. We have reiterated this point, even though we know that it has always been self-evident that this principle must be observed when implementing European projects. All the members of the committee were unanimous in their support for the Commission’s additional proposal that the measure as a whole be managed by the Agency for Reconstruction. The point I should like to make to Mr Samuelsen is that there is broad support for this proposal, and this is something upon which we all agree.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been noted by Mr Patten and the Council, financial support is part of the package proposed by the Commission in July. Although Parliament has no official right of consultation with regard to the direct trade which has also been proposed, I believe that this House will make it clearly known to the Council tomorrow that a prompt decision is expected on the trade proposal, just as we expect a prompt decision on the financial support element.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is crucial that the EU should send out a clear signal to the Turkish Cypriot community by implementing this proposal for a regulation and the proposed direct trade. This signal would be directed in particular at the large majority which voted for the Annan plan and for a ‘yes’ to the European Union, and it would make it clear that, although we want a swift solution to the Cyprus issue, we are also, even today, taking the concerns of Turkish Cypriot civil society very seriously. It is in the interests of all Cypriots and in the interests of positive developments in Cyprus that the democratic, pro-European forces in the Turkish Cypriot community receive backing and do not under any circumstances abandon their fight.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Parliament will, by means of this report, help to achieve this, and I expect and hope that the Council will follow suit very shortly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of diplomatic efforts, however, this has not been possible, given the unfavourable result of the referendum held in April 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to avoid further isolation of Turkish Cypriot territory and to strengthen contacts between the two communities, the European Commission has tabled a proposal intended to establish an instrument for economic development for this community totalling EUR 259 million for the period 2004-2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that no political agreement on unified Cyprus’s accession to the EU has been reached, such funding has raised a number of issues of a legal and budgetary nature. There is, indeed, no heading allowing the direct award of Community funding to a Member State whose government does not have absolute authority over part of its territory. I should like to point out that the Republic of North Cyprus has not been recognised internationally and cannot therefore be deemed a state. This lack of budgetary basis implies that such funding can only be seen in parallel with draft amending budget No 10/2004.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I have analysed the Commission proposal before us. The Commission argues here that funding is intended to finance activities similar to those of pre-accession, which falls within the scope of category 7 of the budget. Without entering into the political aspects of the debate, I did agree, however, with the financial implications of this proposal on the Financial Perspectives, despite it not being entirely clear under which category this financial support would fall. I therefore deliberately left open the choice of the most suitable budgetary basis, a task that the Budgetary Authority must undertake once the Council has tabled its proposed text.</p>
<p class="contents">I could not finish this speech, Mr President, without drawing the attention of this House to the difficulties of having to express a financial opinion on a text of which the most important part has not in any way been the subject of a Council agreement. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has now been assigned an important new task, namely that of managing the financial instrument for north Cyprus. There can be no question that the Agency has efficiently performed the tasks involved in its former mandates, and I am sure that the same will be true of its activities in north Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">As in the previous cases, however, it is also important with regard to Northern Cyprus that the Commission present a report on the future of the Agency after 31 December 2006 to the European Parliament and the Council by June 2005. South-Eastern Europe and the Agency’s future tasks are of too great an importance for the EU to allow the future of the European Agency for Reconstruction to remain unclear. The relationship between the Agency and what are termed the ‘deconcentrated’ Commission delegations must also be clarified in order to prevent a lack of activity or the duplication of work.</p>
<p class="contents">The report should of course also cover the implementation of the 2005-2006 multi-annual CARDS programme for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, something which is not yet the case. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats therefore endorses the proposal to extend the Council Regulation on the European Agency for Reconstruction.</p>

<p class="contents">First, as regards the European Agency for Reconstruction, we should point out that, based as it is in Thessaloniki, it has played a decisive role in the reconstruction of the Balkans as a whole, in configuring the necessary infrastructures, in building democratic institutions, in promoting the rule of law and in defending human rights in the Balkan countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This strategy is the only reliable proposal for the peaceful reconstruction of the Balkans and the strengthening of their European prospects. That is why it is absolutely necessary to extend the operation of the agency until the end of December 2006 and to make provision for examining the possibility of even extending its operation beyond that date, given that there will be important developments in the Balkans both in 2005 and in the next period and policies are needed to consolidate stability and security in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, my request to Mr Patten is that the Commission submit a report on the matter to the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The agency's efficient operation, transparency and in-depth knowledge of the procedure of reconstruction of the area as a whole are a guarantee for extending its jurisdiction to the implementation of financial support to the Turkish Cypriot community.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the question of the report on financial support for the Turkish Cypriot community. This money needs to be given to the Turkish Cypriot community, because it will help Turkish Cypriot citizens and the Turkish Cypriot community, it will contribute to economic development, to the incorporation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, to the configuration of the necessary infrastructures and to the creation of jobs. In other words, it will help to create conditions which will allow the reunification of Cyprus through the development of contacts, dialogue and exchanges between the two communities.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to use financial support to strengthen the prospects of resolving rather than consolidating partition. That is why the messages which we send the Turkish Cypriot community must be clear and unequivocal. We are not financing intransigence. We are financing dialogue and this is where the European Commission and the Agency for Reconstruction need to be particularly careful and act in cooperation with the Republic of Cyprus and with respect for the principles of European law.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask the Presidency to take a stand on the question of the heading for financial support to the Turkish Cypriot community. Mr Nicolaï needs to take a clear stand on behalf of the Dutch presidency on whether financial support will come under heading 7 or heading 3. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the first, but it is behind schedule and it is a small sum of money: far too small for the Commission's list of glamorous priority projects that Commissioner Patten, whom it is very nice to see still here, read out earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of a lack of generosity, the money will be spent in such a circumscribed fashion that it will only apply to 15% of the territory of North Cyprus, excluding many villages that voted en bloc for the Annan plan. I would like to say that I deplore the sluggish progress on this question in the Council. Worst of all, the financial regulation has been split from the trade regulation, which is by far the most important part of the package.

Indeed, before 2000, the European Union was, above all, a bureaucratic monster that delivered on all kinds of promises either far too late or not at all. After 2000, the European Union, via the agency, was very much capable of providing prompt and efficient aid, often under difficult circumstances. It has never happened before that such a large proportion of funding that was budgeted for granting aid was actually spent. Once again, all credit for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the question remains, which we in this House have discussed with the Commissioner on different occasions, as to what exactly the Commission’s thought process was when allocating a certain task to the Bureau, the various offices of the Bureau or to the decentralised delegations, the embassies of the European Union. Although the Commission may not admit to this out loud, it does suggest now and again that Parliament is going on about this <span class="italic">ad nauseam</span> while insisting on an answer. The reason is that we want to avoid further ambiguity. Allow me to give you an example. There is every chance that the European Union will be allocated more tasks in Kosovo in the course of 2005 and 2006: in other words less UN, less UNMIC and more European Union. Does this now entail a greater role for the Bureau or does it mean that we can expect a larger, all-singing, all-dancing delegation and a larger embassy? It is important for Parliament to know, because it is we who must take difficult and awkward, political and financial decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not conceal the fact that I am also overcome by a certain wistfulness. This debate is the last of the many debates we have had with the Commissioner. I think that one of the reasons for the Commissioner’s popularity in this House is that he has given the EU’s Balkans policy a face and a voice, and has done a sterling job of it. I should like to take this opportunity to thank him for this. I wish the Balkans a sound successor and, above all, wish the Commissioner much enjoyment in governing Oxford University and in penning fine books. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The underlying reason for this segregation is not the so-called embargo on the Greek Cypriot side, it is the Turkish occupation, the breakaway action of the occupying regime and the fact that the economy of the occupied areas is inextricably bound up with the Turkish economy, to the point even that the Turkish pound has been introduced as the currency of the occupied areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Turkish invasion and occupation in 1974, the Republic of Cyprus announced that its occupied ports and airports were closed, because it could not exert any form of control over them. This was also an act of self-defence, so that we would not be led into recognising the pseudo-state. Security Council resolutions 541 and 550, together with a series of rulings by the European Court of Human Rights upheld the above decision in full. The same happened in the recent opinion of the Council's legal department, which expressly recognises the right of the Republic of Cyprus to keep the said ports and airports closed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group supports the financial regulation for Turkish Cypriots, provided of course that the Republic of Cyprus is respected and no benefit or political advantage is reaped by the occupying regime. We hope that understanding and broad agreement have been reached on these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the report on the European Agency for Reconstruction being debated, the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus wonders why it has been tabled for voting before us today, at a time when there is no agreement at COREPER level, by the Commission or the Council. I would remind the House of the view of COREPER, that the matter would be debated under the next Presidency, under the Luxembourg Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely because the Republic of Cyprus is not a third country and the occupied areas are not independent territory, they are, as the Accession Treaty expressly states, territory of the European Union to which application of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>has been stayed, that the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus cannot vote in favour of the regulation on the European Agency for Reconstruction. It goes without saying that our vote against the regulation does not mean that we reject assistance to the Balkan countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what we want is to vote on the protocol without clarifying the heading from which this money will be taken. It has been said that the matter will be resolved depending on where there are appropriations. However, no appropriations are available under the internal assistance heading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, on a point of order, I am not sure if Mr Patten is entitled to even be in the House, given that Commissioner Prodi's brief expired on 31 October. Apart from which, all Commissioner Prodi's acts are being audited to see if they are legal. I believe that this matter will be resolved before the Court in Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Who is to blame for the fact that northern Cyprus and southern Cyprus have not developed equally, when the northern part is more fertile and more suited to tourism? The occupying army is to blame. However much money Europe gives, it will be wasted, because the occupying army has created a constricting framework which prevents any development. We therefore need to see what can be done, as the Commissioner says. The occupying army needs to leave and Cyprus needs to return to its <span class="italic">status quo ante</span> following the Zurich and London Treaties, which were also signed by England, of which the Commissioner is, of course, the eminent offspring. The occupying army needs to leave, calm needs to be restored to the island, the 1960 Constitution needs to be applied and economic prosperity will follow in northern Cyprus automatically. As long as there is an occupying army, there will be no prosperity. The money will be wasted. We therefore need to have the courage to find a realistic solution.</p>
<p class="contents">If we had not kicked Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, would we today be providing financial support to occupied Kuwait? If we had not kicked Milosevic out of Bosnia, would we be funding Milosevic today? So why do we not do the same with Turkey? Tell Turkey to get off the island so that northern Cyprus can develop. No one wants poor neighbours. Most of all, the Greek Cypriots do not want poor neighbours. If you have the courage to kick out the occupying army – which is the only occupying army in a European country – development will automatically follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to remember the background to the current situation in the northern part of Cyprus. The background is the Turkish invasion that took place in 1974 and that meant that the population in the northern part of Cyprus now finds itself in an economic and social situation clearly worse than that which existed before July 1974.</p>
<p class="contents">In that connection, I have to emphasise that, as others have already pointed out, the efforts at development are to take place in cooperation with the government of the Republic of Cyprus. What must not happen is for the EU now to go in and provide aid as a thank you to those who voted in favour of the Koffi Annan plan and to forget those who voted against the plan. There are motives that, in my opinion, have not been properly examined in this Parliament, and I remember the discussion with Mr Verheugen, during the last sitting, of the whole issue of the Koffi Annan plan. This was clearly unjust and clearly unacceptable to the Greek Cypriot population, and it was consequently rejected by a huge majority.</p>
<p class="contents">No doubt all of us want to see the situation improve, and an essential prerequisite for this is, of course, an end to the military occupation of northern Cyprus. As long as Turkey has occupied part of another European country’s territory, we cannot conduct negotiations, such as may be decided upon in this House in December, with the Turkish Government about Turkish accession to the EU. Any negotiation must always be conducted with the involvement of the Greek Cypriot population and with an appreciation of their interests. It is the Greek Cypriot population that have been the losers since 1974. It is they who have been victims and they must not be punished through the efforts that we in the EU now put in to normalising the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should not overlook the fact that in April of this year, a referendum was held about this plan, and that a large majority of the Greek Cypriots voted it out. When a referendum is held, the outcome should be respected. The financial support to that part of the island that is occupied by the Turks was intended to be conditional on the Annan plan being rubber-stamped by referendum, which did not happen. Pledging EUR 259 million to the northern part of Cyprus is tantamount to <span class="italic">de facto </span>recognition of the military occupation of that area by more than 35 000 Turkish soldiers. It appears that the European Union has no problems with the fact that a candidate country is occupying part of the territory of an existing Member State. Not only are we about to start accession negotiations with Turkey, but the occupation of Northern Cyprus is now also being rewarded financially, and this is absurd. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, of course, shall focus more on Mrs Rothe's report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that the report, as formulated following the discussions and vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, is a very good report and, as such, the decision which derives from the report on financial support for the development of the Turkish Cypriot community is also a very good decision, a decision which we all support. In other words, we consider that this support will contribute towards the general development of the Turkish Cypriot community, so that when, God willing – and this is something we hope will happen soon – the Cyprus problem is resolved with the reunification of Cyprus, the Turkish Cypriot community will be at the same high standard as the Greek.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say, however, as the Council has also taken a stand, that the regulation on financial support is one matter, while the regulation on trade relations is another. Although it may be logical for us to link the two, I would advise great caution as regards the matter of the regulation on direct trade relations. I am certain that the Council will exercise this caution in its work and that the solution found – when it is found – will be fair and will be the right solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a couple of words on the positive role of the European Agency for Reconstruction in Thessaloniki, in my country; I would like here to express the hope and my agreement to its managing financial support to the Turkish Cypriots and I naturally hope that this management will be based on the regulations of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is good news: Northern Cyprus needs this aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few decades events have separated the island politically and economically. The people of Cyprus suffered immensely from the partition of the island. All those involved must do their best to overcome the separation. It was the explicit aim of the United Nations and the EU that a united Cyprus would join the European Union on 1 May 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments of Northern Cyprus and Turkey have followed the steps laid out by the United Nations and the EU. The population of Northern Cyprus has overwhelmingly supported the unification of the island as well as EU accession. A united Cyprus could already be a member of the EU today. Unfortunately, that has not yet happened. It is our responsibility to encourage the two parts of the island to cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation on financial support that we are discussing today is the first step. The second step will be the regulation on special conditions for trade. The Council should finalise that regulation without delay, firstly, to allow for an improvement in economic conditions of Northern Cyprus; and secondly, to facilitate the rapprochement of the two sides through trade. This rapprochement can also support change in both parts of the island. During the times of the German Ostpolitik, we called this concept <span class="italic">Wandel durch Annährung</span>.</p>

I am delighted that the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Karamanlis, has recently expressed his firm support for Kofi Annan’s Cyprus plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The end of this debate has made one thing clear to me. It is my belief that the people in the south of the island who were in favour of Kofi Annan’s plan have no representative in this House.

After all, today, every European can see for himself how the Union denies its own principles by giving a non-European country, in this case Turkey, a prospect of joining the EU, while that state’s armed forces are occupying part of the territory of a current Member State, Cyprus. That is why it was crucial for the Annan plan to be approved, by hook or by crook, and the Greek Cypriots were intimidated from all quarters in order to accept this half-hearted proposal. That is also why the Turkish Cypriots are being indulged so much by the European policy makers today. However, this turns the world on its head.</p>
<p class="contents">Without going into exhaustive detail, I should like to remind you briefly of the reasons why the Greek Cypriots rejected this plan. Indeed, the Annan plan authorised the Turkish invasion of 1974, as well as the attendant war crimes. According to that plan, the Turkish occupying forces would be allowed to stay on Cyprus and retain the right to carry out military exercises on Cypriot soil. The military border would be perpetuated and armed border crossing points would continue to carry out passport control. The Turkish Cypriots would continue to live under Turkish occupation. Their poor economic situation is attributable less to an embargo by the Greek population than to the corrupt Turkish economic system <span class="italic">in situ</span>. If the Annan plan had been ratified, the more than one hundred thousand Turkish colonists who, in the wake of the ‘Attila’ operation, were forced by their government in Ankara to move to Cyprus in order to continue the ethnic cleansing, would remain on the island.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial support to the Turkish Cypriots – who, I sincerely hope, will, before too long, be reunited with the Greek Cypriots in an independent Cyprus without foreign occupation – must therefore go hand in hand with a number of strict conditions, first among them being the removal of Turkish military occupation. This support should under no circumstances be seen as a reward for a politically correct vote in a referendum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are satisfied that the rapporteur has introduced a vital amendment, making sure that EU money will not be used in a way that impinges upon individual property rights according to the relevant decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the fact that the Council appears ready to reach a consensus on the regulation. I stress the importance of consensus on the issue of trade, without time constraints and on a correct legal basis, as advised by the legal department of the Council.

The messages coming from this debate build bridges between the two communities and do not create unnecessary disputes and confrontation between them, and due attention should be paid to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are our compatriots. The government of the Republic of Cyprus has supported the decision on financial support for Turkish Cypriots from the outset. However, I should point out that the economic destitution of our compatriots is not due to isolation on our part; it is due to the isolation imposed by 30 years of Turkish military occupation in Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that this action is an incidental action and the basic objective of the European Union must be to resolve the Cyprus problem, to bring about full equality, political and other forms of equality, between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in all sectors. That is our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the Annan plan, which many people have glorified. It was rejected in the Greek Cypriot referendum because, first, it perpetuated the Turkish occupation, the Turkish military presence in Cyprus. Secondly, we are creating a climate of uncertainty about the future and, thirdly, it had shortcomings in the area of human rights and on the practical side. We must not forget this. There are those who are critical of the Greek Cypriot side for its stand; why were they not critical for 30 years and why are they not critical now of what Turkey is doing in Cyprus? The Turkish occupation, the eviction of Greek Cypriots from their homes and this ongoing situation. They should demonstrate the same consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I should like to point out that the reunification of Cyprus must be the objective of all of us. We have no dispute with the Turkish Cypriots, we have a dispute with Turkey, which is occupying part of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, part of European territory, because the Republic of Cyprus is a full member of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is the way in which this support will be given that I wish to discuss. That is the matter I wish to address. I have been fighting on this front for many years, not just recently. That is why the report by Commissioner Patten is an insult to my intelligence, when it appears that he does not understand where this support will come from; from heading 3, which relates to countries in the European Union, or from heading 7, which relates to candidate countries. There is a big difference; it is not the projects which will be implemented in occupied Cyprus which are important, it is Cyprus itself. However, the Commissioner refuses to understand this state of affairs, which is perfectly clear to us, and I am sorry that he makes this distinction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, there were one or two points made during the debate which I should address very briefly. I hope that when these debates are held in future without my attendance they will, if I may say so, have as broad a base as possible in the points of view we hear.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to Mr Samuelsen that the Commission would be perfectly content to hold a debate on the Western Balkans in December. Mr Duff spoke about the trade regulation being done within three months. Again – speaking for myself – the Commission would be perfectly happy to accommodate that reasonable request. A couple of other Members suggested that we should concentrate our support on one place: Famugusta. That would not be sensible. We have to spread our assistance more generally than that.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make three other points. First, on the Agency based in Thessaloniki, I would like without reservation to thank the Greek Government for its hospitality. It provided the facilities we have used in Thessaloniki. It was an imaginative proposal by the last government, which has been continued by the present one. It has given us a splendid headquarters. Everybody who has worked in the Agency is grateful for that and certainly, on behalf of the Commission, I am also very grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, Mr Lagendijk made the point – although he was too kind to put it this way – that there is a degree of intellectual incoherence, which I accept, between the policy which I have pursued vigorously around the world of deconcentrating our management of assistance and what we have been doing in the Western Balkans, which is to establish an agency rather than simply deconcentrate to our delegations. I have to say to justify that decision that my main concern – particularly given the position in the Western Balkans and given the position in Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – the position was so difficult it seemed to me that the most important thing was delivery of assistance. Since the Agency has been so effective it was not right to dismantle it and I thought it sensible to continue to use it as our main instrument for managing assistance. So, I plead guilty to a degree of intellectual incoherence, but the record of the Agency has justified it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I do not wish to make my last remarks in this Parliament into the beginning of a hot controversy. However, I would just say to the honourable Member who said that he wished Mr Verheugen, my distinguished colleague, had been able to state the advantages of the Annan plan more vigorously, that Mr Verheugen would have loved to do so, but when he tried in Cyprus, he was stopped. That is a matter of record and was not the happiest episode in this tale. It would have been better all round if during the course of the referendum campaign he had been able to say in Cyprus what he believed the advantages of the Annan plan were. It might have been that he would have given a more balanced view than some of the letters sent out by the government. I very much hope that we can have this debate in as calm a way as possible. I hope that all sides of the argument will be heard reasonably.</p>
<p class="contents">The one thing I would like to say is that I recognise, as Mr Kasoulides said, that there is a genuine commitment on the part of many honourable Members to the betterment of everyone who lives on the island. I have no doubt at all about the honourable Member's commitment to that and I hope that we see everybody living a more prosperous, stable and peaceful life on that glorious island in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
