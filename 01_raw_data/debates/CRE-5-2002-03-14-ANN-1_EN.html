<p>A constituent of mine, aged 92 years, had her bag which contained her passport stolen after departing from the UK and before arrival at Palma de Mallorca on 6 May 2001. Instead of receiving sympathetic treatment with access to Consular services, she was forced to return unaccompanied to the UK after a night sitting on a plastic chair in the airport. Such incidents are doubtless infrequent, especially in Spain with its admiral reputation for hospitality to tourists. When they do occur the dismay of those affected is all the greater.

<p>The Council would remind you that it does not have the competence to intervene directly in the arrest of suspected war criminals. At its sitting on 11 June 2001, the Council nonetheless approved the report on the review of the Stabilisation and Association Process which assessed the progress towards European integration made by the countries of the region. It thought then that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s cooperation with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia had been insignificant, particularly where the Republika Srpska was concerned, while the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia now appears more ready to cooperate. Since then, progress has been made, but without its having led to the arrest of Messrs Karadzic and Mladic and their extradition to the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>When it proceeds to the subsequent annual reviews under the Stabilisation and Association Process, the Council will again study the degree to which the countries in the region have cooperated with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia. This ‘review mechanism’ will enable the European Union periodically to assess whether each country’s compliance with the criteria defined under the Stabilisation and Association Process justifies the level of relations established with the particular country. It will also provide a tool for taking decisions on the future development of bilateral relations, as well as enabling practical recommendations to be made. The Council therefore has available to it a means of putting pressure, albeit indirectly, upon the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p>The Spanish Presidency intends to be consistent in continuing on the path marked out by the previous presidencies, designed to remind all the countries in the region of the need to cooperate fully and totally with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia. The need for such cooperation is one of the conditions laid down by the EU in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process.

<p>As regards research on human embryos, the Council, in its common position:</p>
<p>– has agreed with the opinion of the European Parliament to include references to a number of relevant international instruments on which to base the ethical evaluation of Framework Programme activities, including those relating to the issue of research using human embryos;</p>
<p>– as to the interpretation of these principles, in view of the recent and rapid developments, in particular in the field of biotechnology, as well as ongoing discussions, including those taking place in the European Parliament and at the national level, the Council found it inappropriate to establish in its Common Position on the Framework Programme an exhaustive list of research topics to be excluded from Community funding.</p>
<p>3. The Council adopted its common position by unanimity, with no abstentions. At the time of the adoption of the Council’s common position on 10 December 2001, certain delegations, including those referred to by the Honourable Member and the Commission, made known their views concerning Community-funded research involving the use of human embryos. The Council has committed itself to re-examine this issue, in particular during its discussions on the relevant specific programme proposals. This examination is yet to take place as the Council is awaiting the further views of the European Parliament on the text of the Common Position and its opinion on the specific programme proposals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0114"></a>

<p>The Council recalls to the Honourable Member that further to the Florence European Council of June 1996, recital 10 of Council regulation 975/98 on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation states that giving the euro coins one European and one national side is an appropriate expression of the idea of European monetary union between Member States and could significantly increase the degree of acceptance of the coins by citizens.</p>
<p>Thus, as regards the design of euro coins, Member States having adopted the euro as their single currency in conformity with the Treaty, agreed to have euro coins presenting one common face and one face with a national design. The European Council, in Amsterdam, (16-17 June 1997) welcomed and fully endorsed the choice for the design of the euro coins. Accordingly, a competition was organised at European level for the design of the common face. The winning designs were selected by the Heads of State or Government at the Amsterdam European Council in June 1997. The same procedure applies for possible future modifications of the design of the common face.</p>

<p>There is no clear mandate in the Treaty with respect to ageing and other demographic developments, but a coordinated EU participation in the Assembly is a logical consequence of the increasing and repeated attention paid by the European Council to the challenges posed by an ageing population, and of the increasingly structured activities in the Union which aim to modernise and improve social protection while at the same time ensure economic and financial sustainability.</p>

<p>1. The Council considers the elimination of discrimination between men and women to be an important part of a community wide approach to achieving gender equality. In that context the Honourable Parliamentarian is reminded of the proposal for a Directive amending Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions, which is currently subject to the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p>Clearly, any possible amendment of Directive 75/117/CEE on the principle of equal pay for men and women would depend on the Commission's right of initiative in respect of legislative acts.</p>
<p>2. In accordance with the Employment Guidelines for 2002, Member States will pursue positive steps to promote equal pay for equal work of equal value and to diminish differentials in incomes between women and men. The Council considers that action to address gender pay gaps is necessary in both the public and private sectors, and that the impact of the implementation of the Guidelines on gender pay gaps should be assessed.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Council would like to draw attention to the fact that the Member States are currently developing indicators to measure progress in gender equality in relation to each Guideline.</p>
<p>3. Regarding the question of a study into the factors which influence pay, it is recalled that, in the context of the follow-up of the Beijing process, the Belgian Presidency submitted a report to the Council on the subject of gender pay equality which proposed 9 quantitative and qualitative indicators on the subject of pay differentials.</p>
<p>On the basis of this report, the Council (Employment and Social Policy) of 3 December 2001 adopted conclusions which, inter alia, invited the Commission and the Members States to review and improve their existing data collection and processing systems, invited the Employment Committee to pursue its work on indicators in this field and invited the Commission also to set up a mechanism for the exchange of best practices in the context of the Beijing follow-up.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>What action is the EU Presidency taking to insist on the full implementation of repeated UN recommendations on human rights in Colombia, including protecting the human rights of threatened groups, dismantling paramilitary groups and ending impunity in cases of human rights violations?</p>
<p>Following the breakdown in peace talks, what action will the EU take to ensure close international monitoring of the human rights situation in the former demilitarised zone and to enable international delegations access to this zone and to other areas of conflict in Colombia including the Caguan/Caqueta and Meta?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>Please allow me to give a joint reply to the four questions concerning Colombia which have been tabled by the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The Council has always supported President Andrés Pastrana and the efforts which, with indefatigable determination, he has been making over the last few years in order to bring peace to Colombia. The same cannot, unfortunately, be said about the FARC-EP.</p>
<p>The Council understands and fully abides by the decision which the Colombian President felt obliged to take on 20 February 2002, thereby bringing to an end the process (begun in 1998) involving dialogue, negotiation and the signing of agreements with the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces – People’s Army (FARC-EP). It also signalled the demise of the demilitarised zone.</p>
<p>Since the agreement with the Colombian Government on a timetable for the future of the peace process was signed on 20 January 2002, the FARC-EP has demonstrated its unwillingness to make any serious headway in the process, thereby failing to honour its commitments vis-à-vis the government. Serious acts of provocation by the FARC-EP, such as seizing an aircraft and kidnapping some of its passengers, including the chairman of the Senate’s Peace Committee, Mr Jorge Eduardo Genshen Turbay, have led to the breakdown of a negotiating process in which the Colombian people had invested its hopes for peace.</p>
<p>More recently, the 23 February kidnapping by the FARC-EP of Ingrid Betancourt, a candidate standing in Colombia’s presidential elections, and the murder on 3 March of Senator Martha Catalinas Daniels merely demonstrate the FARC-EP’s true intentions.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly rejected and condemned the kidnappings, blackmailings and other crimes committed by armed groups in Colombia and has called for international humanitarian law to be upheld and for the civilian population to be protected.</p>
<p>The Council has decided that the EU Member States will not issue new visas or residence permits to representatives of the FARC-EP, unless a failure to do so would hamper the efforts of those States which are involved in the dialogue between the various parties in Colombia. The Council reserves the right, where appropriate, to revise its policy vis-à-vis the armed groups in Colombia, depending on the progress made in upholding human rights, international humanitarian law and diplomatic immunity.</p>
<p>The Council has always expressed its deepest concern at the acts of violence perpetrated by paramilitary groups, in which connection the Council has urged the Colombian Government to continue and step up its efforts to disarm those groups and to bring the full weight of the law to bear on those responsible for the crimes committed, whoever they may be.</p>
<p>The Council has expressed its support for, and its solidarity with, both the entire Colombian people and President Pastrana and his government, and it hopes that, on the basis of sound constitutional government and full observance of human rights and basic freedoms, Colombian democracy will enable every Colombian’s yearnings for peace and prosperity to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The Council has also assured the Colombian people of its support for any initiative designed to establish a proper dialogue with a view to ending the conflict which is tearing Colombia apart.</p>
<p>The Council will endeavour to secure fulfilment of the commitments laid down in the European programme to support the peace process in Colombia, provided that implementation of the programme is not hindered by security problems.</p>
<p>On the basis of the principle of shared responsibility, the Council considers that the efforts which are already being made to stamp out the cultivation of illegal crops and the production of, and trafficking in, drugs at both local and regional level must continue, with due respect for biodiversity and the environment.</p>
<p>With a view to tackling socio-economic inequalities in Colombia, the Council has also called for a programme of decisive socio-economic reforms to be drawn up and implemented as a matter of urgency, irrespective of any developments in the peace process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs meeting in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, on 15 February 2002 decided in favour of EU-US judicial cooperation. After strong pressure from the USA, that decision has now cemented the process of cooperation between the two sides' judicial authorities, facilitating the flow of information, extradition of suspects and the freezing of bank accounts etc. At the same time, and under the same umbrella, electronic surveillance and monitoring of individuals is intensifying, evidently by virtue of the notorious 'Echelon' network.</p>
<p>Given that in the USA, inter alia, the death penalty applies - about which, supposedly, the EU was greatly concerned in the past - and exceptional judicial proceedings, including special military tribunals, are operating by presidential decision (the Patriot Act), will the Council say on the basis of which criteria it overcame its reservations and objections concerning fundamental principles of law and why, on the pretext of combating terrorism, it legitimises and promotes the violation of citizens' fundamental human and democratic rights?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council would, first, like to underline that it has not been subject to "strong pressure" from the USA in favour of EU-US judicial cooperation. All member States have agreements with the US on extradition and most also on mutual assistance in criminal matters. However, room for providing added value to these agreements through an agreement to be concluded with the US on the basis of Article 24 TEU and the extent to which this would be the case are currently being explored. At this stage, formal negotiations still have to be conducted and no agreements have as yet been concluded with the US.</p>
<p>The Presidency has presented to the Council a Draft Mandate for negotiation, currently under discussion in the appropriate for a of the Council, in which all guaranties for the preservation of the basic principles and values of the European Judicial System are preserved, according to the views expressed by the members of the Council, in particular during its meeting of 28.02.2002.</p>
<p>This being said, as the Honourable Member of Parliament knows, there is a fundamental difference of opinion between the US and all EU Member States on the issue of the death penalty. The policy of the EU has not changed on that issue. Moreover, it is clear that any agreement between the US and the EU on the basis of article 24 and 38 TEU must ensure that all guarantees of due process and fair trials are upheld. The Council is convinced that it would be possible in a future agreement to ensure that this is guaranteed. The Council will not conclude any agreement with the US that does not unreservedly fulfil this aim.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0146"></a>

<p>The EU, in its declaration of 27 February 2002, has warmly welcomed the signature of the formal cease fire agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE. This agreement is an important first step towards ending the armed conflict that the people of Sri Lanka have been suffering from over the past decades. The Union has also clearly indicated that it expects this cease-fire agreement to be followed by other measures aimed at national reconciliation, in particular further improving the security situation and allowing the reunion of family members separated by the conflict.</p>
<p>The Union urged the Parties to use this historic opportunity in the interest of the people of Sri Lanka, and to undertake with determination and in good faith a process of constructive dialogue leading to lasting peace in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The Union has consistently and for many years indicated its readiness to promote peace and to contribute substantially to the rehabilitation of the country once the necessary conditions are in place.

</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>Although in the past there were some instances of compliance by Greece with Community legislation (the Kouroupitos and Maliakos Bay), in other cases Community environment law is not implemented. Pursuant to Directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#defann_20_1" name="refann_20_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Greek authorities have proposed an incomplete list of special areas of conservation for inclusion in the NATURE 2000 network, when the areas proposed are not even protected in accordance with the provisions of that directive. For example, in many areas no protection system has been set up and no administrative body is in operation, while at the same time serious infringements are being revealed, such as inadequate protection of the Caretta-Caretta turtle in Laganas Bay (Court of Justice ruling against Greece in case C-103/00), the continuous pollution and degradation of the Axios Delta, a wetland protected under the Ramsar Convention, etc.</p>
<p>What measures will the Commission take to ensure that all the areas of Community importance, e.g. Marathon-Skhinia in Attica, are incorporated and the administrative bodies set up? In what practical way will it ensure that the areas already proposed for inclusion in the NATURE 2000 network, such as Laganas Bay, Zakynthos, Lake Vistonida and the Nestos Delta (district of Almyra Velonis), are protected? Is it possible to finance projects or measures from Community funds in areas in which infringements of Community environment law have been identified while Community rules or even the judgments of the Court of Justice (see case C-103/00 concerning Zakynthos) are not observed?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As required by Article 4 of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#defann_20_2" name="refann_20_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, Greece supplied a list of 236 sites of Community importance proposed for the Natura 2000 network. These sites cover an area equivalent to approximately 18% of the national land area. Assessments carried out to date in the Mediterranean biogeographical region show that this list may, as a whole, be considered to be substantial and the few small gaps that have shown up should be filled by the forthcoming meeting on biogeography in July 2002.</p>
<p>The setting-up of the conservation measures needed for Natura 2000 sites in accordance with Article 6 of the Habitats Directive, including the drawing up of management plans and the establishment of management bodies, falls within the competence of the Member States. In Greece's case, nonetheless, important co-financing was arranged through the LIFE programme and the Structural Funds to draw up management plans (‘Specific Environmental Studies’) covering a large number of Natura 2000 sites. Current national legislation (framework law 1650/86) states that the implementation of these management plans requires prior approval by the competent authorities, after which Presidential decrees have to be adopted and management bodies set up. Having noted that little progress has to date been made with the procedures referred to above, and being concerned to ensure that Community funds are used in a proper manner, the Commission has already challenged the Greek authorities on the need to forge ahead in providing the Natura 2000 sites in question, especially those of international significance (Ramsar zones), with an effective system of protection and management, which they still lack. The Commission sees definite progress towards this goal as a precondition for other Community financing for the conservation of Natura 2000 sites. In particular, this is specified by a clause in the relevant measure (8.1) of the operational programme on the environment in the third Community support framework for Greece.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the Commission may act to protect Natura 2000 sites by way of an infringement procedure under Article 226 of the Treaty on the European Communities, which would be commenced either on it’s the Commission’s own initiative or on the basis of a complaint. If projects or actions give rise to infringement of Community law on the environment, any Community co-financing from which they benefit may be suspended.</p>
<p>With particular reference to the protection of the physical habitat at Marathon-Schinias, the Greek authorities, in response to the Commission's intervention in the context of a complaint, have declared their intention of adding the site to the national Natura 2000 list and have given firm guarantees on the implementation of the restoration and management programme for this zone, especially including the forthcoming establishment of a management body for it.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>With regard to the Protocols to the Alpine Convention, the Commission wants to focus to the maximum its resources on those areas which can contribute the most to its own policies. Therefore, on 16 January 2001 the Commission adopted a Proposal on the signature of the Transport Protocol, which is currently being considered by the Council Working Party on Land Transport.</p>
<p>The fact that, as to the signature or ratification of other Protocols, the Commission does not intend to make further Proposals, should however not be seen as a lack of interest in the promotion of sustainable development in the Alpine region.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Commission stresses the interest it attaches to mountain regions. This interest is exemplified by the fact that the Commission, in its second Report on Cohesion, recognised that mountain regions are already at a disadvantage and have, as such, been included as one of ten priorities in the Community's cohesion policy. Other Community policies including environment policy are also contributing to the sustainable development of mountain regions including the Alpine region, and to the conservation of mountain eco-systems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>The position of the Commission with regard to the Protocols to the Alpine Convention, other than the Transport Protocol, is determined by the lack of resources to ensure appropriate follow-up to all activities undertaken under the Alpine Convention. This also explains the lack of involvement of the Commission in the discussions within the Alpine Convention on a possible Protocol on Population and Culture.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0116"></a>

<p>In order to assist Member States with the implementation of Council Directive 1999/22/EC of 29 March 1999 relating to the keeping of wild animals in zoos, the Commission organised a seminar in March 2000, in collaboration with the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), with representatives from Member States, Member State zoos and non- governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
<p>The Commission is co-operating with the Candidate Countries in the framework of the screening exercise to ensure that when these countries enter the Union above directive will be implemented. Zoos will be required to participate in:</p>
<p>research from which conservation benefits will accrue to the species and through which in situ and ex situ conservation can be linked; for example through re-education projects;</p>
<p>public education and awareness in relation to the conservation of biodiversity, particularly by providing information about the species exhibited and their natural habitats;</p>
<p>accommodating their animals under conditions satisfying the biological and conservation requirements of the individual species.</p>
<p>The Commission has also participated in workshops organised by the Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office (TAIEX) for candidate countries, which covered amongst other things the provisions of the Zoos Directive.</p>
<p>The Commission has to emphasise however the specific objective of the directive, which is contribution to the conservation of biodiversity. Matters relating to the welfare of animals of non-endangered species remain mainly within the responsibility of the individual countries.</p>
<p>In the negotiations on the accession of new Member States the Commission has always insisted on the full implementation of the “acquis communautaire” in the Candidate Countries. This will also be the case for this directive as well as for animal welfare legislation applicable to those species, as Directive 91/628/EC of 19 November 1991 on the protection of animals during transport.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As regards the selection procedure itself, the Commission's communication on Leader+ dated 14 April 2000 has already set out the requirement that Member States guarantee that selection procedures are transparent and that competition takes place under satisfactory conditions. As a result, when the EU's 73 Leader+ programmes were approved, including the Aragon region's, the Commission insisted that the whole of the procedure for the selection of LAGs should be precisely laid down, especially the selection criteria and the weighting involved, the composition of the selection committee, the use of a suitably-publicised invitation to tender, etc.</p>
<p>As is the rule in Community programmes implemented by Member States under the joint management system, the national authorities – the Spanish authorities in this instance – have sole competence in matters concerning the proper application of developed standards. Controls are, in the first place, the responsibility of the Member States, whilst the Commission audits the systems set up and, where fraud is suspected, can call in the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to carry out investigations as and when required. As far as the Commission is at present aware, no such course of action was justified in respect of Leader+ in Aragon, any more than a revision of the selection procedure employed.</p>
<p>As regards the more technical problem relating to the territorial definition of the LAGs, it appears from the programme and from the communication already referred to that it is the groups themselves that must mark out the territory in which they will function. Adherence to a boundary already set up by an autonomous community cannot of itself alone constitute sufficient grounds for excluding a local action group from the selection procedure. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0104"></a>

<p>In an enlarged EU, the Union’s forestry resources will be considerably increased. It is in the interest of the whole Union that forestry should be managed in a sustainable way in the candidate countries too.</p>
<p>It has been observed that the sustainability of forestry stands in a positive relationship to private ownership. At present, however, the ownership conditions of forests in the candidate countries are rather confused.</p>
<p>In the candidate countries the legislation on private forestry, and the institutions and structures to implement and monitor it, are having to be recreated. At the same time, the new private forest owners lack experience and know-how in forestry management and the timber trade. There is a need for training and research institutions.</p>
<p>How will the EU and the Commission be taking into account in the pre-enlargement activities – e.g. the SAPARD programme and the enlargement negotiations themselves – the development, training and motivation of the candidate countries’ forestry administration? In that connection, what action will be taken to develop private forestry, e.g. by supporting the organisation of training and by organising a comprehensive advice system?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The possibility of Community intervention in forestry policies is defined by the following:</p>
<p>- The Community Forestry Strategy stipulates that the sectoral forestry policies fall to the Member States in line with the principle of subsidiarity;</p>
<p>- This Forestry Strategy also states that the Community can contribute positively towards the achievement of its objectives by different actions taken under several Community policies namely rural development, sustainable development and research.</p>
<p>Under these conditions the Commission is dealing with forestry matters under the accession negotiations in a similar way as for the present Member States.</p>
<p>Three support instruments are used to meet the difficulties described in the Honourable Member's question:</p>
<p>PHARE: Support for institution building projects or twinning projects is being provided in the following areas: sustainable management of forests, forestry inventories, development of private forestry or preparation of extension services namely in Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia and Poland. The amount involved since the beginning of these actions exceeds €20 million.</p>
<p>SAPARD: The forestry measure generally allows for the same activities as for Member States under the rural development rules. Seven countries have this measure in their programme: Bulgaria, the Baltic States, Poland, Romania and the Slovak Republic. The Community contribution will be €167 million, representing 5% of the total Community contribution for SAPARD. The main areas are afforestation of agricultural lands, improvement of existing forest areas, investments to improve and rationalise the harvesting, processing, and marketing of forestry products and support to forest infrastructure. The training measure also provides assistance to forest owners to acquire the necessary skills to manage their forests in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>RESEARCH: A considerable increase in participation of institutes from Candidate Countries is being experienced during the course of the Fifth framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (1998 - 2002). In total 21 institutes from 9 Candidate Countries have been participating in 12 Quality of Life-programme forestry-related research projects under this framework programme, whereas only 9 institutes from 5 candidate countries participated in the similar previous framework research programme. To allow research institutes from Candidate Countries to join ongoing projects, the Commission has also launched, under this Fifth framework programme, a dedicated call to the Newly Associated States. Nine proposals were submitted on forestry related subjects and will be evaluated soon.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0128"></a>

<p>Transport subsidies are an important element in the European Union's efforts to develop and support its peripheral regions. To avoid duplication of EU subsidies, agricultural produce is excluded from transport subsidies, which are granted only where the goods concerned have undergone significant processing. In the sparsely populated areas of northern Sweden, products are manufactured that contain wild berries such as lingonberries and cloudberries, which grow at such latitudes. These products, e.g. glögg (a Swedish wine-based drink), sweets and jam, do not qualify for transport subsidies, as they are considered to be agricultural produce. This is odd, because the berries grow wild and are not cultivated, and the products made from them undergo substantial processing.</p>

<p>The Honourable Member has drawn the Commission’s attention to the prohibitive cost of tests to detect tumours in female patients with a genetic predisposition to breast cancer, which are covered by several patents issued by the European Patent Office.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the issuing of a patent cannot be used to prevent the use of tests that were already discovered and in use before the aforementioned patent was issued. In other words, if a test already existed in Belgium when the patents were issued to the company Myriad Genetics, its holder could continue to use this test. This exception is known as personal possession which allows those already using the invention within the Union before a patent was issued<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> to continue using it. Therefore, the test used in Belgium to detect breast cancer should not be called into question.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a patent on the test to detect breast cancer was issued on Belgian territory, patients have a right to have access to technological advances contained in this patent.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member implies that the company, Myriad Genetics, intends to use its tests exclusively within the United States and that the cost of the test would be considerably increased.</p>
<p>However, in the legislation of the various Member States, there are provisions on compulsory licences which fully comply with the provisions laid down in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs).</p>
<p>Compulsory licensing permits, in exceptional cases, any third party with an interest in the invention, to use it in cases where the right holder has not used it or has used it but not extensively on the territory of the country in which the patent is valid. A licence may be issued by the competent authority of the relevant State to the interested third party, who, having applied to use the patent in question, has received a refusal from or was proposed unreasonable commercial terms by the right holder.</p>

<p>The Treaties do not recognise the notion of "full national status". The only Members of the Union are the States which have signed and ratified the Treaties. That situation has prevailed at all previous enlargements of the Community and will continue in the forthcoming enlargements.</p>
<p>Clearly the Treaties do take into account the existence of regional and local bodies within Member States to a certain extent - notably through the Committee of the Regions as the Institution which is their consultative body - or through Article 203 of the EC Treaty which makes the provision that a Member State may be represented in the Council by a regional Minister if this conforms with internal constitutional rules.</p>
<p>Since the term "full national status" does not exist in the Treaties, and since such a concept could only apply to independent countries that - in the context of the Union - would have to be separate Member States, the Treaties do not allow for regions that are formally recognised as such in Member States and under the terms of the Treaties to be given a status equivalent to that of a Member State.</p>
<p>That situation could only be changed, of course, if the provisions of the Treaty were explicitly altered. As the Honourable Member will know, the Treaties can only be amended by a new Treaty which has to be established by common unanimous accord between the Member States in an Intergovernmental Conference, and which enters into force only after ratification by all Member States.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member may care to note that the notion of Member State in the Treaties - in accordance with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice - does not only refer to national (central or, as appropriate, federal) authorities, but to all public authorities, irrespective of their level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0069"></a>

<p>A few days ago, the unit responsible for administering the European Social Fund in Spain asked for substantial sums of money awarded to subsidise internal courses provided by the IMEFE to be handed back, after its investigations had shown that the relevant rules had not been observed. While this is a serious matter, it is only the first part of the conclusions of the unit's report on this matter.</p>

Further to the decisions taken with a view to creating a compensation fund for victims of pollution caused by oil spills, does the Commission not consider it necessary to set up a European guarantee fund, financed by a tax paid by all shipowners, which would ensure that payment is made for work carried out without awaiting the result of possible court cases against unscrupulous shipowners?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission’s communication of 6 April 2001 on the training and recruitment of seafarers<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> has already addressed the problem of abandoned mariners. Ships are increasingly being abandoned in European ports and their crews remain on board without being paid. Apart from the unacceptable human consequences of this type of situation, the abandoned ships also create difficulties in terms of the daily business of ports, due to the space that they take up. The Commission will investigate the possibility of proposing an instrument to authorise ports to sell these ships.</p>
<p>Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee issued their opinion on the Commission communication, but the question of abandoned mariners was not retained by these two bodies as a priority. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation of abandoned mariners in Europe and it also intends to raise this issue with the Member States when the communication is discussed within the Council.</p>
<p>In view of the international nature of this problem, the Commission is also convinced that action taken at international level could have considerable added value. The Commission therefore intends to closely monitor the revision of the international maritime conventions launched by the International Labour Office to ensure that the issue of abandoned mariners is addressed in the appropriate manner as part of this revision.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that greater transparency is needed in order to clearly identify, at port entrances, the identity of operators that are financially liable for ships and their cargo. This transparency, coupled with international legislation, should enable port authorities to take immediate action against operators who go missing.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>2. The Commission does not intend, at this stage, to present further proposals on the status of these regions.</p>
<p>3.

Furthermore, on 30 January 2002, it adopted an interim report which gives current statistics on the situation of the regions, presents an overview of the debate on the future of cohesion and reviews the resources needed to prepare future Member States for the establishment of structural instruments. Although it is too early to speculate on the conclusions of the debate currently underway and the proposals arising from this, the Commission would, nonetheless, like to remind the Honourable Member that its proposals will take into account the specific problems of the outermost regions as described in Article 299(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community.

<p>European agricultural policy is suffering from a system fault that leaves animals with defective immune defence, which creates a need for large quantities of antibiotics and other pharmacological substances for therapeutic use. Obviously, this situation constitutes both a direct and indirect threat to public health, particularly through the development of multiresistant strains of bacteria. According to the WHO, resistance to antibiotics is set to become one of our major public health problems.</p>
<p>In October 1999, I asked the Commission whether it was prepared to take steps to bring animal welfare into the public health sphere. Today - in the light of the white paper on food safety - it seems even more absurd that the Union's work on public health should cover all the links in the food chain (feed, slaughter, preparation etc.) except for the actual breeding of animals.</p>
<p>Is the Commission therefore prepared to take steps, by way of the co-decision procedure and Article 152 of the EC Treaty, to close this 'gap' in the food chain?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Community is sensitive to the requests of European consumers for safe food produced in accordance with good farming practices, with greater respect for the environment and for the welfare of food producing animals.</p>
<p>To give concrete answers to these demands the Commission published the White Paper on Food Safety. The White Paper integrates the way animals are farmed, including their health and welfare status as factors which may contribute to achieving a high quality and safety of food.</p>
<p>Based on the White Paper, the recently adopted Regulation of the Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety,<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span> includes all issues having a direct or indirect impact on the safety of the food and feed supply chains, animal health and welfare, and plant health.</p>
<p>The farming of animals for the production of food is by definition and also historically an agricultural activity and as consequence Article 37 of the EC Treaty constitutes the legal base to undertake legislative initiatives at the level of the Community. According to Article 152 (4) (b) of the EC Treaty this Article could only be regarded as an appropriate legal base if the measures have, as their direct objective, the protection of public health, which is not the case for animal welfare legislation. In any case it should be noted that the Parliament is always consulted and has expressed its opinion on every occasion that the Commission has adopted proposals for new legislation on animal health and welfare.</p>
<p>As stated above, this approach does not exempt the Community from undertaking a sufficiently comprehensive and integrated approach to food safety considering all aspects of the food chain as a continuum, including the ways in which animals are kept.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the evolution of the agricultural policy, in particular a shift towards rural development and away from aids to production, should provide a more favourable framework for the production of food of animal origin, obtained in less intensive productions systems, that are more respectful of their natural behaviour.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 30 January 2002, the Commission communicated its strategy for the successful integration of the new Member States into the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). It includes provision of just under € 2 billion to cover the expected market expenditure requirements of the new Member States over the period 2004-2006. This budgetary estimate has been made on the basis of the Commission’s most recent projections of production developments, and assumptions about world market prices, the dollar/euro exchange rate and internal and external market developments.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that it has outlined a balanced and fair package. Its approach to the gradual introduction of direct payments will mean that after a transitional period there will not be a two-tier CAP, but will also ensure that the process of agricultural restructuring in these countries is not jeopardised.

<p>The question raised by the Honourable Member relates to the collective management of copyright and related rights in Europe, and in particular, how copyright societies operate.</p>
<p>The way in which these societies operates is currently regulated by the various national provisions. The extent of the monitoring undertaken by the state authorities and, more generally, the relations between these societies and their members vary from State to State. The same applies to relations with commercial users. Within the Union, therefore, transparency, financial accountability and external and internal monitoring of copyright are carried out in various ways and thus may be more effective in one State than in another.</p>
<p>For its part, the Commission has been examining the question of rights’ management, including collective management since 1994. The question was addressed in 1996 by the communication on copyright and related rights in the information society. Several meetings, consultations and studies have been carried out and a hearing was organised more recently in November 2000 by the ‘Internal Market’ Directorate-General, which brought together all the players and institutions involved in collective management.</p>
<p>The Commission is completing its analysis on rights’ management and also maintaining contact with the interested parties. This analysis includes the question of a possible Community initiative.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0107"></a>

<p>The average European enterprise employs only 6 people<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the overwhelming majority of European enterprises - over 18 million - employ fewer than 10 people<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. That is why the Commission’s approach is to “think small first”. By doing so, the Commission can contribute to the creation of a favourable environment for small and micro enterprises. This principle is embodied in the European Charter for Small Enterprises.</p>
<p>The Commission is reviewing its definition of SMEs. Its aim is to make sure that it is as operational as possible. In the process, the existing definition of micro-enterprises has been completed by the inclusion of a financial threshold. This should be a help if, in appropriate cases, national and Community measures are targeted at this important category.</p>
<p>The Commission's action in favour of micro-enterprises is inspired by the European Charter for Small Enterprises.</p>
<p>Thus, the Commission is committed to Better Regulation, and will present an Action Plan on simplifying the regulatory environment to the Seville European Council.</p>
<p>Further, most of the regulations affecting businesses are national. In the end, these can only be made simpler by the Member States. The Commission is helping Member States improve their performance through, for example, benchmarking projects. In particular, these have aimed to help the start up and early stages of new businesses. As a result, it is now easier and cheaper to start up a company in most Member States. Further, Member States are working at simplifying legislation. In some of them it is now possible to settle some tax and social security issues on line. Micro-enterprises will be the first to benefit from this progress.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Another serious problem for micro-enterprises is access to finance. Under the Multi-annual Programme for Enterprise and Entrepreneurship the Commission has provided a specific window offering guarantees for micro-loans. The Commission is also about to launch an initiative on best practices in micro-finance for SMEs. This should help access to micro-loans.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member on the importance of the participation of civil society in the debate on ageing, and more specifically in connection with the Second World Assembly on Ageing.</p>
<p>As far as the possibilities of Community funding for the event are concerned: while the Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) Forum is linked to a world assembly, the Commission wishes to underline that the possibilities for funding under external assistance and development budget lines are determined by the overall objectives of Community development policy, or in the case of certain specific thematic budget lines (such as those relating to human rights or migration), by the specific objectives agreed for the line in question by the budgetary authority. The Commission was approached by the organisers of the event with a view to obtaining Community funding, but the Commission regrets that it is not in a position to provide funding in the context of its external assistance programmes and budget lines, as the event does not unfortunately correspond to the criteria referred to above. Moreover, the relevant programming documents do not provide for funding such an event on ageing.</p>
<p>Under very specific conditions it might be feasible to consider the possibility of support from budget lines related to Community internal policies on ageing, on the understanding that these budget lines cannot cover any costs of participation of NGOs from the developing countries.</p>
<p>In relation to the possibility of funding from budget lines related to internal Community policy measures, a delegation from the organising committee met with the Commission services in mid-January of this year. At this meeting the delegation was informed that there might be some small possibility for financial support for this event from the "Community action programme to combat discrimination<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span>", if several conditions were met. First, there would need to be a clear anti-discrimination component to the Forum, which was not the case in its draft programme. Second, the Commission would have to receive a formal application from the authorities responsible for the Anti-discrimination Programme in Spain. The delegation was advised to take immediate contact with the appropriate Spanish authorities to process the application as soon as possible, given the short timeframe. However, the Spanish authorities have not contacted the relevant Commission services on the matter and unfortunately it is now too late to process an application to secure support in time for the event.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission sent a reasoned opinion to the Portuguese authorities on 23 October 2001 concerning the construction of the Odelouca dam mentioned by the Honourable Member. In the light of the reply received from them the Commission is currently considering what further action to take in the infringement proceedings, including referral to the Court of Justice in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty.</p>
<p>No Community funding has been granted, up to now, to fund directly the construction of the Odelouca dam.

<p>The Commission can also confirm that it has approved funding for projects under the Cohesion Fund which are subsidiary to the Barlavento water supply system in Algarve. This system was given high priority in the reference framework for the Cohesion Fund in Portugal, in view of an urgent need to improve the drinking water quality and to protect the water beds which were being depleted due to excessive demand. For all projects co-financed up to the present, the Portuguese authorities have provided the necessary environmental assessment information, which was subject to prior analysis and approval by the Commission in relation to compatibility with existing Community legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0119"></a>

<p>On 6 March 2002, the Commission decided to re-open proceedings in accordance with the requirements of the Treaty establishing the EC with regard to the State aid scheme and with Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 on the application of Article 88(ex 93) of the Treaty<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, for abuse of aids that have already been approved and granted to Olympic Airways, as decided by the Commission in 1994 and 1998 and for new aids that were granted illegally since that time to this company.</p>
<p>The Commission’s investigation focuses, in the main, on the existence of doubt surrounding:</p>
<p>- the respect of the restructuring plan covering the period 1998-2002;</p>
<p>- the respect of a number of conditions and commitments, subject to which aid measures were approved both in 1994 and in 1998;</p>
<p>- the payment arrears relating to various airport charges and taxes and other amounts due for the use of premises at Greek airports by Olympic Airways and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission decided to investigate the guarantee provided by the Greek government regarding Olympic Airways, a guarantee which concerns EUR 19.5 million in credit, which would have enabled Olympic Airways to survive the operational difficulties experienced between November 2001 and February 2002.</p>

<p>A report from DG SANCO's Food and Veterinary Office has recently been published concerning a series of missions to the Member States regarding control of staging points. The report makes disturbing reading and of particular concern is the conclusion where it states that 'the failure to check that animals destined for staging points actually arrive, as indicated on the route plan, has also led to a failure to ensure that journey times are respected.'</p>

<p>Council Regulation (EC) N° 1255/97<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> concerning Community criteria for staging points and amending the route plan referred to in the annex to Directive 91/628/EEC<a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, as amended by Directive 95/29/EC<a href="#defann_47_3" name="refann_47_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> had to be applied by Member States from 1 January 1999.</p>
<p>The general report of the Food and Veterinary Office, to which the Honourable Member refers, is based on the individual missions carried out within the Member States quite shortly after the Regulation had to be applied.</p>
<p>Staging points were a new concept in Community law and were set up, where needed, by private trade interests subject to inspection and control by the competent Member State authorities. For this reason it was, perhaps, not surprising that some difficulties occurred in relation to securing compliance with the requirements of the Regulation.</p>
<p>The Commission was, of course, disappointed that the first FVO inspection reports on staging points found some serious breaches of the requirements of the Regulation.</p>
<p>The FVO always carries out a follow-up to these reports, and the Honourable Member’s attention is drawn to the statement in the report indicating that “in all Member States, the competent authority responded to the mission team’s findings by either initiating corrective action or withdrawing the approval of the staging point”.</p>
<p>Given the degree of co-operation, the Commission would not normally seek to open infringement proceedings following a first inspection mission. It will, however, continue to monitor the situation and take further appropriate action if necessary.</p>
<p>Under present Community legislation there is already a maximum journey limit of 8 hours for all journeys over 50 kms in basic vehicles.</p>
<p>Existing Community legislation aims to achieve a satisfactory level of welfare for journeys over 8 hours by imposing additional welfare requirements notably in relation to the facilities available on the vehicle and the particular needs of the species of animal being transported<a href="#defann_47_4" name="refann_47_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the Parliament’s concerns relating to journey times and is currently examining this aspect in the context of the drafting of its proposals for new animal transport legislation.</p>
<p>In redefining travelling limits, it is necessary to take into account both scientific and socio-economic evaluation.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Commission requested an opinion of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on different aspects of animal transport and in particular to define the most appropriate time limits. This opinion is expected very shortly.</p>
<p>However, it should be pointed out that a wide range of other measures need to be addressed to improve the welfare of the transported animals in combination with appropriate travelling time limits. The Commission has, therefore, consistently argued for a wider approach.</p>
<p>In this context long distance transportation of live animals has to be examined against its contribution to a sustainable agriculture which should be not only capable of maintaining an active rural community but which is also environmentally and ethically sound.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission recognises that the repatriation of mortal remains of a person who has died in another Member State than his/her own is a sensitive and difficult issue which can cause great suffering for the family involved.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of some individual cases, in particular, through the recent written parliamentary questions, where the repatriation of a deceased person from one Member State to another has raised difficulties. However, the Commission does not have any information or statistics which would provide an overview of a possible problem and its scope.</p>
<p>These issues potentially raise a number of questions, some of them in relation to different Community policies, for instance, transport, health, free movement, etc. However, it does not appear that there would be a clear Community competence to cover all these various aspects. Moreover, the regulations governing the transfer of remains of dead persons are laid down in the International Agreement of Berlin (1937, N° 4391 League of Nations Treaty Series) and by the Agreement on the transfer of corpses of the Council of Europe concluded in September 1973. In any event it should be recalled that Member States which regulate the transport of deceased persons, must, in conformity with the case law of the Court of Justice, apply any requirements on a non-discriminatory basis. Any derogation based on public health grounds must also be in conformity with the case-law of the Court.</p>

<p>The first outbreaks of the Pepino mosaic virus in the Community were detected in late 1999 and early 2000, and a preliminary pest risk analysis carried out by several Member States based on available scientific information demonstrated that Pepino mosaic virus and its damaging effects could be of significant plant health concern to the Community, in particular for protected tomato production. However, fruits of tomato were not found to present a particular risk of spreading this disease.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission, by Decision 2000/325/EC<a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and subsequently by Decision 2001/536/EC<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, introduced measures against the introduction into and the spread within the Community of Pepino mosaic virus. Those measures apply to the inspection of tomato plants intended for planting, originating in third countries or produced in the Community, and the movement of tomato plants, intended for planting, within the Community. They also include more general monitoring for the presence of Pepino mosaic virus in the Community.</p>
<p>The Commission has asked the relevant services in the Member States to continue scientific work and to deliver an opinion on the risk of Pepino mosaic virus to out-door production of tomatoes and of other Solanaceae crops. At this stage, the scientific work performed on the Pepino mosaic virus has not provided sufficient clarification to revise the preliminary pest risk analysis.</p>
<p>Accordingly to Article 5 of Decision 2001/536/EC, the Commission will, by 30 October 2002, consider possible subsequent measures in the light of information and scientific opinion delivered by the relevant services of the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In June 2001, the Gothenburg European Council invited the Commission to present a Communication on "how the Union is contributing and should further contribute to global sustainable development". In February 2002, the Commission responded to this request by adopting the Communication « Towards a Global Partnership for Sustainable Development ». This document is intended to provide building blocks for the development of the Union's position in the framework of the work at international level preparing the World Summit on Sustainable Development. Contributions from all stakeholders, including Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs), the Parliament and the Council will of course feed the debate in the run-up to the Summit as well.</p>
<p>In April 2001, the United Nations (UN) Commission on Sustainable Development decided to develop the agenda for the Summit following a "bottom-up" approach, including: the identification of regional priorities via preparatory conferences in each UN region ; the review of the implementation of Agenda 21 ; and the consultation with stakeholders at national, regional and international level. The Commission, which has been actively participating in this preparatory work, attaches great importance to consultation of stakeholders. In fact, although, due to time constraints, it was not possible to consult civil society on the Communication as such, the Commission has publicly addressed sustainable development related issues, including meetings on sustainable development and trade policy, where the preparations for the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Ministerial, its outcome, and preparations for Johannesburg have been discussed. It also participated in public events, such as the High Level Seminar on globalisation, sustainable development and the Union’s external policies, co-organised by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) at the end of October 2001.</p>
<p>Over the next few months the Commission intends to intensify consultation with stakeholders. For example, it has set up a European Civil Society and Private Sector Steering Group, with the participation of representatives from environment and development NGOs, trade unions, business, women and youth organisations, consumers and regional and local authorities. The Steering Group, which will convene several times during 2002, aims at ensuring stakeholders involvement in the international preparation of the Summit and its follow up. Most notably, the outcome of the work of the Steering Group will provide input for defining the Union position for Johannesburg. In addition, the Commission will hold a public event on the Summit in Brussels on 18 April 2002, within the framework of the Green Week.</p>
<p>Finally, sustainable development will be addressed at the stakeholder forum, which the Commission and the Economic and Social Committee will organise on 12/13 September 2002.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0139"></a>

It has emphasised its conviction that working conditions and rewards need to remain among the most effective and competitive in the Union in order to permit sustained recruitment of the best qualified staff.</p>
<p>The objectives and rules of the Union’s Institutions reflect the fact that they are of public service organisations. The objectives and rules therefore differ, and will continue to differ, from several conventions in the private sector. An unbiased examination of all of the Commission’s proposals would further prove to the Honourable Member that the Reform does not aim to “privatise a significant part of the European public service”. Meanwhile, the Commission’s “response to the criticism” that the proposed changes will “create a network of patronage and favouritism” is that such a claim is completely unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member’s question gives the impression that he has not been informed that, whilst it was possible in the negotiations with Staff Representatives to get unanimous agreement on basic reform principles, differences of opinion with some trade unions on specific reform proposals could not be overcome. It must be stressed, however, that these differences have nothing to do with a lack of dialogue or serious consideration of counter-proposals. On the contrary, meetings were held between the administration and trade unions on an unprecedented scale. The reality is that differences were mainly caused by differing perceptions of the possibility of the Council being willing to approve the essential parts of the proposed package of modifications to the Staff Regulations. Where counter proposals were put, it would not be accurate to say that they came from “a large section of trade unions”. Indeed, the Commission regrets that unions that were opposing some of the Commission’s proposals generally failed to attend the final rounds of negotiation.</p>
<p>Despite this disagreement with some trade unions, the Commission points out that Staff Representatives representing, in electoral terms, 59% of the Commission’s staff have agreed to the Commission’s proposals. These proposals are currently under discussion with the Administrations of the European Institutions and representatives of their Staff Committees. Following those discussions in the Inter-institutional Staff Regulations Committee the legislative proposals of the Commission for revision of parts of the existing Staff Regulations will be given final consideration by the Commission and then laid before Council and Parliament.</p>
<p>The Commission notes the declarations made by the Honourable Member in the first paragraph of his Question and invites him to examine all proposals so that he can see that, regrettably, he has been badly misinformed on all of the points that he makes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0145"></a>

<p>For two decades, the Ministry of Cultural Affairs has endeavoured to build the new Acropolis museum on an inappropriate site, as competent scientific bodies have repeatedly pointed out. The Central Archaeological Council of Greece has reported that some important archaeological finds have recently been made at the same site. Nevertheless, while the survey is not yet complete and no official announcement and assessment of the finds have been made, the Ministry of Cultural Affairs is hastening to build the museum over them.</p>
<p>Since the EU provides part of the funding for the project, what measures will the Commission take to prevent the construction of a cultural edifice over other archaeological remains, ensure that another site is selected which is able to accommodate and enhance a modern museum worthy of the international appeal of its exhibits, and to protect and develop the archaeological site at Makriyannis?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Would the Commission say how many non-remunerated traineeships there are in the latest call for applications? Why does this category of trainee continue to exist?

<p>In relation to the question raised the Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that:</p>
<p>1. The traineeships office of the Commission recruits 1.200 trainees (stagiaires) each year, following a pre-selection and selection procedure between more than 12.000 applications. All these trainees are the official "administrative trainees" in the Commission.</p>
<p>2. Since 1997, following an agreement between the Commission and the Budgetary authority, (relevant letter of Mr Liikanen of 29/10/1997), the annual budget of the Traineeships program of the Commission has progressively increased, in order that all trainees recruited (1.200 /year) be remunerated. From 1 March 2002 all trainees recruited in the Commission will receive a monthly grant of € 695 and they will be entitled to the reimbursement of their travel expenses and participation of all activities organised for them by the traineeships office (visits, conferences etc.).</p>
<p>3. As far as concerns “non remunerated trainees”, these are trainees selected and recruited directly by the different Directorates General (DGs) and services of the Commission, on a bilateral basis and outside the official administrative program of the Commission. They are known as “atypical traineeships”. The duration of their traineeship and their nature differ in each DG (i.e. from four weeks to 12 months, PhD researchers, students in their final year required to have a short specific traineeship, specialist for a specific project or action, etc.). Each DG recruits according to its needs, requirements and availability for their reception.</p>
<p>4. None of these "atypical trainees" receives any form of grant or remuneration by the Commission. Some of them receive research grants from other institutions or organisations during their traineeship in the Commission.</p>
<p>5. Since atypical trainees are not part of the official "administrative trainees", thus they are not entitled to join in activities organised by the Traineeships office for the "administrative trainees".</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0151"></a>

<p>Responding to the results of a survey carried out in 2001 on the distribution of Rhizomania in the United Kingdom, and on extensive industry wide consultations regarding this disease, the United Kingdom informed the Standing Committee on Plant Health that it was not the intention to seek renewal of the United Kingdom protected zone status for the whole of the United Kingdom except for Northern Ireland. Sweden informed the Standing Committee on Plant Health of the presence of the disease in certain areas at very low level.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Standing Committee on Plant Health proposed to change the protected zone status of the United Kingdom to be restricted to Northern Ireland, and to change the permanent status recognised for Sweden into a temporary status enabling Sweden to complete its efforts for eradication of this disease in the areas concerned.</p>

<p>As the Commission has made known in press statements, the official referred to in the Honourable Member’s question did submit a lengthy personal statement of concerns together with 5 000 pages of annexes to the Commission and to the independent EU Anti-Fraud office, OLAF, on August 31 2001.</p>
<p>The duty of all officials to report suspicions of wrongdoing was set down in Parliament Regulation 1073/99 of 25 May 1999 and implemented by Commission Decision of 2 June 1999. Because the Commission considers that the duty must be taken seriously, the Commission provided the official referred to in the Honourable Member’s question with eight weeks of paid leave and with secure office accommodation to enable him to compile the statement.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member will recognise that the fact that a statement of concerns is submitted does not give automatic validity to the allegations made in a dossier, nor does it constitute the opening of an investigative procedure, or mean that individuals referred to in the statement can be considered to be under investigation. The Honourable Member will appreciate that basic considerations of natural justice, of the presumption of innocence, and of the right to privacy as well as proper procedure require recognition of these realities.</p>
<p>The Commission is also sure that the Honourable Member’s parliamentary experience and professional background as a journalist will enable him to appreciate one other relevant and vital consideration: it is that public divulgence of allegations can be regarded to unjustifiably compromise the rights of individuals and put at risk the proper conduct of any investigations that might potentially be undertaken.</p>
<p>Those are the very considerations which make it impossible for the Commission to publish the statement of allegations. OLAF has, however, provided material to the Budgetary Control Committee of this Parliament under the terms of Annex III of the Framework Agreement, and the Commission has reported to that Committee in ways that seek to impart the maximum possible information without compromising individuals or potential proceedings.</p>
<p>The initial, and separate, examinations of the statement and its annexes were finalised by OLAF and by the Investigation and Disciplinary Office of the Commission at the end of February 2002. The press was informed on 1 March 2002 after the President of the Parliament and the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
