<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for this opportunity to speak on our trade relations with Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">What I told the Council recently, and would like to reiterate here today, is that we are now confronted with a very important decision on the future of our relations with Japan: namely, whether we move towards free trade negotiations with one of our main economic partners or we freeze these relations for several years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">My view is that, based on the scoping exercise we have just completed, we are now in a position to move ahead with the next steps and should move to open negotiations. The ground has been fully prepared. First, we have an upfront agreement with Japan on what both sides expect from the negotiations. This scoping paper, which lays out the scope of our potential discussions, is the most ambitious that we have agreed in all of our trade negotiations. Therefore, we have the comfort that all our priorities will be addressed in future negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, regulatory barriers are the most important problem for European trade and investment in Japan. As a result, we have negotiated – again upfront – a dedicated package which addresses the key issues. We have already found satisfactory solutions for barriers in the car, foodstuff and pharmaceutical sectors. For a number of others, I will admit that some uncertainty remains.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, a failure by Japan to deliver on these barriers would have a very negative impact on any negotiations. Europe could not conclude an agreement if that were the case. But this political reality should be backed up with legal force and that is why the Commission’s proposal for the negotiating directives includes a provision clearly stating that if Japan has not delivered on its non-tariff road maps within a year from the start of the negotiations, the negotiations will be stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">This would oblige us to take stock of the situation one year from the start of the negotiations and, as mentioned, if progress were not satisfactory, we would simply call off the discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight another important principle that we have agreed with Japan: we have accepted that the phasing out of tariffs can only take place strictly in parallel with the elimination of regulatory barriers and according to mutually agreed timetables. That means that Europe will not commit to dismantling tariffs before Japan delivers concrete results on regulatory barriers, including those for the car sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the thorniest issue we faced in our discussions with Japan was on public procurement in the railways sector. Here, I am pleased to say we have secured a good compromise. Japan has agreed to take effective measures in the context of the negotiations to open up its railways and urban transport market to EU suppliers.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to highlight, as I have done before in this House, that trade liberalisation remains the cheapest way we have to stimulate our economy. Ninety per cent of world growth will happen in the markets outside the EU in the future. Europe needs to be a big player in those markets if we are to return to prosperity. Considering its future weight in the world economy, we have a broad strategy for getting better access to Asia in particular. This agreement is a key piece in that puzzle. I would ask you to bear that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">In the weeks to come, the Commission intends to submit draft negotiating directives to the Council and start discussions on the content of a mandate. So this is a moment to seize and I hope we will have your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We really do have a great deal to be happy about, and the Commission deserves our praise.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to remind you that last year, our Chamber voted in favour of a resolution on trade relations with Japan. In this resolution, we voiced what was not so much opposition as a certain concern. We asked several questions to which we wanted answers. Work started on a scoping exercise back in June last year, and has continued during the year that has passed since then. The work would appear to have progressed very efficiently, and two weeks ago we received a report summarising it. Unfortunately, we have not received any answers to the questions we asked last year. The doubts we voiced in the previous resolution have not been resolved, in particular, as regards indicators for the removal of non-tariff barriers, or the scope of public rail tenders, for example. There were a great many more questions, and I could go into much more detail on them, but that is not the point. I believe that the issues we raised back then should be raised again.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures with a view to launching negotiations are still ongoing; this is very positive, and I am of the opinion that our Chamber should be involved in them. The European Parliament should also help to clarify public expectations. We are therefore proposing today that Rule 90(2) of the Rules of Procedure should be applied. We would like to ask the Council to wait until the Committee on International Trade has drafted a report stating its opinion before issuing a mandate to launch negotiations. We do not wish to hold back the negotiations and we are not opposed to them. We are most definitely in favour of them. What we are opposed to, however, is the questions we asked in the previous resolution being left unanswered.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that we will receive more honest responses from the Commission following work in the Committee on International Trade, and I will be even happier if we can support both the Commission and the Council in these negotiations, since I believe that Japan is a good and long-term partner, and that we should support the stepping up of our relations.</p>

This would mean we can now pursue a purely academic debate. If the European Parliament is not meant to participate in these negotiations, why do our Rules of Procedure allow us to take the steps to which I referred in my speech? If we do not have the right to voice our doubts and to call on the Council to delay issuing a negotiating mandate, why are those provisions there, when they should be removed? It is my feeling that if the Rules of Procedure clearly state that we can participate in negotiations, then this is all the more reason for us to do so, for our voice to be heard, and for us to draw attention as often as possible to our right to participate. Otherwise, this debate is a purely academic one, but I think it is much more important than that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a good reason for this.</p>
<p class="contents">You have already addressed the resolutions that we have adopted with numerous questions. These resolutions did show quite clearly the two sides of the coin when it comes to trade relations with Japan. We support increased trade relations with Japan – that much is clear – as the negotiations at WTO level have ground to a halt and Japan is one of our most important trading partners in the world. Over the last year, EU exports to Japan had a total value of around EUR 49 billion, while exports from Japan to the EU came in at around EUR 69 billion – in other words, we are talking about a very important part of our economic dynamics. That being the case, we need to also strengthen this so that the inter-exchange and the growth dynamic develop further. That is right and proper. On the other side of the coin, however, when it comes to market access on the Japanese side, we actually have non-tariff barriers to trade. That, after all, is why the Commission carried out this scoping exercise, and it was only recently that we obtained the results.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, analysing this situation precisely is the right thing to do. No sooner do we look, for example, at the key sector that is the motor industry, than three non-tariff barriers to trade hit us right in the face. Of course there is, for one thing, an agreement at UN level about technical standards for cars, as well as for vehicle parts. Clearly, recognition of this is crucial to market access. The European Union has signed up to nearly all of these guidelines, whereas Japan has only signed up to 43. In order to also be able to supply car parts to the Japanese market with unfettered access, it is actually a basic prerequisite that Japan, too, should sign up to these UN conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">If I consider, now, the tax breaks enjoyed by environmentally friendly vehicles, I can see that, in Japan, these depend solely on test cycle JC08. Logic dictates, however, that this cycle is not adhered to by vehicles that we produce here, as we test according to a different cycle, the European driving cycle. It needs to be ensured that the same tax benefits for environmentally friendly vehicles – we define these as vehicles emitting below 90 grams of CO<span class="sub">2</span> per kilometre – are ensured for European vehicles in Japan, too, without jeopardising the standard by so doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, traders must also have the opportunity to offer their cars for sale in Japan, and to have them maintained in workshops there. Current property law does not provide for that.</p>
<p class="contents">So, then, we need a tougher re-presentation of the scoping exercise and clear guidelines from Parliament. That is why we are calling on the Council to wait until September to issue a mandate, that is, until Parliament has drawn up clear guidelines for a mandate for trade relations with Japan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Youth unemployment is at record levels and economic growth has barely reached 1.5%. International trade is turning into a key growth factor in response to the needs of the European Union’s shrinking internal market. Europe needs bigger markets where European producers can export our products. It needs cheaper products for European importers and consumers, as well as opportunities for more profitable investments to become available and be given to European companies.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is vitally important that the European Union’s trade policy is targeted at those countries where European business can gain the most. The agreements with Colombia, Peru and Central America cannot revitalise the EU’s stuttering economy. What the EU really needs are free trade agreements, both with the large newly emerging economies, such as India and Brazil, and with the global economic giants like the US and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I too, representing the Liberals in Parliament, support the opportunity for potentially opening the negotiations on a free trade agreement with Japan. I believe that Europe must not miss the moment to strengthen its contacts with Japan across the board, including its economic relations with the world’s third largest economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The opportunity to overcome the biggest obstacles hampering deeper relations between the European Union and Japan relating to the removal of the non-tariff barriers in important European business sectors (and which my colleagues mentioned: car manufacturing and electronics), the reduction in tariffs and progress on public procurement will generate billions of euro in profits for European firms and will create new jobs which European citizens desperately need.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take this step before it is far too late, and before Japan decides that it is no longer worth waiting and heads east towards the United States and the countries of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">I obviously understand that some colleagues and Member States are distrustful of Japan, still unable to meet all the commitments it has made, which have been outlined in the scoping exercise for the negotiations. However, I firmly believe that this distrust is more the result of pessimism and conservatism. Of course we must not be naive. At the same time, however, we must not forget that initiating negotiations on a free trade agreement between the European Union and Japan does not mean, as Commissioner De Gucht also emphasised, that these negotiations need to be concluded at any price.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also why I think that the Commission needs to be given a mandate now to initiate negotiations on a free trade agreement, with the clear insistence, however, that, if Japan fails to meet its commitments in the car sector and, most of all, on public procurement, we will be obliged to halt these negotiations or review our position towards them continuing in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if the European Union waited now, if it waits again and again after this, and continues waiting, I think that we will squander one of the biggest opportunities in our trade policy. This is why I am actually making an appeal to my colleagues. I do support the view that Parliament should have its say before giving a mandate, but we must not be so conservative and we need to give growth in Europe a chance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also share the positive view on this resolution. It is extremely important for us that the Council be able to hear the voice of Parliament on the mandate. I believe that the institutional agreement framework is clear. It is not a binding opinion but, in view of both the economic and social crises, and the trade deficits that we have in Europe, it is absolutely essential to get trade agreements and the content of the negotiations right.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, should it happen, for once, that the Council listens to what Parliament has to say before establishing the negotiating mandate, I think that we could take a step forward in terms of the quality of the agreements that we can approve. I think that recent experience, including the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), shows that from a policy standpoint, it would be wise to listen to what Parliament has to say before entering into negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is not a question of obtaining, pre-negotiation, concessions from the Japanese, as certain groups understand it. We are simply saying: let us have a transparent negotiation process that is clear, and thereby not enter into several negotiation processes at the same time. Let us have a clear mandate with which we can start negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">That also raises some questions. Conducting negotiations with Japan and with the United States also raises some questions. In our Committee on International Trade, we have, on several occasions, had discussions with Pascal Lamy and today this process marks a break. Entering into negotiations with a large trade bloc such as Japan or the United States marks a break in the European position and, as such, puts to one side, or takes note of, the failed negotiations that took place in the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p class="contents">We must take greater consideration of the consequences of these negotiations, in particular, when they primarily concern the regulatory system, investments, public markets, and all of the regulatory frameworks rather than tariffs. We must consider what bilateral negotiations signify as opposed to multilateral negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, Commissioner, you said that 90%, I believe, of the growth – this is your figure – will take place outside of Europe. I am not sure that Japan is the most dynamic area right now, but to benefit further from this international growth means being able to sell, which entails having a strategic vision of our economy and our industrial sector. Once again, I regret the fact that we have some 20 trade negotiations ongoing around the world without having an industrial policy, without knowing what we want for our economy, for example, for our automotive industry over the next 20 years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Japan, too, finds itself in a long struggle, which was made even worse by the disaster last year. The EU’s trade agreement with South Korea, a direct competitor of Japan, put the government and businesses of that country under pressure, and that also affects the jobs and overall social situation in Japan. However, while many European governments are often quickly enthused by agreements with developing countries, as these are always negotiated to the advantage of European businesses and investors, the conservatives – including in this House – are currently applying the brakes to the talks with Japan. Aware of Japan’s dire straits, some are even calling for the Japanese to kowtow before real negotiations can take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, friends prove themselves in times of trouble. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would be ill-advised – as certainly all of us in this House would be, too – to categorise Japan as a beggar now, rather than a partner. The dispute about non-tariff barriers to trade is also something that we should resolve eye-to-eye at the negotiating table. In those negotiations, our aim should not be to cut as many laws as possible that our trading partner has developed. We need to analyse the regulations in dispute based on their purpose and aim in order to achieve a result that provides the social benefit required but which, at the same time, favours the trade of products, without, for example, reducing levels of consumer protection or environmental targets.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we also take very seriously the concerns of Japanese farmers, who see their livelihoods threatened by future European agricultural exports. Similarly, there must be no agreement if the interests of the people of Europe are not safeguarded. My group will certainly not vote in favour of any treaty in which the investment protection chapter grants companies a right of action against governments or the EU.</p>

In response to your first question, I do believe it very likely that all or many of the groups jointly submitted this draft resolution. Nonetheless, the questions I asked are of pressing interest, including because they are accepted and considered not merely by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), but by all the groups. That is why I pointed out that we need to make progress here with the negotiations. In that regard, it needs to be more than just scoping. We need to go a step further and, as Mr Lange said, also incorporate this consideration when issuing the mandate.</p>

Luckily, like the Member States of the European Union, Japan is a free democracy with human rights and a market economy. Sadly, there are all too few countries around the world where that is the case. That is why we need close contact with Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true, though, that we have been engaged in what is known as a high-level dialogue with Japan for years now, and it has produced no results whatsoever. Fascinatingly, the results of this were not that this high-level dialogue was to be taken to a successful conclusion, but the answer that Japan and the Commission came up with, instead, was to commence a ‘scoping exercise’ in respect of a free trade agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of subjects have already been mentioned. The Commissioner, for instance, brought up the subject of the railways, which is an incredibly good example, because our market for public procurement in the railway sphere is as open as possible, and Japanese firms are able to compete. Yet we need to beg and scrape and do everything possible just to now obtain a very small degree of access to the Japanese market. This cannot be how this is supposed to work.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies in the automotive sector, which Mr Lange has already addressed. Of course, the import figures into the European Union for Japanese vehicles are not much larger than our export figures into Japan. We must not, however, ignore the fact that the Japanese already have such good access to our markets in Europe that, as luck would have it, they produce 100 000 cars in Europe, while we do not produce so much as a single European car in Japan. This, too, shows that we need fair conditions before we enter into negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The next issue that is close to my heart that I want to raise is that I wish that we should not engage in never-ending negotiations. When we start negotiations, it must also be ensured that the Commission has enough resources to bring them to a prompt conclusion. We have been negotiating for years with over a dozen countries around the world on free trade agreements, but we have concluded hardly any of them. I would like to see the Commission investing sufficient personnel resources in order to achieve tangible results as regards the free trade agreement with Japan so that we do not negotiate for five or ten years only to find ourselves still without a result. I would like to see negotiations with a fixed schedule. I would like to see an agreement. I would like to see the negotiations concluded within one, two or, at the most, three years, before, unfortunately, we then in any case have to wait another year at the European end until we have the translations in place.</p>
<p class="contents">This, as it happens, is another subject which I would be very grateful if the Commissioner could bring up in the Commission at some point. I find it unsatisfactory for the European Union that it sometimes takes a year or more after the negotiations have been concluded before we finally have all the translations in Parliament. This is another area where the Commission needs a great deal more resources.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the results, I would like to see negotiations commence with Japan. However, I would like us, Parliament, to first clarify what we want to say and for the Commission to then go all out to conclude such negotiations within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

Deep underlying reasons, based on the history of our times, push for relations between the democracies of Europe and of the Rising Sun, based on the desire for friendship, development and the opening up of new opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, however, overlook the fact that, amid all the distrust caused by long-term antagonism and by resentments that have not yet fully died down, the history of a system of relations in the name of multipolarity, overcoming the hegemony of the United States, is pushing us into new partnerships with the Far East. This has led to new forms of cooperation between China and Japan, shifting the balance that has become established since the Second World War and which must not be used against the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The new set-ups which are being introduced at global level and in the major regions of the world thus require the European Union to be an enterprising key player, both by strengthening the multilateral approach and through bilateral relationships that will help Europe strengthen its competitiveness. For these political and economic reasons, we fully support your efforts to create conditions that will improve the system of relations between ourselves and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are not willing to begin negotiations unless the Council first involves Parliament in drafting the negotiating mandate. Although, formally, Parliament has the power to conclude the negotiation process by ratifying, or otherwise, any treaties that have been signed, it is equally true that parliaments throughout the world, due to their democratic legitimacy, have always been involved in drawing up the policies that underlie negotiating mandates. Europe needs to follow not only the letter but also the spirit of the treaties, so we call upon the Council, in this as in other cases, to duly take this into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, acknowledging the words of the Commissioner, we stress that it is imperative that Japan prove it wishes to break down tariff and especially non-tariff barriers that still dominate its domestic market. It is not therefore our intention to impede negotiations, but to assume responsibility for the growing demand within European public opinion, which fears that bringing together an open internal market such as ours with the increasingly closed markets of our main competitors will, in the end, damage our competitiveness and, with it, growth and employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur Metin Kazak: if there are no negotiations, Japan will look further east – as Mr Susta said just now – to the rest of Asia and to the Pacific rather than to Europe. Such a closure would be paradoxical for us, given that it is a fully democratic country, whereas we have ongoing negotiations with other countries that are dictatorships in one way or another, such as Vietnam or Singapore.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, let there be no talk about the European crisis as a reason for holding back such negotiations. The crisis will not be defeated by clamping shut like a clam, through protectionism. The crisis will be defeated by open, intelligent trade, by a wisdom that we have perhaps not always had, and by basing our stance on reciprocity, as I – together with Mr Daul, Mr Guerrero Salom, Mr Susta and Ms Muscardini – called for in written statement No 0016/2012 on fair trade, which I invite you all to sign.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, it means not closing the door on Japan, but negotiating measures to ensure the removal of non-tariff barriers, bilateral safeguards for sensitive sectors – and we can strengthen such safeguards – the protection of geographical indications for our products, the removal of barriers that hamper trade today, especially for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which could otherwise find a further outlet in Japan, the opening up of Japanese public procurement to our companies, including SMEs, a mechanism for judging business disputes which today we are finding hard to put in place, as well as cooperation on post-Fukushima energy, based on sustainable development. These and other things we can ask for and obtain from Japan. We cannot agree with simply giving up from the start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An important part of these relations is the existing strong trading links between the two parties. I absolutely believe that these also need to continue to be expanded and deepened. Against the backdrop of global stagnation, trade can play a very important role here in helping countries and regions to achieve increased economic growth and thus, increased prosperity for the citizens on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">However, stronger trade relations cannot be obtained at any price. Entering into trade agreements also means accepting responsibility – vis-à-vis European citizens, vis-à-vis small and medium-sized enterprises, but, above all, also vis-à-vis the environment. A precise weighing up of the advantages and disadvantages but, in particular, respectful gestures on an equal footing, must be the fundamental prerequisite for the commencement of trade negotiations. Commitments, Commissioner, must also be lived up to.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, the area of agriculture is of rather particular importance. I would like to ask a couple of questions relating to food safety, the designation of geographical origin and organic products. In relation to the Commission’s most recent talks with the Japanese delegation, I would like to hear from the Commissioner whether, during these talks, he was able to bring up barriers to trade in the sphere of food safety, specifically not only in relation to the Fukushima disaster, but in general? I would also be interested to hear the latest state of affairs when it comes to the designation of geographical origin for foodstuffs. How did the initial talks in this area go and what assessments would you make in this connection?</p>
<p class="contents">My third question relates to the area of organically produced agricultural products. What form can you envisage for a potential mutual recognition of organic products in this field? What specific efforts is the Commission making in this field?</p>

A free trade agreement between Japan and the European Union would entail substantial benefits for both sides. A large proportion of the benefits deriving from such an agreement will be gained by Japan lifting the barriers, especially non-tariff ones, which it currently imposes on the European Union. A second thorny issue is Japan’s public procurement market, to which European companies are still failing to gain sufficient access.</p>
<p class="contents">Before initiating the negotiations aimed at achieving a free trade agreement, Japan must demonstrate its willingness to make the necessary concessions in these two areas. Given that the discussions on these subjects have not made sufficient progress so far, it is not appropriate to embark hastily on the negotiations.

Trade between us is not without its complications, however. Having met with many European and Japanese companies, I think that the picture is pretty clear. The huge challenges faced by European companies in Japan consist of discriminatory bureaucracy and complicated procedures as well as a huge number of protectionist rules. Japanese companies, for their part, complain all the more about European duties.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore pleased that we are now, slowly but surely, getting close to initiating free trade negotiations, because this is precisely the tool to deal with both of these problems. Now that we have finished discussing the scope, we can also clearly see the benefits that we can expect from a free trade agreement. It is therefore important for us now to take the next step, for the Council to set a clear mandate for negotiations and for the Commission to initiate those negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have heard to a certain extent here in plenary today, however, there is opposition to these negotiations, but I think that it is rather interesting, because this opposition is somewhat different to the kind we usually see when we discuss free trade negotiations. It is not the usual kind of opposition relating to agricultural protectionism or talk of social or environmental dumping, and it is not north against south. Instead, it seems to be more difficult in this case as it is often economies that are similar to each other that need to come together.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a question of rules that have to be equal, and I do not believe that these negotiations will be easy. A number of us visited Japan to discuss the preconditions for a free trade agreement with Japanese representatives, and I must admit that I was not entirely convinced of their resolve and willingness to get to grips with the difficult decisions that need to be made precisely with regard to amending these discriminatory rules. This does not mean that we should not initiate negotiations, however. On the contrary, I believe that it is within the context of negotiations that we can exert the pressure that we need to exert in order to open up the Japanese market for European companies.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a free trade agreement. At the present time, when it is more popular than ever to talk about us needing reforms for growth, there is no other growth reform that could be as good and as effective as a free trade agreement. This is a reform that will not cost any money, but, unfortunately, there seem to be a lot of European leaders and representatives who do not recognise such a reform, despite the fact that it is staring them in the face. I therefore suggest that, as soon as possible, we propose that we enter into full negotiations with Japan concerning a free trade agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that more trade between Europe and elsewhere can help create these jobs. Japan is the third largest economy in the world. I know from my own country, Denmark, that we have very good experiences of trading with Japan. We have a surplus in that trade. I believe that the potential is huge for the whole EU, and I therefore support the Commission and the Council. Let us get the negotiations under way now. There are barriers, it is true, but I believe that the best solutions to those barriers are to be found at the negotiating table. It is also true that there are still questions that remain unanswered, but I believe that there is still time to get them answered. It seems to me that, for the citizens’ sake, we need to get negotiations on increased trade under way. That is something that we need, both in Europe and in Japan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there can also be serious drawbacks, and there may be sectors – including in Europe, Commissioner – that suffer heavily under agreements of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">That was, and is also, the case today in the free trade agreement that we have concluded with South Korea. This agreement has a pernicious influence on the European automotive industry. The fact that European car makers are inadequately able to sell their vehicles in South Korea has nothing to do with a lack of innovation or a lack of competitiveness. On the contrary, it has everything to do with the doggedly persisting non-tariff barriers to trade in South Korea and the blatant lack of a level playing field. The deterrent in the form of what are known as the safeguard clauses seems clearly not to work in this case, either.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is, Commissioner, that we cannot afford a repeat of a scenario like this when it comes to Japan. Mr Lange pointed out very clearly – and I agree with him 100% – that the Japanese, just like the South Koreans, are extremely proficient in the art of establishing, maintaining and continuing regulations producing non-tariff barriers to trade of this kind. Technical standardisation, in particular, where they are on a completely different wavelength to us and take a much less voluntary approach than we do here in the EU, is of crucial importance in this regard. There are also other non-tariff barriers to trade, such as those of a fiscal nature, a technical environmental nature, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">We do need to make that absolutely crystal clear as part of the scoping exercise before we begin negotiations. I hope you are prepared to promise that. I think we can say that the European automotive industry cannot be the victim of a global deal again – in this case with Tokyo – a deal where there will, of course, be give and take. In the European automotive industry today, we are faced with an actual overcapacity, with potential further restructuring measures and further problems that would arise as a result of this uneven deal with Japan and which we, of course, could overlook today.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, Commissioner, we can only have a future free trade agreement with Japan on condition that we have cast-iron guarantees, cast-iron safeguard clauses, and that there will be a level playing field in the industrial sectors, specifically in respect of the automotive sector. This idea is also set out in the CARS 21 report that the Commission very recently agreed – last week – with the car manufacturers. I propose that we meticulously implement that agreement in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that we can identify three key points in what Commissioner De Gucht has said. Firstly, that we need balanced conditions for both sides, which relate to both restrictive duties and limited access to internal markets. Secondly, the Commissioner discussed certain priorities, such as the foodstuff, car and industrial goods markets. Nevertheless, given the experience we have gained in various fields, we need more time before finally issuing a mandate, and I think that Mr Lange is right when he proposes that we should return to this matter in September. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Very unfortunate as it is, however, the news reaching the world about Europe is not positive; it is mostly negative. We all realise that this free trade agreement would give us better access, better access for Europe to the Asian markets. Each of us today also realises that the negotiations will not be easy. However, only by starting negotiations shall we be able to solve anything. The Latvian people have a saying that water does not run under a standing stone. So, then, if we do not start negotiations, that will be the standing stone in the way of trade and intensification of our economic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we have unfinished and unclear issues related to non-tariff barriers in the automotive sector, the pharmaceutical sector, in public procurement, and also with regard to agricultural products. However, the European Commission has stated very clearly that it is ready to suspend the negotiations if Japan does not fulfil the commitments undertaken in the pre-negotiation stage. I wish to again underline the fact that the faster we begin the negotiations, the stronger our signal to the world that Europe is active and able to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that Japan has supported us with contributions to the Stabilisation Fund, and that Japan shares our values. Our potential today has not been realised. If it is so hard for us to begin negotiations with Japan on a free trade agreement, how shall we ever get to negotiate with the United States of America on a free trade agreement, which is currently being discussed in political science circles as one of the ways of strengthening the unity of the democratic states? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But I have a deeper relationship with Japan and with the motor industry because I have had the experience – which I do not think anyone else here can claim – of having run a company importing cars into Japan, which was very successful.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard a lot about cars already, and I just want to make this broader point. This is a package that by any analysis – and we have had a comprehensive analysis now on the table for two years – will generate very large benefits for the European economy, across all sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">But the key difference between Japan and Korea is that the Japanese market is already open to many European companies in whole areas of branded goods and, by the way, that includes automotive goods.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are dealing with here is a complex set of non-tariff barriers. The scoping study was a response to that and we have moved forward on it.</p>
<p class="contents">But I want to say, and particularly to colleagues in the PPE Group whom I am disturbed to see are speaking in such protectionist terms, that dealing with non-tariff barriers is a far more complex and difficult and deep-seated issue than dealing with tariffs.</p>
<p class="contents">As chairman of the Committee on the Internal Market, I deal with non-tariff barriers every day of the week. We have more experience in dealing with this than any other grouping in this House. We will not make any substantial progress in the real detail of non-tariff barriers – and I would like to say to Mr Belet, by the way, that we know what they are with regard to cars; I can tell you what they are, off by heart. It is a question of getting the administrative capability in Japan to sort this out and to respond to political leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, we will not move forward unless we follow the Commission’s line: we actually start those negotiations and we will move forward, but, as he says, we will not conclude the agreements until we have got the deal on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I would say to my colleagues in the PPE Group, what on earth is wrong with that and why are you going back on your stance on supporting free trade agreements? I am very pleased that we have had support on the other side of the House and I really hope that you will agree with me that this is the right way forward and we have those safeguards in place.</p>

Indeed, it is based on an assumption of utility-maximising consumers in each; consumers in each buying goods on the sole criteria of price and quality. However, Japanese consumers are as different from Western consumers as they are admirable. They do not buy on these criteria alone. They are predisposed to buying Japanese goods because they <span class="italic">are</span> Japanese goods. All of this means that the removal of EU tariffs on Japanese goods will be as efficacious as the removal of Japanese tariffs on European goods will be irrelevant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, first of all, an answer to some technical questions which have been asked. There was a question on whether food security NGIs were included in the scoping. The answer is yes, food security is covered by the EU rules on sanitary and phytosanitary issues which themselves are part of all EU free trade negotiations. The same applies to geographical indications; specifics, of course, will be addressed during the negotiations. There was also a question on mutual recognition of organic produce. Recognition of EU organic foods in Japan is one of the early deliveries on our NTB list so this problem is being rectified and will be solved in practice before any negotiations start.</p>
<p class="contents">The second set of questions are about the role of INTA in these negotiations. I believe that in the case of Japan, the European Parliament has been duly informed that we were about to propose that the Council authorise negotiations, first orally by myself and Director-General Demarty in the INTA meetings of April and May respectively, and secondly in writing by Jean-Luc Demarty through an e-mail to INTA Chair Moreira on 17 April. Also, Director Mauro Petriccione debriefed the Japan monitoring group of INTA in May on the state of play of the scoping exercise and the European Parliament now has an opportunity to give its views on this resolution. The Commission has fully lived up to the commitments under the framework agreements. By the way, the INTA members have received the result of the scoping exercise but it is a restricted document which cannot be sent to all Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There were also a number of questions requesting that the Commission should wait to start the negotiations until the European Parliament has formally taken a decision. The procedure is that we have to propose negotiating directives to the Council. The Council has to decide upon those negotiating directives. It is up to the Council to decide when they give such a mandate to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that you are able to come forward with a detailed resolution before the Council takes its decision. Of course the agenda is within your hands, within the hands of INTA and the plenary, but I would suggest that if you could come up with a resolution by September, then probably you would be in time to influence the debate in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Questions were also asked on whether Parliament should not be part of the negotiating delegation. I am against that: Parliament is not made to negotiate; Parliament is made to debate, to come forward with resolutions, to make proposals and ultimately to vote on the ratification of the free trade agreement that will possibly be concluded with Japan. That is what is in the Treaty and I think it is very important for all institutions that we keep to that Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowhere, by the way, does a parliament negotiate free trade agreements. You will, of course, make reference to the United States, where the government can only go forward when there is a fast track, but when you look at the practice, you will see that, unless there is a fast track, the American Congress does not conclude the agreements. The whole idea that you have an agreement and then start introducing amendments can never work; it simply does not work, it has never done so in the past and will not do so in the future either.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, on the whole topic of the scoping and how we go forward, I believe there are two very important points. In the scoping, I think we have covered all items which you would normally cover in a broad free trade agreement. On top of that, we have asked the Japanese to give a solution on a number of non-tariff barriers. Recently, they have come forward with a proposal on those non-tariff barriers and we have observed that this is a satisfactory answer – provided, of course, that it is honoured in practice. That is why I have also told the Foreign Affairs Council on trade that our idea is to come forward with negotiating directives whereby we give the Japanese a year to deliver on these promises. They cannot deliver immediately because legislative and administrative instructions have to be changed. On the other hand, it does not make sense to negotiate if they do not deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">Japan being a friendly country – a democracy by the way, one of the biggest in the world – I think you realise that politically, it does not make sense to tell them: look, now deliver on all of these non-tariff barriers and then within a year we will see whether or not we will start negotiations. You do not do that. The only right political approach is to say OK, we have started negotiations, those are the promises which you have been making, we are going to check this within a year and then we will make our decision on whether or not we continue with the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">A second and very important element which we have very clearly stated is that whenever we do something about tariffs, they should do something about the NTBs so that there should be a parallel in the approach of dismantling trade impediments: on the one hand, tariffs, and, on the other hand, the non-tariff barriers. We will keep to that very strict parallelism also in negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">My last remark, Mr President: we are now discussing whether or not we should start the negotiations with Japan; we are not discussing whether or not we agree with the result of a negotiation because there is not a negotiation yet. It is very extraordinary to ask a country you want to negotiate with, and that wants to negotiate with us, to deliver on a certain number of topics before you even start negotiations. Normally, you do not do that; it is quite extraordinary. What you cannot ask the Commission is to say look, now first deliver; take another year and then we will see whether or not we agree to even speak to you. That you cannot do; that we will not do, so we are going to go forward with our proposals to the Council and then, of course, it is up to the Council to decide on the negotiating mandate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
