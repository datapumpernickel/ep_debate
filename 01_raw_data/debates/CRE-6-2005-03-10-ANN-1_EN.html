<p>The Commission, in the person of Peter Mandelson, Commissioner for International Trade, revealed at a meeting with civil society on 20 January 2005 that it intends to place a stronger focus on development in the Partnership Agreements with the ACP countries. It views the regional integration of ACP markets as a driving force for growth. The establishing of integrated areas is therefore seen as a priority, before the opening-up of the ACP markets to the EU. In the same connection, the Commission stated that it is prepared to extend the transition period for the reciprocal opening of the markets and that the duration of those transition periods would be based on the specific needs of ACP countries identified in the negotiations.</p>
<p>What does the Commission mean by the term 'integrated region'? Does it not feel that more time will be needed to give effect to South-South regionalisation?

<p>(EN) The Commission will continue to work towards the negotiations deadline for Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) with ACP countries set for the 1st January 2008. This is a tight timetable but the Commission will not be changing it for two reasons. Firstly, Article 37 (1) of the Cotonou agreement requests that the EPA shall be negotiated during the preparatory period which shall end by 31 December 2007 at the latest. Secondly - and far more importantly – deeper regional integration will be essential to helping the ACP address the development challenges of the 21<span class="sup">st</span> century and we need to act sooner not later.</p>
<p>Building on regional integration initiatives existing within the ACP, EPAs will contribute to consolidating and deepening these initiatives. They will help to make regional integration more effective and help to create larger markets. This in turn will help to mobilise domestic savings and to create poles of attraction for foreign direct investment. The recent progress made in regional integration within the ACP reflects the political decision of the ACP States to build their integration into the world economy on regional economic integration. EPAs will further follow the integration process within the ACP, as provided for in the Constitutive Act of the African Union or as may be agreed between the ACP States as a whole.</p>
<p>There are clearly real challenges ahead. The Commission does not underestimate them. However, addressing such challenges is one of the key objectives of EPA negotiations and not a reason to delay them. Furthermore, the nature and level of regional integration clearly varies between the six ACP regions.</p>
<p>The Commission objectives are to develop tailor-made agreements that support existing processes and reflect the needs and context of each region - not to adjust the overall timing of negotiations. And yes, the Commission will indeed be flexible, if need very flexible, in determining the transition periods when it comes to discussing the gradual opening of ACP markets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0155"></a>

However, on closer examination, it emerges that this continuing review is less ambitious than at first appears, and that a 'publicly available monitoring mechanism' is merely to be set up in order to assess the development aid and technical assistance provided in support of EPA negotiations (and consequently not the approach to, and the progress and outcome of the negotiations themselves).</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission can reassure you that it will do its utmost to ensure that the 2003 CAP reform is not called into question by the negotiations. In that respect, the Commission believes the Framework Agreement is a very good basis for the ongoing negotiation.</p>
<p>Some areas of the framework agreement are therefore extremely sensitive, in particular the green and blue boxes as well as to the category of sensitive products in market access.</p>
<p>The Green box has become a central element of our agricultural policy, to the benefit of all. The Community has undergone an important reform of its agricultural policy in the sense wished by the entire World Trade Organisation (WTO) Membership. By decoupling the vast majority of its direct aids from productions the Community has provided a substantial contribution in terms of reducing trade distortions.</p>
<p>As regards the Blue box, although the proportion of the domestic support devoted to it has substantially decreased thanks to our domestic reform, we still need it to cover a certain number of cases.</p>
<p>On market access, the Commission attaches particular importance to the category of sensitive products. Moreover, the discussion so far has clearly shown that all the market issues should be negotiated in a synchronised way in order to try to reach a global agreement on all these issues.</p>
<p>The Commission also considers that there is need to address the issue of balance within agriculture and in the DDA in general. There can be no question of just a deal on agriculture; equally there will have to be a balanced deal within agriculture.

<p>(EN) The Structural Fund Regulations set out the basic rules of implementation of the Funds. This legal basis is the same for all Member States and has been agreed by the Parliament and by the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p>Within the spirit of subsidiarity, the responsibility for implementing programmes supported by the Structural Funds lies primarily with the Member States while the Commission’s responsibility is to ensure that EU legislation and agreed policy priorities are observed. (Detailed ex-post audits are carried out by the EU on a sample basis.) The Polish administration has added other procedural requirements in line with Polish legal practice. For example, it decided to transpose the implementation system for the Structural Funds into Polish legal regulations which took some time to complete. It should be borne in mind also that Poland is benefiting from substantial Structural Funds assistance for the first time and the start up phase of an ambitious regional programme like IROP represents a considerable challenge for the national and regional administrations.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there has been considerable progress in the implementation of Integrated Regional Operational Program (IROP) since all of the Polish procedures were finalised last autumn. According to the Ministry of Economy, nearly 8400 applications for assistance had been submitted by the end of 2004, demonstrating considerable enthusiasm for IROP in the regions. There has been particularly strong demand for funding for the regional and local health sectors and, in fact, requests for funding add up to more than the budget available which may explain the difficulty of obtaining support for particular projects. The project selection procedure at regional level is intended to be thorough and this is essential to ensure value for money by granting EU assistance to the best projects and to ensure that the highest priority projects for each region are chosen.</p>
<p>The Commission transferred € 828 million to the Ministry of Finance last July, less than three months after accession. This was a first advance of 10% of the total assistance available from the Structural Funds and a further advance of 6% of the funds will be transferred to Poland shortly which will bring the total amount paid to over €1.3 billion. The Commission would not accept that there has been any delay in transferring substantial funds to Poland which can be made available to the ultimate beneficiaries in the regions.</p>
<p>In general, the Commission’s intention is to make the operation of Structural Funds as simple as possible while observing the principles of sound financial management. To this end, further simplification is one of the themes of the new cohesion policy proposed for 2007-2013. This should allow for greater flexibility in implementing of Structural Funds and this in turn should lead to increased efficiency in cohesion policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0115"></a>

At the same time the Commission has asked industry representatives to come forward with their preferred approach and the discussions with Member States and industry indicate common ground for such an approach.

<p>(EN) The supply of childcare services in order to facilitate women's participation in the labour market has always been a key objective within the European Employment Strategy. Furthermore, the Barcelona European Council endorsed two targets on childcare: "to provide childcare by 2010 to at least 90% of children between 3 years old and the mandatory school age and at least 33% of children under 3 years of age".</p>
<p>Indicators to meet these targets have also been included among the set of indicators to monitor the European Employment Strategy. However, the National Action Plans on employment show that, despite the improvements made in recent years, data on childcare remains scarce in Member States and is not comparable between countries. There are still discrepancies in the type of childcare included in the data, in the length of the services provided, in the age of children, etc and there is an important risk of double-counting.</p>
<p>The Commission started work on childcare statistics. The aim was twofold: to have comparable and reliable data on care for children and to fine-tune the indicator on childcare in order to be able to monitor the Barcelona target. This resulted in:</p>
<p>A report on developing a methodology and a harmonized collection of childcare data. This report is available from Eurostat's website<a href="#defann_7_2" name="refann_7_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>: Development of a methodology for the collection of harmonized statistics on childcare.</p>
<p>An indicator to measure the availability of childcare, approved by the Employment Committee. It will measure:</p>
<p>Children cared for (by formal arrangements other than by the family) up to 30 hours a usual week/more than 30 hours a usual week as a proportion of all children of the same age group. Breakdown by</p>
<p> Children under 3</p>
<p> Children aged between 3 and the mandatory school age</p>
<p> Children aged between mandatory school age and 12 years in compulsory primary (or secondary) education</p>
<p>This will be measured in the new European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), where new variables have been introduced. Results about the number of hours per child in different types of child care will be available for all Member States at the beginning of 2007.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) ad hoc module on Reconciliation between work and family life will be carried out, where more data on aspects such as quality, affordability and accessibility of care services will be available. Results will be available mid-2006.</p>
<p>From 2006, the Labour Force Survey will include a new variable on Need for care facilities. The purpose of this variable is to measure, on an annual basis, to what extent the non-existence of suitable care services, separately for children and other dependant persons, remains an obstacle to participation in the labour market. Results will be available from mid-2006.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue the work in the area of childcare - in removing disincentives for female labour participation. This will remain central in the implementation of the Lisbon strategy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At the JHA Council of Ministers on 29 January 2005, the representatives of Germany and the Netherlands asked Spain for explanations on the process of wholesale regularisation of illegal immigrants that it planned to initiate, considering such a measure to have irremediable consequences for the other EU Member States.</p>
<p>This process, which in fact began on 7 February, and which it is estimated could affect around one million people, has already led to instances of immigrants being sacked for fear of denunciations and to the 'pull factor' warned of by some Spanish police unions.</p>
<p>The principle of developing a common immigration policy has already been declared at the European Council meetings in Seville and Thessaloniki, the Green Paper on managing economic migration, recently presented by the Commission, recognises that 'decisions to admit … third country nationals in one Member State affect others', and Article III-267 of the Treaty on the European Constitution provides that the Union shall develop a common immigration policy.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, how does the Commission view the request for explanations and the criticisms levelled in respect of the process of extraordinary regularisation being implemented by the Spanish Government?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission does not comment on the actions taken by individual Member States in the field of regularisations, as these decisions are within their national competences. However, previous regularisations in some Member States and the current large-scale campaign in Spain have made it very clear that there is a strong need for a common EU approach in managing migration, since regularisations in one Member State clearly have a potential impact on all other Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission communication on the links between legal and illegal migration (June 2004, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2004&amp;nu_doc=0412">COM (2004) 412</a>) reviewed regularisation measures in Member States and concluded that, while they allow for better population management and serve to tackle illegal working and increase government revenue through taxation and social security payments, they are nevertheless not effective to reduce the extent of the unregulated labour market and they offer a form of encouragement to illegal migration (wide-scale regularisation programmes appear to be self-perpetuating).</p>
<p>National decisions by one Member State to admit third country workers, or to regularise their stay, inevitably affect others, in particular because of the right to travel freely within the Schengen area and their right to deliver services in other Member States or to reside and settle there once long-term residents status has been acquired (after 5 years).</p>
<p>Therefore the Commission proposed in the communication possible options to deal at EU level with the regularisation issue in the future; this concerned mainly the development of an early-warning information system on regularisations.</p>
<p>The Hague programme explicitly recognises the need for closer cooperation between Member States in the area of migration and asylum, including, among others, exchange of information and further harmonisation of legislation. The Commission has therefore taken the initiative, together with the Luxembourg presidency, to resume discussions among Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Ministers on the creation of a mutual information and early warning system with regard to all important national policy decisions in the field of migration and asylum, which would cover regularisation measures. Such coordination would significantly enhance transparency and ensure a much higher degree of mutual trust.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0122"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the economic consequences for the feed industry that the detection of animal proteins in feeding stuffs may have.</p>
<p>The high number of BSE cases in cattle born after 1994, when a ban on feeding mammalian proteins to ruminants was introduced, resulted in the application of an extended feed ban to all farmed animals in 2001 including a zero-tolerance policy. The provisions are applicable to all Member States. This policy proved essential in the successful fight against BSE.</p>
<p>The European Food Safety Authority has been requested to re-assess the risk posed by the presence of traces of animal proteins in feed. An opinion is expected within the next few months.</p>
<p>The Commission has co-financed research projects and organised ring trials in order to improve the non-species specific microscopic method and to develop ruminant-specific alternative methods.

<p>(EN) Animal welfare is a very important issue for the Commission. The Commission has been promoting and developing animal welfare legislation for many years.</p>
<p>The Commission’s responsibilities for animal protection increased under the recent amendment of the EC Treaty, which includes a Protocol on animal welfare. In addition, the Commission recently announced that it will develop a strategic approach on animal welfare. The development of the strategy will be an inclusive process based inter alia on broad stakeholders’ consultation.</p>
<p>The competence for adopting animal welfare measures having an exclusively ethical objective remains, however, within the national domain. It is in this national context that the UK decided to ban fox hunting and, by the same token, in Spain the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands decided to ban bullfighting totally. In a less far-reaching measure, the Autonomous Community of Catalonia forbids the building of new arenas, the use of portable bullrings and the establishment of bullfighting schools.</p>
<p>The welfare of animals used during bullfighting, traditional festivals or other activities involving combat between animals or between people and animals is an area which also falls within the sole competence of the Member States.</p>
<p>The mentioned Protocol annexed to the EC Treaty requires the Community and the Member States to pay full regard to animal welfare when drawing up and implementing agriculture, transport, single market and research policies. The use of animals for entertainment, sporting activities or hunting fall therefore outside the scope of the Protocol.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Protocol states that the legislative and administrative provisions and customs of Member States relating to particular religious rites, cultural traditions and regional heritage must be respected.</p>
<p>In addition, Directive 93/119/EC on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing expressly states that its provisions do not apply to the killing of animals in the context of cultural or sport events.</p>
<p>In the light of the described legal situation, there is no legal basis on which the Commission could propose measures to ban bull fighting or similar spectacles involving the use of animals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0130"></a>

<p>(EN) The promotion and protection of the rights of the child is an important part of the human rights policy of the EU both in the internal and external relations fields. At a policy level, the Commission fully supports the efforts which have been made by the EU to draw attention to the issue of birth registration, including the call to all UN Member States to intensify efforts to ensure the registration of all children which is included in the resolution on rights of the child tabled by the EU at both the UN Commission on Human Rights and the UN General Assembly Third Committee.Moreover, the Commission has also sought to improve awareness of the issue within the EU institutions by focusing on birth registration at the second meeting of the Inter-institutional group on children’s rights held on 20<span class="sup">th</span> January 2005, during which representatives of the NGO Plan International briefed participants on the issue.</p>
<p>As regards initiatives to tackle child labour and the link to birth registration, it is important to mention that the Commission has a long standing cooperation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO). This cooperation has been extended to EU external policies by an overall agreement of the 14 May 2001 (Exchange of letters). The Commission is already supporting specific ILO initiatives on the promotion core labour standards and in particular the fight against child labour in several regions in the world. The Commission also signed in July 2004 a Strategic Partnership with the ILO in the field of development which has as one priority preventing Child labour. In this context, the Commission is at present discussing with its ACP partners an action programme to fight child labour together with the ILO International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC). The specific measures which will be taken in order to promote capacity building for public authorities may include strengthening birth registration and tracking mechanisms. This could be organised in close coordination with UNICEF as this organisation is particularly active in this field.</p>
<p>The Commission has also supported in West Africa several initiatives from rehabilitation to building up the legislative framework at country level, including attention given to birth registers. Moreover, it should be noted that specific funding for children’s rights is channelled through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR). EIDHR programming for 2005-6 complements the recent approach of “mainstreaming” human rights in funding by making explicit provision for support to projects to promote children’s rights.</p>
<p>Given the magnitude and prospects of the problem of Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVCs) affected by HIV/AIDS in the Southern Africa, and their higher risk of being trafficked, the Commission is in the process of defining an Action Plan to prevent and mitigate child trafficking in the region. This would include strengthening national capacities on birth registration and tracking mechanisms of children at greatest risk of rights’ abuse.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0133"></a>

<p>A Composting Plant and Waste Recycling Facility is to be built at Sant’Antnin, Zejtun, Malta, and financed by EU funds, within 300 metres of residential areas. The Zejtun local council was not involved in either the preparation of the proposal or the impact assessment; neither were residents informed of the new plant’s increased capacity over the existing installation. The impact assessment itself excluded other possible sites on the basis of reasons which apply equally to Sant’Antnin, such as concentration of local residents, inadequate accessibility and negative impact on habitats. It did not include an assessment of the economic impact, in the only tourist area in southern Malta. Is the Commission aware of this flawed impact assessment?

<p>(EN) The project referred to by the honourable MEP consists in the redevelopment and upgrading of an existing waste treatment plant in the locality of Marsascala. The site is located in the south-east part of Malta around 1.5 kilometres from the centre of Marsascala and a similar distance from the centre of Zejtun. It should be recalled that this is not a new project. The plant will be built within the current boundaries of the existing plant and will not necessitate land reclamation or new construction for the site preparation.</p>
<p>From the information provided by the Maltese authorities and examined by the Commission during the appraisal process of the request for assistance under the Cohesion Fund, the Commission has not identified elements which could demonstrate that the requirements of the EIA Directive (Directive 85/337/EEC<a href="#defann_14_1" name="refann_14_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment as amended by Directive 97/11/EC<a href="#defann_14_2" name="refann_14_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>) have not been respected. Indeed the Environmental Impact Assessment procedure, on which this information is based, included public consultation at different stages and the examination of three alternative locations of the project. The proposed location was identified as the most suitable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it should be stressed that under the subsidiary principle, the Commission does not have the power to impose the choice of a specific location on a Member State. This choice is exclusively up to the national competent authorities.</p>
<p>The economic aspects of the project were assessed through a cost benefit analysis and a financial analysis which are requested for the project appraisal needed for assistance from the Cohesion Fund. The analysis presented with the project detailed alternative technical solutions for the treatment and management of waste on the Island. Due to the urgency of the situation and limited land availability, the analysis implies that the “footprint” of any new facility should be minimised as far as possible. This was the basis for the choice of the current site and the upgrading of the existing plant. Any mitigation measures necessitated by an increase in the plant’s capacity, including those concerning odour emissions, noise and traffic, will be implemented according to European standards. In particular, the requirements of Articles 4 and 10 of Council Directive 75/442/EEC<a href="#defann_14_3" name="refann_14_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> will have to be complied with.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The PRINCE budget line, which covers information and communication measures relating to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, has been allocated EUR 9 million in 2005. EUR 8 million is currently being distributed to the Commission Representations in the 25 Member States. Before this money is granted, the national governments must draw up an action plan on the Constitution, and a strategic partnership must be established between the Commission Representation, the European Parliament Information Office and the national government in question.</p>
<p>The European Commission has developed a range of information tools intended to provide European citizens with factual information on the European Constitution. Information panels and several million brochures and promotional items have been sent to the Commission Representations and the European Parliament Offices in the 25 Member States, as well as to any national governments that have expressed an interest. The text of the Constitution has been available on the Constitution website since 29 October 2004 in all the EU languages. The Commission has provided its Representations with several thousand copies of the Constitution for distribution to any citizens who request a copy, and there are plans for another print run. Finally, a video is currently being distributed explaining the main changes that the Constitution will bring about.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission has worked in tandem with the other European institutions in order to implement several initiatives aimed at providing European citizens with objective information.</p>
<p>These include ‘Spring Day in Europe’, which is designed to stimulate dialogue between school pupils, teachers and major players in the EU on their vision of Europe and its future. Members of the European Commission, the European Parliament, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee are asked to encourage schools to take part in this campaign, and to take part themselves in the events organised in schools on 17 March 2005.</p>
<p>A further initiative is ‘1000 debates on Europe’, the aim of which is to encourage elected representatives at all levels of government to hold debates on the Constitution, so that they can provide their fellow citizens with enough information to be familiar with the contents of the Constitution and to express their opinions freely in a public debate.</p>
<p>The Commission has also organised 16 seminars for journalists, to be held between March and December 2005. Although they will all deal with the Constitution, each will focus on a specific aspect.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0144"></a>

<p>(FR) The honourable Member appears on the one hand to be concerned that Members of the Commission could disclose details of Commission meetings, and on the other hand to want these meetings to be more open to the public.</p>
<p>These two concerns contradict one another. The first reveals a desire to ensure that the Commission’s work remains confidential, whereas the second reveals a desire for it to be made more public.</p>
<p>The only aspect of the Commission’s work that is confidential is the discussion process, which is a constitutional and governing principle of collegiality. In accordance with the Treaties and with its Rules of Procedure, the Commission acts as a College. In instances where the Treaties and the implementing acts expressly state that acts must be adopted by the Commission, such acts must therefore be adopted jointly by all the Members of the Commission. Any initiative that is put forward by a Member is discussed by the Commission, and all Members must be able to set out their specific views or proposals. Once an act has been adopted, however, the Members of the Commission hold collective responsibility for it.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, in accordance with the Code of Conduct for Commissioners, which was adopted by the Commission on 24 November 2004, out of respect for the principle of collective responsibility, Commissioners may not make any comment that would call into question a decision taken by the Commission. They shall also refrain from disclosing what is said at meetings of the Commission.</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct also states that Members of the Commission must tender their resignations if the President asks them to do so. The President of the Commission has already stated his intention to make use of the powers the Treaties confer on the President of the Commission in this respect. He has further said that he would ask Members of the Commission to resign if they were clearly not equal to their tasks or if they neglected the duties incumbent upon them under the Treaty, and that the Commission would be asked to comment on any possible resignations.</p>
<p><br />It should also be noted that, in the interests of transparency, the Commission ensures on a weekly basis that it immediately makes available a summary of all the acts it has adopted that day. This ad hoc summary is drawn up at the end of the Commission meeting purely for Parliament’s purposes, in order to inform Members of Parliament of the substance of the decisions that have been taken.</p>
<p>Similarly, press releases are drafted in such a way as to ensure that information reaches a broad audience.</p>
<p>Finally, minutes are taken of Commission meetings, and are made public after having been officially endorsed by the Members.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0146"></a>

<p>(EN) The issue raised by the Honourable Member was already discussed on the 9<span class="sup">th</span> February within an Ad Hoc group in the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. This group had asked for technical expertise in order to take account of the characteristics of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>During the presentation by experts from Italy and Germany, it was noted that the Mediterranean lacked an early warning system for tsunamis and that the increase of the population residing in the coastal zones was an additional matter of concern.</p>
<p>It was also underlined that, due to the relatively small stretch of the Mediterranean, an early warning of a few minutes duration was necessary.</p>
<p>The need to set up an early warning centre and to ensure the efficiency of the transmission channels of information before mobilising the national systems of civil protection was recognised.</p>
<p>The Commission, following the mandate of the European Council of 31 January 2005, in coordination with the Common Research Centre, is aiming at identifying the most appropriate system. At this stage, research is focusing on the global dimension in response to the request made in the framework of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the sub regional dimension, in particular the Mediterranean and its adjacent seas, will be examined.</p>
<p>The Commission will outline a more precise position at the next General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) in April.</p>
<p>With regard to the EUROMED “Bridge Project”, which aims at creating a Euro Mediterranean System of Mitigation and Management of Natural and Man made disasters and covers the period 2005/2007, the Commission is satisfied with its implementation. The operational Committee of this project, chaired by France and Algeria, with the participation of the Commission, will meet in Marseille in order to organise the future activities of the Bridge Project.

<p>(EN) ITER construction costs are estimated at 4.7Bn euro, (year 2000 prices), to be spent over a period of about ten years. The costs of operating ITER are estimated at an average annual amount of 265Mn euro, (year 2000 prices), over ITER’s expected twenty year operating lifetime, including provisions set aside during the operations for its eventual decommissioning. The EU contribution to ITER through the Euratom research framework programme budget will be within an upper limit of 40% of the total cost.</p>
<p>The Commission is closely involved in the development of the ITER Project. Recognising the scale of the technological challenge presented by ITER, Europe participated in full, with international partners under IAEA auspices, in a nine year phase (1992-2001) of ITER Engineering Design Activities with the objective of “producing a detailed, complete and fully integrated engineering design of ITER and all technical data necessary for future decisions on the construction of ITER”. The ITER design is based on the results of the latest scientific and technological results and experience from the world-wide fusion research and development programmes and has been validated by wide-ranging physics and engineering work, involving detailed analyses, specific experiments in existing fusion research facilities and dedicated technological developments, including the fabrication and test of full or scalable models of the key components of ITER. Within the European Union, the evolution of the work for ITER has been subject to rigorous expert appraisal through the European Fusion Development Agreement and the EU’s competent consultative bodies.</p>
<p>Recent technical studies of prospective fusion power plants suggest that an adequately funded ‘fast-track’ fusion development programme (including ITER and a fusion materials programme) could lead to the operation, within thirty years, of a demonstration fusion power plant through which the commercial viability of fusion energy could be established. In the context of the overall European effort, including the EU and the Member States, for energy research and development, the financial support needed to pursue Europe’s integrated fusion programme would not be made at the expense of the overall R&amp;D programmes devoted to other energy sources.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0153"></a>

<p>The autonomous region of Madrid, currently one of the regions in the vanguard of economic growth and job creation in both Spain and Europe, has for the last ten years been making a major and ambitious commitment to public transport, and, in particular to the metro system. Madrid has a metro network of 405 km with 450 stations, which by 2007 will have become a major world landmark in the field.</p>
<p>1999 saw the creation of Mintra, a company combining executive, holding and management functions with responsibility for the new regional rail infrastructures. In February 2003, Mintra was provisionally classified as a non-financial company.</p>
<p>Eurostat has now decided to classify Mintra in its public administration category, a decision which will have obvious consequences for the funding of the extension of the Madrid metro.</p>
<p>Can the Commission explain the grounds for this reclassification of Mintra, given that since 2003, when the company was provisionally classified as a non-financial company, there has been no change in either the criteria established by Eurostat or the circumstances and characteristics of Mintra itself?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) It is important to clarify: the previous consideration of Eurostat that MINTRA could be considered outside government, had a preliminary character based on the information provided to Eurostat at that time. The present decision is based on the recent and additional information received at Eurostat’s request to INE (Instituto Nacional de Estadística), such as the analysis of the balance sheet and profit and loss accounts of MINTRA.</p>
<p>The reasons for classifying MINTRA inside general government were the following: most of the revenues received by MINTRA are obtained due to the lease agreement contract concluded with METRO, and the biggest share of revenues are fixed in advance and do not correspond to objective parameters regarding the usage of infrastructure by METRO. In addition, the price of the services provided by MINTRA to METRO can be revised in order to restore the ‘economic balance’ between the two parties. Moreover, analysing the figures of 2003 it was possible to relate the amounts paid to MINTRA by METRO with the subsidies that METRO receives from the Madrid Public Transportation Regional Consortium.</p>
<p>From the accounts available for 2003, one can conclude that the price of the services provided by MINTRA to METRO are not economically significant, which is a requirement in national accounts for classifying a unit outside general government.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0158"></a>

<p>(FR) As the Commission has already noted on several occasions, particularly in its answers to Written Question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2003-3124_EN.html">E-3124/03</a> by Mrs Muscardini (UEN) and Written Question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2004-2111_EN.html">E-2111/04</a> by Mrs Reynaud, according to Council Regulation No 1/58 all the official languages are also working languages (Article 1), and everybody is therefore fully entitled to use them interchangeably in the institutions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in order to ensure that the decision-making process is efficient, the Commission’s Rules of Procedure set out the arrangements for language use within the Commission itself. It is up to the President to decide which working languages best meet the minimum needs of the Members of the Commission and may be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Texts must be available in all the EU’s official languages in order to be sent officially to other Community institutions and/or be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
<p>The Commission employs people from the various Member States of the European Union. In keeping with the spirit of the Treaty, the Commission advocates and practices multilingualism. Internal arrangements within the services in terms of drafting documents and holding meetings are therefore left to the discretion of senior officials. For operational reasons, it is obvious that certain languages are more widely used than others by Commission staff in the day-to-day running of departments. Nevertheless, the principle that languages are equal as official and working languages is respected.</p>
<p>Apart from the above-mentioned procedures, the Commission does not have any intention of introducing specific arrangements to give preference to the use of one or more particular languages internally.</p>
<p>With regard to the press conferences referred to by the honourable Member, the Commission would note that changes have been made to the languages used in the press room following enlargement and thanks to the technical possibilities of the press room in the Berlaymont building. Although constraints exist in terms of staff and money, our aim is to avoid discrimination of any kind. The Commission services are currently looking into the various options that are open to us, with a view to achieving a balanced use of languages that is compatible with the resources available during press conferences.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0161"></a>

<p>(FR) As the Commission stated in its answer to Written Question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2004-0660_EN.html">E-0660/2004</a> of 28 April 2004:</p>
<p>‘The Financial Regulation (FR) and its Implementing Rules do not provide for special rules for non-governmental organisations (NGOs), therefore they are not treated distinctly from other natural or legal persons. Thus, they have to comply with the general exclusion and selection criteria applicable to all beneficiaries. However, Part Two, Title IV of the FR contains special rules for external actions.</p>
<p>NGOs are collaborating with the Commission in the implementation of a great number of actions both within and outside the EU. As they are normally not treated distinctly from other organisations, bodies or firms, the Commission’s records do not determine the level of NGO funding. In many cases, NGOs are implementing partners and not the end beneficiaries of Community actions.’</p>
<p>It is therefore impossible for the Commission to state whether the figure cited in the magazine article referred to by the honourable Member as the total sum allocated to NGOs under the Community budget is correct.</p>
<p>In the above-mentioned answer, the Commission also noted that specific eligibility criteria may be laid down in action programmes and in calls for proposals for various measures.</p>
<p>As far as the good financial management of these Community payments is concerned, the Commission would stress that, on the basis of the Financial Regulation<a href="#defann_23_1" name="refann_23_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>,<span class="sup"> </span>NGOs are subject to the same obligations in respect of the presentation of accounts, audits and financial transparency as any other recipient of Community aid.</p>
<p>It would also note that details of the financial regulation framework and the level of transparency required before money is granted to NGOs are given in the responses to recommendations 64 and 65 in the annex to the Commission’s report to the European Parliament and to the Council<a href="#defann_23_2" name="refann_23_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the follow-up to 2002 discharge.</p>
