The European Parliament is doing itself proud by resolutely defending the rights of minorities. We call upon the Serb Government to take immediate steps to halt anti-Hungarian acts of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The day before yesterday, when the President of the Hungarian Republic held discussions with President Tadic in a good atmosphere, 15 kilometres from the borders of the European Union, in Szabadka-Subotica, the word ‘death’ was painted on the front door of the house of the man who first dared to complain publicly about the physical injuries he had sustained. Today’s resolution of the European Parliament is an important reinforcement of the fact that the rule of law and observing the rights of the minorities are preconditions of a partnership between the European Union and Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a fundamental political question. Serbia and Montenegro is an important strategic partner of the Union. The stability of the Federation and the maintenance of security are in the interests of the whole of Europe. Today’s resolution is not meant to punish but to encourage the Serbian democratic forces to uncompromisingly confront nationalism and xenophobia. This is also in the interests of the Serb majority, the national minorities and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, and positive initial signals have reached us from Belgrade, mostly for President Tadic and Prime Minister Kostunica, to confront the gravity of the situation and investigate the anti-Hungarian actions. I am pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has accepted my budgetary amendment proposal to increase the Union’s support by EUR 5 million for the process of democratisation in Serbia. Today’s European Parliament’s resolution will encourage the Vojvodina minorities, amongst whom live 300 000 Hungarians, and they will not feel abandoned by Europe.</p>

Unfortunately in Vojvodina, where citizens were subjected to bombing in what fell short of an ethnic war, non-Serbs are once again being tormented by those around them. Today, we will once again express our horror at the situation and call for peace and reconciliation. However, we will not solve this problem merely by committing our condemnations and moral indignation to paper. If that is the only thing we do, then I fear that we will have to repeat pertinent resolutions of this kind again and again, because they are not being heard by the people who matter. Violence and intimidation by ordinary citizens are evident wherever there is a predominant feeling that many of their own people are shut out by state borders, while many others who used to be considered to be the occupiers, are left behind in the people’s own country. In Serbian public opinion, the prevalent view is that, in terms of government, the Serbian inhabitants of the north and east of Bosnia and of the north of Kosovo are wrongfully cut off from the home country, and that for that reason, the areas that are recognised as Serbian territory should be made completely Serbian. Anyone who opposes this view is considered an enemy and is tarred with the same brush as the former Turkish and German occupiers. Political parties identifying with this feeling, shared by many members of the public, can count on a lot of votes, because they have the nerve to do what the public want. On the map of 1856, which is displayed on the second floor of this building, anyone can see how ethnically divided Vojvodina was between Hungarians, Croats, Germans, Slovaks, Romanians and Serbs at the time. Since the 1918 division, when it became part of Serbia, it has continually become more Serbian and other groups have moved away or have been driven out. Since 1989, the autonomy for the large Hungarian-speaking minority has also been driven back considerably. The recent riots are part and parcel of this long-term development. Without clear and broadly based agreements on linguistic rights, autonomy and administrative borders, it is difficult to avoid future outbursts of ethnic hatred in and around Serbia. We should therefore do more than merely adopt this resolution, although it is a step in the right direction.</p>

The proposal draws attention to a series of violent acts committed, in the first place, against members of a Hungarian minority population and minority groups in Vojdovina. Thus, we are sending signals to the Serb authorities that they should take seriously these oft-neglected breaches of rights, which are considered local, in order to prevent graver ethnic conflicts that would necessitate serious efforts of intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">The frequency and increasing severity of violent acts show that the perpetrators and agitators will perceive the absence of legal consequences and the silent tolerance as tacit encouragement. I would like to emphasise that it is not our intention to stigmatise Serbia, even less so as the country has European-standard minority legislation. Despite all this, these events have been occurring up until today. Because of this, the central and local authorities carry enormous responsibility for putting the principles into effective practice. Naturally, one must appreciate that the Serbs have finally promised in the last two days that they will do everything to stop these incidents. No doubt this is being done as a result of the strong international response.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time if the European Union does not call them to account, their promises will only remain promises. Yesterday for instance there was a new threat, this time a death threat, that drove a young man and his family, who had already previously experienced such incidents, to say that they wished to leave Serbia and seek political asylum. It is in our mutual interests to reinstate the tradition of living harmoniously side-by-side in Vojvodina. On a simple level this means that youngsters should not be afraid of speaking another language in the street and that if someone goes out at night to have a good time, he should not be slapped in the face because he speaks Hungarian and immediately think of emigrating. This is why I ask all my representative colleagues to support the motion. Thank you.</p>

One of the many worrying signs is that assaults against minorities have become commonplace. What is even more worrying is the indifference and inaction of the Serb authorities. Serbia’s leaders must know that what is at stake is the European future of the country. Serbia can achieve closer connections to Europe only if fundamental human rights can be assured and if it can guarantee the rights of minorities as well as their personal safety. We do not want words from the Serb leadership but action. It is not enough to make reassuring statements on the issue. The perpetrators must be apprehended and brought before the courts. We can rest assured only when we will see the consequences of these issues. If we are not to see any positive change we must keep the issues high on the agenda.</p>

Is there anything more shocking or terrifying than this? Such was the death threat, in Serbian, that Béla Csorba, Vice-President of the Hungarian Democratic Party of Vojvodina, received on 9 April of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">This offence against a Member of the Hungarian minority in the Serbian province is by no means an isolated incident. Not for nothing does this draft resolution list the specific expressions of physical and mental violence, to which particularly Serbian citizens of Hungarian origin have been exposed for some time. Of how many incidents of hostility is the outside world unaware? After all, typical of the climate of fear and intimidation in Vojvodina is the desire of various victims of ethnic violence to remain anonymous.</p>
<p class="contents">Extensive documentation, currently available, about the present position of the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina is conjuring up a simply alarming image. If a teenager speaks Hungarian on the streets or in a public place, then they run the risk of being beaten up by a gang of their Serbian contemporaries. There is every chance that the police will look the other way or dismiss the incident soon enough as ‘not ethnically motivated’.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally shocking are the texts of anti-Hungarian graffiti. At the crack of dawn on 15 July 2004, a wall in the city of Novi Sad was covered in big letters which read: ‘OK, OK Hungarians, a deep mass grave awaits you’. Shortly before that, in early May, many buildings in this capital of Vojvodina were covered with graffiti asserting that ‘Serbia belongs to the Serbs; Hungarians: get lost!’</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background of an unmistakable radicalisation of the political climate in Vojvodina, I would underline Paragraph 5 of the draft resolution. This paragraph asks for an in-depth inquiry to be mounted on the ground by the EP delegation for south-eastern Europe. I would already like to give this fact-finding mission a number of urgent questions to take with them, questions that I would also like to address to the Council and Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the situation with regard to language teaching and other cultural provision for the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina, including newspapers, magazines and other media? How much money does the Serbian Government set aside in total for public provision for this specific ethnic group? In short, what exactly are the minority rights of the Hungarians in Vojvodina?</p>
<p class="contents">Encouraging was this week’s pledge by the Council, through its Dutch Presidency, that it intends to examine the position of the minorities in Vojvodina. This House and the Commission will have no choice but to follow suit. What is decisive, however, is the attitude of the competent Serbian authorities. In the first and last instance, we would urge them to commit to human tolerance in Vojvodina.</p>

For centuries, it has been home to a good dozen peoples, who have lived together, sometimes relatively peacefully, sometimes very much so. It was not only Poles, Ruthenes, Germans, Hungarians, and Czechs, but also Croats and Slovenes, who established themselves there a long time ago and have co-existed well with each other. I might add that it was the Serbs of Vojvodina who contributed much to the tolerance in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is something quite different: it is that Milosevic deprived Vojvodina of its autonomy by force in order to secure himself a majority in Yugoslavia’s collective state presidency, and that wave after wave of people uprooted and expelled from other parts of Serbia were settled there, thus upsetting the complex ethnic balance, and have to date been socially and politically marginalised, unable to put down real roots. It is for that reason that a clear distinction must be drawn between cause and effect.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not solve the problem without building up democracy and the rule of law, autonomy and co-existence in Vojvodina. We must support the Hungarians, but also all the other minorities too. We also have to tell the old-established Serbs in Vojvodina that we know of the good they have done for this multinational region, that this policy of ours is not anti-Serb, but that it is our concern, in the world of many and varied cultures that is Vojvodina, to re-establish the sort of co-existence that prevailed for centuries. That can be done only if we stand firm against the extremist elements and also tell the government in Belgrade that it is by the way they handle this that we will judge their readiness for Europe.</p>

Traditionally, Vojvodina has been a region in which many cultures and languages have existed together, and its youngsters have learned each other's culture and language. I am very happy to hear that our Dutch and German colleagues from different political groups understand this, which means that this is also well known to Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue, as has already been mentioned, is not only a Hungarian one. During Tito's decades in power, many nationalities lived together in the autonomous region of Vojvodina: Croatians, Czechs, Slovaks, Romanians, Poles, Germans, Jews and other minorities lived together with Hungarians and Serbs. Now this peaceful coexistence is endangered by some extreme nationalists: Serbian politicians, policemen and other wrongdoers. The Hungarian youth of Vojvodina has a very rich, special and progressive culture, which is different from the culture in the Hungarian motherland. These young people were born into the spirit of a multiethnic culture and they understand both the Hungarian and Serbian cultures and traditions. The young should be the future of the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina. If they leave their homeland, not only the Hungarian community but also Serbia in its entirety will lose a valuable part of its culture and its democratic future. Young Hungarians in Serbia want to be good Hungarians, good citizens of a democratic Serbia, but, above all, good Europeans. They want to remain in the land where they were born. Let us help them to stay in their homeland.</p>
<p class="contents">The western community reacted too late in many cases to the use of ethnic harassment in the Balkans. We have all seen the tragic consequences. This time we have to answer without delay and send an encouraging message to the Hungarians, emphasising that they can stay in their homeland in a would-be democratic Vojvodina, in a would-be democratic Serbia of the future.</p>

Our emphatic intervention is also required because, in the last year and a half, neither the Serb Government nor the local authorities have done anything to restore law and order and failed to protect fundamental human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not know of a single incident where a person in breach of the law has been called to account. I find it particularly serious that the local police force is not only turning a cynical blind eye to the beatings of Hungarians, but also actively takes part in these atrocities. As a mayor, I would like to express my particular solidarity with the Mayor of Padej, Laszlo Komárom who was twice slapped in the face by a police superintendent. In a situation like this it is our duty to condemn the apathy and complicity of the Serb authorities. At the same time we must warn the government of Serbia and Montenegro that by tolerating, and even encouraging the atrocities, they will make it impossible for the country to draw near to the European Union.</p>

Of course the question is to what extent this resolution, which I have studied carefully, is conducive to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that by adopting such a resolution we would merely signal that we support one side only, and that we are not concerned with Yugoslavia or Serbia remaining a unified state, but only with a biased viewpoint. According to the latest reports, the matters to which my Hungarian colleagues have referred also affect a number of other nationalities. This is not merely a one-sided attack on the Hungarian minority, it is an attempt to disrupt the peaceful coexistence of the nations which live together in this country. We should be aware of the kind of signal we would send out by means of such a resolution, and to whom we would send it.</p>

Members of the Hungarian minority are pestered on a daily basis, tombstones are damaged and violated, vandalism and anti-Semitic propaganda have become everyday fare. Everything seems to suggest that within this province with its different minorities, the Serbs are once again turning more insolent and more radical. Since the autumn of last year, we have been inundated with alarming reports about ever worsening violent incidents. A recent report by the Hungarian Human Rights Foundation gives a 19-page long, humiliating chronology of the ethnic violence in the province of Vojvodina. With this renewed violence, everything seems to suggest that the Serbs want to displace the frustrations that the loss of the province of Kosovo has caused them. Fellow Members, I do not only want to point the finger at the Serbs here. The sad experiences from the recent past should have taught us that conflicts in so-called multi-cultural or multi-ethnic societies are rooted in recent history, and that we should therefore look for a balanced political solution, whereby consideration is given to the complaints of all those involved, as well as to the conflict’s historical background. We should therefore firmly condemn all violence, but we should be careful not to lay the blame on one party alone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The brutality of the organised atrocities and ethnic cleansing by the central authorities in the other parts of the former Yugoslavia, for instance Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, serves as a warning.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last decade Vojdovina has become the strife-ridden hinterland of Serbia and the former Hungarian national community of half a million has decreased to half its population today. Why? Because its members have been chased away by political and economic forces, its youth has been recruited forcibly into the Serb-Bosnian-Croatian-Kosovo conflict and their homes occupied by several hundred thousand Serbs. More and more politicians and experts who know the area are convinced that the stirring up of inter-ethnic tension, the beatings of Hungarians, the harassment and the robberies, the public burning of the Hungarian flag, and the desecration of graves in cemeteries are largely perpetrated by the Serbian and Montenegrin Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The Serb central authorities’ attitude to this serious situation fundamentally contradicts general human rights and clashes with the standards of the European minority protection. The European Union bears a great responsibility for solving the situation. The solution to the Vojvodina question must be based on long-term acceptance and tolerance.</p>

For this, they must establish a lasting and solid democratic value system the basic principles of which constitute a vital element of the Copenhagen criteria.
