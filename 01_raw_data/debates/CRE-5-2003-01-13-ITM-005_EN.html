<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Napolitano (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, it is on the initiative of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the European Parliament is, for the first time, addressing the issue of the role of regional and local authorities in European integration with a specific report and a motion for a resolution. The reasons for this initiative and its goals are not difficult to understand. Indeed, particularly over the last decade, a widespread trend towards decentralisation, regionalisation and increasing autonomy of local authorities has become apparent in the Member States of the Union, and it is right to recognise the importance of this trend when reflecting on and discussing the state of the European Union and its future. The regional and local authorities have taken on a more important role in transposing Community legislation within the individual States and in running Community programmes. They should therefore feel involved in the preparatory work on the Union’s policies and acts too.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the motion for a resolution which is now to be put to the vote in the plenary session of this House contains important proposals: the inclusion in the new constitutional framework of the principles of respect for regional and local identity and, therefore, of the application of subsidiarity, not just in relations between the Union and the Member States but where regional and local authorities are concerned too; committing the Commission, not least on the basis of its White Paper on Governance, to involving the representatives of regional and local authorities in the preparatory work on its proposals; calling upon the Member States to promote and enhance – each in accordance with its own constitutional system – the participation of regional and local authorities in the Union’s decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">With the resolution we have drawn up, which, if adopted by broad consensus, will be an important point of reference for the subsequent debate at the Brussels Convention in early February, the cause of recognising the role of the regional and local authorities in European integration will receive a considerable boost. I hope that due consideration will be given to certain concerns expressed in committee by myself and other colleagues and that a number of amendments correcting and clarifying the text adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will be adopted, so that misapplication and unilateral measures which would harm our cause are avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to stress the criteria I adopted as rapporteur. Firstly, we need to consider all the autonomous territorial entities which operate within the Member States as a single unit. As we are all aware, they vary greatly in size and nature but they all, from the largest to the smallest, whatever their role or powers, represent certain shared values – the value of proximity, of the closest possible adherence to the views, opinions and needs of the citizens, the value of the most immediate and widespread democratic participation possible – and the European Constitution must recognise that they all have a key role to play in the achievement of the goal set for the Convention on the Future of Europe: the goal of bringing Europe considerably closer to the citizens, of making the Union more democratic as well as more effective. I have therefore not proposed in my draft report to subdivide regions or local authorities into different categories. Giving a specific category of autonomous territorial entity special status or exclusive rights within the Union would lead to difficult, counterproductive disputes, even as regards defining and establishing the boundaries of a particular category – the category of regions with legislative powers, for instance – and would conceal the value of recognising all the regional and local authorities together as one whole, as one overall entity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to ensure that we do not create a more cumbersome institutional system and procedures which we all agree actually need to be simplified, and in this ‘institutional system’ I include the Court of Justice and its procedures too. As a general rule, we need to take care not to reduce the effectiveness of a decision-making process which is already subject to a large number of constraints<span class="bold"> </span>by applying a set of checks and balances of varying degrees of rigidity.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I trust that the Members will reflect on the points I have made and that there will be broad consensus in tomorrow’s votes.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the united Europe, which was embarked on in Copenhagen will be an extremely diverse Europe, first of all in terms of economic and social diversity. Never before has there been such great economic disparity within the European Union and, at the same time, furthermore, never before has a genuine cohesion policy been so crucial. There will be cultural and political diversity, but also territorial diversity. In fact, I used this exact expression – territorial diversity – as one of the three themes of the Second Report on economic and social cohesion entitled ‘Unity, solidarity, diversity for Europe, its people and its territory’, just over one year ago.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this diversity that explains why the task given to your rapporteur, Mr Napolitano, on this matter, was extremely difficult as regards defining the role of regional and local authorities in the European Union. As he said, we shall hold a sitting specifically devoted to this subject within the Convention on 6 and 7 February.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Napolitano, you have completed this task with your usual talent and wisdom and, ladies and gentlemen, it will not surprise you to learn that I agree with the rapporteur on many of the points in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Napolitano was wise enough to point out that if the European Union wishes to function without becoming a super-State, it must respect the right of each State to organise itself as it sees fit. It is not, therefore, the role of the European institutions or the Commission to propose, or even less, to decide, in Brussels, how competences are to be divided within each country, or how relations between territories should be organised within each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore with this restriction in mind that the Commission is able to approve the main points of the report presented. We are in favour of a more prominent role for the Committee of the Regions provided that the interinstitutional balance remains as it is today. The Committee’s right to recourse to the Court of Justice deserves consideration, if necessary, in order to defend respect for the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of what your report calls ‘new participatory methods’ so that regional and local authorities might be more directly involved in Community procedures. In its White Paper on governance, the Commission advocated systematic dialogue with the associations representing these authorities, and we are currently finalising arrangements for this dialogue which, following extensive consultation, will be operational at the end of the first half of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of adapting the implementation of EU legislation to take account of individual local circumstances and needs. The Commission will thus try out a pilot scheme of tripartite contracts, involving Brussels, the national capital and the region. Above and beyond this, generally speaking, the Treaty already provides us with plenty of room for manoeuvre through framework legislation. The three institutions responsible for legislative activity share responsibility for preventing these framework laws from entering into too much detail.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, take care to preserve the uniform, and therefore equal or fair, application of European law. We must not weaken the rules we adopt here, through democratic debate, by allowing the territorial authorities variable-geometry application, even on an exceptional basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I have talked about what happens initially, when drawing up Community texts, and what happens downstream, when they are implemented. In its contribution to the work of the Convention before the end of last year, the Commission prepared the ground in this area while expressing its desire to find the means to increase the involvement of the regional authorities throughout the process of European integration, while respecting the institutional system of each country.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly – and this is my fourth point of agreement with your report, Mr Napolitano - we are in favour of a strong European and territorial cohesion policy, which means something real for each region of the Union and the citizens of the Union. In this area, which I am familiar with because it is my responsibility within the Commission, both the Commission and Parliament will have a great deal of work to accomplish together in the months ahead, before I present, at the end of this year, the Commission proposals for future regional policy after 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is precisely because, as I have just said, we agree on the broad lines of this report that I would like to express the Commission’s concern on a point that I know has also been the subject of debates and questions here in Parliament. It concerns the opportunity for certain regions alone, those with legislative powers, to defend their rights before the Court of Justice. Furthermore, I spoke very frankly to these regions with legislative powers a few weeks ago in Florence, at one of their meetings. I believe it is neither realistic nor desirable to establish this kind of distinction between European territorial authorities. For example, how can we confer important, individual rights on these regions, while not all the current and future Member States are organised in this way? Our institutional system must not favour one system over another. It must, I repeat, be neutral, fair and impartial.</p>
<p class="contents">Regions with legislative powers, however, which have their own responsibilities, are facing difficulties that we do not want to ignore. Why, therefore, to respond to one of their requests – and this is an option I raised with their president – do we not take inspiration from the positive experience of Article 203 of the Treaty, as intelligent use of this article enabled us to facilitate the participation of these regions in the Council itself? Why should access to Community justice not follow this example, or at least its spirit? That is why I find it interesting that some of you – in particular Mr Corbett, and also Mr Méndez de Vigo, I am told – have made progress in finding a way out of this dead end. This would consist of giving each State clear responsibility for taking cases to the Court of Justice on behalf of these territorial authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are not trying to pit the regions against the States or against Europe, or even less so the States against Europe. We are trying to choose a culture of cooperation rather than maintaining a culture of confrontation. The regions must be able to count on the Member States to obtain genuine political and legal representation within the Union. The regions must be able to count on the European Union to involve them systematically in all stages of the European decision-making process. The European Union, for its part, must be able to continue to count on the constructive, loyal cooperation of all the territorial authorities: the regions, of course, but also towns, cities and subregional territorial structures. It must be able to count on their contributions to the debate on European democracy.</p>

Recent years have seen an increased awareness of what the Member States' various regional and local authorities do, and of their autonomous nature. These authorities have an important part to play in bringing the European Union closer to its citizens, and it is the regional authorities in particular that make a decisive contribution to the success of cross-border cooperation and of the ever closer union of the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As it is in the regions that the EU's grass-roots democracy does its work, it is obvious that the regions have to be involved in European policies. In its opinion on the Napolitano report, ‘The role of regional and local authorities in European integration’, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities devoted special attention to gender mainstreaming. Democracy works only when everyone is involved, and that means women and men equally.</p>
<p class="contents">We point out the democratic deficit arising from the under-representation of women in decision-making bodies and administrations in all areas of political, economic, social and – not least – professional life. The European Union's regions are significantly handicapped in their cohesion and in their development as democracies by the continuing under-representation of women in decision-making processes. Regional and local bodies play an important part in the labour market, among other areas, in that their superior grasp of local needs and obstacles gives them better proximity to jobseekers, and it is through them that the best ways of removing these obstacles may be found.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital to work towards the development of new social policies, and this includes, in particular, assessing support for equal treatment and its implementation. According to a Chinese proverb, women carry half of heaven on their shoulders; we are striving to open up the whole horizon as a means of shaping a Europe belonging to the regions' citizens. We are well aware, Commissioner, of this Parliament's inability to act in this area, but constant dripping wears the rock away, and the highlighting of deficits is for us both a task and an obligation.</p>

This report must therefore form the basis of that debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Chairman, Mr Napolitano, on the good sense, which is the least common of the senses, of his proposal. Mr President, in this case you have done justice to your talent and reputation.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution is clearly regionalist, because what we are asking the Convention is that it recognise the objective of territorial cohesion in Article 2; because we are asking for recognition of regional and local autonomy in Article 6; because we are asking for inclusion of linguistic diversity in Europe and the protection of minority languages in Article 151; because we are asking for recognition of cross-border cooperation in Article 158; because we are asking that the Committee of the Regions, within the context of subsidiarity, should be able to bring cases before the Court of Justice – in this regard we cooperate with the working group on subsidiarity which it is my honour to chair in the Convention; finally, because in paragraph 2 of Article 299 we ask for the situation of the outermost regions to be consolidated.</p>
<p class="contents">You may ask me, why has the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats voted by a majority against in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, if it is so positive? Well, I will tell you; because there are two issues which concern us and we believe that they have not been properly resolved in committee:</p>
<p class="contents">The first issue is Recital 2, into which an amendment was introduced empowering regional and local authorities to adapt the way in which they apply the legislation of the European Union, in order to take account, it says, of exceptional local circumstances and needs. I know that it then adds a paragraph saying 'while respecting the integrity of EU law', but I believe that, as it stands, this paragraph is detrimental to the common internal market and that led the Group of the European People’s Party, which has always defended the four freedoms of the internal market, to vote against.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore presented an amendment, No 21 – I believe we have reached an agreement with the Socialists – to bring together our Amendment No 21 with the Socialist No 5 in a compromise amendment, which I believe takes us in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, another issue which concerns us, Mr President, is the current wording of Article 8, which, along the same lines mentioned by Commissioner Barnier, grants all regional and local corporations with legislative powers the right to bring cases before the Court of Justice of the European Communities. We believe this is over the top, we believe this is not the way to build Europe, and we have therefore presented an amendment, No 24, which allows the regions, under the authority of the State, to defend its prerogatives before the Court in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We would ask the Members to examine these amendments, and if we reach an agreement on them, the Group of the European People’s Party, in accordance with the reasoning we have given, will be able to vote in favour of this extremely important report on which it is my honour to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Napolitano. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbett (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I too would like to congratulate our rapporteur, the chairman of the committee, for having dealt with such a complex issue and brought us together around a compromise position which, on all but one or two little details which still need to be settled, can command the overwhelming majority of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Our European Union is not just a union of states, it is a union of citizens. The Treaties have always conferred certain rights directly on citizens and therefore on the way that citizens are governed within Member States. Subnational authorities therefore already have an important role to play, both in the application of European legislation – for instance much of our environmental legislation imposes requirements on local authorities to deal with packaging and waste – and even, in some cases, in the transposition of directives into domestic legislation, as is the situation in Belgium, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right that we should look at how our regions are involved in the running of this Union. What rights should we give to our regions? What responsibilities should we give them in the Treaties? The principle of subsidiarity does not stop with national governments, but nonetheless, by virtue of that principle of subsidiarity, it is not up to the Union itself to tell the Member States how to organise themselves internally. Nonetheless the Union must recognise the fact that many of our Member States are organised internally in a way that gives substantial responsibilities to regions and other subnational authorities. It is therefore right that we should look, as this report does, at how we should adapt to that reality, that we should recognise it in the Treaty, that we should provide for better consultation and information of the regions, that we should make fuller use of Article 203 of the Treaty where appropriate, and that we should give proper consideration to the views of the Committee of the Regions. On all these issues there is consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">But one issue leaves us divided: should regions be able to appeal to the Court of Justice against acts which they dislike, notably because they feel they violate their own responsibilities or the principle of subsidiarity? On the one hand there is an argument to say that they too should be able to defend their prerogatives. On the other hand there is an argument that we would be overloading our Court, which is already facing the challenge of enlargement, with a whole raft of cases which may be brought sometimes for dubious political, rather than real legal, reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is offering a compromise on this question. Regions should be able to bring a case either via their national governments or via the Committee of the Regions. The committee would therefore be a sort of filter. It would check what level of support there would be for a court case. A case would not necessarily be brought if only one region were interested, but if several regions felt there was a real violation of their rights, then the Committee of the Regions would proceed and bring a case.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a reasonable compromise: to allow regions the right to go to court, not individually, but to raise the matter and check, either via their national government or via the Committee of the Regions, whether there is a wider feeling that subsidiarity has been violated; if so, then a court case could be brought.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend our amendment on this point to the House. I hope that other groups, even those for whom it is not their preferred amendment, will nonetheless rally behind this as an acceptable compromise and a workable one, which our Union would be wise to take on in its new Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many of us would want the Union to enjoy more direct interaction with regional and local authorities, because they are frequently more sensible intermediaries between the citizen and the Union than the more remote and centralised national governments. We appreciate that such a direct relationship postulates the federal nature of the integration process in a fairly dramatic form. It is appropriate that the treaty provisions on subsidiarity should be reformulated to reflect this.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberals believe decentralisation is essential if the Union is to manage its common policies more effectively. More of a relationship with provincial politics will improve the quality of our supranational democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This report provides many of the answers, but the issue of the approach to the Court of Justice is still controversial. The Liberal Group wishes to improve access across the board for the citizen, to improve citizens' approach to their constitutional court. This implies clear lines of approach for all democratic representative bodies, especially regional authorities with parliamentary powers of law-making independent of their Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have asked to take the floor because, last year, I was rapporteur for a report dealing with the local dimension of the European Employment Strategy. In the report, I wrote sincerely in favour of a number of the aspects commended by Mr Napolitano in his report and, in particular, the importance of a bottom-up-perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, however, share Mr Napolitano’s perspective which, at heart, appears to be in some way trying to reduce or even do away with the importance of the national political democracies. He emphasises very strongly the local and regional levels, on the one hand, and the Commission and EU levels, on the other, an approach I believe to be very dangerous. I believe, in spite of everything, that the national democracies themselves form the democratic basis for the European project. I therefore believe that this local and regional development should take place within the framework of these national democracies. The nations, and above all their governments and parliaments, must be the link between the local, regional and European levels. To circumvent the national level would be completely reprehensible. It could not lead to anything other than a weakening of European democracy, and that is something which none of us could wish to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course my group prefers the report in what we regard as the strengthened form in which it emerged from the committee, but which on some points Mr Napolitano thinks was pushed too far. No doubt that will be where the votes will be concentrated on Wednesday. However, it is a matter of common consensus that democracy in the European Union is necessarily democracy at many levels. The principle of subsidiarity is an iterative principle which works down the line and which should, as far as possible, enable people with local knowledge to apply that local knowledge, with common sense, to local circumstances, taking account of the purposes of the European legislation in question.</p>
<p class="contents">It is often said that a characteristic of the European method of legal interpretation is its purposive quality, and I feel that to some extent the local enforcers of European law should act with regard to the purpose not only to the letter of the law. That is not to say that I wish to see a different law operating in different parts of Europe, but it is difficult to have the same law operating identically where there are very different circumstances. For example, very arid countries will necessarily apply the same water law in a somewhat different way than very wet countries because the circumstances that lead to the application of the law vary and these need to be taken into account. That surely is important.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important matter is that the transposition of the directive should take account of the local circumstances; it is yet more important that the protocol on subsidiarity should encourage local and regional authorities to exercise a constructive discretion in enabling the directive to make the most possible sense at local level.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other points that have been raised which we think are vital as well. The regional authorities should on occasion be able to take matters to the Court of Justice. Just at the moment, in Scotland, the government, the Scottish Executive, the opposition parties, are all of the view for example that a recent compromise reached at the Fisheries Council violates the principle of proportionality. Why should it be left to the fishing people to test that? Why cannot the regional authority responsible for enforcing the law test it itself? Many other such examples sprint to mind. There should also be opportunities to take things into account during the legislative process and before it.</p>
<p class="contents">The EFA parties which I represent here do not just represent regions. Of course the countries we represent are regions in the technical constitutional sense. However it should not be forgotten – and Mr Lamassoure in his famous remarks about partner regions was not forgetting it – they are also among the ancient nations of Europe which deserve to be taken seriously. If it comes out of this Parliament, or out of the Convention, that there is nothing for a region between being a Member State and being nothing, then you know what answer you will get. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Often we forget the role and relevance of local and regional government. It is the closest level of governance to the people of the regions. It implements many of the policies and legislative processes agreed by the European Union. A prime example of this, in the Irish context, is environmental legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore enhance the role of regional and local government in responding to and developing European policy. It is my belief that the European Charter for Local Self-Government has many merits. It commits the parties to applying basic rules guaranteeing the political, administrative and financial independence of local authorities. Consequently, the Charter considers that public responsibilities should be exercised by the authorities closest to the citizens. In many cases these are the local and regional authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As a person who has always encouraged the promotion and safeguarding of lesser-used regional languages, I am pleased that this has been included in the report as a proposed amendment to Article 151 of the Treaty. It is by embracing our cultural and linguistic diversity that we enhance the understanding of Europe, its diverse peoples and its many different regions. Linguistic and cultural diversity is not about defining or redefining boundaries; it underpins the cultural strength of our enlarging European Union. It is my belief that the work of the European Committee of the Regions is important. It has become more focused in its opinions and it has to be further recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">A region is not about its boundaries, it is about its cultures and its languages, and, even more so, it is about its people. The citizens of Europe are always reaffirming their demands for a Europe that is much closer to them and this should not exclude the level of governance closest to the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not Cornwall, across the river Tamar, which is foreign parts, nor Zummerzet where all they toffs live. That's too close to Lunnon for my liking. As for Lunnon, well that used to be three days on the fast stage coach, and there are many of us folks who never did get used to they newfangled things like horseless carriages and they motorway things that bring all those foreigners to our neck of the woods. So when I tell them that they bureaucrats over the water have made us citizens of Europe, most of my mates say 'thank 'e very much guvnor, but we'm Devon folk and we'm British, we don't need that Europe over here, thank 'e kindly'.</p>
<p class="contents">'But,' I says to them, 'they want to bring that Europe much closer to our citizens, so that's all right, isn't it?'</p>
<p class="contents">My mate says 'what be'm going to do about it then, dig it up and put it in trucks and pile it up on Dartymoor so we can go and have a looky at 'n?'</p>
<p class="contents">'No,' I says, 'they'm going to make us into regions, they'm going to take away our counties and they'm going to make us all one big happy family, along with they foreigners to Cornwall and they toffs to Somerset. They'm even going to throw in they folks up to Gloucestershire and other foreign parts. We'm are all going to be part of the south west region. That is going to bring Europe much closer to our citizens, so we will be all right then, won't us?'</p>
<p class="contents">When my mates looked a bit mazed, I said ''tis obvious really, by making us big happy families in regions, with fifteen times more votes than those Luxembourgers, we will really feel part of the European culture. This chap Giorgio Napolitano says we can then be an autonomous territorial entity. Then the likes of me can be on the Committee of the Regions which has recently affirmed its exclusive legitimacy as an institutional discussion partner. With one of they regions, we will be off like a long dog, and then our citizens can all take a fuller part in the integration of Europe'.</p>
<p class="contents">‘What's a Luxembourger?’ says my mate.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the reality of bringing Europe closer to the people. The only people who want it are the political elites, but the price in the United Kingdom is losing our long-established county structure and with it the rich local dialects that abound. It is a price not worth paying. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the principle stated in the report itself, which the Community has obeyed since its beginnings, the European institutions are based on a Union of States; they respect the internal structure of the States; their only interlocutors are the States and, where regions are involved in certain European policies, it is because the States, and behind them their national democracy, wanted this and because they are in charge, and must remain in charge, of the process. In any case, it is not the place of the Community to decide – or even suggest – that regional and local authorities should play a greater part or participate otherwise in a given European decision-making process, as indicated in the Napolitano report.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite the opposite. As I explained in a minority opinion annexed to the report, the increased number of Member States following enlargement makes the role played by the Member States as coordinators and intermediaries more crucial than ever. It is difficult to imagine the European Union maintaining direct relations with 250 regions or more, or listening to all their opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">That would be impossible to manage. In any case, national identity and the peoples’ right to organise themselves as they see fit must be respected completely. The European Union has no supreme power to intervene in these matters. If, however, it did manage to worm its way in, it would open up a Pandora’s box which would eventually lead to dislocated nations and a Europe that would be impossible to govern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The many amendments tabled here and in committee testify to the topic's capacity to engage our emotions. Whilst the EU is being enlarged, that process also demands internal integration. People may well move around, but they think of themselves primarily as citizens of their region and of the places where they have their abodes and domiciles, long before they start describing themselves as Italian, English, German, Spanish or even European. This gives these local structures crucial importance when it comes to imparting the tradition of European thought and implementing European legislation in practice and on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, though, that the Member States' constitutional arrangements also differ to an extremely wide degree. Our rapporteur has distinguished himself with the survey he has compiled and included in his working paper on the relationships between the central and local levels in the EU's Member States and in the candidate countries, which reveals that, below the level of a Member State's central government, the regions or federal states possess the most diverse legislative competences. It is not intended that Europe should tamper with this autonomous approach to national structures, which has the deepest of roots in the nation state.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not, though, delude ourselves; discussion of this topic brings the Member States, those with centralised constitutions and those constituted on federal lines, with their own conceptions, head to head with each other. This alone explains why so much emotion is called forth by the idea of the regions having an independent right of appeal to the ECJ when their own legislative rights are directly affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is the European Parliament that, alone, possesses the power to integrate Europe. We, its Members, represent the people for whom ‘home’ means their regions and their communities. If we are now to work on the even greater Europe that we all – for a diversity of reasons – desire, we have to take care to stand on a secure foundation; what we must also give this Europe is a soul – and we must do it with popular consent. Our regions are that foundation, and it is for that reason that we have to treat them with respect rather than passing their concerns through a filter, as Mr Corbett suggested.</p>

In this regard, the role of the regions is quite simply essential.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Convention must do is formalise something which is already a reality. How is it possible that the regions are applying Community legislation and that this is not formally recognised in terms of rights within the institutional framework of the Union? How is it possible that these regions transpose Community legislation but their situation is clearly undervalued in the Treaties in force?</p>
<p class="contents">We must correct this in the following way: firstly, the regions must be consulted at every stage of the legislative procedure in the European Union; secondly, we must urge the Member States to allow them the greatest possible participation throughout the European decision-making process in each of the States, including at the level of representation within the Council of Ministers; we must also increase the role of the Committee of the Regions and allow the regions to be able to act within the framework of the principle of subsidiarity. If somebody has to apply and transpose legislation in accordance with this principle, then logically they must also be able to defend their prerogatives and rights. Also in the European Union the courts are there to ensure the better legal operation of the institutions and policies we have decided on jointly.</p>
<p class="contents">By whatever means, the important thing is that the Napolitano report, in the form it is in today or the form it will be in, probably, after the vote in the plenum, will recognise the right of the regions to defend their prerogatives before the Court of Justice – this is the fundamental thing – and also to apply the policies of the Union, in a more effective manner, within the framework of Community law, as the Socialist Group’s Amendment No 5 states.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Socialists voted in favour of the Napolitano report in committee and we will do so again tomorrow because it represents a step forward. What will be approved will probably be somewhere in the middle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that the result will only be achieved if subsidiarity is not just applied to relations between the Union and the national States but is extended to the territorial authorities – the regional and local authorities – with all due respect for the constitutional systems of the respective countries, of course. Indeed, it is the territorial authorities – the regional and local authorities – alone which give substance to the democracy of proximity. It is they that make it possible to strengthen the roots of genuine democracy and to bring the citizens closer to the institutions, including the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention is the forum which has been assigned the task of resolving this thorny issue. It started off focusing its attention solely on the first level of subsidiarity, the subsidiarity between the Union and the States. We need to free ourselves from this trap because, if we endorse this system of two levels of subsidiarity – subsidiarity between the Union and the States and between the States and the territorial authorities – we prevent – and I feel that this is the crux of the matter – recognition of that direct connection between the European institutions and the territorial authorities which now exists and which is yielding promising fruit, where it is not misinterpreted or destroyed at birth.</p>
<p class="contents">We must resist this temptation at all costs and, to this end, I hope that the Convention will take on board the lengthy debate which has taken place in Europe, particularly in the Council of Europe, on the matter. My hope is that the Convention will succeed in recognising and endorsing the right to local and regional autonomy. This right will then be regulated within the respective legal systems of the individual countries but will have to comprise the single level of subsidiarity, the equal dignity of levels of government, the right of local autonomies to their own financial resources and the right to have access to justice, which can balance the technical needs to prevent this getting out of control against the needs of the territorial authorities, but which cannot stop it happening. It may be that the idea of strengthening the link through the Committee of the Regions is the solution we all need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Centralisation means arrogant governments that think they know better than the people who are experiencing the regional problems and who choose solutions for them themselves. Furthermore, if the national language is not the language widely used in education, government and the economy, there will be a split between first-class citizens who have grown up with the dominant language from birth and second-class citizens who have merely acquired it.</p>
<p class="contents">Democratic government in Europe cannot exist if cultural diversity and regional differences are not taken into account. The existence of the European Union is resulting in the power of the governments of the Member States growing in comparison with their national parliaments and their regions. This expansion is at the expense of the positions that Scotland, Catalonia, Friesland, Corsica, Flanders or the Valle d’Aosta have now acquired, while in these areas in particular the people yearn to be put on a more equal footing with the Member States.</p>

I believe that, as a<span class="bold"> </span>clear, natural consequence of the European Union changing from a system based on an international Treaty negotiated by diplomats to a political Union which is of a federal nature, that is a Union based on a Constitution, the instruments of constitutional control will have to be overhauled and consolidated. The argument that giving some regions with constitutionally recognised powers – legislative powers – direct access would result in congestion at the Court of Justice would appear to be really very weak, for, if this were the case, then we would have to find a way to strengthen the Court of Justice and make the system more robust and better able to cope with the demand. Moreover, as Mr Duff has already said, it would appear necessary to make it easier for the citizens to approach the constitutional court and to identify the channels open to them, and not just where the regions are concerned but in cases of violations of the citizens’ fundamental rights too.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that this is an important aspect of the future European Constitution, and it is why I believe that it is, quite frankly, going too far to paint such a negative picture of the opportunity presented by this report, which I see as the more innovative, original part, treating it as some kind of impending disaster which we will not subsequently be able to control.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I feel that the compromise put forward has two major shortcomings, for it proposes two filters, two filters which are themselves inadequate. The state cannot act as a filter for the regions because, in many cases, it is in a position of opposition to a region and its powers, and the Committee of the Regions, which was created to be weak on purpose, cannot be another filter for the powers of the regions because, not least, that would<span class="bold"> </span>introduce and preserve the idea of a false neutrality, as Commissioner Barnier said, and a false equality between the regions.

Serbia and Montenegro are using the principle of self-determination to try to reach a definitive settlement of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union itself, on the contrary, lacks a comprehensive approach to the issue of stateless nations. This is very regrettable. But it is much more regrettable to read in the explanatory statement of Mr Napolitano's report that it is unacceptable to suggest the recognition of the right to self-determination, because that falls within the sovereign and exclusive competence of the Member States. That means that those stateless nations cannot claim the right of their peoples to exist as such. How can the European Union ignore the principles of universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights proclaimed in 1993 by the Vienna Declaration? Could that be possible in an area of freedom, security and justice?</p>

It is an issue which puts to the test the principle of subsidiarity and the very ideal of Europe as a community of diversities, and it involves different national historical traditions and systems whose attitudes towards regional power vary.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is right for the proposal on the Union’s powers not to interfere with the systems of the individual States. We cannot, however, disregard the fact that some national Constitutions confer major legislative powers on the regions, and the Convention will have to recognise this, although without creating privileges, without upsetting the internal market and without removing the need for a political Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I feel it is right to give the regions with legislative powers the right to approach the Court of Justice directly when their prerogatives are affected by European measures. I believe that it would be a mistake to overlook the fact that some <span class="italic">Länder </span>or<span class="italic"> </span>regions – in Germany, Italy or Spain – are territorial authorities which are much larger than some of the entities established in the national States.

After all, the officials and politicians in the European Union are spending much too much time in the corridors of supranational power and are forgetting that Europe is really made up of four governmental levels: local, regional, national and European. Europe’s roots lie at local and regional level. That is where the European lives and works; that is where most of the policies that we make in Europe are carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">The Napolitano report recognises the importance of the local and regional entity for the continued existence and consolidation of European integration, and not only the formal regions with constitutional powers, but all regions, from Dutch <span class="italic">provincies</span> to English counties to German <span class="italic">Länder </span>and Spanish <span class="italic">comunidades autónomas.</span> That is because, in a Europe in which all citizens are equal and therefore have equal rights, it is not possible to differentiate between territorial entities and to grant one region more rights than another. Of course, every Member State can determine for itself how its own constitutional system should be organised, however, and that naturally means that decentralisation in one country is organised differently from decentralisation in another.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that Mr Napolitano has made a number of very good proposals for improving the involvement of regional and local entities in the European policy process. I am referring here to the participation of the regions involved – both in the draft phase and in the execution phase of the policy – the appropriate application of Article 203, the possibility for the region to ask the Committee of the Regions or their own government to go to the Court if they think that the principle of subsidiarity has been violated, or to take action, and finally to develop a statute for border regions. A statute of this kind for border regions could make the lives of many Europeans who live on both sides of the borders every day quite a bit easier and more pleasant. I hope that as a result of this report, the Convention will actually bring Europe and the regions closer to the people and we will anchor the region firmly in a new European constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not agree with those people who have said that this is a responsibility of each Member State, which is contrary to the principle of subsidiarity.

This participation and will, if recognised by the future Constitution, would not represent a free concession, but a right of the regions, such as Catalonia, which the European Union, and this Parliament in particular, as the representative of the European people, must respect if it really wants to listen to the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This topic, the position of the municipalities and regions and their involvement in European policy, is one of them. It is my belief that both local self-government and regional identity are fundamental principles, and must be reflected as such in the European constitution. I also wish to thank Mr Napolitano, whose task was a difficult one in view of the concepts involved being very much a matter of dispute. In many respects, this report advances the position of the municipalities and regions and their involvement in European policy, but I am surprised that such impassioned controversy has been unleashed by the right of municipalities and regions to go to the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think that the constitution has to give everyone who possesses a right, the additional right to approach the ECJ in Luxembourg, a right that 380 million Europeans are meant to be given by the Charter of Fundamental Rights. To that, we all say ‘yes’, yet there is division in this House when it comes to the regions. I think that further thought needs to be given to this.</p>
<p class="contents">No attempt whatever is made to tamper with the way states are organised internally, something that does, indeed, vary a very great deal, in that many regions possess competences, while others have merely administrative responsibilities or simply the name of ‘region’. This diversity must also be reflected when it comes to the right to appeal to the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Barnier has proposed the application of Article 203 in the event of us not succeeding in this. That may perhaps be a way ahead, albeit only the second best. It may be that a further stage is needed to enable us to find the best way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something else of great importance that I would like to mention. Commissioner Barnier, you have been to the border region that is my home. The lives of those of us who live on the borders are still made more difficult by bureaucratic and legal obstacles, and a European statute on cross-border cooperation would be a help to many millions of people. Reality has already burst the bounds of the legal framework, and to a substantial extent. That is what European added value actually amounts to. There must be room in the constitution for this sort of statute on cross-border cooperation, which will then benefit many millions of people.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that a large majority will endorse the Napolitano report. Rather than being in competition with them, Parliament exists to be the regions' and municipalities' natural partner.</p>

That is the view expressed by the Catalonian President, Mr Pujol. Certainly, it is the case that, for many citizens, not only regions but also districts – that is to say, the local administrative units – feel closer and perhaps more natural than, in particular, the European institutions. Moreover, it is regional and local authorities that implement a large portion of EU decisions. It is therefore only fair that they should be given a strengthened role to play now that we are reviewing European forms of governance. These bodies must be involved at an early stage in some form of consultation procedure when proposals are formulated. As proposed, for example, in the report, they can play an important role in terms of evaluation and follow-up, as well as seeing to it that the principle of subsidiarity is applied.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot solve internal constitutional conflicts in this Chamber, but we must give a clear signal that we attach great importance to local and regional levels and specify this in the treaty. It would therefore be excellent to incorporate, for example, the statute on local and regional authorities.</p>

Ten years ago, when the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated, there seemed, in my view, to be a more favourable climate for the regional package of requirements than there is today. There are even signs of a countermove in the European Convention now. The draft constitutional treaty put forward by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing causes me great concern in this regard. It does not contain any references at all to sub-state governments and is a step backwards in many respects. All this is happening against the background of enlargement. Many of the states that will soon be acceding are smaller than the existing regions and nations with legislative powers. The candidate Member States will soon be participating fully in the European structure. It is therefore only fair that nations such as Flanders, the Walloon provinces, the Basque country, Catalonia, Wales, Scotland and Galicia can do that too. The report by Mr Napolitano has arrived at an opportune moment, a few weeks before the debate on this in the Convention on 6 and 7 February. I fully support the strengthened version of the Napolitano report that Mr MacCormick mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Barnier and Mr Méndez de Vigo have just commented on the proposal to offer constitutional regions direct access to the Court of Justice. If I understand correctly, they are arguing for controlled access under the authority of the Member State in question. This little trick, however, is rather too transparent. It means in practice that, for example, the three historic nations of the Basque country, Catalonia and Galicia, would more or less be denied access to the Court of Justice by the centralist powers in Madrid. As a representative of Flanders, one of the historic regions that acquired quasi-autonomy without the use of force, I would like to ask you not to go down the route proposed by Mr Méndez de Vigo at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, this report's political message is that Europe's Parliament is drawing much closer to its regions, thus abandoning its former attitude, which was somewhat aloof.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the regions' right of appeal is concerned, I am glad that we have already come to an understanding about so much. We have agreed that the situation demands that the regions should have the option of laying claims before the European Court of Justice. We are also as one in believing that, on the other hand, the Member States must have some sort of monitoring role in this. In practice, this means that all that remains to be decided is what the role of the Member States is to be. Mr Corbett, your compromise proposes that it is only to the Member States that the regions should be able to make some sort of application, but that, unfortunately, gets us no further and is no sort of compromise. The fact is that the regions can of course do that already. Furthermore, it labours under the great disadvantage that we would be doing precisely what you advise us not to do, in that we would be interfering in the relationship between the regions and the Member States, and prescribing what that relationship should be.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I wish, again, to commend to you the compromise motion No 24, which would enable the regions to appeal under the Member States' supervision, as it were. This would leave room for flexible solutions in all the Member States, solutions that might be different in Germany from what they are in Great Britain. For this reason, I really do beg you to reconsider this. This is a sensitive issue for the regions, who are awaiting a signal from us, and I would be glad if we could join in sending that signal tomorrow.</p>

<p class="contents">Regional and local authorities should therefore be offered the opportunity to contribute to the creation of Community policies and, where appropriate, to promote them, without ever replacing the Member States and the peoples of the Union, upon whom alone political and legal legitimacy rest.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should not interfere in any way with the territorial organisation of its Member States. Furthermore, the Member States are completely free to organise, each for their own part, the participation of the regions in their decision-making processes. It should be the role of the Committee of the Regions to consult the regions at Community level and defend their interests. This process should also apply to monitoring the principle of subsidiarity. Contrary to what Mr Wuermeling has just said, the Committee of the Regions did not until now have the right to involve the Court. Any other solution would inevitably lead to an inactive and ineffective Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Since a close vote in committee has altered the delicate balance secured by our rapporteur, it now falls to Parliament to reestablish this by voting for Amendment No 17 by Mr Corbett, intended to replace the controversial paragraphs 8 and 9 of the motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet, although it is not an easy issue to resolve, the rapporteur addresses it in a commendably balanced, not to say quite pragmatic way. There is, in fact, undeniable tension between the supranational and regional dimensions: tension which is historical, for the more European development has tended towards the supranational, the more – I regret to say – we have lost sight of the fact that, within many States, regionalisation processes were developing with characteristics and approaches to decentralisation which were different from what we were developing in the European Union. Thus, a sort of grey area has been created, there have been injustices, if we consider what has happened in recent years. We have witnessed a process of Europeanisation of powers conferred on the regions by Constitutions. We have witnessed a complete lack or only relative participation of the regions in the Community decision-making processes. We have witnessed the transfer of responsibilities from the States to the Community and thus the loss of the interactive powers conferred on the regions by national Constitutions. The <span class="italic">Länder </span>participate in the<span class="italic"> </span>federal legislative process through the <span class="italic">Bundesrat </span>and the Italian regions have powers of initiative at national level. Then the regions are further penalised in that they no longer have any guarantees as regards jurisdictional protection in the event of encroachment on their competences.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the Napolitano report endeavours to provide a very interesting legal response to all these concerns. It is the basis for a debate which will take place formally in the Convention, probably at the beginning of February. The report and the amendments tabled – further reflection may be necessary on some amendments where too much emphasis is placed on access to a Constitutional Court – will enable Parliament to provide the Convention with a plan for the construction of the Europe of the citizens which we want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The two gentlemen standing over there, Mr Corbett and Mr Wuermeling, Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo, those who, even when something as central as nations' right to go to law is at stake, are trying to make a man out of a woman or the other way round, even though they know perfectly well that you cannot be just a little bit pregnant?</p>
<p class="contents">It is not of course by chance that, happily, no compromise motion has so far been tabled by those who have again been away pondering these matters. Instead, the decision is a clear-cut one: vote yes to the Leinen/Martin motion, which was adopted by a majority on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and the regions get the right of appeal. I say this with an awareness of history and of the fact that the European Union's present constitutional arrangements have, to an enormous degree, come about as a matter of coincidence, so that, if I am from little Luxembourg, I can of course oppose the right of appeal – and quake in my boots when I do so – but am in a quite different position if I am from the Basque country or from some other region.</p>

Even if some have legislative competence, this would not give them greater or additional rights in relation to other regions. Otherwise, we would be establishing two-speed citizenship with first- and second-class Europeans. It falls to each State to give power to its regions if it wishes to do so. The matter is being debated in many of our countries, and in particular in my country, France, but not only there. It falls to each State to consult its local authorities and its regions within the context of European policies and their transposal. The Member States do not necessarily do this well, and could do better, but this is a good start.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that the European Union is not the sum of its regions. It is a Union of States and peoples. Each State must remain master of its internal organisation, both at institutional and territorial level. That is laid down in the Treaties in their current wording and we must retain both the spirit and the letter of the Treaties. No country can claim to have a better system than another. No country can impose its system on another. Europe is a contract, not a constraint.</p>
<p class="contents">If I had to summarise, I would say: yes to strong, fraternal regions within the European Union, yes to regions that cooperate outside their borders, but no to a Europe of regions which would be an unfair, variable-geometry Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
