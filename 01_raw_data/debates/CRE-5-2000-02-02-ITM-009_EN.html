<p class="contents">An urgent request has been referred to us, and we approve it. We have been asked for EUR 35 million. We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring, once the decision has been taken, that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible. We are talking about macrofinancial aid. There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration. This is not our opinion. Our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region. Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments, the donors have made commitments and, obviously, we are the only ones actually paying. The other parties are not paying. We wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regarding requests for financial aid. We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this. We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors. This is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but, quite the contrary, to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors. From that point of view, the proposed facility is a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have three questions for the Commission in this regard. Firstly, we need the Commission to give us, on a regular basis, the list and the amounts that other donors contribute. When we come to pay, we want to know what the others are paying.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation. During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet, according to our information, no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date. This is serious, since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and this follows on from what I have just said, we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis, monthly, regarding progress on payments made. We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments. It is not firm commitments that we need, just plain commitments would suffice, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, more especially, what has not been paid. Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality, and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate. As of 9 February, there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council, which will comprise representatives of the political parties, the minorities and civil society, and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament. This is a positive move and we welcome it, but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare, for elections are planned for the autumn. No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result. No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis UNMIK. In other words, there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either. Of all people, it is the Albanians, who are now being integrated into the transitional council, who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work, urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs, Albanians and other minorities – not forgetting the Roma of course – in this country, so that at some point in the near future, on the road to coexistence, it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about. Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors. That is excellent news! There too, people are being encouraged to pay their taxes, for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources. It should also be noted that of the 19 departments, 4 already have administrative leadership, which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto. </p>
<p class="contents">There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law. We have 130 judges and public prosecutors, who have now been sworn in, and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice, with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little, and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions. Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UCK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country. I believe that is a good thing</p>
<p class="contents">I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way. The EU Commission cannot pay for everything. It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar, but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr Kouchner’s outstanding bills. One could do so once or twice, but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well, for there is a very large hole, as yet unfilled, that we are unable to fill. We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a debate, there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said. However, I would like to concentrate on two points. Firstly, I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo. I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press is true, and that figures do not lie. Let us make this clear, however much some people may not wish to believe it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has decided to assist with a further EUR 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo, on the basis of an IMF report which estimates that a further EUR 115 million is needed for that reconstruction. I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I am in complete agreement with her when she says that the Commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express my concern – which is very considerable – at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter, in any circumstances, the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin. This calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached, with great difficulty, with the Council in December, according to which, when the Commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction, the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary. I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Commission – and I am glad that Commissioner Solbes is here with us this evening – to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme, with the corresponding report, requested by Parliament, so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up, as we have been promised.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to insist that, although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now, we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough, and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo, which is so badly needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million, and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need. The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there. However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process. Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents. Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions. I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future. It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here. One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims. In other words, we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner’s sphere of competence and not to other spheres.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there, we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into. This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations. It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there. This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence. We have so many coordinators, who, in turn, are responsible to so many employers, that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators. Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this, but if the European Union is doing the most work out there, then it should also be given the leadership, and bring coherence to the situation, so that we can be of real assistance to the people. It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground! Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed – it is now set for the end of March – that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline, that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented, and there is a steady stream of new press conferences, this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe!</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative, so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month. Rather, we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country, and I hope that in the process, you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the Alliance is still active in that region, it is with the same objective. </p>
<p class="contents">The day before yesterday I was pleased to hear an interview given by the KFOR commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in Kosovo were starting to be, particularly as regards security, crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level. Those representing Europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective, and I am thinking in particular of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, are on the verge of despondency precisely because, since matters are improving, there is less talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">We must work to ensure that, in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally, the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords. It is true that economic aid is, in this respect, certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level. Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we, the Members of the European Parliament, must fulfil our own obligations in this regard, while ensuring, of course, that we are not the only ones to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on. The Council’s failings in this respect are a source of much regret. The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should, and must, provide help swiftly, however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random. I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point, which clearly emphasises that it is only possible, and permissible, to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public, communal and other authorities and institutions, which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK. Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations, in particular Pillar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place.</p>
<p class="contents">What is to be done with this money? I would like to highlight the issue of human rights. The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today? We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit. Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians. I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life. These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated. </p>
<p class="contents">I hear – whether it is true or not I do not know – that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo. There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again. It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo. It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo. What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together. We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough. We need an independent judiciary – this would certainly be difficult to establish –, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this needs to happen, and quickly too. If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise. That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available. Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue. This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight’s debate. Firstly, although much progress has been made, and we could mention customs administration, bank administration or tax administration, it is true that we must continue to move forward. However, in moving forward, what should we be financing? This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement. In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds, for example, Amendments Nos 3 and 5. In our view, however, in both respects, greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which, on the ground, is more aware of the reality than we are.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that to prejudge, at the moment, where resources should be directed, would create more practical difficulties. In short, we should put our faith in those parties who, in these areas, are better equipped than us to make certain decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second concern which I notice that many of you share – it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges, but others have repeated it – refers to the situation regarding the other donors. Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate? Some of the amendments in your report pose this question. For example, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue, that this is not the fundamental problem, although we recognise it totally. The fundamental problem is that, at the moment, the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the High Level Steering Group, but it is also true that they have no legal status. This is simply a political commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the reason why, while accepting its spirit, we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently – and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect – so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say the same about Amendment No 2, which we would also accept with a slight modification, since the idea seems to us to be basically correct.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature. On this specific point, we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction. We have already spoken to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision, establishing this element of conditionality. With regard to the second contribution, what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors. In other words, we should not establish conditionality, or we believe that it is more effective not to establish conditionality from the start, but, nevertheless, we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage. In this way, we would have no problem in acting immediately. We would not create problems for the Kosovar people, but, on the other hand, we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">A third problem has been raised by Mrs Dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes. I would remind you that these projects are multiannual. The programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us. On the one hand, we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and, in this respect, I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament’s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in Kosovo. The Commission can commit itself to regularly informing Parliament of the invitations to tender which are published. We also wish to see these publicised on the Internet, so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point which I would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance. In this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed, on a confidential basis, if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality, on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that, with the final decision of the Council, we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in Kosovo by different parties, so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do, however, have one small concern, when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a clear agreement, good or bad I will not say, but there was a contract. There was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7, i.e. on the idea of linking the mobilisation, the implementation, of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment. But, if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira says correctly, then this undertaking was only a tentative one.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement. Can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on Budgets, yes or no? Or are you going to drop this proviso, thus breaking the undertaking made to us? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
