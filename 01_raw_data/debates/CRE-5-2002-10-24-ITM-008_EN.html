<p class="contents">Credit is due to the Danish Presidency for having made every endeavour to maintain a united Union position. However, the General Affairs Council has assumed a very ambiguous position regarding the possibility of concluding bilateral agreements, following the offensive launched by the current US Administration in an attempt to obtain immunity for all US citizens across the board and the willingness to accept this demand displayed by a number of European countries, including Italy – something which particularly pains me – which, apart from being my native country, was also the first Member State to ratify the Treaty of Rome.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to stress how shameful it is that the United States should have gone so far as to resort to threatening to impose sanctions on the countries which have ratified or intend to ratify the International Criminal Court Statute, and emphasise that there can be no agreements allowing those who have debased themselves by committing crimes against humanity or genocide to do so with impunity. Since the Rome Statute does not allow for derogations from this requirement, any agreement to that effect is to be deemed not to be compatible. That applies to the 15 Member States, but also to the countries which are going to join the Union and the countries with which the Union enjoys relations. The Council therefore needs to make every effort to hold a frank dialogue with the US Administration and to present to us a report stating a clear position on the compatibility of any potential bilateral agreements with the Rome Statute, before the Copenhagen European Council takes place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is supposed to give substance to the concept of international, immanent justice which can punish, if not prevent, genocide and crimes against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">Even with one International Criminal Court conducting an investigation into a few crooks who bear a large part of the responsibility for the massacres in the former Yugoslavia and another conducting an investigation into the genocide in Rwanda, however, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that all those guilty of offences which are just as serious will be prosecuted. How likely is it that the politicians and economic profiteers of the former colonial Belgian power, who consciously set the Tutsis and the Hutus against each other, will be prosecuted? Will the French leaders be prosecuted, those leaders whose troops in Rwanda were present, holding their fire at the massacres unleashed by the government in office, when they did not make matters worse by supplying weapons to either side?</p>
<p class="contents">Will the United Kingdom be prosecuted for its part in the political manœuvres which played such a major role in the ethnic massacres in Sierra Leone? How likely is it that George Bush, who is preparing, openly and publicly, to bombard tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians with the excuse that he is punishing their dictator, will be prosecuted before the Court for crimes against humanity? How likely is it that the industrial groups which, thanks to the gung-ho activities of politicians, are free to derive considerable profits from the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, will be prosecuted?</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, the only effect of the International Criminal Court will be to add a touch of hypocrisy to an imperialist world where the strongest have the last word. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why it is unacceptable for the American Government to undermine the Court by trying to enter into bilateral agreements with EU countries or candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Danish Presidency has worked hard to maintain a common EU position, and I am sorry that no such position has come about. The Council has to a large extent given in to American pressure, and I want, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to call upon the national parliaments in the EU and in the candidate countries to keep a close eye on what their governments are doing so that the Rome Statute is not weakened.</p>
<p class="contents">As is well known, the United States signed the statute, but has withdrawn its signature. I hope that the Council will embark upon a new dialogue with the American Government concerning the recognition of the International Criminal Court, which all the Member States and most of the candidate countries have now ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the United States share the same basic values. Both parties profess freedom and democracy and the defence of human rights and the principles of the rule of law. That is why the United States, which will be able to contribute in a particularly positive way to the Court and to the way it operates, should be among the signatories of the Rome Statute. Since 1998, the EU has tried to accommodate American anxieties in relation to certain provisions of the Statute, but its efforts have unfortunately been in vain.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate, moreover, that the United States does not now intend to be a party to the statute which, as I say, it in fact signed during the Clinton administration. The United States’ decision is wrong, and we must all regret the American measures. We must therefore hope that the United States can be convinced to adopt a more positive line once the Criminal Court has in practice had the opportunity to show that it operates in accordance with the highest standards of the rule of law and does not allow itself to be misused for political purposes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Posselt (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, this debate on the International Criminal Court has gone from one extreme to another. We heard one extreme earlier, in Mrs Cauquil's speech. Mrs Cauquil, I must say to you in all honesty that we do not want an international revolutionary tribunal. Putting forward theses such as yours is a sure-fire way of scuppering the whole idea of a criminal court. On the other hand – and here I do agree with you – we do not want a criminal court to be no more than a rubber stamp in the hands of the major powers. I am really sorry that the forces that, even if they are not willing or able to prevent this court completely, want to downgrade it to some sort of rubberstamp are gaining ground in the USA and China and Russia and other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union are going the way of the law and I think that this forms part of a good and important tradition. The Council of Europe was founded as a human rights community here in Strasbourg over 50 years ago. The Human Rights Convention was adopted and the Court of Human Rights was created here in Strasbourg. For the last 50 years, the European Parliament has sat here in Strasbourg as the voice of the people, as the voice of the European rule of law and because we want to extend this rule of law to the whole continent, we quite deliberately set the idea of the Copenhagen criteria, democracy and the rule of the law, at the spearhead of the historic enlargement process, which is now approaching its culmination.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a consequence of our history, which has, unfortunately, seen its own share of genocide, expulsion, disenfranchisement, suppressed minorities and crimes against humanity. We have no right to play teacher to the rest of the world, as we sometimes do, unless we take our own rule of law seriously. That does not just mean respecting the rule of law internally, it also means being the strong partner for others throughout the world, when it comes to the worldwide rule of law. The criminal court, like our founding treaty, was born in Rome and the idea of Rome is somehow bound up with the concept of law. The Rome Statute underlying the criminal court should not be undermined, weakened or watered down. If we do not want the courts needed for genocide and recurrent crimes against humanity to be wrongly denigrated as victor's justice or one-off justice, then we need a permanent criminal court to which all are equally subject, large and small states alike, whatever the nationality of the perpetrator or criminal.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we want to hold on to this Statute as it stands. We are severely critical of the Council of the European Union for skimping on clarity and dignity here, for repeatedly trying to get by with devious manoeuvres and for repeatedly giving in to the powers that be. If Europe wants to take itself seriously, it must fight for this criminal court and must say to the United States of America that they are indeed our most important ally, but that just such an ally has a duty within the free world to take the law seriously, however uncomfortable it may find it.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not need more unilateralism in response to 11 September; we need to strengthen the rule of law throughout the world, which is why we are calling for fast, undiluted ratification of the Rome Statute.</p>

I am therefore slightly surprised at the negative text of the resolution we have before us and at some of the contributions to the debate, because the General Affairs Council surely produced a very good outcome – European solidarity was confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a good example of how the common foreign and security policy works in bringing Member States together and it preserved the integrity of the International Criminal Court. So we should really be welcoming that agreement, particularly as it established the general principles governing any agreement to be signed, including the point made by colleagues that no agreement should be signed if it means that people will enjoy impunity.

The principles of the Rome Statute, as well as those governing the functioning of the Court, are obviously in line with the principles and objectives of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Our commitment is articulated, as Mr Titley just reminded us, in the common positions on the ICC adopted in June 2001 and revised in June 2002. It is reflected in the Action Plan on the ICC adopted in May of this year and the conclusions and guiding principles adopted by the Council as recently as 20 September. These decisions all give clear evidence of the European Union's continuing support for the Rome Statute and for an effective International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Consistent with that is the fact that the European Union is actively committed to ensuring the widest possible signature, ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute. To that end, between 1995 and 2001, the Commission's European initiative for democracy and human rights financed nearly EUR 7 million in projects with this purpose in various parts of the world. An additional EUR 6 million is earmarked for projects in 2002/2003.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as continuing to encourage all states that have not already done so to sign, ratify and adopt implementing legislation for the Rome Statute as soon as possible, we also encourage all states to respond to Washington's request for immunity agreements in a manner which is consistent with the Rome Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions and guiding principles adopted by the Council on 30 September provide guidance on the ways to ensure that such responses preserve the integrity of the International Criminal Court, which is absolutely fundamental and vital.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union also wants all states which have ratified the Rome Statute to be actively involved in nominating and electing the chief prosecutor and judges of the International Court. This should be done in a manner consistent with the process and criteria established by the Rome Statute and the resolution of the first assembly of states parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for this opportunity to set out the position of the Commission and the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What does this have to do with urgent cases of breaches of human rights? This has nothing to do with the provision of Article 50(1). The motion tabled by the Socialist Group, concerning the stoning of women, a frequent practice in Iran, which is even inflicted on girls of 9 years old, made perfect sense. This is something I fail to understand, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, however, to ask the Bureau a second question: If we are going to look at the dialogue on human rights between Iran and the European Union; I should like the Bureau to clarify the precise meaning and scope of this debate, because according to the Iranian authorities and according to what we can read about the dialogue on the Internet, what they are saying is that Islam is being persecuted in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom. It is there, in print. I should like to have clarification of this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
