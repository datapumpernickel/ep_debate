<p class="contents">It is worth pointing out that there have been repeated and insistent calls from a large number of European regions over many years for this concept to be taken into account in EU policies. The accession of 10 new Member States, which has manifested itself in a worsening of regional disparities and the emergence of new territorial inequalities, has singularly amplified the calls for this major necessity. The draftsmen of the draft Constitution for Europe were well aware of this, since Article 3 of the draft Treaty refers to economic, social and territorial cohesion among the essential objectives of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The problematic fate of the Treaty could lead some of those responsible for regional policy, particularly within the European Commission, to show extreme caution against even referring to the necessity for territorial cohesion. We do not consider this attitude to be justified and I hope, Commissioner, that you will share our viewpoint. Indeed, the tremendous geographical, human and cultural diversity of the territory of the EU, within what is, when all is said and done, a relatively limited area, represents a unique asset on this planet, but, if we are not careful, it contains the seeds for major imbalances that are unbearable for those who view themselves as the victims. This was demonstrated beyond all our fears, unfortunately, during the referenda in France and the Netherlands on the draft European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is probable that popular referenda organised on the same basis would have produced the same result in several other Member States. That is why I wanted my report to contribute to finding answers to the questions raised. How can we reconcile the citizens to the European project? What is the future for Europe? For our Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the answers is provided by the cohesion policy, this policy of solidarity that is the original model for the EU and that sets it apart from a simple free-trade area. Besides ensuring that it has the necessary resources, which assumes that it will be taken properly into account in the financial perspective 2007-2013, it is important for it to integrate the territorial dimension into all its aspects. That is how territorial cohesion will come to represent a clear basis that all Europeans can understand for increasing cohesion within the territory of the EU. More particularly in relation to the realisation of territorial cohesion, I will mention a few specific principles and measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The principles are as follows: the principle of equality between citizens throughout the territory, which in particular implies appropriate accessibility of services of general interest and services of general economic interest; integration of the territorial aspect into the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies; multicentric development of the European territory; the role of small and medium-sized towns and their connection with rural areas; strengthening all aspects of territorial cooperation; supported decentralisation to the regions, which are best acquainted with the needs and potential of their territories; multilevel governance, and the participation of non-public partners.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the concrete proposals that we are presenting to the Commission relates to the implementation of three instruments. First of all, we are proposing a mechanism for cross-fertilisation between sector-specific policies with a major impact on the development of the EU’s territories and regional development policy. Next, new territorial indicators, in addition to gross domestic product, are needed to measure the development of a region and to assess objectively the obstacles to this development. Finally, we need a system for assessing the impact that various Community policies have on territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Another proposal relates to the drafting of a White Paper on the objective of territorial cohesion and in particular on how this objective is to be incorporated into the national strategic plans that the Member States are currently in the process of drawing up. I hope, for my part, that tomorrow’s vote will translate Parliament’s broad support into an ambitious territorial cohesion policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sérgio Marques (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, today sees the completion of a further stage in the process of conferring special status for the outermost regions, pursuant to Article 299(2) of the Treaties, which is based on the highly specific situation in these regions. These regions are characterised by their remoteness, insularity, difficult topography, small size, mountainous nature and economic dependence on one sole product or activity, and the permanence and combination of these factors. These are the characteristic features of what are referred to as the outermost regions, and are unique within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact of the matter is that it would be a grave violation of the principle of proportionality and equality were the outermost regions treated in the same way as the other regions of Europe. The model of integration in these outermost regions must take account of their highly specific characteristics and must therefore be subject to adaptation, adjustment and in some cases derogation. What is different must be treated differently, and the differences evident in the outermost regions have a very detrimental effect on their economic and social development, resulting in unacceptable competitive disadvantage and an inability to make the most of the benefits triggered by the internal market, the recent enlargement, the Lisbon Strategy and globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the outermost regions have little chance of competing on a level playing field when the economic activities developed there are burdened by considerable extra cost, arising from, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, transport, the absence of economies of scale and external economies, small and fragmented markets and the scarcity of qualified labour. It is therefore of vital importance that we pursue measures aimed at stepping up the EU’s special treatment towards the highly specific characteristics of the outermost regions. This is the thrust of the Commission’s communication entitled ‘a stronger partnership for the outermost regions’, on the subject of which I had the honour and the exciting task of drawing up the report before us today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing a far-reaching strategy based on three priorities: competitiveness, accessibility and regional integration. This strategy is set to be implemented under the revamped cohesion policy. The Commission is also proposing the setting up of innovative instruments, such as the specific programme to compensate for additional costs, along with a wider neighbourhood action plan to aid integration of the outermost regions into the surrounding geographical areas, which will involve both transnational and border cooperation on the one hand and trade and customs measures on the other. This is the backbone of the Commission’s proposal to offset and reduce the severity of the main handicaps from which outermost regions suffer. The main priority is to address the most serious of these handicaps, namely the remoteness of the outermost regions, which will be done by promoting the use of new information and communications technology, by facilitating transport links to the European mainland and by fostering the integration of the outermost regions in the surrounding areas to which they have always had their backs turned.</p>
<p class="contents">The second big idea is to promote the competitiveness of the outermost regions, which will be achieved not only in terms of the extent to which we reduce the significant extra costs inherent in being an outermost region, but also by means of decisive action on dynamic elements such as competitiveness, education, training, innovation, research, the information society and entrepreneurship. On this last point, the Commission’s proposal falls well short and this is its major weak point.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that Community policy with a potentially significant effect on the competitiveness of the outermost regions falls well short of what is required. This is particularly true of policies designed to boost human capital, technological research and development, the environment, services of general economic interest and telecommunications. For that matter, the Commission does not propose any special plans for those regions leaving Objective 1 on account of exceeding the 75% of the Community average in terms of per capita GDP. Special phasing out arrangements from Objective 1 to Objective 2 are clearly called for in Article 299(2) of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal is, however, a major step in the right direction, because it is timely, because it correctly establishes its strategy and its priorities and because it proposes innovative policies. We welcome the Commission’s initiative, but we urge it to be more ambitious and to take on board the suggestions and comments made in my report. I could not finish without a word of thanks to those people whose contributions have enhanced this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Danuta Hübner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I wish to begin by making some comments on Mr Guellec's excellent report on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development. I highly appreciate your support for promoting the concept of territorial cohesion in our regional policy. I wish your enthusiasm was shared by all our Member States, but, as you know, the current version of Structural Funds draft regulations has weakened the Commission's proposal on territorial cohesion. This is true, for example, for urban issues. The proposals foreseen by the Commission as compulsory have been rendered merely optional by the Council. Another example is the substantial decrease in terms of financial resources regarding the new European territorial cooperation objective in the Financial Perspective, according to the latest compromise proposal of the Luxembourg Presidency. In this proposal it amounts to only half of the amount proposed by the Commission. So I should like to encourage you to reinstate our initial ideas in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the work on territorial cohesion as something that we must take forward on two fronts. First, through greater emphasis on territorial cohesion in the next generation of cohesion programmes. It must be said that in the draft Community strategic guidelines – which were adopted by the Commission at the end of June – we asked Member States and the regions to pay particular attention to a balanced territorial development when preparing their future regional programmes. In this context, the future national strategic frameworks represent a key opportunity for promoting development models respectful of territorial balance. Moreover, the draft regulations foresee provisions for the specific character of certain territories and they focus on certain thematic priorities which contribute to the territorial development by improving their accessibility or by fostering the development on research and innovation poles.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe we can advance our work on territorial cohesion through promotion of exchange of experience, best practice, benchmarking and also analytical work. As you know, Espon – the research programme – is helping us to improve the understanding of territorial trends and the impact of sectoral policies on the enlarged Union. In addition, other networks, such as Interact or Urbact, contribute to this. I feel confident that these initiatives can be continued in the future as well.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the regular reports on economic and social cohesion carried out by the Commission, I propose to devote part of the fourth cohesion report – due for publication in 2007 – to the territorial cohesion issue. I would also like to inform you that my services are currently preparing a working paper on the cities' contribution to growth and jobs in the regions. This paper will complement the Community strategy guidelines and will be presented to the informal ministerial meeting on sustainable communities in Bristol in December of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am also convinced that we can take forward our work on territorial cohesion through better coordination of Community policies and national policies. So, once again, I am grateful for the emphasis you put on the role of territorial cohesion in our regional policy and I am willing to take forward the territorial cohesion issue both in the context of the new programmes and in our exchange of best practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to Mr Marques' report, which is also excellent. It is about stronger partnership for the outermost regions, with a number and diversity of recommendations which are clear proof of the strong commitment and dedication of the European Parliament to this important subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that the Commission succeeded in establishing a good foundation for a strong partnership with the outermost regions, at both political and technical levels. I strongly believe that the last meeting we had in La Réunion is visible proof of this partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said, we have indeed proposed a significant number of measures to promote economic development of the outermost regions in line with our communication of last year. Our proposals cover many areas such as cohesion policy, agriculture, fisheries and research. Those proposals are currently under negotiation in the Council and Parliament. I sincerely hope that we can swiftly come to an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Some important proposals are still under preparation; in particular, rules on national regional aid, which the Commission will adopt by the end of 2005. I share your view that much remains to be done. Your draft resolution constitutes an important milestone, which we will take into account in our daily work. In our next report on the outermost regions, possibly in 2007 or 2008, I plan to assess the progress made. It is also indispensable to have a coherent approach across all Community policies that takes account of the specific situation of the outermost regions and which needs to be complemented by appropriate national policies. As Commissioner in charge of the coordination of questions related to those regions, I am committed to ensure that all measures taken by the college are adapted to the specific situation of these regions. Your motion for a resolution identifies a significant number of topics to which I will refer in my closing remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to financial perspectives and the cohesion policy and the outermost regions, we certainly welcome the UK Presidency's stated aim of reaching a consensus on the package of regulations as soon as possible so that it can be finalised very quickly once the outcome of the future financing negotiations is known. I pay tribute to Parliament, which quickly recognised the urgency of the situation and voted through the regulations at first reading by an overwhelming majority and with very constructive amendments. An urgent deal on the budget is particularly important for the outermost regions. Such a deal must include, in our view, the special programme that the Commission has proposed for the outermost regions in order to compensate for the additional costs those regions have to bear.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that we will do everything we can to get support from the Member States for those ideas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For any policy to be implemented successfully, it needs a good strategy, as we are all aware. Yet a good strategy on its own is of little worth without the policy instruments needed for its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission deserves praise for the strategy document that it has presented to us. What the document reveals is that the repeated expressions of concern and the calls from various Community bodies for stronger partnerships with the outermost regions have been duly taken on board and followed up. As regards farming, I was the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture, and was delighted to see the unanimity among its members on the broad issues raised by the document, on sectorial questions and on the specific recommendations and suggestions that I formulated in order to make improvements and plug gaps, with regard to banana, sugar, milk and fruit and vegetable production.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the rapporteur responded positively to all of the crucial questions put forward by the Committee and congratulate him on his outstanding work. I also share his concerns as regards the uncertainties concerning the policy instruments required to give the proposed strategy tangible form, such as those instruments designed to solve the current impasse on the financial perspective for the next programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">Without such practical measures, this debate will be little more than a statement of good intentions. I want to believe that the Commission and the Council will be consistent with the positions that they have thus far held and I hope that their actions will live up to their responsibilities and the expectations that have been created. If so, this will be to the benefit of the social, economic and territorial cohesion of some EU regions suffering from the greatest disadvantages; and if not, the objectives of our Union will not be met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion of that committee, I should now like to say a few words of interest to the fisheries sector in those regions. Although I broadly welcome the content of the Commission’s communication in relation to this sector, I feel that it should have gone a little further. I therefore put forward a range of points that I consider essential in the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries. There is no doubt in my mind that POSEI-Fisheries should be updated, in keeping with POSEI-Agriculture, on which I was rapporteur, owing to the specific characteristics of the sector and the regions, and the constantly developing situation there.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to highlight the highly vulnerable nature of the fishing zones there, of which we are all aware, and the social and economic importance of fisheries in some of these regions. The truth is that although there is a great deal of water, it is well known there are not many fish in the waters of the outermost regions. Added to which is the lack of a continental shelf, meaning that fishing essentially takes place on what are referred to as ‘submarine hills’.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, I am of the opinion that the Commission must always apply the precautionary principle where appropriate, unreservedly and without delay. We recall, for example, the recent proposal to ban deep-water trawling off the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, a position that we advocated in Parliament. Nevertheless, the Commission must give preferential treatment to the outermost regions when it comes to access to maritime resources with a view to safeguarding traditional fishing methods. I also feel that the Commission should place limits on fishing methods that may be harmful to ecosystems.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the financial aspect, I should like to remind the Commission of the vulnerable nature of the outermost regions. The Commission should therefore maintain, in the European Fisheries Fund, the level of aid currently granted under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, the level of aid for the processing industry and the derogations that have thus far enabled the outermost regions to modernise their fleet. It should also look to increase compensation levels in respect of the additional costs involved in marketing certain fisheries products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The big difference between now and 15 to 25 years ago is that the regions are very active in their own development. They no longer wait for someone else to enable them to develop their economies and societies and create a good life for themselves. They wish to do these things themselves. It is not so strange, therefore, that territorial cohesion has become an important concept. What it does is sum up this feeling and this desire that exist throughout Europe, including in the city suburbs, that everyone is needed on the continent of Europe, that everyone is important and that all regions have something to contribute. This needs to be obvious to all of us in the EU. That is why the concept of territorial cohesion, whereby we hold our continent together and everyone feels they are participating, is so important. There is a huge amount of knowledge throughout Europe, and that is something we must make the most of if we are to develop our continent. If we do not do so, we shall be making a mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole of Europe has an incredible amount of wealth, which is often to be found out in the regions or city suburbs. We have a great many natural resources which, when they are turned to good account, are helpful not only to the regions but also to the whole of Europe. We are also concerned here with energy, which is what provides us with export income. We also have very extensive natural resources that we can use in tourism and for recreation. A lot of people are employed in these areas, which are ones that we can develop and that our good for the whole of our continent. We also have variety in Europe. We have minorities and immigrants from all around the world whose energy and knowledge must also be made full use of.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to emphasise a number of points in the report that I think are important. The first is that the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies must embrace everyone. We must ensure that they extend to include all regions. Otherwise, we shall not be able to develop the whole of Europe. The second is that we cannot accept sectoral policy areas, which have the opposite effect of merely strengthening the centre. Thirdly, I want to say how important it is for the various policy areas to be valued in Europe so that we obtain genuine territorial cohesion. Take the transport area, for example. We must ensure that we have transport routes enabling the whole of Europe to be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this is a constructive report, and I really do hope that the Commission will listen to what Parliament has to say. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to start by saying that we have before us two excellent reports, one by Mr Guellec and one by Mr Marques, both of whom I should like to congratulate.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report by Mr Marques, I should like to point out very briefly – because I do not come from one of these regions and my honourable friends from such parts know more about this matter than I do – that the Union needs to give priority to the issues of the outermost regions by honouring the commitments which we all made within the framework of the Treaty on European Union and I am sure that the Commission, insofar as it is able, will proceed in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to comment at greater length on the report by Mr Guellec and to say that the Commissioner was indeed right; the draft regulations on the Structural Funds contain many ideas relating to the question of territorial cohesion, an issue which is dealt with in Mr Guellec's report. For its part, the European Parliament will indeed do what it can in its negotiations with the Council to ensure that this principle of territorial cohesion is promoted through the regulations on the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not forget that this principle was a principle which was first introduced in a text of the Treaty on European Union within the framework of the adoption of the draft Constitution. It was an idea which was jointly promoted by your predecessor, Mr Barnier, and the Committee on Regional Policy of the European Parliament at the time. The endeavour was indeed a success, but we have nonetheless, as you know, been unable as yet to get the Constitution ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that the ratification of the Constitution, in relation to the principle of territorial cohesion, will give us many more tools than we presently have at our disposal for proceeding beyond regional policy and seeing territorial cohesion within the framework of competition policy, within the framework of the transport policy of the European Union and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, Commissioner, I should like to come back to what was also said yesterday in this Chamber. You for your part – the European Commission – and we for our part must take advantage of this period of concentration on the European Constitution in order to enlighten the citizens of the European Union and ensure that this Constitution, which contains positive provisions for the citizens themselves, is adopted as quickly as possible, so that we have more substantial legislative tools in our hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, as long as this period does not turn from a period of concentration into a period of hypnosis. That is the huge wager before us and I think that both Parliament and the Commission need to make every possible effort not to waste valuable time and to ensure that the European Union acquires the Constitutional Treaty to which it is entitled and which it deserves.</p>

<p class="contents">For my part, I would like to focus more particularly on one of the points raised in Mr Guellec’s report, but which also affects Mr Marques’s report, as Mr Guellec has examined the role of urban centres and the surrounding areas.</p>
<p class="contents">For a number of years we have readily been talking – I myself represent a town, Rheims in Champagne – about the concept of catchment areas. Catchment areas are zones covering both a town, whether small, medium-sized or large, and all the surrounding rural areas up to 5, 10, 15, 20, or even, to take the French capital, Paris, as an example, up to 200 kilometres outside it, where a number of people travel every day between their homes and their workplaces. It was therefore vital, in order to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, for the European Union to fit the bulk of its assistance into the framework of harmonious, consistent territorial development.</p>
<p class="contents">These catchment areas, in particular, must play a central role, which is currently not the case. I have mentioned travel; it is clear that, in all catchment areas, there are housing problems. Housing is more expensive in the town centre, and cheaper on the outskirts; people choose to live in the outskirts because it is quieter there, or because housing is cheaper. All of this results in problems with daily commuting. We are seeing depopulated villages just a few kilometres from our towns, while, in some neighbourhoods, there is appalling overcrowding. We are experiencing security problems, and I could go on.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore perfectly natural that, in order to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, we need to ensure that there is real cohesion within these catchment areas, between the town centre, the suburbs, the immediate surroundings and the more remote areas. Can we overcome these problems without too much difficulty? The answer is obviously no, in view of the large number of players involved. These include housing associations, decision-makers in the employment sector, and, of course, political decision-makers operating at local, regional and national level. We are all aware of the difficulties involved in harmonising the positions of the various political organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the European Union currently has a central part to play, in providing a stimulus to create, over the years to come, true cohesion in all of these areas, and harmonious development within these catchment areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Marques, I have already mentioned the respect I have for your report, and the support that we give it. I hope that, in all of our outermost regions, whether in the areas surrounding small towns, larger towns or in any other areas, the EUR 1 100 000 000 that we obviously hope will be released will enable us to realise the harmonious development for which we all hope and pray. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am much obliged to Mr Guellec for what is a really good report, and I believe that its being an own-initiative report makes it a good means whereby we in this Committee of the European Parliament can develop our own approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Good teamwork has made it possible to produce this balanced but forward-looking report. If we all agree that we want – and let me say, Commissioner, that I hope you will succeed in your efforts to get the Member States to join in this – to communicate Europe to people where they are and in their day-to-day lives, then territorial, along with social and economic, cohesion is of enormous importance. It will help to secure the acceptance of the principle that all EU citizens should be valued equally and treated fairly irrespective of the region in which they live; it will also help to get this incorporated in all our important documents, for example those relating to the Structural and Cohesion Funds, but also in the implementation of the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">We do well to make partnership a primary principle – partnership between cities, their <span class="italic">hinterland</span> and rural areas, but also partnership between all political levels. As I see it, the coherent, harmonious development of all the EU countries, the regions and the cities, largely depends on this, and I want to express my strong support for the idea that a region’s state of development should be assessed by reference to more than just its GDP; other territorial indicators – educational, scientific, cultural and sporting provision, for example, as well as the incidence of unemployment or the state of the infrastructure – need to be included, for viewing the region as a whole gives a much clearer picture of what it is like. That is a significant step towards fairer assessment, and will eventually enable the people who live there to have a better understanding of Europe and of the regulations that we enact, and I get the impression that there is still a desperate need for far better communication between us and the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These regions are characterised by permanent structural disadvantages which set them apart from the other regions of EU Member States. These structural disadvantages are compounded by their remoteness, their insularity, their small size, their difficult topography and climate and by their dependence on a few products, the permanence and combination of which severely restrain their development. This is referred to in the Treaties, and for this reason, the specific characteristics of the outermost regions must be mainstreamed across all Community policies, bearing in mind their development needs and the need for effective implementation of economic and social cohesion, a principle that is also enshrined in the Treaties. Furthermore, a specific Community programme to support these regions, bringing together all of the dispersed measures should be set up, which must be granted adequate financial resources within the framework of the financial perspective for 2007-2013. This will contribute significantly towards solving the regions’ problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the characteristics and needs of these regions and their populations can and should be addressed. Of these, I wish to highlight the need to ensure the sustainability of fish stocks and the activities of fishing communities in these regions. To this end, it is essential that exclusive control of access to their waters, pursuant to the relevant national jurisdiction, should coincide with its exclusive economic zone.</p>
<p class="contents">We must consider implementing a range of permanent support measures in the area of the environment, given that most of the territory of these regions is made up of nature reserves and other protected areas. Lastly, we should support measures to support training in traditional handcrafts, local production and tourism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My plain-speaking constituents have no time for regionalism and I doubt if they would be interested in strategic spatial impact evaluation procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Guellec clearly does not pick up simple messages from ordinary voters. His fellow Frenchmen rejected the EU Constitution, yet it is an essential ingredient of his report. That is no surprise, for the rapporteur's own website has a whole section devoted to the Constitution, including a table of key dates. The most recent key date for Mr Guellec is 29 October 2004, when the Constitutional Treaty was signed in Rome. The day of the French referendum, 29 May 2005, is not even a minor detail for him. He said that territorial cohesion becomes an essential objective of the EU in the Constitution. Sadly for him the Constitution is not an essential objective for French and Dutch voters.</p>
<p class="contents">What is territorial cohesion? The rapporteur can only tell us that the first formal attempt at a definition comes from the Commission. Who ever heard of such nonsense: to suggest a project and then attempt a definition? How typical of this mad European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur says that regions are the best qualified level to determine needs. He should visit the so-called region that I represent. The regional authority in Exeter cannot possibly know what is best for Gloucester, Swindon or Penzance, all many miles away. The ordinary people in those areas do not think so. Perhaps Mr Guellec is not bothered what those ordinary people think, as long as he can emphasise that his beloved EU Constitution strengthens the role of the regions. The only problem for him is that ordinary people in his own country do not agree with his approach. He certainly achieves cohesion in one respect, because ordinary people in all parts of the continent will be equally confused by his report, and he is equally out of touch with all of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is stated therein that as a Community we shall strive to reduce disparities in the level of development of individual regions and the degree of underdevelopment in less privileged areas. This also applies to rural and remote areas. It is therefore entirely appropriate for us to consider this very important issue, and I should like to thank the rapporteur for his work.</p>
<p class="contents">Cohesion policy involves more than implementation of the provisions of a treaty. It is about long-term thinking and strategic action. It is also an expression of solidarity within the Union. Clearly, when considering territorial cohesion we should not adopt a simplistic approach, along the lines that everyone is entitled to everything in equal measure. We are all aware that we should be striving to achieve equality between citizens, which is quite another matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing differences between Member States and their regions mean that the Union’s cohesion policy must adopt a variety of approaches. The policy must be ongoing in nature, and have commonly agreed aims and appropriate limits in terms of time periods and areas covered. I would also like to emphasise most strongly that it must have suitable financial resources at its disposal if it is not to be meaningless. In this connection, the difficulties experienced in reaching agreement on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective give reason for concern. The delays and the real threat of a delay to the Union’s budget could have very serious consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it would be advisable to return to sound source material that is politically neutral in nature. I have in mind the Europa 2000 Plus study referred to by the rapporteur, though it does of course need updating.</p>
<p class="contents">The priorities set in the strategic guidelines published by the Commission in July are due to be endorsed by Parliament and the Council. They should then serve as a basis for genuinely cohesive preparation by the Member States of documents aimed at the future, namely the National Strategic Reference Frameworks. In general, I feel that the priorities laid down in the Commission’s document are sensible.</p>
<p class="contents">The urban aspect is worthy of mention. Mr Beaupuy referred to it just now, in connection with the role played by metropolitan centres. Other important factors are entrepreneurship and the knowledge-based economy. I would also like to say that genuine coordination of work related to the various Union documents is essential. We need more than lip service to the idea.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal concerning the relevance of potential accelerated work on the White Paper on territorial cohesion should be considered seriously. It does rather seem as if little account has been taken of the actual situation in the new Member States in the work undertaken to date.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the latest figures published concerning Union expenditure over the last year, two countries of the old Fifteen, namely Greece and Portugal, head the list of net beneficiaries with reference to GDP. The new countries lag far behind. I should add that in term of absolute sums Spain comes top. It is not my intention to criticise anyone in any way whatsoever, but simply to dispel the myth that enormous amounts of money are being handed out to the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Union cannot look to the future with optimism if it lacks a properly run cohesion policy. I would remind the House that there can be no European cohesion without European solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, the EU has no power in the field of spatial planning, yet it presumes to chart a course for this on the back of the dead Constitution. That is wrong and it shows utter contempt for the electors of Europe, not least the electors of Mr Guellec's own country, who handsomely rejected the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, territorial cohesion is clearly being advanced for the political objective of bypassing and downgrading the entity of the nation–state. It aims for territorial integration. There are obvious political and constitutional issues here, which are perhaps more obvious to me, given where I come from, than to some others. I do not want my part of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, treated instead as part of the territorial whole of the island of Ireland. That would offend and it would defy the settled political will of Northern Ireland's people. The EU must act within the constraints and parameters of that reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, within the context of cohesion funding, talk of territorial cohesion in my region is somewhat ironic, since we were excluded from cohesion funding from its inception, while our neighbour in the Irish Republic was included. The real route to cohesion was equality of access to funding, but that was denied to Northern Ireland, while the south of Ireland benefited to the tune of over EUR 2 billion for its infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, it is so much nonsense to now talk grandly about securing equality of treatment between territories. The EU had its chance to give such equality of funding to Northern Ireland for necessary infrastructure but it failed, by making national statistics instead of regional need the threshold for access. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I, of course, take a completely different view of Mr Guellec’s splendid own-initiative report from that of Mr Allister, who spoke before me, for Mr Guellec is right to emphasise territorial cohesion as one of the EU’s strategic goals in terms of the promotion of harmonious and balanced development throughout its territory. It is in this respect, as he also rightly points out, that the EU marks itself out as something more than just a free trade zone, and quite right too.</p>
<p class="contents">The eastward enlargement brought a new and significant dimension to the challenge of cohesion, as the EU had never before had to face such a marked increase in disparities. It is true to say that the new, enlarged EU is now characterised by a great deal of geographical and cultural diversity, and this is what distinguishes it from comparable major economic areas such as the USA, Japan or Mercosur.</p>
<p class="contents">As such diversity does, however, constitute one of the EU’s great growth factors, it needs to be maintained as European integration proceeds.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the policies that affect the EU’s spatial and urban structure must promote its territorial continuity, without – let me emphasise – standardising local and regional identities, as these have a vital role to play in enriching the quality of life for the public as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may express this in more precise terms, the territory that now comes into being does not abolish national, regional or local areas. On the contrary, the object of spatial planning at European level is to make the best possible use of every specificity as a source of growth. The rapporteur is right to say that the EU does not as yet possess any competence for spatial planning, for no provision is made for it in the treaties, even though it is a thorny issue for the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am persuaded that the reduction in the number of goals for the coming planning period will make the new regional cohesion policy more coherent. The new regional cohesion policy, with fewer targets to meet in the next planning period, must – and will – gain new dynamism in facing up to the challenges that await it, so that the objective of territorial cohesion, too, will be achieved, and, indeed, if need be, independently of the budget funding provided for regional and cohesion policy, which we still hope will be substantial enough to enable us to perform the tasks set us.</p>
<p class="contents">With this end in mind, we must, on the one hand, focus on the Community’s strategic guidelines for cohesion, while also taking territorial specificities into account, and, while I am on that subject, I have to say that I take a rather sceptical view of the rapporteur’s proposals, according to which, alongside GDP, new territorial criteria and indicators need to be created in order to evaluate a region’s development and the obstacles to it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have learned from previous planning periods that this is where we face the great risk of such additional criteria, when brought into play by one or other party, all too easily degenerating into a wish list that can no longer be objectively evaluated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed the case that economic, social and territorial cohesion make interconnection not only between the regional, state and European levels, but also between the Community’s various policy areas necessary. It is the regions, however, that will in future remain the appropriate territorial level for the implementation of cohesion policy, in line with the principles of subsidiarity and decentralisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with this in mind that both Parliament and the Commission have – and rightly – favoured explicit decentralisation and concentration along the lines of ‘one fund, one programme’, and so I am led to take what is actually an optimistic view of the next planning period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to congratulate Mr Guellec on the quality of his report.</p>
<p class="contents">As shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Regional Development, I tabled a number of amendments, most of which were adopted, and proposed that my political group support the report and most of the amendments tabled in the vote, both in committee and now in plenary. Despite our different perspectives and approaches, we came together in support of, firstly, the strategy proposed by the Commission for the sustainable development of the EU’s outermost regions, as regards the priorities, the instruments and, most importantly, the setting up of a specific programme to offset the additional costs relating to the specific, permanent constraints suffered by the outermost regions, such as remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few products and activities and the limited scope of local markets, and, secondly, the establishment of an action plan for the wider neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we were in favour of the strategy, we offered a number of criticisms or reservations, relating to the following areas: firstly, the absence of measures and financial resources to follow up the Commission’s statements and proposals; secondly, the use of per capita GDP as the sole criteria for these regions to qualify for the new ‘Convergence’ objective of the revamped cohesion policy; thirdly, the use of population criteria for the distribution of budgetary appropriations set out for the specific programme to compensate for additional costs; and fourthly, uncertainty over the action plan for the wider neighbourhood, given that it is unclear how this will fit in to the future ‘European territorial cooperation’ objective of the revamped cohesion policy and of the relevant ‘New Neighbourhood Policy’.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, in line with the view expressed by the rapporteur, I would suggest that the outermost regions deserve to be treated as a special case in view of their specific constraints, under Article 299(2), regarding the conditions for access to the Structural Funds, whereby priority financial support should be given to them, irrespective of their income level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also advocate an increase in budgetary appropriations relating to the specific programme to be redistributed fairly on the basis of the constraints affecting them. Furthermore, the action plan for a wider neighbourhood should be clarified within the framework of the future ‘European territorial cooperation’ objective and the Union’s new ‘Neighbourhood Policy’. The concept of neighbourhood should encompass both neighbouring regions and countries such as Morocco, Cape Verde and Brazil, and countries hosting large communities of immigrants from the outermost regions that retain strong traditional ties.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the adoption of this report, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as it represents a further step in the right direction in response to the Commission’s welcome proposal. In this way, once the financial perspective has been adopted, the conditions will be in place for the sustainable development of the outermost regions, and the successful promotion of economic, social and territorial cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the European Union’s basic aims concerns cohesion policy, especially since the latest enlargement and in view of the imminent future accession of Bulgaria and Romania. The European Parliament has distinguished itself precisely on cohesion policy during this first part of the parliamentary term, since it has approved all the regulations on regional policy for the 2007-2013 programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the constant, fruitful cooperation and dialogue with Commissioner Hübner, which I have personally experienced as rapporteur on the Cohesion Fund regulation, has led to a firm resolve on the part of the Commission and Parliament not to accept reductionist solutions. A credible and effective cohesion policy cannot, indeed, exist without adequate financial instruments, and that is why we are hoping for a prompt decision on the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary to avoid having European aid concentrated in just a few areas, thus adding to the existing disparities within a single region. Instead, measures must be adopted that are widespread, harmonious and thorough in less-developed areas, as Mr Guellec has rightly shown. I also agree with the rapporteur on the importance of towns, especially small to medium-sized ones, as motors for territorial cohesion. That is the point I tried to make by tabling amendments, which Parliament then adopted, to the regulation on the European Regional Development Fund, for which I was shadow rapporteur on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. The amendments also emphasised the pivotal role of the urban dimension in developing the immediately adjacent rural fringes.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome Mr Guellec’s proposal of using specific territorial indicators alongside the usual parameter of GDP for measuring a region’s development. I also believe that they should be used periodically to provide impact assessments on ongoing Community programmes. Among all the positive effects that such working methods would bring about, I would mention the further transfer of responsibilities to local authorities and actors, who must increasingly be seen as leading players and promoters of development, and greater flexibility at the implementation stage of measures, leading to a more appreciable effect on the territories. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like, if I may, to focus my attention on the report by Mr Guellec on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague's report has, in my opinion, one very important paragraph: I refer to paragraph 3, which states that Parliament calls for 'regional development to be founded on programmes which guarantee equality of treatment between the EU's territories, while preserving their diversity, which notably implies appropriate accessibility of services of general interest and services of general economic interest'.</p>
<p class="contents">What services of general interest are we talking about today? The services which the European Commission insists on liberalising? How will these services continue to be services of general interest and how will they help territorial cohesion? To give you a spectacular example, I am sure that you know that Greece, on the basis of Community legislation, will shortly be privatising its national airline. I wonder to what degree this will help territorial cohesion, knowing the peculiarities of the Greek state. How can a private individual replace the state as a general interest service provider? Obviously, we are proceeding with a firm step, in this instance, towards both the decline of the citizens in outermost areas who expect a service of general interest, and of the workers who risk finding themselves unemployed in the Community of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also discussing territorial cohesion here at a time when, in Brussels, the governments of the Member States can hardly even agree on the financial perspectives, with the result that the Member States will be in for a few surprises. So let us not bury our head in the sand. Territorial cohesion is desirable but on the right bases, bases which relate to social opinion, not on the basis of market pressures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Citizens of the new Member States placed great importance on this and still do. Along with economic and social cohesion, territorial cohesion has an important part to play in achieving that aim.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the differences in development across the 25 Member States that will soon become 27, actions concerning transport, tourism, environmental protection, research and innovation are particularly important. Territorial balance can be ensured by strengthening the ranks of small and medium-sized urban centres. In these areas, urban planning should provide for the development of housing stock, transport networks and the regeneration of land previously put to industrial use. This approach will allow the periphery and surrounding rural areas to benefit from the economic growth of the centres too.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, dynamic economic and urban growth is only taking place within the largest urban centres, namely the metropolitan areas. Unfortunately, the developmental needs of smaller urban units are being disregarded, so the growth is accentuating inequalities instead of reducing them. Satisfactory territorial development in all Member States of the Union can only be achieved through the implementation of a decentralised model of spatial development. One key feature of such a model is that it is based on a network of towns with different economic, social and cultural potential. Another important feature is the establishment of permanent links with rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lubelski region I come from is one of the largest in Poland. It accounts for 8% of the territory of my country and 5% of its population. There are 40 mainly small and medium-sized towns in this region, the largest being Lublin, the regional capital. The latter has a population of approximately 400 000 inhabitants, and the population of the other town varies between 20 000 and 70 000 inhabitants. Over half the population of the region lives in rural areas. If the unsatisfactory level of infrastructure is taken into account also, the Lubelski region could serve as an example of the practical implementation of territorial cohesion in a decentralised manner.</p>
<p class="contents">One can but hope that the activities of the Union’s decision-makers will result in more than mere fine words and intentions, as was the case in the past. Specific measures are needed, and provision should be made in the Union’s budget for the next few years, and also in the long-term Financial Perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the present context, however, efforts must first be directed towards having some certainty on the financial perspective, because only then will we be able to judge whether the funds available to the regions will allow for the fair distribution of resources in line with the requirements that the Commission has outlined.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, then, I welcome a greater commitment to the outermost regions and a stronger partnership for these regions, so as to enable them to escape from isolation and to make them increasingly competitive on the common market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am glad of the opportunity to place on record the deep resentment of my constituents in the East Midlands at the attempts by Brussels – aided, let it be said, by a supine British Government – to divide England by imposing artificial regions. It will divide the English nation and undermine our nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, I have news for you: it will not work because the people in, for example, Derby, in the East Midlands, have no special affinity with the people of Lincolnshire. The regions are artificial. They are spurious. They have no identity. They will not work either because the English people do not want them. They voted against in the north-east by 90% in the one opportunity they had, and they will do so elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">We English are very tolerant. We are prepared to subsidise the Welsh, the Scots and most of the nations here. We do it with resignation. We will not tolerate being robbed of our nationality and our identity. So carry on with your policy. Carry on trying to divide us, because what you will do is inflame the English and English nationalism and we will assert ourselves and we will insist on governing ourselves again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I come from one of the outermost regions, I will concentrate on Mr Marques’s report, which focuses on a stronger partnership for the outermost regions, because it makes it possible, thanks to some in-depth work, to provide a comprehensive assessment of the European Union’s activities in those regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I give my full support to the rapporteur, who, while noting that the most recent proposals drafted by the Commission in favour of the outermost regions are promising, nevertheless calls on it to be more active in exercising the right of initiative accorded to it under the Treaties, with regard to the cohesion policy, of course, but also to other Community policies and more generally to areas important for the development of the outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me to be essential to point out once again, at a time when everyone is preoccupied with the financial perspective and the reform of EU regional policy for the period 2007-2013, that the great majority of the derogations implemented or proposed for the outermost regions can in no way damage competition or the fundamental principles of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the programme to compensate for the additional costs incurred by the outermost regions, the Commission has quite rightly proposed to provide it with EUR 1 100 000 000. However, echoing one of my amendments, which was adopted in the Committee for regional development, I would stress that these funds should be devoted solely to the outermost regions and that their allocation should not penalise any of those regions.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to another of my amendments that was adopted in committee, I hope that the wider neighbourhood action plan will have a specific budget aimed at transnational and cross-border cooperation and that the much hoped-for coordination between the assistance funded by the ERDF for the outermost regions and the assistance provided by the EDF for their ACP and OCT neighbours will finally come into effect, with or without the inclusion of the EDF in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I think this is an opportune moment to state, with modesty, but without an inferiority complex, my conviction that the outermost regions of the EU are just as important as its centre. I sincerely hope that this vision is shared by all the Member States, old, new and future. Indeed, in an increasingly globalised world, there is no benefit for the enlarged Europe in doing without its outposts in the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean, Latin America or the Indian Ocean. That is the position that Parliament has always defended and will, no doubt, continue to defend. Have no doubt that the overseas populations will be particularly grateful to you for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Guellec on his excellent work and the pertinence of his comments on the concept of ‘territorial cohesion’, which seems to me to be at the heart of Community regional policy, which is now referred to more and more frequently as cohesion policy. The Constitutional Treaty makes territorial cohesion an objective of the European Union, in the same way as social cohesion and economic cohesion. Thus, even though the ratification process experienced some difficulties, as we know, this constitutes official recognition of the relevance, currency and importance of the territorial aspects of regional and cohesion policy. The latest enlargement also confirms the urgent nature of this.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, regional policy primarily aims to reduce development disparities at local and regional level and thus constitutes an indispensable counterbalance to convergence and economic competitiveness policy. However, cohesion does not stand in opposition to convergence and competitiveness: these concepts must be and remain complementary. While ensuring that the development of Europe’s most dynamic regions is not hindered, so that they can play their part as the engine of the European economy, the main aim of the cohesion policy is to help the most disadvantaged and underdeveloped regions. The reformed regional and cohesion policy must also be integrated in the Lisbon Strategy but, above all, ensure solidarity and equality between areas and the visible continuity of the efforts previously agreed to in the old Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, to achieve harmonious and sustainable development of the European territory, we must attack territorial imbalances. We must take into consideration the diversity of the European area and the often cumulative handicaps of certain areas, be they natural, historical or demographic, such as low population density or imbalances in the age pyramid or in the active population. We must measure the additional costs faced by these regions and help them so that these areas have the same development opportunities as others and so that the people who live there are not penalised.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, that requires resources and I hope that the financial perspective will soon reach a favourable outcome, so as to give the regional policy an adequate budget and to help the areas that still need it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the Ligios report on the French overseas departments, back in the second parliamentary term, laid the initial foundations for the concept of the outermost regions, a report that inspired programmes already intended to compensate for remoteness and insularity.</p>
<p class="contents">During the current period of uncertainty about what will happen after 2006, Parliament’s support for the outermost regions is very valuable. Sérgio Marques’s report is very much to the point in this regard. Indeed, although the European Union’s support has made possible a number of achievements in our underdeveloped regions, there is still much to be done. That was also the conclusion of the 11th Conference of Presidents of the Outermost Regions, which took place on the island of Réunion at the beginning of this month, in your presence, Mrs Hübner.</p>
<p class="contents">On that occasion, I advocated a reversal of approach to relations between the European Union and the outermost regions. Over and above what the European Union brings to these regions, we must recognise the worth of what they bring in terms of European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you of some obvious examples. It is the outermost regions that put Community shipping in its position as world leader. The geographic situation of Kourou in Guiana makes a significant contribution to the competitiveness differential enjoyed by the European space industry. So, there is the ocean, space, and we could also cite the exceptional biodiversity of the outermost regions, their importance for improving knowledge of climatic phenomena and their contribution to cultural diversity. The great distance from the continent in which the outermost regions are integrated and the geographic proximity of other continents with which the European Union has agreements also sometimes give rise to contradictions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that this dual identity provides a real prospect for the sustainable codevelopment of these areas, all of which face major challenges. The EU’s ability to respond to the question of the development of its outermost regions will bear witness to its ability truly to be a decisive player in fair and controlled globalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To put it bluntly, any changes in the policy on providing equality of opportunity for poorer Member States must not have a negative impact on the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Union is to demonstrate solidarity and unity in practice, it must respond to the aspirations of its new members on the basis of existing principles. At the same time, this policy must take greater account of the needs of small and medium-sized towns and regions than has been the case in the past. To date, the tendency has been for metropolitan areas to receive the lion’s share of Union funds and resources. There is some justification for this, but it has meant neglecting smaller local government structures at a lower level, even though they were in even greater need of support.</p>
<p class="contents">I fear that the proposed changes we have been hearing about this last year are aimed exclusively at extending the flow of funding to the poorer countries of the old Union. We have nothing against that, but at the same time we would like it to be possible to make use of all the existing opportunities and support for the new Member States. I have every confidence that the Commissioner will be the guardian of a Europe of equal opportunities within the Commission. I can assure her that she can always count on our support on these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, it means increasing the potential for development of the weakest and enhancing their opportunities in terms of competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is called on to react creatively to recent and future enlargements. For example, cohesion policy must be adjusted appropriately in response to new conditions and challenges. Conditions in the enlarged European Union are different. Consequently, existing actions aimed at social and economic cohesion need to be expanded, and become horizontal. More emphasis should be placed on the need to reduce the differences emerging between centres and the hinterland, between metropolitan areas and small and medium-sized towns, and between towns and rural areas. The new conditions also make it necessary for local authorities to be much more involved in efforts to do away with the disparities between all the social groups mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The democratic deficit will not be reduced without the active participation of representatives of regional and local communities in the implementation of Community programmes. I would remind the House that in January 2003 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the role of local and regional authorities in the European Union. It was laid down in this resolution that not only should local and regional authorities be more involved with the implementation of Union policies, but that they should also contribute to the drafting of such policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Extending cohesion policy to include territorial cohesion confirms that cohesion policy as implemented across the length and breadth of the Union is one of the European Union’s key policies. I should like to add that I believe Community provisions should place more emphasis on partnership. I have in mind partnership between authorities at different levels and also joint activities increasing effective use of European financial instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in July, the Committee on Regional Development adopted the own-initiative report drawn up by Mr Sérgio Marques, in response to two Commission papers on a stronger partnership for the outermost regions. The report called for support for the outermost regions and for areas that are important to their development: agriculture, fisheries, competition and state aids, enterprise policies, services of general interest and services of general economic interest, taxation, customs measures, environment, energy, research, technological development, vocational training, transport, trans-European networks, new information and communication technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to public transport that I would like to turn. Public transport is important to all our local communities, and in Scotland ferries provide an essential service for some of the European Union's most peripheral and vulnerable communities. Tomorrow I will be welcoming to the European Parliament a delegation from the CalMac trade unions, who will be meeting the transport Commissioner. As I said yesterday, presently these ferry services are being put out to tender in communities where they are the sole mode of transport connecting island communities to the mainland. Under the latest Commission proposals for land transport public service obligations, public administrations will be given flexibility over tendering processes and will be able to award certain services to in-house operators directly.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are lifeline ferries being treated differently from trains, trams and metros? There are no trains, trams and metros in Scotland's peripheral, island communities. Given the Commission's general position on the needs of the outermost regions, its position here would appear to be contradictory. I urge the Commission to clarify its position. Lifeline ferry services are too important to be ignored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Marques report offers many good proposals for strengthening the infrastructure of, for example, isolated islands or mountainous regions. Structural policy of this sort is yet another expression of European solidarity and equality of opportunity. What I particularly like about this report is the balance that it has acquired now that the unreasonable demands are gone from it. What makes the rapporteur’s concept credible is that it takes Parliament’s existing structural policy conception as its foundation.</p>
<p class="contents">Its consistency and the reasonable demands for the coming period notwithstanding, I do see danger ahead in the likelihood that, in future, far less money will be available for structural policy, and this leads me to believe that structural policy on the present models will, in a few years’ time, be obsolete, and we will need to look for new ideas as to how, with less money, to carry on supporting Europe’s regions – whether that means a policy of subsidised loans, of guarantees, or one with a greater emphasis on key infrastructures and core projects.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, we will have to give more attention to the question of how and where subsidised investment actually does attract more investment, and whether our use of investment subsidies in isolated areas might not in fact result in an ever-increasing need for support. Our eventual goal must be a policy with an overall greater emphasis on Europe’s ability to compete.</p>
<p class="contents">Much as I welcome the Marques Report as a first step towards a realistic outlook, we need to move even further away from indiscriminate ongoing subsidies and towards economic growth that maintains its own momentum. If we are to do that, the EU needs more encouragement to move in that direction, not least from those who make regional policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As an area that cuts across all areas, territorial cohesion should be mainstreamed in all EU policies, so that we do not fall into the trap of exacerbating the differences between the existing 25 Member States and those that are on their way, whom I should like to take this opportunity to greet.</p>
<p class="contents">We must break down some of the barriers faced by the outermost regions and invest in a sustainable development model that takes account of the disparities between not only Member States but also regions, even within the same Member State. The purpose is therefore to give tangible form to the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, without making the mistake of achieving efficiency and competitiveness by promoting an unequal Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that we do not use per capita GDP as the sole eligibility criteria for the Structural Funds, which is after all the classic indicator. Other indicators must be used, as a matter of priority, such as the amount of activity in research and innovation, the level of education and training, the extent of diversification of productivity in the area and the unemployment rate. Subjecting a region’s actual needs to an indicator that is often determined at national level is notoriously error-prone.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw your attention, Mr President, Commissioner, to the issue of phasing out in certain regions, 19 of them in all, which since enlargement have acquired the status of being statistically wealthier, whilst their actual economic situation has seen no improvement. This is a serious problem affecting regions such as the Algarve, in Portugal, from where I hail, one of the outermost regions in terms of the European mainland, which also suffers from deep internal disparities, quite apart from the fact that it is surrounded on all sides by Objective 1 areas. For this region, just as for all of the other 18, a balanced solution must be found whereby they remain eligible while structural problems are still apparent, and they are helped to achieve more balanced development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union needs to find a response to the challenges that enlargement has placed before us. That response must be characterised by solidarity and responsibility and requires territorial cohesion and the political courage to create the conditions whereby the EU can become a prosperous area, without discrepancies between north and south, east and west, between mountainous areas and outermost regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All its citizens have the right to education for their children, job security, a healthy life, healthcare, recreation and everything that urban residents can enjoy.

Nonetheless, it remains a dream. In particular, following the recent accession of 10 much poorer countries, the disparity between the development of individual regions has become even more marked. For example, if the British Inner London region boasting 270% of average GDP for the Union is compared with the Lubelski district in Poland whose GDP is barely 30% of average for the Union, one can appreciate how much still remains to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs a Community strategy for cohesion, and the territorial aspect should be taken into account when implementing all Community policies. All aspects of territorial cooperation should be strengthened. I refer to cooperation at cross-border level and also at inter-regional and supra-national levels. Stronger cooperation and partnership between urban centres, their periphery and rural areas is also needed.</p>
<p class="contents">In a European Union founded on solidarity, regional development must be based on programmes that ensure equal treatment for all regions. In practice, this means that the citizens should have appropriate access to public services and to services provided in the general economic interest. The House is well aware that we are nowhere near attaining that objective. Consequently, the failure to agree on a new budget for the Union and the lack of a new Financial Perspective are particularly worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">Actions aimed at achieving territorial cohesion across the Union must be improved, and Parliament must become more involved in monitoring progress towards genuine territorial cohesion. If this does not happen, disparities in the development of individual regions are bound to increase. Ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to you to help create a cohesive Europe founded on solidarity. I am sure none of us would advocate a Europe in which we were subdivided into the rich and the poor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Territorial cohesion is the basis for lasting social and economic cohesion. If we want to aim at having an area of growth, well-being, stability and justice that embraces all the 500 million inhabitants that make up the European Union today, it has to be a primary objective. If it is so difficult, however, to make more slowly developing regions progress, what will happen when events that are completely out of the ordinary strike one of these regions, events that may result from climatic factors, fires, floods or earthquakes? We have seen on our television screens what has happened on the other side of the Atlantic in highly developed areas like Louisiana or Texas. On our own doorstep we have the situation of the regions in Romania where the flooding of recent weeks has led to death and despair.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union is not there when it is needed – because in actual fact, apart from a Solidarity Fund that hardly has any money available at all, we do nothing – if Europe is not there in those cases, when does it expect to be there? What can a Europe that has not yet reached agreement on the financial perspective, a Europe in which six governments of large countries are calling for further reductions in their financial commitments, promise to those countries and those peoples who have believed in the European dream? Well, I think we need to reflect on that, because that is what our fellow citizens are expecting and that is what we are duty-bound to do for our future and for that of our children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is something we must do to achieve the most important objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, such as increased competitiveness, more jobs, a strengthening of social cohesion, togetherness and solidarity as well as securing sustainable development. Cooperation and cohesion between regions contribute to stronger integration; they create the foundation of sustainable development in each region and facilitate the universal use of best practices. They enable the regions to cooperate in various ways within the framework of regional cooperation across borders, between states or larger geographical entities.</p>
<p class="contents">Exploiting heterogeneity and the national, regional or local opportunities may increase our workload, but if we consider the task on a European scale, it promises more substantial results and larger benefits, and it is definitely worth the effort. The government must also take part in the national, regional and local cooperation. Dialogue, the exchange of opinions and a lively relationship between the three levels of nation, community and region are essential prerequisites to cooperation, as are the public and private sectors. Development strategies are built on good partnerships that involve consultation, active participation by all partners, combined efforts with the relevant authorities, social partners and the organisations of the civil society including non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional cohesion implies equal treatment of the various European regions, while not losing sight of their individual geographic and demographic characteristics. Its fundamental objective is to raise the standard of living which in turn is a precursor to the equal treatment of citizens. The economic and social convergence of the regions helps the cause of gender equality in all areas and at all levels. To get there, we have to initiate dedicated programmes and fight all forms of discrimination.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Commissioner Hübner has already said, territorial cohesion is under pressure, and she was actually asking for this Parliament’s support. There is every reason to repeat this request in this House, for when we study last week’s OECD report on the regional differences, we see that 40% of growth is realised in less than 10% of the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that competition on a world scale requires that a distinction be drawn between regions, top regions and regions of excellence, which are mentioned in the Seventh Framework Programme for research and development. Although that may be the case, knowledge is one thing, but innovation in the regions, production and marketing are quite something else. In short, specialisation within the regions is necessary. There is nothing wrong with it, but the strategic actions plans requested by Parliament and the Commission that are in line with the Lisbon objective are tailored to national scale.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now important in this Parliament to highlight once again, and safeguard, the territorial, or regional, dimension, certainly now, with a view to the future, that the new objective 2 funds and the resource and development funds will be combined, or will, at least be deployed together. That is why I support Mr Guellec’s idea of reviewing the regional contribution in 2007 in the form of a White Paper or otherwise. What will then be the state of play as regards this multi-level approach, or this decentralised focus, for that matter?</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, there are, fortunately, regions developing that often take on cross-border tasks in a new context. In my region, I have seen Eindhoven, Louvain and Aachen, located in three countries, do exactly that. So, although territorial dimension and cohesion are important, they are also being restyled. In that way, we have to help think ahead in respect of these opportunities that are vital across the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is being discussed at a time when work on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective is ongoing, and when the Council is considering cutting the resources devoted to the European Union’s regional policy. I trust the outcome of this debate will be that most of the resources the Commission proposed should be devoted to regional policy in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective will escape cuts, in particular as concerns the new Member States. I should also like to endorse the rapporteur’s view about the importance of territorial cohesion to regional development.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from the Mazowsze region. It is true that this is the richest region in Poland, as evidenced by the fact that we have the highest GDP per head of population in the country. At the same time, Mazowsze is the region with the most marked internal differences. According to estimates of GDP per head of population, it is likely that in the seven years between 2014 and 2020 Mazowsze will exceed 75% of the average GDP per head of population for the European Union, and will no longer qualify for support from the Structural Funds. Nonetheless, many parts of the region will remain characterised by a very low level of development.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken Mazowsze as an example, but the same is true of many other regions in the old and new Member States. I therefore hope that the European Union will devise additional instruments for use in such situations, and that territorial cohesion will become an important aspect of the Union’s future regional policy.</p>

Commissioner Hübner’s presence in this debate is very important for all of us and I would, of course, like to acknowledge the work of the two rapporteurs, Mr Guellec and Mr Marques.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the two reports demonstrate a European reality which is very different to that of other territorial political entities and models. It would say that the European Union is characterised by a lack of territorial continuity. We are essentially a small peninsula off the great continent of Eurasia, with a very distant peninsular and island presence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very different, for example, to the great North American quadrilateral, which is enormously consistent, and it has great territorial diversity, which makes it very difficult to remain competitive compared to other similar territorial entities. Recognition of this regional reality and these regional policies is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a representative of an island region, an outermost region, very distant from the centre of Europe, but, as Mr Vergès said earlier, this type of region presents a different reality and aspect, since they take Europe out into the great oceans, the Atlantic, the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean, in a different manner. But it would be impossible to try to redirect the whole of this population – we are talking, for example, in the case of the outermost regions, about 4 million inhabitants, who face difficulties competing in the Union’s great internal market — solely by means of economic protection measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals it has made and, of course, express my support for the proposals of our rapporteur, Mr Marques, on the development of these regions within the context of a great European Union cohesion policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What emerges from these reports is that the stakeholders share a view of an ideal Europe that sees the priority of cultural diversity in their regions as the most important element of the EU’s development model. Regional policy is therefore a separate initiative and must not simply be subject to replicating the implementation of national policy at national and European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional policy is an area of concepts, policy measures and action, which takes the relevant parts of national policy and adapts it to its own objectives and strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional policy in the EU has always been seen as something of a focal point, given public policy does need to intervene; after all, not everything is resolved merely by means of a functioning market, as some would still have you believe. Regional policy is the strongest way of ensuring territorial cohesion. Consequently, if the resources at its disposal become weakened, selfish interests will prevail and solidarity will be the loser, and without solidarity the feeling of belonging, the key element characterising European identity, will not be able to flourish.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore add my voice to the calls for the Commission to draw up a White Paper on this objective of territorial cohesion and to create a system of gauging the impact of Community policy on territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">This has become even more of a priority, in my view, owing to the impact of the phenomenon of globalisation, given that some EU regions will be successful and others will lose out. In these new circumstances, regional policy requires a new driving force and for this reason I wish to commend the Commission for stepping up the integration of territorial issues into existing Community policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Community policies have presented many challenges to the outermost regions. There have been welcome developments in some of these, such as restrictions placed on free access to the waters off the Azores, but also cases of incomprehensible backtracking on others.</p>
<p class="contents">An example of the latter is the proposals to amend the specific supply arrangements proposed by the Commission, which, if implemented one day, would lead to total economic paralysis in the Azores.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opposed to the ban on shipment of the only product covered by the ‘contradictory’ specific shipping arrangements, along with new arrangements designed to ban the shipment of any product containing goods covered by these supply arrangements, in breach of international and Community law governing rules of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The setting of insignificant quotas as regards quantities and products solely destined for exotic destinations such as Morocco, which has no traditional business links with the Azores, at the same time as a ban on shipments to traditional markets such as the Portuguese mainland, the United States and Canada, would be a sick joke if it did not feature, in black and white, in one of the Commission’s regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedures put forward by the Commission are, in any event, out of step with the structure of the internal market, impossible for small businesses with simplified tax arrangements to put into practice, deeply discriminatory and of an unprecedented administrative complexity.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission’s statement that he accepts decisions made by the national European justice system to reject precautionary measures to stop shipments from the Azores is a very welcome sign. It is now crucial that, in the same way, all remaining legal provisions proposed are carefully reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore appeal for common sense to prevail, so as to ensure that the interests of a European cartel are not confused with the general interest and that a root and branch review can take place of the Commission’s legislative proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support both reports as they are well written and cover the most important points.</p>
<p class="contents">My first remark is that I like the way in which the reports focus on one fund and one programme, as this streamlines the way in which we conduct our business and makes it more effective and less complex. That is a very welcome approach from both rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark concerns the territorial indicators. Coming from Finland, I think it very important that we do not just focus on GDP but broaden our view and look at how difficult it is to get to a place. I welcome the rapporteurs' proposals on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">My third remark is that I am disappointed there is no mention of the northern sparsely populated regions in the reports. I urge anyone who has not been to Lapland to go and see what a real outermost region looks like. This was mentioned in Article 218 of the Constitution, and it is unfortunate that it is not going to be adopted on time.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth remark concerns the agencies. Agencies and the decentralisation of agencies are part of regionalisation. I do not mind that the Food Agency went to Parma – I can live with a Chemicals Agency – but we must be rational. As part of a rational regional policy we should look at where the seat of the European Parliament should be. I am not sure that it is good regional policy to fly or take the train to Strasbourg once a month.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to congratulate the rapporteurs for including competitiveness and Lisbon in the reports. All in all, I support them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The basic point I would like to make about the report is that you cannot have ‘more Europe’ for less money, and so it is, to say the least, desirable that we should come to a speedy and realistic agreement on the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The report itself, as is only right and proper, makes demands for an increase in economic and social cohesion in line with territorial cohesion, so that every citizen of the EU will be able to rely on the best possible state and political structures in making a success or his or her own life. What can the EU do about this? For a start, it must establish a framework for the balanced economic, social and territorial development of the geographical area of the Community as a whole. Secondly the EU’s sectoral policies must therefore acquire this new territorial component and with it added European value. Thirdly, the Community’s diversity needs to be promoted, with the various regions supported in their specific interests, strengths and weaknesses for the sake of a polycentric regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is through such an all-embracing approach by EU policies, enhanced by the territorial component and with subsidiarity maintained, that we will be able to move the EU a significant step further down the road towards becoming a Union of all citizens. Particular attention needs to be given to disadvantaged regions such as rural mountainous areas, for which suitable indicators will have to be devised if we are to have a better picture of what their actual disadvantages are, for which existing models and calculation methods, such as, for example, per capita GDP, are not sufficient. There must also be a greater emphasis on the simplicity and practicability of Community policy if its effective implementation and application in every EU region is to be guaranteed. This is one instance where the ‘less is more’ principle is particularly applicable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Particular attention needs to be paid to the 9 400 000 inhabitants of the 284 islands of the European Union: 3% of the total population living in an area of 95 000 km2. Economic development in these areas is affected by their isolation and the additional costs that that causes. In many cases, these islands are mountainous and they are also less-developed outermost regions. Their average per capita GDP in 2004 was 72% of the EU average and in most cases lower than that of any other area in their respective countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be pointed out, however, that those logistic difficulties do not necessarily equate to unfavourable economic circumstances. Such handicaps should potentially, in fact, be turned into advantages, opening the door to new development opportunities. These islands are part of our Union’s natural heritage and are particularly suitable for many kinds of activity, such as tourism, cultural and leisure pursuits.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst other things, with the development of a knowledge-based economy – a major Community policy objective – it is no longer closeness to raw materials or to major markets that leads people to choose where to live, but rather the natural beauty and amenities of the surrounding area. In that respect, the availability of infrastructure and essential facilities become decisive factors.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, after introducing the ‘one fund per programme’ principle in the financial perspective for 2007-2013, we need to promote the territorial cohesion policy as an instrument that adds an essential resource, as these two reports have rightly done, and include it among the priority aims of the European Union’s cohesion policy in its broader sense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Guellec's report, I have taken note of the strong support in this House for the recommendations it puts forward: to consider territorial cohesion as a major element in the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies; to give a boost to all dimensions of territorial cooperation; and to place greater emphasis on cooperation between urban centres, suburban areas and the countryside, particularly those with specific disadvantages, so as to contribute to the development of sustainable communities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that we share many ideas. Let me respond to those few ideas on which I think we might have difficulty in finding a solution. First, with regard to the adoption of new territorial indicators, alongside GDP, to measure the development of regions and evaluate obstacles, I would remind you that there are no standardised and generally-accepted indicators in the field of territorial cohesion and, as you know, any new indicator needs to be accepted by Eurostat. There are currently only a small number of indicators available at regional level that have been harmonized: GDP, employment, unemployment and population data. Secondly, I agree that more work needs to be done in this area, but we must be realistic at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of establishing a system for assessing the impact of the various Community policies on territorial cohesion within the Union, it is true that current impact assessment does not take into account territorial cohesion issues. I agree that this question deserves further examination. I have taken note of your proposal to develop such a system through Espon and I will ask my services to analyse this. We will also discuss it with the Member States, which, as you know, cofinance this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">On your suggestion that a White Paper on territorial cohesion be drawn up by 2007, indicating in particular how this objective is to be incorporated in the national strategic plan of each Member State, you may remember that I raised the possibility of preparing a White Paper in order to promote territorial cohesion on the European agenda in the perspective of a ratified Constitution. That was done in Luxembourg in May.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that in the strategic guidelines we asked Member States to pay particular attention to territorial issues when preparing their national development plans. These are already being drawn up and so, while I agree strongly with the added value that the White Paper would bring, we cannot wait for it in order to incorporate this dimension into the national strategic plans.</p>
<p class="contents">On Mr Margues' report, I have also noted a number of concerns and recommendations and I would like to respond to as many of them as I can in the time available to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the wider neighbourhood action plan, I fully agree that we have to strengthen the economic, social and cultural links between the outermost regions and their non-member neighbours. We have to take this forward on two fronts: first, trade and customs measures that would allow for the integration of markets in goods and services, as well as in trade-related fields; and second, the preferential agreements with non-Member countries. This mainly concerns the ACP countries through the European partnership agreements. These new agreements are to enter into effect as of January 2008. We are currently in the process of negotiations, but we are also examining the needs and interests of those regions, together with the Member States concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I share your view that economic integration needs to be supported by exchanges of a social and cultural nature and cooperation in fields such as new technologies, health measures, combating illegal immigration and measures on the environment and risk prevention. I can also tell you that my services are currently exploring ways in which the Community financial instruments – not only the ERDF, but also the European Development Fund – can be used to strengthen the wider neighbourhood policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to agriculture and fishing, some of your recommendations are already part of our legislative proposals, as some of you must know. On the reform of the organisation of the sugar market, the Commission's proposal takes account of the specific problems of the outermost regions. The Commission is convinced that the sugar sector in the outermost regions is expanding, also in the context of its contribution to energy security.</p>
<p class="contents">On the new agricultural fund, here, as you know, we have proposed maximum co-financing rates that are higher for the outermost regions, while the intervention areas have also been extended.</p>
<p class="contents">On bananas, you know how difficult the negotiations are for us, but I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to protect the interests of Community producers.</p>
<p class="contents">On fisheries, at the Council meeting of 21 June, the Commission declared that specific treatment was needed for this sector in the outermost regions. We have launched a study into this and will carefully examine the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On competitiveness, your recommendations concerning the competitiveness of regions and the attention to be devoted to the development of human capital constitute the centrepiece of the draft Community strategic guidelines for the next generation of cohesion programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of research, we have introduced specific measures for the outermost regions in the draft seventh framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to state aid, the latest proposal for the rules on national regional aid contains a number of positive measures in favour of the outermost regions. Those regions will be considered within the scope of Article 87(3)(a). They will also benefit from increased aid ceilings and will be able to authorise operating aid.</p>
<p class="contents">My door is always open to those who need further detailed information. I believe that, at a time when so many proposals affect the situation of the outermost regions or regions in general, constant cooperation and communication are a must for all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
