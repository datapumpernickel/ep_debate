Russia is our neighbour, it is about to join the WTO, it is a major energy supplier to the EU. All these are reason enough to draw up a report on the subject and get to the heart of the matter: where do we stand and where do we want to go?</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I should like to emphasise a few points in particular. Firstly, it cannot be said that democracy, human rights, the rule of law or the freedom of the press in Russia have made progress in recent times. I had initially thought it would be possible to write a report that was more oriented towards practical politics; but we in the committee found – and I thank my colleagues for their support – that we did have to analyse some things critically. Russia is a member of the Council of Europe and, as such, has subscribed to a good many things and, in particular, promised to ensure democratic conditions. I believe that the country needs reminding of these commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">EU–Russia relations are currently in a difficult phase, as recent events have demonstrated time after time. I should like to quote Commissioner Mandelson, who said that the psychological legacy of the fall of the Soviet Union and the associated loss of superpower status were a great burden. What we celebrated as the triumph of freedom was seen differently in Russia. Russia’s political leadership has yet to learn how to deal properly with recent history. At the same time, however, it is true that the EU and Russia are dependent on each other. We need Russian gas and oil and, in turn, Russia’s economy depends largely on its energy exports. In addition, the Russian economy is in urgent need of foreign direct investment to enable its continued growth in future. The EU is by far its largest customer, and is also the main source of foreign direct investment in Russia. As such, we can expect our trade relations with this large country to be governed by the rule of law, reliability and predictability.</p>
<p class="contents">How should the EU act in this situation? It is very important that the European Union adopt a common line and speak with one voice. If it agrees something with one of our Member States or fails to keep to an agreement, Russia is acting illegally towards the whole European Union. We cannot close our eyes to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for my second point: Russia must create a better investment climate for European enterprises – not by changing its laws, but by better applying and, in particular, better enforcing these laws. The Russian legislation on intellectual property must be harmonised with international agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">One important point in our relations with Russia is the Energy Charter. Russia has signed it, but does not feel bound by it; which is regrettable. Without abandoning the Energy Charter, the EU should attempt to anchor the important elements of the Charter in the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. It is to be hoped that the negotiations on this agreement will start shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Russia’s WTO membership, we realise that it is also in the interests of the EU that Russia become a member. This would mean Russia’s being subject to a whole sheaf of international obligations; which, in turn, would help make Russia a fully committed economic and trading partner rather than one that is able to cherry-pick. We should not accept this at all costs, however. In short, in spite of the dark side, we can look ahead to the future with optimism and confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also want to thank the rapporteur for the excellent cooperation with the Commission when drafting this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few years, Russia has seen impressive economic development. This is partly due to high energy prices, but also, to a large degree, to a sound macroeconomic policy. Russia is becoming a more and more important economic player in the world. Growth of the Russian economy has averaged 6-7% since 1999; Russia has a considerable budget surplus, is an important destination for foreign direct investments and holds the third largest amount of foreign currency reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget how important Russia is for the EU, and how important the EU is for Russia. In economic terms, the picture is quite clear: we are by far Russia’s most important trading partner and, in turn, Russia is our third most important partner. The EU is by far the most important investor in Russia. In short, we need each other and we need to work closely with each other; this is in our mutual interest.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is also clear that some problems exist. There are questions about specific issues concerning the business climate, for example the continued high levels of corruption. But there is also a range of specific issues, such as the ban on imports of agricultural products from Poland, the oil supplies to Lithuania via the Druzhba pipeline and the planned increases in export duties for wood. However, despite all these challenges, we should not forget that we also need to look at the overall situation and the very substantial opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report is thus very timely. It provides a comprehensive overview of the issues at stake in EU-Russia relations. Allow me to focus on four points concerning our economic relations that you also highlighted in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">First, you rightly insist on the importance of the rule of law. This is not only important for the economic operators that want to invest in Russia: it is also indispensable for the long-term economic and political development of Russia itself. What is really needed – and this is not specific for Russia – is sound and effective application of laws and rules, and a fully independent judiciary. Only this will guarantee a predictable and stable economic environment. Rules are the key to attracting investment. But we also need rules for other areas, such as intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the basis for our future cooperation. First of all, there is WTO membership, which is not an abstract aim in itself. WTO membership is the indispensable building block for successful and sustainable economic development. The Commission is working hard with Russia to achieve this as soon as possible, but we still need solutions for the outstanding issues. We also need to work towards launching negotiations on a new EU-Russia framework agreement to update the current Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. We should also consider a further deepening and strengthening of our bilateral trade and economic relations once Russia has acceded to the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would like to thank Parliament for its support concerning the latest developments on Siberian overflight payments. The fact that we had a clear position and maintained unity on this issue led to a good result. The signature of the agreement – which has so far only been initialled – is one of our priorities. This issue needs to be resolved before Russia’s WTO accession. President Barroso made this point quite clear at the recent EU-Russia summit in May. On that occasion, the Russian Government confirmed its intention to sign the agreement in the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns energy. You rightly say in your report that the primary objective of EU energy policy cannot simply be to avoid continued energy dependence on Russia. We need fair rules, not politics – rules for predictability and certainty on both sides. The call for security of supply implies security of demand. Our aim should be to promote two-way investment by energy providers and consumers, upstream and downstream. In this context we also need to agree on clear, enforceable standards for energy transit, as well as other aims.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, allow me a comment on the area I am responsible for: competition. Over the past few years, the Commission has established close cooperation with the Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly service. I believe we need to further strengthen this dialogue to identify areas where we can work more closely together and build on increasing convergence between our systems. Competition law is an essential feature of good economic governance. The new law adopted last October has given Russian competition policy the means to be really effective. Therefore, we will continue to work with the Russian competition authority in the context of the Common Economic Space and future bilateral agreements with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, allow me once again to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent and balanced report, which the Commission will certainly take into account in our ongoing and future cooperation with Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share the rapporteur’s concerns, but I also appreciate the Commissioner’s pragmatism, because it is indeed the case that economic relations between the EU and Russia are blossoming. As already stated, the EU is Russia’s most important trading partner and this trade continues to grow, just as investments continue to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">Last weekend, a lot of good work was done during the economic forum in St Petersburg, and according to the reports, there was little evidence of the frosty atmosphere which prevailed during the EU-Russia Summit in May. We cannot see politics and economics in isolation from one another just like that, and on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I have focused on the political dimension of the trade relations and economic relations between the European Union and Russia. In doing so, I wanted to stress the political significance of economic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The economy has a bearing on political relations, and stronger economic ties can, in my view, contribute to the mutual atmosphere in which tricky political issues can easily be resolved. This does not happen of its own accord, though, as neatly epitomised, most of all, by the energy issue. It is, on the one hand, one of the most important pillars of the special political ties between the European Union and Russia, but at the same time, the current frictions indicate that agreements must be struck as a matter of priority.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we endorse Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation, which should contribute greatly to the transparency of Russian market rules and considerably improve the investment climate. At the same time, it should subject Russia to a number of rules that apply worldwide and thus reduce the risk of trade policy being used as a weapon. The Russians themselves realise only too well that they stand to benefit from good trade relations with the European Union. Economic relations very much underpin mutual political relations, and the growth potential is enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">This will also help Russia realise that it will have to find common ground within Europe, not least politically speaking. Not only in terms of trade, but also where human rights, democracy and dormant conflicts with common neighbours are concerned. It is absolutely vital that the right balance be struck here. The EU must enshrine these agreements in an improved agreement which is to supersede the present Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. This once again exemplifies the close relationship between the economy and politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the negotiations have run aground on account of a trade conflict which translates politically as a conflict between the European Union and Russia. In short, we are in favour of a pragmatic approach, but the political dimension cannot be seen in isolation from the economic dimension, even where trade relations are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Commission is very much to be encouraged to negotiate with Russia with a view to concluding a regional free-trade agreement in line with WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Parliament is up in arms about Russia’s failure to ratify the Energy Charter or the transit protocol, yet Norway has not ratified these instruments either, so they will not enter into effect, and hence the relevance of a new strategic partnership agreement with Russia, on which, however, Poland, under the Kaczynski brothers, is standing in the EU’s way, something that is made all the more unacceptable by the fact that the need for a common energy policy is becoming more obvious from one day to the next. Because of the Polish veto, the EU risks missing a good opportunity to embark on negotiations that might produce results to the benefit of both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe will become more dependent on Russian gas and oil, while the Russians, for their part, are in need of solvent customers since they will not be able to pipe their gas to Asia until 2012, when the Asian gas pipeline currently under construction is likely to be put into service. Moreover, half of Russia’s budget is dependent on earnings from the energy sector. Finally, Russia is in enormous need of investments in its energy sector in order to meet increasing demand.</p>
<p class="contents">All the conditions for a balanced agreement are therefore in place, but it is the Polish Government that is preventing any further progress in this matter, and this state of affairs will prompt the various Member States of the EU to sign more bilateral agreements with Russia, with both the EU itself and Poland losing out in equal measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the rapporteur already mentioned, Russia is one of our key trading partners, and she has the figures to prove it. There is, however, still a great deal of potential in our relations with Russia. In fact, if one considers the trade relations, there is a paradox: bilaterally, a number of Member States have good relations, but EU-Russia relations need to improve. Both partners should play a role in this, in fact. Accordingly, the Member States should find a common response to the challenges. This is why, Madam President, the negotiations about a fresh partnership agreement should start at the earliest opportunity. A fresh Treaty that is underpinned by the experience of the past decade and that also allows for a fresh dialogue to be held in the next few years. There are a number of important elements that should be included in this: reciprocity and transparency. This is what President Putin had to say at the economic forum in St. Petersburg two weeks ago: </p>
<p class="contents">‘Economic partners can feel a sense of security only when they have reliable and predictable relations.’ </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> This is all well and good, but our entrepreneurs also want the security of being able to do business in a clear and legal framework. We need an improved investment climate which boasts transparent business conditions and where intellectual property rights are guaranteed. I therefore look forward with a great deal of interest to the fresh foreign investment act, and the Commissioner may be in a position to say something about this.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, improved economic cooperation can also contribute to economic development that is diversified more effectively in Russia itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the subject of the WTO, I welcome this. This is the only way of tackling counterfeiting.</p>
<p class="contents">As everything has already been said about energy, I will not say any more on this subject. Madam President, I should only like to express my appreciation to Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl who, along with her colleagues, has done an excellent job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This really is an integrated, balanced and fundamentally realistic report, because it maps the present level of relations between the European Union and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">No one can dispute the specific strategic weight of Euro-Russian relations and the need for them to be developed and deepened. Circumstances dictate that Russia should be promoted to the position of a strategic partner of Europe. It is not simply the statistics on economic and trade relations that force us to move in this direction. Nor is it simply the fact that Russia has large stocks of energy resources. It is, above all, the very history and geography of the European continent which, even under present circumstances, impose the need for new, integrated and balanced strategic relations between Europe and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">These relations must be based on mutual respect and mutual benefit. Euro-Russian relations must look towards the future, towards the joint challenges we have to address and towards the joint potential we can exploit in order to achieve security, stability, development and prosperity for our people and cooperation in resolving serious global and regional problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, we need to overcome the historic past of confrontation and mutual suspicion. We have a common need to work to establish a new climate of mutual trust. I point this out because clouds of mistrust, tension and crisis in our bilateral relations have already started to gather. No one has any interest in a new confrontation, in a new cold war, and this applies to both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs to formulate a common strategic perception of Russia in all sectors of cooperation, to speak with a united voice and to express its solidarity collectively towards each Member State. However, it is in the energy sector that there is an urgent need to formulate a common European policy. I believe that only under this precondition can the European Union strengthen its negotiating power and prevent the energy dependency of individual Member States and the exploitation of energy resources as a political weapon by the Russian side.</p>
<p class="contents">Important achievements have been made in relations between the European Union and Russia over recent years. Of course they were helped – and we should recognise this – by the far-reaching reforms and a new stable macroeconomic environment in Russia under the leadership of President Putin.</p>
<p class="contents">One strategic priority must be to immediately start negotiations on a new strategic partnership and cooperation agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU exports 7.3% of its goods to Russia, while Russia exports 53% of its goods to the EU. It might appear that Russia is fairly dependant on the EU. However, 65% of the EU imports from Russia are energy-related. Some countries import 100% of their natural gas from Russia. In reality, the EU is dependant on Russian exports and its energy policy at a global, EU and domestic level.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia uses energy policy as a political tool, attempting to dictate its political conditions to former Soviet republics and EU Member States, particularly the Baltic States. For almost a year now a decision has not been made on repairing the <span class="italic">Druzhba</span> oil pipeline, which used to carry oil to Lithuania.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia is fragmenting the solidarity of EU Member States by offering bilateral energy supply projects which may be exploited for political purposes with sad consequences for common EU energy policy. I am referring to <span class="italic">Nord Stream</span>, the German-Russian project, which will make Germany directly dependant on Russian political interests and <span class="italic">Blue Stream</span>, which is envisaged to replace the EU-planned <span class="italic">Nabucco</span> project.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are considering the ideas put forward in the report, that the basic aim of EU energy policy cannot merely be the avoidance of energy dependency on Russia. I wish to stress that this should be the main means which would enable us to achieve one of the most important goals of the EU Common Energy Policy – energy security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is therefore to be commended for demanding that in talks on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement any retreat from the standards and requirements of the European Union’s values must not be allowed. Russia must understand and must provide transparent and predictable business conditions that are based on rigorous democratic values and trustworthiness. Without such requirements there is little hope that Russia will cease its discrimination against the Baltic States and other states in the region in the sphere of rail or timber export tariffs or in the restriction on exports of fish, meat and dairy products.

<p class="contents">The solution, in my view, is as follows. The EU should, as a matter of principle, return to practical discussions not only on energy but also on other issues concerning economic relations with Russia, without prejudice and without any psychological baggage on the part of our leaders, in particular those of the new Member States. Russia is today economically stronger thanks in part to oil prices and therefore more assertive when it comes to its own interests, which is understandable. It is also worth pointing out that Russia is in an election campaign. It is taking many steps in other places with an eye to how they will be received at home. Nevertheless, not even Russia is free of the need to adopt a certain measure of arrogance in negotiations. Provided that both sides understand a number of other factors, such as the increasing economic strength and energy needs of China or India, there is still hope that we will be able to work together properly.

The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia is virtually on ice. There are difficult relations between certain Member States and Russia. It is totally unclear what the outcome of the WTO negotiations will be. In this regard, too, there is frustration on many counts. The Free Trade Agreement that should be concluded after Russia’s accession to the WTO is a project that we have been envisaging for a long time but has been put off time and again.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wiersma and also Mrs Oomen-Ruijten raised an important point, and that is that we are in a strange situation. On the one hand, we are achieving economic integration and are sensing in the Russians an intensity and indeed a willingness to adopt Western standards in the field of investments and production facilities. On the other hand, in the political sphere, something is discernible on the part of Russia that could be described as either uncertainty or a craving for status.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good to retain a healthy pragmatism, as Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl has done in her report, and to say that we need and want these relations. Russia is our neighbour, it is an important political power, and it will continue to be an important political power in future. We also need it for the internal stability of the European region as a whole. Let us develop sound economic relations, therefore, including in the field of energy cooperation. I believe that this is the right course to take.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we need something more, too, Commissioner, so that there is not always the risk of Russia’s using economic policy as a political weapon. We should develop sound mechanisms to foster genuine dialogue. These are finely tuned in relation to many other countries, in some cases very finely tuned, but in the case of Russia we are still at square one. Dialogue between our respective business communities, SMEs, political cooperation, civil society – all this is necessary for the development of a reliable democracy that does not fear that every conflict situation will immediately turn into a dispute. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a problem faced by all the EU Member States, as we can see in the case of flights over Siberia. In spite of promises recently made by Russia, European airlines using Russian airspace still have to pay a special fee, which has nothing to do with the normal price paid for air traffic control services. This is a transit charge that is contrary to universally accepted practice, and contravenes international law.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of Polish meat is similar. This meat meets all European Union standards but is not allowed onto the Russian market for reasons that have nothing to do with the market economy. Russian consumers are denied access to Georgian water or wine from Moldova for the same reasons. This behaviour is as cynical as the Gary Kasparov case. Mr Kasparov was arrested at the airport on his way to a protest which took place during the summit in Samar. He was detained long enough to be unable to reach his destination although, officially speaking, he had not been detained at all. That is how the Russian Federation authorities operate. Everything appears to be fine on the surface. However, appearances can be deceptive. Europe would do well to remember this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For a huge part of Russia too is Europe. Russia is the neighbour of many Member States of the EU and our partner, therefore, in many areas, not just energy. I would like to bring your attention to the fact that the Russian economy is not just about energy. Only a third of its economic growth in the last few years is based on energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Russia is about to expire. Just as 26 Member States are keen to develop economic and commercial relations with Russia, one country, Poland, is obstructing the process. We have to ask whether the critical trade problem it has would not be resolved in a more organised way through negotiation rather than by preventing the start of joint talks. Poland is preventing the EU from speaking with one voice. As someone representing a country which shares a border with Russia, I have to say that we can in fact take care of matters more successfully bilaterally rather than speaking with one voice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Russia is the great power situated closest to the EU. If Russia were again to become a threat to peace and democracy, that would be devastating for Europe’s future.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we have to work to promote increased trade with Russia and why we must make efforts to bring Russia into the World Trade Organisation. We must also send out the correct signals, however. Russia has recently suspended deliveries of coal and oil to Estonia. The aim was to force Estonia to yield to Moscow on an issue of domestic politics. The EU reacted feebly. Russian oil and gas for large EU countries were more important.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Erst kommt das Fressen, dann kommt die Moral’ [‘Gorge ourselves first – morality later’] was the message. The EU did not make it clear enough that Estonia is an EU country and that the Russian measures were therefore directed against the whole of the EU - a state of affairs that is unacceptable to the EU.

<p class="contents">In the debate concerning economic relations with Russia, there appear to be two opposing extremes. On the one hand there are those who see Russia’s growth into a great economic power as a threat and who want to prevent this and make us independent of Russia. On the other hand, there are those who want to trade with Russia, at whatever price, and who are prepared to do anything to ingratiate themselves with the leaders in Moscow and to secure their own access to Russia’s natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not support any of these perspectives. We have a lot to gain from increased trade with Russia and increased economic integration. Russia has still more to gain, however. It is not only the economy with which we are concerned here. The fact is that trade brings us closer to each other and strengthens democracy and the rule of law in the countries concerned. In that way we would be establishing Russia firmly within the European community of interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also make demands of Russia, however. We must demand that it respect democracy, the market economy and the rule of law. Too many people today appear to believe that Russia is fated to reject universal principles and they blindly accept that Russia is violating those principles. They are wrong to do so, however. To prostrate ourselves in the face of Russian pressure or provocation would lead nowhere. It would purely and simply weaken the forces for good in the country. If, on the other hand, we act together and form a united front in the EU, we shall make them listen. The fact is, they have to listen. Certainly, Russia is an important trading partner of ours, but what a lot of people forget is that we are a still more important trading partner for them.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also demand that Russia become a member of the World Trade Organisation. It is important to bring Russia into the WTO, whereupon it would be integrated into rule-based world trade. However, we must ensure that they intend not only to be members, but to comply with the rules. The situation must not be like that in, for example, the Council of Europe, of which they became members only then not to concern themselves with human rights. That is a situation we cannot afford. The WTO cannot afford to have Russia act in that way.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the European Energy Charter is relevant in this connection. I should like to go further into this subject on another occasion. It is one on which the EU must show a united front and force Russia to listen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the other hand, economic relations between Russia and numerous EU Member States are increasingly important when it comes to energy, on which there need to be stable agreements and of which there needs to be a properly negotiated supply. There must also be negotiations to reach clear solutions on Russian investment in the EU. Companies from the Member States are making serious inroads into the sources of Russian energy supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">EU support for better balanced relations with Russia must be maintained. This must encompass not only external trade but also recasting European cooperation programmes such as the TACIS programme (technical assistance to CIS countries). Russia has financial, economic and human resources. Without wishing to preach to our partner from the East, which does not have extensive experience of political pluralism, strengthening trade with Russia can play a very positive role.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us makes a significant contribution to the debate on business and economic relations with Russia. We know that strengthening these relations will foster better mutual knowledge and can help break down social and regional inequality, especially when those relations are accompanied by frank and far-reaching dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that accession to the WTO will lead to deeper economic integration between the EU and Russia. It is also necessary to foster a climate that is conducive to investment in Russia and to encourage the Russian Federation to ensure that their workers enjoy decent working conditions and trade union rights. Furthermore, it is necessary, of course, not only to support, but also to contribute towards, improvements to Russian law, in order to ensure that the law on protecting intellectual, commercial and industrial property rights is enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by saying that all contact with Russia can and must contribute, too, towards freedom of movement and expression and towards respect for national minorities throughout the Federation. Good friends do good business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Food and Veterinary Office has decided, after numerous tests, that Polish meat complies with health and safety standards. During my visit to Ireland, I consulted the inspectors myself. In view of this, it is scandalous that the Russian Government is publicly lying and stating that the tests produced different results.

Where politics and government, or the state, come into play as actors, there is a danger of the economy being used as a means to achieve political, or even military ends.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, for the first time, Russia may have sufficient financial resources to significantly increase its citizens’ income and improve their standard of living. However, will it use the profits from its minerals trade for this purpose or will it use them to attain military, or other goals instead? We have no idea. Every so often, President Putin surprises Europe with forceful statements, which make Western leaders tremble. We also have no idea how the Russian people will react to national assets being placed in the hands of a small group of advisors. We have to admit that it is very difficult to cooperate with an unpredictable partner.</p>
<p class="contents">What should we do in this situation? I think that we need to assure Russia that we want it to be a peaceful, economic and political partner and that we wish the Russian people a happy life, the quality of which meets European standards. However, in addition to this, we also have to ensure that Russia treats the European Union, and each of its members, as a friendly partner. However, it needs to know that this partner, namely the European Union, is also decisive and cohesive.</p>
<p class="contents">Any partiality within the Union will tempt Russia to use a selective economic strategy, which is damaging to cooperation and to the cohesion of the Union. Godelieve Quisthoudt-Rowohl’s report should send a signal to Russia that we follow healthy economic principles, that we respect our partners and expect the same in return. Only this kind of cooperation can help to increase citizens’ economic standards. Finally, I would like to say that if this criterion is not met, cooperation will not be possible. Instead, tensions will reappear. I hope that both sides understand this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Важният раздел за енергетиката следва да бъде разглеждан и като подкрепа на отделни споразумения на страни-членки на Европейския съюз с Русия, какъвто е случаят с петролопровода Бургас-Александруполис, който ще транспортира енергийни суровини. В този проект се включват две страни-членки на Европейския съюз, България и Гърция. Той е от изключителен интерес за страните, които са го подписали, но и за Европейския съюз като цяло. По тази причина проектът трябва да получи подкрепата на съюза. Много е важно, обаче, да се подчертае, че и Русия, и Европейският съюз трябва да направят сериозна оценка на въздействието на проекта върху околната среда и да вложат инвестиции в технологии за опазването й, тъй като петролопроводът преминава през чувствителната в това отношение Черноморска зона. Проектът ще носи икономически растеж за региона, но в никакъв случай не трябва да затваря други сектори, като например туризма, в зоната на Бургаския залив, през който ще се осъществява прехвърлянето на суровината. Трябва сериозно да се прецизира и трасето на петролопровода, да бъдат защитени пластове от културно-историческо наследство. Това ще повиши неговата обща сигурност.</p>
<p class="contents">Подкрепата на Европейския съюз ще бъде гаранция за неговата перспектива с оглед устойчивото развитие на региона. Черноморската зона се явява изключително интересна за развитието на други отношения с Русия, каквито са икономическите зони. Това са инвестиции, в които ще се допринесе за голям икономически растеж, особено инвестициите в търговия и производствен капацитет. Сътрудничеството с Европейския съюз и Русия трябва да премине и през партньорство в създаването и прилагането на нови технологии, нови материали, които са от изключителен интерес и за двете страни.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, in relations with Russia we are constantly faced with the situation where fish products from the Baltic or meat from Poland becomes very unhealthy for the Russian public, which has a very healthy lifestyle. The same applies to oil pipelines — the technical conditions of these always deteriorate very rapidly in those situations when there is a change in ownership of oil processing businesses in the Baltic States. Rail tariff policy, for its part, has for many years now been making shipments of freight to ports in the Baltic Sea States up to 2.7 times more expensive than shipments to Russian ports. For that reason I believe that, in the WTO context, it is enormously important to achieve a situation whereby no type of discrimination whatsoever is permitted in trade relations between Russia and any European Union Member State, and particularly in those European Union Member States which Russia continues to regard as falling within its sphere of particular influence.

Una dintre aceste faţete, la care aş dori să mă refer, este poziţia geopolitică a Rusiei. După aderarea României şi Bulgariei, la 1 ianuarie 2007, graniţa de est a Uniunii Europene o reprezintă regiunea Mării Negre, din care Rusia face parte şi unde joacă un rol foarte important, atât din punct de vedere economic şi comercial, cât şi bineînţeles din punct de vedere politic. Regiunea Mării Negre este o zonă cu un potenţial de dezvoltare imens, dar în acelaşi timp o zonă care trebuie să găsească răspunsurile adecvate la provocările existente. Printre ele, asigurarea securităţii şi stabilităţii regiunii în ansamblu, dar şi a fiecărei ţări în parte, constituie prima prioritate. În acest context, găsirea şi aplicarea unei soluţii pentru rezolvarea conflictelor îngheţate este imperios necesară. Acesta continuă să fie un obstacol important în calea dezvoltării regionale şi a prosperităţii economice, iar poziţia şi implicarea constructivă a Rusiei în această direcţie trebuie să fie o tematică mereu prezentă în dialogul Uniunii Europene cu această ţară.</p>
<p class="contents">Tot în contextul Mării Negre, dar şi separat de ea, trebuie abordată tema energetică. Aici trebuie punctat că relaţiile Uniunii Europene cu Rusia nu se pot dezvolta fără a ţine cont de necesitatea de a le baza pe încredere reciprocă, precum şi pe respectarea obligaţiilor internaţionale şi principiilor democratice de către ambii parteneri. Şi, pentru a introduce în context şi regiunea, cred că diversificarea surselor de energie trebuie să rămână o prioritate a Uniunii Europene.</p>
<p class="contents">În sfârşit, sper ca noua iniţiativă a Uniunii Europene de consolidare a cooperării la Marea Neagră să ajute la realizarea obiectivelor menţionate mai sus şi mai ales la dezvoltarea unui dialog sincer între partenerii din regiune, ce astfel ar putea învăţa să asculte, să aibă încredere şi să coopereze cu vecinii lor, în conformitate cu standardele democratice recunoscute la nivel internaţional. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This pro-Russian forecast might have some basis if Russia played by the time-honoured rules employed by the rest of the world in the fields of economy and trade, and if it tread the path of democracy, even if it is democracy with a Russian flavour.</p>
<p class="contents">However, for the moment, it will be a long road – both in time and in terms of distance from what is really happening now – to the fulfilment of these predictions. Russia's economy may be growing impressively, but reforms are slowing down, corruption is not decreasing, and the legal system is not becoming any more reliable. The cases of Khodarkovsky and Lebedev, which will soon be re-opened, may become parodies of trials. Investors from Europe do not have the same adequate legal safeguards that the EU guarantees to investors from Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Moscow’s penchant for adding hot political spices to the trade of petroleum, natural gas and meat causes concern. The new EU members experienced losses when Russia clashed with Ukraine and Belarus, cut off the supply of crude oil through the <span class="italic">Druzhba</span> gas pipeline because of alleged technical breakdowns, and has not cut the Gordian knot of the Polish meat import affair.</p>
<p class="contents">EU-Russian trade relations would be helped by a Baltic Sea cooperation strategy in the northern dimension context, especially in relation to the Kaliningrad area. The degree to which this area is closed or open is like a barometer showing the whole of Russia's intentions. At the moment the barometer shows ‘changeable’, because investment and trade guidelines for the area have not settled down, nor has taxation policy, and businessmen from EU countries working there do not feel safe.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, one would like to believe, that one day the barometer will indicate ‘fine weather’. Mutually beneficial EU-Russian trade relations will help Russia achieve the favourable economic forecasts and become a good and reliable EU partner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Another of the report’s virtues is that it has been published at a point when Russia has been enjoying a run of good luck thanks to the increase in the price of raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">This has translated into a qualitative change in its attitude, as well as its economic and trade policy. Let me draw your attention to the most important features of these changes. The first is Russia's unwavering effort to control the markets and the transport of raw materials with the aim of using crude oil and gas as a tool to exert political pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is Russia's policy of consistently offering special relations and privileges to some countries in the European Union while discriminating against others, in line with the principle of divide and rule. An example of this policy was the speech Mr Goebbels gave in this House. In spite of clear evidence to the contrary, he claimed, as a Russian spokesman would also claim, that Russia was in the right concerning its dispute with Poland. I applaud this bias.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up the situation, Russia is consistently exploiting its favourable situation on the raw materials market to create an international economic and trade structure that will allow it to attain its political goals. The Union’s response to this kind of policy should be a decisive strategy based on speaking with one voice on all common issues and, in order to defend the weakest among us, working to protect and support those countries and economic sectors that are most dependent on Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We share the European continent, but without mutual agreement we will not be able to solve any of the world’s major problems. We also cannot get by without mutual cooperation when it comes to trade and the economy. I am one of those MEPs that feel that the construction of a joint economic area, and the creation of an open, integrated market between the EU and Russia, is in the interests of both sides. Also in the interests of both sides is Russia’s accession to the WTO. The EU should be open to investment from Russia, but Russia must also guarantee the same access rights for the Community, and that includes firms operating in the area of natural resources. If that is possible, I am convinced that not only economic prosperity but also stability across all areas of mutual interest and relations between the EU and Russia will be strengthened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, between the end of 2006 and the start of 2007, the Member States of the European Union were in a position where their supplies of natural gas were threatened due to the dispute between Russia and Ukraine. Then, in January 2007, Russia suspended crude oil supplies to Western Europe due to a dispute with Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, Russia is blocking the supply of crude oil to the Mazeikiu refinery, following its sale to the Polish company Orlen. These are unfortunately only a few examples of the way in which Russia uses the supplies of raw materials for energy production as a political tool against European Union Member States and third countries. It is also proof of Russia's unreliability as an energy supplier.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, for over eighteen months there has been a ban in place on imports of Polish foodstuffs to Russia. It was only at the start of this year that the European Union decided to acknowledge that the problem affects not only Poland, but also the entire European Union. Unfortunately, although several months have passed and in spite of an ever increasing amount of evidence to prove that this embargo is purely political, even the European Union has not managed to resolve this problem. Therefore, I would like to express my hope that the European Union will not only be resolute, but also effective, in resolving this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have an obligation to try to improve this relationship. There is a path that can be found between ‘Realpolitik’, which tends to overlook principles, and what former French Cabinet Minister Hubert Védrine recently termed ‘<span class="italic">Irrealpolitik</span>’ in the field of international relations, which tends to overlook the complexity of a given situation. That path is one of tough, responsible pragmatism.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that this is the way forward proposed in this report and the way that I should like to advocate. It is a path that promotes stronger economic and trade cooperation and the creation of conditions whereby Russia can join the World Trade Organisation, a prerequisite for better integrating Russia into the international framework in this area. At the same time, this path must also be matched by resoluteness with regard to protecting and safeguarding fundamental rights, fundamental human rights, the fundamental principles of a democracy and the fundamental principles of the rule of law. It is in this balance that we must seek the solution whereby we can resolve the problems that still divide the EU and Russia before it is too late. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have taken good note of what you said and I will convey your message to my colleague Mr Mandelson for his consideration. I am sure that he, like me, will be impressed by the high degree of consensus in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than going into detail on the different points raised this evening, I should like to say the following. It is true that many problems exist and our relations are complex. However, this is not surprising given the enormous depth and breadth of cooperation between the Russian Federation and the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of a number of difficult issues, we should not forget that our cooperation with Russia is very successful on many issues. I have already referred to the example of competition policy, where we have established good cooperation, and we have made good progress in aligning our regulatory systems. There are many other examples that I could refer to.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is also clear that we need to tackle the challenges in our relations. We want to work actively with Russia to find solutions to the outstanding issues and we need constructive engagement: only an active dialogue with the Russian side, including on the difficult issues, will allow us to find solutions that are in our mutual interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members asked when the EU will be ready to start negotiations on the new agreement. Negotiations on the new agreement will take place as soon as we have the mandate from the Member States. The Commission is working actively with the Presidency, the Member States and Russia to overcome the remaining difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">We and Russia have an interest in a new EU-Russia agreement to replace the existing Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, as our relationship with Russia has developed over the last decade. A new agreement would take relations to a new level and enable them to reach their full potential. However, there is no time pressure: the present Partnership and Cooperation Agreement remains in force and the ‘common spaces’ roadmap provides us with a substantial agenda for the short and medium term. There will be no legal vacuum.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Foltyn-Kubicka and Mr Seppänen mentioned Polish meat. The Commission is working with Poland and Russia for the lifting of the Russian ban on imports of Polish meat and plant products. We have been very active at all levels to demonstrate to Russia that Poland fully complies with EU legislation and EU-Russia documents concerning veterinary and phytosanitary issues and that the bans should therefore be lifted. Discussions will certainly continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Budreikaitė and Mr Paleckis raised the question of the Druzhba pipeline. The Lithuanian Government has raised this issue. The Commission has kept in close contact with the Russian Energy Minister, Mr Kristenko, and we are urging the Russian authorities to provide Lithuania with full information on the state of the pipeline so that a satisfactory solution can be found.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members spoke more generally about EU-Russia energy relations. Energy is an area which demonstrates our interdependence. Russia needs European markets, investment and know-how just as much as Europe needs Russian oil and gas. We continue to believe that the Energy Charter Treaty offers a good multilateral framework for international trade and investment in energy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the most recent summit, a decision was taken to establish an early-warning mechanism. This can help make EU-Russia energy dialogue more operational. Energy will obviously have an important place in the new EU-Russia agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As President Putin assured us at the last summit, Russia respects the key principles of the Energy Charter Treaty and we expect them to be reflected in the new agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Oomen-Ruijten asked about developments in Russian investment law. I have to make it clear that this is at present a draft law, covering strategic sectors of the economy. The Commission is following the developments closely. We will soon start an investment dialogue with Russia and we will be able to discuss this with you further.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of the rule of law, human rights and democracy, I can assure you that the Commission will continue to press the importance of respect for common values and will ensure that the new agreement also reflects these values.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to thank the rapporteur once again for an excellent report. We will take it into account as much as possible in our work with Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
