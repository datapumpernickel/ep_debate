<p class="contents">My reason for bringing this matter up in plenary is to correct inconsistencies attributable to the Commission services which arose when the vote was taken in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI).</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, after consulting a number of parliamentary experts, I propose, today, the adoption of three amendments, the sole objective of which is to correct these inconsistencies and clarify the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 45 and 47 are therefore simple technical corrections. Amendment 46 proposes that the simplification of the voluntary labelling procedure should not enter into force until 1 January 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that these voluntary indications must be objective, verifiable by the relevant authorities, and comprehensible to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">To avoid any unfounded fear, I have also specified once again that the relevant authority should verify the truth of these indications and ensure that the sanctions referred to in Article 22(4a) are applied. We are talking here about voluntary indications and not mandatory indications relating to the origin of the meat. We are therefore talking about commercial information used by operators, the rules for which need to be simplified. Clearly, we are all in agreement on the need to move towards the electronic identification of bovine animals. We are not advocating forcing the agricultural sector to implement electronic identification immediately. I am a legislator and I believe that we are responsible for the laws we adopt which have an economic impact.</p>
<p class="contents">The meat industry in Europe and the beef industry in particular are suffering at present and we, as legislators, cannot subject them to even more expenditure. This is not a public health problem. The idea is to put in place electronic identification to ensure better traceability of bovine animals, which the sector will adopt over time. We will see in five years’ time whether, in fact, the technology is sound and whether or not the industries are ready. Perhaps the economic climate will be better.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second part, the labelling of bovine animals, what are we talking about? We are not talking about questioning voluntary labelling: we are not doing away with it, just to be clear. We are talking about simplifying the system and simplifying the procedure. I will explain it very simply: meat labelling is carried out in the same way for all meat. For the beef industry, for beef, mad cow disease has made the procedure more complex. Let us keep the voluntary system, but let us simplify it, because we are responsible for the administrative burden that is characteristic of our procedures in Europe. We must do everything in our power to simplify them for our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express particular thanks to the rapporteur, Ms Auconie, for her commitment to this cause. I hope that her dedicated work will pave the way for an agreement to be reached at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">This would be particularly welcome because the proposed new rules amount to an opportunity to enhance growth and competitiveness for many stakeholders. We all recognise that the current system of traceability is effective in terms of consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Electronic identification will, however, make the system more accurate and faster. It will improve the tracing of animals and food products for enhanced food safety and better management of disease outbreaks. It will also reduce administrative burdens by simplifying the current procedures. Modern technology is literally just a click away for European farmers, and our duty is to adopt legislation to allow them to embrace and profit from this progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards voluntary beef labelling, horizontal EU legislation has already been developed. This legislation covers beef in the same way as any other meat. There is, therefore, no need to maintain a specific authorisation procedure for voluntary beef labels. Operators respecting the existing horizontal provisions would, of course, be free to provide additional information on their labels. Any such information should not mislead consumers and should be verifiable by the competent authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also keep in mind that current rules on bovine identification and voluntary beef labelling were described as ‘burdens’ imposed on business in the communication from the Commission on the action programme for reducing administrative burdens in the EU. There has been much talk about reducing these burdens, and now we are acting on it.</p>

He will be here with us imminently, so I would like to thank you and your services for allowing me to speak now, but I am delivering the speech I was going to make later on in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make a contribution to this debate because of my recent experience with EID on sheep, and I am going to confine my remarks to how that system works technically.</p>
<p class="contents">This system has been imposed on farmers in my constituency, despite strong opposition, and has now been around long enough for us to know that it does not work efficiently. That is not to say that some farmers do not find it useful. They do – particularly for internal flock management – but it is not sufficiently reliable to be used as a primary system for stock movements.</p>
<p class="contents">The unreliability of the technology has been acknowledged by the Commission through their granting of more time, for example, to the UK to bed the system in. Why would we want to embark on an extension of this system to bovines before we get these things sorted? And why would we want to extend it at all – and I mean here specifically on a mandatory basis – unless we are clear that there are benefits to be gained?</p>
<p class="contents">I frequently meet farmers who are terrified by the prospect of failing to achieve cross-compliance and thereby suffering the punitive withdrawal of their single farm payments. Our job is to make regulations that help both farmers and the authorities to work smarter. Let us take the opportunity to do that when we vote on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the two issues at hand, I must say that I entirely agree with the Commission’s proposal on the electronic identification of beef. However, I cannot say the same for the voluntary beef labelling system. The Commission’s proposal to delete this provision is neither appropriate nor correct. Specifically, this labelling system has played a very important role in restoring European consumers’ confidence in beef and products derived from beef.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the argument being put forward by the Commission regarding a heavy administrative burden is not valid at present, as the operational mechanism is perfectly familiar to the authorities and the sector. Proof that the mechanism is working very well can be found in the fact that in my country, for example, 180 requests for beef labelling have been approved, as opposed to just 32 for goat meat and 55 for poultry and eggs.</p>
<p class="contents">Voluntary labelling is a highly effective tool for making a distinction between varieties of a product, and consumers want to be informed about what they are buying and consuming. However, consumers do not distinguish between voluntary and mandatory labelling, and they often consider voluntary labelling to be more important and more relevant than mandatory labelling. All of this information combined is what enables them to make informed choices.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 is by no means perfect, but it is nevertheless much better than the legal vacuum that could be created if Articles 16, 17 and 18 are deleted, because we would be faced with a new system with no prior warning and no mandatory external control. One possible solution to improve the system would be to establish specific sectoral standards for beef, as already exist for other products, such as those in the chicken and poultry sector. I believe the Commission is in the process of doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to point out that labelling plays a vital role in consumer decision making, and this is precisely what we have defended in Parliament. It is therefore very hard to understand why we should now want to abolish it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fifteen years ago, it was self-evident that we would introduce an animal passport and that two ear tags would be mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are once again hesitant. Do we really need crises in order to make the right decisions? The rapporteur said that this is not about public health, but that is precisely what this is about. This is about health policy, it is about public health. I admit that the introduction of a mandatory electronic identification system does, of course, involve a certain amount of expenditure and effort. I therefore proposed in committee that we should put forward a transitional period of 10 years. Even that, however, was too much for the majority of the committee. Do you want to face your electors earnestly and tell them that you take public health seriously? Not a single farmer would say that they could not achieve this given ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us turn now to voluntary labelling. In this connection, we have repeatedly said that what we want to do is to urge farmers to connect better with consumers and provide information in which consumers are interested. How old are the animals? How have they lived? How have they been fed? How were they reared? We are providing this option with the voluntary system. It is used in every Member State. The rapporteur is now proposing that we should remove the essential characteristics that provide conditions for how the system is to be operated. That would mean that there would be a system, but no conditions within it. Who seriously believes that something like that can actually work? Not a single national authority would be able to monitor these elements. No one can manage that. In other words, the aim is to destroy an existing system.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety – and the rapporteur must represent that committee here, after all – decided to retain this voluntary system as it is. I would like to ask all my fellow Members to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by that committee when we vote on this tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I do believe, however, that we could consider whether we can simplify this system from an administrative point of view. Then, however, we would have to simplify the system and remove the administrative obstacles and hurdles. We need to help the authorities, but the way proposed here is the wrong way to go. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you urgently, including in the interests of the consumers and of the farmers of the European Union, to follow the lead of the decisions of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety when it comes to voluntary labelling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Food safety is certainly an issue that we must do everything we can to address. We definitely do not want to see the kind of situation that existed in the 1990s in connection with the BSE crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">An essential factor in the traceability of the entire food chain is the identification of bovine animals. Every animal on every holding must be registered. Identification and traceability, however, must also constantly be improved. Electronic identifiers are not acknowledged in current EU legislation: instead, there have to be two ear tags serving as the identifier. I myself have received a lot of feedback from producers on the present ear tag system, so there is certainly much room for improvement in that area. Technology has developed, and we should recognise electronic identifiers as an official means of identifying animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has taken an important step in this respect, and I am pleased with its proposal and with the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, inasmuch as cautious progress is now being made. Electronic identifiers are recognised under the law, but their use is not being made compulsory. Instead, holdings are being allowed to switch to these systems in their own good time.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel that it is necessary to develop a voluntary system for beef and beef products. There have been shortcomings with the voluntary labelling system, and practices have differed widely among the various Member States. Some have not adopted the system at all, so, for this reason, the system needs to be clarified, so that consumers are sure that they are getting accurate information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When it comes to the voluntary information, a system has developed – which has also led to competition in the marketplace – such that I would not like to do without this information. I therefore believe it would be a mistake for the Commission to remove this voluntary information.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that we need to mention cutting red tape. The rapporteur put forward a proposal for how we can integrate this into the proposed food information regulation. Article 7 prohibits misleading statements and the like. I would like to ask the Commission whether it is possible for us to introduce monitoring via this food information regulation that could operate that precisely? Would it, instead, be better to leave this up to the Member States? This is an absolutely crucial point. The voluntary information must be retained; it represents an important part of the consumer system.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the marking of the animals, I would have liked to have seen a little bit more courage. If the conclusion is that the electronic system does not work, there is then no need to introduce it; it should be removed from the legislation straight away, and it should be left up to the technicians to see what they make of it then. However, having the two systems in parallel in the internal market is something that I view as way off the mark. Things cannot work like that. We need a system for trade and commerce and, in my view, that can only be an electronic system. If the farmers complain that they are punished in cross-compliance if an ear tag falls out, that is much worse. The electronic tags never fall out – they are inside the animals. They therefore provide much greater certainty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder who it is who does not want the public to know what they are eating, who it is who does not want the public to be able to make choices, who is supporting corporate interests or what companies think is in their interest, by which I mean their operating under wraps. The same applies to traceability. This is a very important issue because, with proper traceability and electronic labelling, we really can prevent death, loss of life from disease and epidemics. I should like to congratulate the socialist rapporteur Ms Roth-Behrendt on her excellent work. I trust that the vote in plenary will reverse the unsatisfactory outcome in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and that it will act in a way that provides real protection for the rights of European citizens and public health in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not, at this point, say anything about the voluntary labelling of the meat; I will stick mainly to the electronic identification of the animals. In that connection, Mr Schnellhardt, I need to disagree with you quite stridently. Sheep farmers are telling us very clearly that they have major problems with electronic identification, as there are technical shortcomings with it. The tags are not coming out of the animals, but the technology is malfunctioning. The fault that occurs as a result is blamed on the farmers. That is not acceptable, and it is a situation that we must avoid in the case of cattle. It is therefore right that we should leave this system as voluntary in cattle in future, too, until the system has matured.</p>
<p class="contents">As a farmer, I am not saying that the system should not be developed or introduced, but allowing something to mature takes time. Moreover, it is important – for public health in particular – to call electronic identification into question if it does not work. As regards public health, it is quite clear that we need certainty. As long as that certainty is not in place, we should stick to a voluntary system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have stood before this Parliament many times to decry sheep EID. I hope the Commission has learned from their incompetent handling of electronic ID tags in the past, with which there are still many problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that, if the scheme is introduced, it must be on a voluntary basis and is not, as some Members of this Parliament urge, subject to a report in five years to consider compulsory EID of bovine animals. The UK cattle ID system works perfectly well, so the choice to upgrade should be an individual decision based on working preferences. It should be made without fear of penalty under cross-compliance if equipment is subject to error.</p>
<p class="contents">Sheep tagging brought a host of problems that persecuted British farmers whose equipment was especially vulnerable to the elements. Cattle in the UK are often out to grass for at least six months, so tag loss is inevitable. There is a crisis in the dairy industry in the UK, while the beef market is only just seeing a small recovery after years of being in the red. Both are subject to pressures from rising feed cost and cheaper foreign imports. If the Commission makes a shambles of bovine tagging, the industry will be brought to its knees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consumer information should be clear and objective, and the result of a simple, unbureaucratic process. The labelling of beef is clearly important and should prevent the proliferation of erroneous information given to consumers about sensitive issues such as the breed of the animals and the way in which they were created, as well as the way in which the meat is processed. The regulation of information given to the consumer must address these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Beef is an extremely sensitive product in relation to the EU market, and it is highly subject to pressure from third countries, which have less stringent requirements in terms of animal well-being and systems of production. The same provisions must apply to imported products.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the labelling system should be improved, but with concrete rules and a clear and fair monitoring system for all of the Member States. This should be done within an EU system that is able to prevent different levels of performance, which supports distortions in competitiveness. I also consider that this system should be made obligatory for all of the Member States, similar to the current system for poultry meat and eggs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us not forget that the use of these technologies will enable the improved management of direct payments to farmers, granted per animal, through better control and there being a reduced risk of payment errors.

This measure makes the market more opaque and benefits anonymous and counterfeit producers to the cost of breeders who aim for quality.</p>

Given the differing views held, it was no easy job in committee, and it is certainly no secret that there were different focuses even within the group. This is, however, a good basis for the negotiations with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, it is important that consumer protection has top priority. We have learnt the lessons of the BSE crisis. At the same time, however, we have made it clear to our farmers that we need to pay closer attention, when it comes to imports, too, to ensuring that rules that we put in place together are also complied with. We do not want any unnecessary bureaucracy. The trick now lies in finding out the point at which we have the maximum possible level of consumer protection without causing unnecessary bureaucracy. After intensive discussions within the group, we therefore introduced another refinement of Article 1 point 14 that envisages that the information that has thus far fallen within the scope of voluntary labelling under this system could soon be covered by food labelling rules. However, we also want to see that monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schnellhardt asked the Commission the right question, namely, how can we ensure that there will be no deception of consumers? Our point of view is that the competent authorities must monitor this and that penalties must also be imposed in the event of violations. After the vote tomorrow, we will be entering into negotiations with the Council. All sides will have to be flexible so that we can achieve our common goal. Perhaps there will also still be new insights during the negotiations with the Council that we could then also allow to flow through into the final result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">By proposing the abolition of voluntary labelling, the Commission is weakening these aspects and preventing the consumer from having access to additional information, such as the sex, age and diet of bovine animals – elements I consider fundamental for two reasons: because they can help the consumer to make a more informed purchase and because they give added value to the product.</p>
<p class="contents">The criticisms the Commission has made of the voluntary labelling system are based on heavy administrative burdens not offset by sufficient advantages.

In theory, this should lessen the administrative burden on farmers and managing authorities. Member States should have the flexibility to decide the system which best suits their own farmers, livestock markets and processors. In the United Kingdom, the majority of farmers do not use electronic management systems, and it would be unfair to make EID compulsory, given the impact on farmers but also the lack of tangible benefits for the consumer and taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">Sheep EID has proved to be nothing short of more unnecessary bureaucracy from the Commission. A 100% accuracy rate has not been possible, given the failings in technology, and unless the Commission takes a more pragmatic view here, farmers in Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom and throughout Europe will be unduly penalised under cross-compliance rules. It is important, therefore, that the Commission tackle the problems within the sheep sector before imposing other unnecessary rules on beef and dairy.</p>
<p class="contents">As we move forward, we must have an approach that allows for flexibility, does not prove bureaucratic for farmers and processors, improves competitiveness in the market and gives consumers valuable information to make informed choices. This is a huge task indeed for negotiation with Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a second point, we do not want to destroy the working electronic origin identification systems in the Member States.

<p class="contents">I have the impression that, on this issue, the Commission is not taking the real protagonists of the event – the breeders and the producers – into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the proposals is to introduce a ban on voluntary labelling – a measure that is precisely not obligatory – which allows producers who choose to do so to provide additional information on the label. Since the same organisations representing breeders and producers have asked for this measure to continue to be provided, it is paradoxical not to concede this possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, work is being carried out in order that our farmers can provide data relating to the products that they sell in as transparent a way as possible. It therefore seems counterproductive to work, on the one hand, to protect the provision of information to consumers and make it transparent while, on the other hand, abolishing measures, voluntary measures even, that go in the same direction.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that these are choices to be made if the intention is to lower the quality and the standards of agricultural products. There is no other explanation of a comparable measure against breeders committed to providing indications of quality, such as the choice of one type of feed rather than another. For these reasons, I will be voting against certain amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a well-known fact that, over recent years, input costs have risen disproportionately in relation to agricultural earnings. In an environment of rising rents for forage land, rising feed and fuel prices and other similar developments, official regulations, including where they would be welcome in principle – for environmental protection reasons or for consumer confidence and food safety – will tip small farmers in particular over the edge, right across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With that in mind, the European Union has, in my view, drawn the right conclusions from the consultation, namely, that compulsory electronic identification would have entailed economic disadvantages for some farmers, and that is something that we do not want to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission considers that its proposal would be beneficial for animal health, public health and food safety, and that it would reduce the administrative burden in bovine farming and the related meat sector. Let me remind you that it was this Parliament that adopted a resolution calling on the Commission to reduce administrative burdens, and it was endorsed by this entire House.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the specific problems, there is no need to maintain a specific authorisation procedure for voluntary beef labelling as horizontal provisions on labelling of meat would apply. It is also important to note that voluntary beef labelling contains information related to quality and not necessarily to health. Health and traceability are ensured by mandatory beef labelling and not by voluntary beef labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it would be very important that Parliament gives its agreement, so that it can start with the necessary negotiations, and that this will result in the development of electronic identification through use in practice by those who want to take it up. Of course, this will also reduce the vulnerability of the systems and their cost for smaller farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say to you just how important public health, the health of our citizens, of European citizens is to me. There is absolutely no doubt about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Identification of bovine animals exists. It is not electronic, but it exists. It allows for very high-quality traceability. That is not the issue at all. It is simply that, as Mr Bufton, Ms Reimers and Ms Girling have said, the technology for the electronic identification of bovine animals does not appear to be totally reliable. Therefore, let us wait until we can be sure that the system for the electronic identification of bovine animals is reliable before we decide to make it mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in reaching my compromises, I accepted without any difficulty that we would consider reviewing the issue in five years’ time to see whether the technology had progressed and was able to guarantee high-quality electronic identification.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem is also economic. I do not think that I am putting the health of European citizens at risk when I say that we must leave our agricultural sector and the beef industry sufficient time to adopt this new technology naturally. For farmers, there is a cost: an electronic chip costs EUR 1 for each animal in a herd. In addition to that, however, there is the whole system of automated reading and so on, which is very costly, and I would remind you that our farmers are suffering from the recession and a lack of competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to say to Ms Bizzotto, for example, that I am not doing away with and do not wish to do away with voluntary labelling, not at all. As the Commissioner has said, it is not a question of doing away with voluntary labelling but of simplifying the system and the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">All aspects of the public health of our citizens are indicated in mandatory labelling. There is absolutely no question of abandoning labelling information.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in response to one of my fellow Members, I would like to reaffirm that there will not be a legal loophole in relation to labelling. We must ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers. This is the horizontal legislation you spoke about, Commissioner, which concerns all types of meat. Beef will therefore be treated in the same way as all other types of meat. Furthermore, all the compromise amendments submitted to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) have been adopted. I therefore call on my fellow Members to take my lead in tomorrow’s vote and I should like to thank them most sincerely in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to clarify that we are still aiming for an agreement at first reading. This means that tomorrow, under Article 57 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, I will ask for the final vote on the resolution to be postponed. I propose that we then move directly to the trialogue, and that we subsequently reconvene in plenary to put the result of the negotiation at first reading to the vote in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The identification system is a matter of serious concern for European farmers. The Commission is well aware that there were significant problems, which caused terrible difficulties for farmers, with the mandatory system for electronic identification (EID) of sheep. Many farmers have contacted me because of illness, strain, injury or infection among their sheep as a result of the identification technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Faulty technology and a lack of realism and flexibility on the part of the authorities have led to fines being imposed on farmers and a pointless increase in bureaucracy. The electronic identification of animals ought to be an optional scheme and one run by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, there is no advantage in having a compulsory scheme. In an optional scheme, small farmers – who would benefit little from the scheme – would not be obliged to implement electronic identification and would not have to shoulder unfair administrative and financial burdens. In an optional scheme, only those farmers who would derive immediate, significant benefit from the EID would implement it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European legislation is committed to ensuring them the highest level of protection by means of measures adapted to the changeable requirements of the market. Although I agree with the Commission’s overall objective of achieving more clarity in the application of the legislation on the identification and traceability of bovine animals, I strongly disagree with the proposal to delete the provisions on voluntary labelling of beef, apparently justified by the heavy administrative burden that is not offset by sufficient advantages. Given that it seems to be a contradiction in terms to delete a provision that is, in itself, ‘voluntary’, if this proposal were to be approved, it would create a legal black hole as regards voluntary labelling which, instead, proves to be valuable because it provides useful information that helps both to increase the information available to consumers and the value-added of the products. The best way to market their products is a determining factor for farmers and approval by the competent authority guarantees that the information featured on the labels is reliable. In the absence of such approval, consumers cannot rely on the labelling of the product. For the above reasons, I support keeping the present system of voluntary beef labelling in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reasons in terms of costs that have led to the proposal to simplify the system of beef labelling seem to be understandable. Nevertheless, they are disproportionate in terms of the losses or rather the harm that it would cause, above all, in terms of quality, transparency and protection as regards consumers. In any case, I hope that it is clear to everyone that the proposal to abolish the voluntary labelling system would prejudice the competitiveness of the product. In my country, Italy, breeders always invest in quality, traceability and food safety, and, in voluntary labelling, they have found a useful means of improving information and adding to the value of products for sale. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
