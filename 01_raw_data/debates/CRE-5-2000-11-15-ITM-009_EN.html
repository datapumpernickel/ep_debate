<p class="contents">As you know, yesterday the French Government adopted national measures to strengthen health safety, including the suspension of the use of animal meal in feed for pigs and poultry. I was with the Prime Minister, Mr Jospin, when he announced this action plan. The Council of the European Union is also playing an active role, in concert with the European Parliament and the European Commission, in updating and constantly reinforcing Europe’s raft of measures to prevent and combat this disease.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that you wanted me to address you today regarding these two aspects, in other words, the state of play in the fight against BSE in Europe and related developments in France.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore start by confirming the raft of measures adopted by the French Government yesterday, and I will then talk about the initiatives taken by the Presidency, and the Community developments that are underway. It is important to take stock of the situation with regard to the fight against BSE in the broader context of food safety developments in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, then, in Paris, the French Government announced an intensification of national health safety measures. This action plan places public health and transparency at the top of the agenda, this being a requirement of the French Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with a situation of uncertainty in the event of a potential major risk to public health, all decisions necessary to protect health must be taken and constantly reassessed in the light of developments in scientific knowledge and opinion. This is thus our third guiding principle: the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">An additional stage in protecting public health seems to be necessary. Two facts have increased concerns about meal of animal origin in animal feed.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the emergence of cases of BSE in cattle born after the ban on animal meal was imposed. The hypothesis of the accidental or fraudulent cross contamination of these animals by meal of animal origin has been put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a report released earlier this month by the UK Government enabled us to take stock of the difficulties of controlling and using this type of meal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary to add that, over and above the health issues, animal meal is seen by the consumer as a symbol of the abuses of a certain method of agricultural production which has been in operation for 40 years. This method has guaranteed the supply of foodstuffs at low cost but its limitations have since been exposed and it has been called into question over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the French Government decided to suspend the use of meat-and-bone meal in feed for pigs, poultry, fish and domestic animals. Only fish meal can continue to be given to fish.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the French Food Safety Agency is carrying out new scientific research into the possible health risks linked to meat-and-bone meal in the light of the progress of knowledge and the efficacy of safety measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, the French Government is taking steps to withdraw specified risk materials from the food chain. In accordance with recent scientific recommendations, it has decided to enforce the removal of the spinal cord. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Following a suggestion from the independent scientific assessment agency, AFSSA (the French Food Safety Agency), a decision was taken to ban beef on the bone. The spinal cords of cattle will also be excluded from the production of gelatine and tallow and the entire organisation of animal slaughter will be re-examined in such a way as to make the cutting up of carcasses even safer.</p>
<p class="contents">The methods of control will be strengthened along the entire food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">France has embarked upon an important programme of some 48 000 tests to be carried out on cattle populations deemed to be at high risk, 8 000 of which also come under the Community programme. The decision has been taken to extend this programme to cover the whole of the territory of France. Tests will also be carried out on a random basis on cattle entering the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">We propose that the Commission and the European Union should thus undertake to extend these tests at a European level, in the light of scientific recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">A specific concern is the human form of the disease and the care that is provided. A programme to encourage disinfection and sterilisation within hospitals and to reinforce measures for the use of single-use material will be put in place very quickly. A reassessment of the precautionary and safety measures regarding the production and use of blood products is underway. Special attention will be paid to hygiene and safety conditions for workers in the facilities concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress of research is a crucial factor in improving our knowledge of BSE as well as in its prevention and treatment. That is why the efforts that have been made since 1997 in terms of research will be extended and broadened.</p>
<p class="contents">The current unpopularity of beef consumption is reflected in a significant imbalance in the market. Tools to support the beef industry in tackling this crisis must be implemented. France has asked that the situation of the beef market be included on the agenda of the Agriculture Council, which will take place in Brussels on 20 and 21 November. In the interim, it has called for the implementation of the private storage measure provided for by the COM for beef. The intervention measure cannot exclude the possibility of going much further and of determining whether the production of oil seeds in Europe can be stepped up.</p>
<p class="contents">This national action plan, which was announced by Prime Minister Jospin yesterday in Paris, resulted from the fact that food safety is a legitimate concern of consumers. It is also a constant inspiration to the government, which will continue to act with determined vigilance to ensure that it is guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that this concern is fully shared by all the European institutions, whether it be the European Parliament, Madam President, the Commission or the Council. As a result it must be put squarely at the top of the European agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">This very day in Brussels, the experts on the Standing Veterinary Committee at the European Commission have been meeting with a view to preparing ways of extending the European programme for carrying out screening tests on cattle. This meeting of veterinary experts at the Commission is especially useful in the run-up to the next Agriculture Council, which will take place on 20 and 21 November under the chairmanship of my fellow Minister, Jean Glavany.</p>
<p class="contents">This meeting will compare experiences and approaches with regard to the test programme, the ban on animal meal and other measures that might be reinforced at a European level. The results of this first debate will be presented to the Council on 20 November. The key issue is to restore the confidence of European consumers in beef.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has also planned to hold, during the same meeting, an open debate on food safety on the basis of work in progress, current developments regarding the crisis and recent proposals from the Commission on hygiene and food law, particularly on setting up a European Food Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be recalled that a number of proposed regulations are under discussion, which will reinforce the effectiveness and the relevance of the raft of Community measures and shall thereby, I hope, restore consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I am reminded that a framework programme on the fight against TSEs is currently being examined by the Council with a view to an agreement being adopted at the Agriculture Council in December.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary objective of this text is to establish the legal base making it possible, by means of a single text, to implement practically all the epidemiological and monitoring measures, health policy and the ban on specified risk materials, as well as measures relating to the introduction on the market, the exchange, importation and exportation of live animals and their products. All these measures relate to BSE in both cattle and sheep and to scrapie in small ruminants. The scope of these measures covers human and animal feed: the other aspects of the problem of the TSEs will be dealt with under other legal headings (medicines, cosmetics and others).</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, the Commission has put forward measures on food hygiene, which are under examination both in the Council and in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s very recent proposal on food law and the setting up of a European Food Agency will be debated extensively during the Internal Market, Consumers and Tourism Council to be held on 30 November, which I will be chairing, with a view to devising guidelines for the operation of this agency. I believe that the open debate on food safety, which will be held next week during the Agriculture Council, will clearly show, among other things, that scientific research is a cornerstone of the European raft of measures on food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament recently took up a position on the Commission White Paper, which foreshadows the establishment of this agency. I am sure that your parliamentary calendar will take full account of the need to move ahead more quickly so that, as suggested by the Commission, we can have a European Food Agency by 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as this proposal to set up the European Food Agency was presented by the Commission on 8 November, the Presidency enlisted the work of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Two meetings of the Council group were held on 9 and 14 November to prepare the general debate, which will take place on 30 November in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the European Food Agency will be mainly to express high-quality, independent scientific opinions on all issues having a direct or indirect impact on the health of consumers and arising from the consumption of food to cover all the stages of primary production right up to the final consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Food Agency will also provide clear and accessible information on issues arising out of its mandate. As a result, effectiveness, independence and transparency will be the key principles guiding the assessment of food risks in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Madam President, I am glad of the opportunity to update you on the latest developments in the on-going crisis in relation to BSE. I had already anticipated addressing you on the Phillips report released earlier this month by the UK Government. However, events in France over the past week clearly call for an earlier discussion of these events.</p>
<p class="contents">Only the dangerously complacent or naïve could assume that we have safely put the BSE crisis behind us. Once more we are reminded that BSE is not an historic event, but a real and present danger. There has been a worrying increase in the number of cases of BSE detected in France over the past year, in part due to the introduction of targeted testing. Moreover, the marketing of beef from a herd found to be harbouring a clinical case of BSE ignited public fears over the adequacy of controls to protect public health.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, we need to look at these developments and draw the appropriate lessons. That process must begin with a look at the facts. The current incidence in France is of the order of 7 cases per million cattle aged over two years. This falls far short of the international criterion of 100 cases per million used to define high incident countries. However, this relatively low incidence is no reason for complacency. The fact is that the incidence is rising in several Member States. In the absence of clear and transparent evidence that the incidence of BSE is falling in all Member States, we must remain extremely vigilant. More importantly, we must learn from this latest experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly outline my main observations in this respect. First, the increased incidence of BSE in France is, in large part, due to the introduction of random testing by the French authorities. This follows from a Commission decision requiring all Member States to introduce such testing by 1 January 2001. All Member States should follow the French example.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the absolute necessity for the implementation of rigid controls on BSE cannot be over-emphasised. The fact is that there is a battery of controls provided by legislation. If these controls are respected and implemented, the risk to the public is reduced to a minimum. I will return to this point later.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, we must have total transparency in our approach towards BSE. The consumer reaction to BSE has been variously described as a psychosis, irrational or driven by panic. A lack of clarity and transparency in addressing the issue has contributed hugely to this unfortunate situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must not overlook the huge progress in recent years, in the past year in particular, in putting in place a framework to tackle BSE. In the process, we have also begun the task of ensuring that EU systems are in place to avoid similar tragedies in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I was, frankly, disappointed that there was no acknowledgement in Prime Minister Jospin's statement yesterday of the hugely positive role played by the Community in recent years. Inspired by this Parliament, the Commission has been the driving force in pressing for the adoption of measures to eradicate BSE. And this was done notwithstanding the frequent lack of support in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This work is not complete. Important proposals, for example, on animal waste and on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are currently before the Council and Parliament. The proposal adopted by the Commission last week on the establishment of a European Food Authority is an even more significant initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not allow recent events to undermine this progress. I expect a strong endorsement of the Commission's proposals on the Food Authority from the European Council in Nice – and I note what you, Madam President, said on that issue only very recently. Parliament can equally signal its commitment to the proposal by giving it the highest priority with a view to its adoption in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the issue in hand, the events of the past few weeks already call for a response. The Commission view that targeted testing is essential in establishing a true picture of the real incidence of BSE in the Community has been fully vindicated by the test results in France. However, it is necessary to put in place such tests on a much larger scale.</p>
<p class="contents">The public needs reassurance that the controls already in place are effective. Extensive testing now appears to be the most effective means of providing such reassurance. The Commission intends to put proposals to the Agriculture Council on Monday next, which will fully answer public demands in this respect. The European Parliament has been a consistent and strong supporter of such testing and I count on your support for the Commission's approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The implications of recent events for the Community measures on meat-and-bone meal are also at issue. Clearly, explanations are necessary for the increased incidence of BSE, not only in France but also in other Member States. Time and again the finger of blame points in the direction of contaminated meat-and-bone meal.</p>
<p class="contents">France decided, yesterday, to ban meat-and-bone meal on a provisional basis. I look forward to the forthcoming opinion of AFSSA, the French Food Safety Agency, which will help inform the decision of the French Authorities on whether this provisional measure needs to be continued.</p>
<p class="contents">The evidence still strongly suggests that the increased incidence in some Member States has its origin in the period before the introduction of reinforced controls in 1996 and subsequently. And it is certainly the case that the current controls are very strict. For instance: there is a ban on the feeding of mammalian meat-and-bone meal to ruminants, notably cattle. Meat-and-bone meal must be processed, that is, pressure cooked, to very high standards. Specified risk materials must be removed and destroyed. Active surveillance measures, including random testing, are in progress to prevent cases of BSE from entering the food and feed chains.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these controls can only be effective if properly implemented. Many inspections by the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office point to weaknesses in the implementation of these controls. In some cases, the follow-up to these reports in Member States is not taken with the seriousness which it deserves. This, frankly, is unacceptable. It is unacceptable on public health grounds. It is also foolhardy, as the alternative to these controls leads towards an outright ban on meat-and-bone meal with the attendant huge financial and environmental consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Public health and financial considerations, therefore, both argue for strict implementation. The Commission, for its part, will continue to impress on Member States the importance of this issue. The Commission's Food and Veterinary Office already affords top priority to Member States' controls in relation to protective measures against BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">I am asking the Food and Veterinary Office to carry out once more a fundamental and thorough inspection in the Member States in this respect. For example, the requirement to remove and destroy SRMs only entered into force from 1 October 2000 and I want urgent on-the-ground confirmation that this requirement is being enforced. Parliament's assistance in this respect would also be most welcome in alerting the public in the Member States to the importance of these controls.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, there is currently a major proposal before Parliament and the Council for a regulation on animal waste. This proposal provides the opportunity for putting in place a comprehensive framework to ensure that all the relevant issues relating to animal waste are addressed. Again, I hope to work with Parliament in putting this proposal on the statute book as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of speakers have raised the issue of a total ban on meat-and-bone meal. Let me add a few comments on what I said earlier in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In the situation confronting us it is always tempting to look to a magic solution, a solution which can, in one step, both eliminate risk and restore confidence. I have gone on record in stating that I will be fully transparent with consumers. This includes in my view the responsibility not to mislead them into believing that there are magic solutions to a very difficult problem. A total ban on meat-and-bone meal is an example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">My only concern in relation to the use of meat-and-bone meal is whether it is safe or not to use in animal feed. I leave it to others to make the economic and environmental case for its continued use. In relation to its safety, let me repeat that there is an extensive range of controls already in place to ensure that MBM does not pose a threat of transmission of BSE. It may be that MBM cannot be fed to ruminants and I have said this already. The scientific advice is that MBM produced under these conditions is not a danger.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament also accepts that there is a place for meat-and-bone meal produced under safe conditions. Parliament acknowledged that in its report on BSE in 1997 and I quote: "The recycling of carcasses and slaughter waste by the production of meat-and-bone meal for animal feed offers the best alternative on economic, environmental and health policy grounds". As I stated earlier, however, the safe use of meat-and-bone meal is conditional on the required controls being respected and implemented in full. If there is a weakness in the controls, clearly there is a problem. I am insisting, once more, that all Member States accept their responsibilities in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's Food and Veterinary Office will redouble its efforts to ensure that Member States respect their obligations. I would add that if the French decision to ban meat-and-bone meal is motivated by fears over the adequacy of their controls it is a decision I fully endorse. I welcome in this respect that Prime Minister Jospin yesterday also announced a substantial strengthening of controls on the food chain including a big increase in staff. I will be asking Member States on Monday if there are concerns that weaknesses in the implementation of controls over the past several years, in contravention of the Community legislation in the matter, are a factor in the current increased incidence of BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, I would add that the Commission has recently presented a proposal to Parliament under codecision for a regulation on animal waste. This proposal aims at putting in place a Community framework which will address all relevant issues governing the treatment of animal waste, especially its use in animal feed. It is notable that in the discussions that have taken place already on this proposal with the Member States, a ban on the feeding of meat-and-bone meal to animals has not been suggested as a necessary measure. By that I mean a total ban. Instead, the consensus view is that the Community must ensure that only material from animals fit for human consumption should be used in the production of meat-and-bone meal. It remains to be seen if this changes in the light of current events.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me recall, Madam President, in this respect that I succeeded only five months ago in securing the Council's agreement to a ban on the use of specified risk materials in the food and feed chains. Yes, difficult as it may be to believe, it took four years to agree a measure which I consider to be fundamental to public health protection. The obstacles in securing support for a ban on meat-and-bone meal should be viewed in this light. Let me assure you, however, that if and when I consider that a ban on the feeding of meat-and-bone meal to all animals is a necessary measure to protect public health, I will present such a proposal irrespective of the obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament itself now has its opportunity to shape decisively the future direction of policy towards waste at Community level. All options are open in this proposal on animal waste including a total ban, if thought necessary. I await your report and suggested amendments and assure you of my full cooperation for suggested improvements.</p>

I am also willing to concede that the Commission, no doubt because of enormous pressure from the European Parliament, has made great progress in recent years in gaining acceptance for the principle of precautionary consumer protection. But implementation by the Member States has still been too slow.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely it is possible both to act quickly and to do the job properly. The public cannot understand why our legislative process is so slow in times of crisis. That is also why I wish to say here that the Commission must have powers at such times of crisis to take more rapid decisions in relation to infringements of Community law or when there is an imminent risk of such infringement, and that it should be in a position to take action in the public interest or if public health is threatened.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to say that there must be solid grounds for bans within the single market. The measures that have been agreed for animal identification and meat labelling will provide an important basis for consumer safety and confidence. It is always better to tackle the root of a problem than to indulge in populism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time we all finally escaped from this vicious cycle of speculation and mutual recrimination, in which BSE now seems to stand for "Blame Somebody Else"! That is why I specifically support the joint motion for a resolution calling on us to leave behind this atmosphere of suspicion and universally introduce rapid testing methods for BSE not only for animals affected, not only for animals over 18 months, but for all animals involved in the food chain, if at all possible.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This will give us a basis for more extensive and objective criteria for assessing the risk of BSE or the absence of BSE in Member States and allow us to take new and more far-reaching decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, I specifically call on the Council to make known its opinion on the TSE regulation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We completed the first reading in May. It is a scandal, if BSE is causally related with scrapie, that there is still no joint preventative legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, France has the right to ban animal meal for reasons of domestic policy. But what may be right for France in this situation is not necessarily right for all Member States. It is good that in this respect we are adhering to the joint decisions adopted in 1997, as Mr Byrne explained. A recycling system that functions well in part has been ruined because safety factors have been disregarded. I shall be quite open about this: what we will be calling for in the motion for a resolution tomorrow – a temporary general ban on the production and use of animal meal in feedingstuffs until all criteria relating to standards and safe origins have been met, together with the implementation of the Commission proposal to eliminate affected animals for good – is hard for many Member States, but we are going along with it because without society's backing we will have problems in the long run. However, it must also be possible to use animal parts approved for human consumption in animal feed as well in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to think about the budget. A BSE test for all animals cofinanced by the Community would cost EUR 130 million. Reserves also need to be earmarked in case redevelopment measures should be necessary. With that in mind we will also use the trialogue and the budget concertation process with the Commission and the Council to ensure that the Commission's rectifying letter for the 2001 budget is also amended with a view to making the necessary provisions.</p>

I particularly admire your courage, Mr President-in-Office, in coming here today, because I am sure that apart from the rhetorical boxing round the ears you have received from Mr Böge, you will also be on the receiving end of some other harsh words as a stand-in – and I wish to make that point clear – for your fellow Members of the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have brought in legislation, starting with our exposure of the BSE scandal, which, for years, the Council wanted to sweep under the carpet. We have produced excellent legislation. Let me mention some examples for you: the ban on feeding animal meal to ruminants, animal meal production methods and the removal of risk materials. Where was the Council when this legislation had to be implemented? How long did the Commission have to put up with getting a bloody nose in the Council of Ministers before the removal of risk materials was legislated on? Why did this Council, which attaches so much importance to consumer protection and which now acts as if public health were its top priority, not act earlier and say that this could also be achieved without legislation? You, Mr President-in-Office, and all your colleagues would have been in a position to take appropriate measures in the Member States long before the Commission, unfortunately somewhat belatedly, brought forward its proposal to process only those animal parts suitable for human consumption into animal meal. This could have been a Council initiative. I really wonder why we had to do battle with the Council about beef labelling in the European Court of Justice. Was that necessary? I also wish to ask you, Mr President-in-Office, in relation to your reference to France's policy, why it has taken France so long to transpose the legislation on animal meal manufacturing methods? I fail to understand that. Nor can I understand why France could not transpose the provisions on the pressure, temperature and heating time for the production of animal meal more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Böge has already said – he and I were rapporteurs for the TSE regulation – we had our first reading on 17 May. Where is the Council common position, if this is so important? Excuse me, Mr President-in-Office, if I make a rather heretical assumption, namely that you personally are certainly very interested in public health and in consumer health, but time and again I cannot help feeling that the Council considers market organisation and economic aspects to be much more compelling. And the moment, as you would put it, public hysteria breaks out, there is immediate concern about beef markets collapsing. Then you react. I would say to you with one small reservation, Mr President-in-Office, that I am very interested to know when those countries which have today agreed a universal ban on animal meal in feedingstuffs will open the door again by saying that animal meal is now being produced safely and we can feed it to animals once more. But I shall be very calm and wait for you to tell me something new here.</p>
<p class="contents">I will tell you exactly what we need, ladies and gentlemen – we need two things. The first is good legislation. We have already put large parts of this in place, and we are trying to take this further, and we need to act quickly. It is up to you to deliver this legislation quickly. Up to now the Council has acted as a very major brake on this. All 15 Members of the Council have dragged their feet. And I can tell you that worked very well, it was very effective. Once we have good legislation we need controls. That is why I am very grateful that our joint motion for a resolution, which I hope will be adopted almost unanimously tomorrow, contains a requirement for the Member States to report on their controls. I would like to know when Germany, France, Sweden, Austria and all the other countries have carried out health checks on the production of animal feed, and when veterinary checks have been carried out, and how many poor overworked veterinary officers there are, and whether you are recruiting any new ones at all.</p>
<p class="contents">If you are serious about all this, then you do not need a token Food Authority, which might prepare legislation on food safety, but which is not in a position to deliver what we can: good legislation and controls. That is your job, Mr President-in-Office. Madam President, I would be delighted if this were to be my last speech on this subject in this House, because we really must get this sorted out sooner or later!</p>

In this situation, the only way to break the cycle of BSE infection is to place a complete ban on the use of animal meal as feed. As long as it cannot be guaranteed that meal from deceased animals is not being mixed with animal meal that is free from infection, then all animal meal must be banned for use as feed.</p>
<p class="contents">One must not be wise after the event, but I find it extremely difficult in this debate not to think back to the beginning of the Nineties when, as the Swedish person responsible for the agricultural negotiations, I was forced to negotiate an opt-out because we in Sweden had a ban on the use of meal from deceased animals. We only just managed to obtain such an opt-out, but we managed it, even if we were laughed at to some extent and told that there was, of course, no danger. Now, no one is laughing any more. That was, in actual fact, how it was, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. You mentioned, of course, that a faulty production method was to blame and that it is for this reason that animal meal has been banned in France. That was why we, back home in Sweden, banned it a long time ago. It appeared that faulty is precisely what these production methods are, and they must be opposed from the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise a further couple of points. In the resolution that I hope will be voted through tomorrow, there are some very important points. The first is that it must be possible to trace every raw material in every type of food back through the chain. In a situation such as that which has now arisen in France, and also earlier on in many other countries, it is important to be able to tell consumers where the products they buy come from and how their origins can be traced. This is an extremely important requirement, especially where the specific issue of BSE is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is important to emphasise – and this is not some new idea – that anyone who consciously allows an animal that is sick, or that is suspected of being sick, to enter the food or feed chain is committing a criminal offence. Every food producer must be aware of this fact. Clearly, many people suffer, of course, in this situation, especially many farmers. In certain circumstances, it is necessary to slaughter the entire stock of animals, which must come as a real blow. It is also important to remember that the national systems for eradicating this terrible infection must include measures which properly compensate farmers for the financial losses they suffer in this connection. On this subject, I want to point out that those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party have tabled an amendment I hope will be voted through.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I just want to thank Commissioner Byrne, who I think is doing a good job on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The BSE crisis is now a public health problem, if not a problem of society. The Commission and the Council are unable to respond satisfactorily, with their hands on their hearts and the precautionary principle on their lips, at the same time confining themselves to an acute mania for meetings and to vague decisions. Countless measures may have been taken at a Community level, but they are either badly implemented or simply inadequate. We must move on to practical proposals and provide the necessary resources to implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">As a first step, our group is calling for the immediate imposition of systematic testing for BSE throughout the European Union and, at the same time, for the use of MBMs in animal feed to be completely suspended on a temporary basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Mr Böge, those who are claiming they have no incidence of mad cow disease on their territory are those who are not looking for it.</p>
<p class="contents">The practices of intensive farming have been the same everywhere. So we must have an exact overview of the situation, country by country.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is calling for an immediate ban on MBMs for all livestock as long as Member States are unable to guarantee the implementation of laws preventing BSE and the strict application of European directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Minister, we must have strict controls in order to guarantee that specified risk materials are separated out throughout the entire animal food chain. The Commission proposal to eliminate animal matter which cannot be consumed by humans from animal feed must also be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">MBMs which largely become, even if only temporarily, a new form of waste may be burnt in cement kilns or used to produce biogas. Replacement solutions exist as far as feed for livestock is concerned. MBMs make up but a small percentage of their diet, a fact we often forget. The grass in our meadows, white clover and vetch – currently neglected by the CAP – may provide satisfactory solutions for the safety of animal feed and human food.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible to save livestock production by reforming an agricultural economic system which, even today, makes farmers and consumers hostages to multinationals that are more interested in profit than in food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Policies must change this situation so that those who are really responsible for this crisis can be penalised and so that precise decisions can make it possible for a first step to be taken towards ending this tragic crisis. This is the thrust of the joint resolution. It is a heavy responsibility, but we were elected to take it on in full.</p>

<p class="contents">The work of this Parliament’s committee of enquiry contributed to the application of measures to protect consumer health: in particular by banning animal meal for cattle and through the compulsory labelling of beef. But fraud, negligence and the lack of adequate measures mean that the BSE crisis is still not under control, since new cases are being discovered all the time. Without becoming paranoid, we must recognise that the consumers’ concern is perfectly legitimate. My group believes that the health of consumers is an imperative which should have overriding priority over all other considerations. It is therefore urgent that measures are taken to reassure consumers and to restore their confidence in food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if this is a panacea, Commissioner but, in line with the precautionary principle, it seems to me that experience behoves us to ban, as of today, the use of animal meal in feed for livestock, including pigs, poultry and fish.</p>
<p class="contents">Detection tests must also be extended to all cattle entering the human food chain. The current crisis has led to a significant slump in sales and to a fall in prices, which are hurting livestock producers and all those involved in the beef sector. It is necessary both to restore consumer confidence and to help the livestock producers affected by the crisis. Selective aid, such as market support and a grass subsidy, are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">But, beyond the immediate future, should we not be reflecting on the mechanisms of the CAP? Are these not the very mechanisms which are at the root of the problem?</p>
<p class="contents">They have contributed to overly intensive production, which has harmed the environment and the quality of farm products. They therefore need to be reviewed. Perhaps it would be no bad thing if animals returned to traditional fodder. I feel like saying, “Yes, let them have a bit more grass.”</p>
<p class="contents">But the European Union must also encourage the production of oil seeds so that animal meal can be replaced by vegetable meal. To achieve this, there would have to be a re-examination of the 1993 GATT agreement, which prohibits the European Union producing more than 25% of its vegetable protein requirements so as to satisfy US exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not detail the horrors that have been committed on all sides. I find the debate that is underway in this Chamber, which consists in finding out which institution out of the Council, the Commission or Parliament has done the most and which the least, rather unnecessary. The reality is something else. The facts stand, and they are appalling. We were aware of the dangers of animal meal, we were aware of the dangers of specified risk materials. The scientific authorities clearly stated that the development of the disease in cattle was not under control and they pinpointed the alarming growth in the numbers of animals affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission has failed miserably. The labelling of beef that was agreed on, which is a minimum form of labelling and only came into force two and a half months ago, does not make it possible for the origin of animals to be adequately traced, and we were very slow to ban specified risk materials.</p>
<p class="contents">The management of the crisis has been terribly poor, and there were tragic shortcomings in our ability to anticipate the foreseeable consequences of the crisis. Where are the programmes to reduce the deficit of proteins in the European Union, to which reference was made a few moments ago? Where are the programmes to incinerate animal meal and animal waste and to implement obligatory testing throughout the European Union? The truth is that this is a problem affecting the European Union as a whole, not just a single country. The truth is that food quality has been sacrificed on the altar of productivity, the standardisation of lifestyles and flavourless products.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers used to have doubts about quality; today they worry about their own health. Our citizens know – because we cannot lie to people with impunity – that the crisis is serious. They know that if we are discovering sick animals in France, it is because we are looking for them, as was said earlier. We need far-reaching measures to be adopted at a national and European level if we want to avoid economic bankruptcy and a major health scare. We need to adopt the proposals put forward by the President-in-Office of the European Council, especially those banning animal meal in feed in all sectors of animal production.</p>
<p class="contents">But we also need two additional, comprehensive plans, and I am calling for their immediate implementation, because any delay through hesitation would exacerbate the health and economic risks. The measures adopted by the French Government in this regard are, as I said, inadequate. Firstly, as others have said before me, we must have systematic screening of all cattle slaughtered for consumption by European citizens. For more than a year, the European authorities have been examining three screening tests, including the French test, which is deemed to be the most reliable and the most sensitive. This test can be developed on an industrial scale very quickly. It has to be done, without hesitation and without delay, and on a massive scale. Just now, I heard reference being made to random tests. Random tests are not going to restore consumer confidence, or producer confidence for that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Public opinion must be fully informed of the characteristics of the test I am talking about. The French screening test for BSE was developed at the CEA (a public-sector research institute). In June it was assessed by Directorate General 24 of the European Commission, which is responsible for consumer protection, and, in July 1999, it was transferred to an industrial partner. This test was developed with a view to protecting the consumer, so that it could be extensively used in slaughterhouses, thus preventing animals dangerous to human health entering the food chain. The results of the European assessment, which were published in July 1999, suggest that it is 10 to 300 times more sensitive than the three other tests assessed at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">A new study undertaken in September 2000 has been evaluated by the European Commission. It confirms the preceding results in terms of sensitivity. The sensitivity of this test guarantees that contaminated animals cannot possibly enter the food chain. The result of the examination can be obtained within 5 hours, and the test can be made widely available, as hundreds of millions of samples a year can be produced easily. Its immediate widespread use in the veterinary laboratories of the French <span class="italic">departments</span> would simply require the allocation of sufficient human resources until it can be automated. The test exists, it is reliable, and it can be carried out on a massive scale. I hope I have convinced you that it needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Community farming needs to be reorganised to put our set-aside lands back into production so that we can grow soya, alfalfa and peas, which will give us the replacement proteins we are lacking and which will feed our animals much better than American GMOs. We sacrificed our soya, alfalfa and peas in the course of the COM negotiations in Marrakech. Well, the thing with poor agreements is that they should be challenged, especially when public health dictates this.</p>
<p class="contents">By displaying courage and ambition, we can combine the health interests of Europeans and the economic interests of our producers, and thereby restore confidence. This will only be possible if there is no longer any doubt in the public mind, in other words, if screening is, as I would insist, systematic. Unless there is mandatory general testing, confidence will not be restored, for confidence cannot be restored by decree; it has to be earned.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the reasons why my group has signed the motion for a resolution which will be presented to this House tomorrow, which, I hope, will be adopted with, if not a unanimous vote, at least a very large majority, so that everybody can be made aware that this Parliament is in direct touch with the problems affecting European citizens.</p>

What were the reactions at the time? Nothing but sarcastic comments and criticisms came from these benches and from the political class while the media maintained a scornful silence.</p>
<p class="contents">Back then, Mr President-in-Office, you did virtually nothing, just as your colleagues have done virtually nothing about the fallout from Chernobyl, the AIDS epidemic or contaminated blood, and always for the same reason: so as not to panic public opinion. The former Commissioner, Mr MacSharry, justified this criminal silence by claiming that the beef sector must not be put at risk and that consumers must not be panicked. Now, we are faced with a health and economic catastrophe of unparalleled proportions causing widespread panic amongst consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of predictable reactions from the public, you hastily pronounce a ban on animal meal for all animals, in line with the infamous precautionary principle. Despite the opinion of experts and scientists, who had shown that these MBMs were behind the development and transmission of the pathogenic agent for BSE, you forget to mention in your analysis that the situation is first and foremost due to Anglo-Saxon meal producers who, for commercial reasons, lowered the cooking temperature for MBMs.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, you also fail to mention that France continued to import possibly contaminated MBMs from the UK after 1989, the year in which they were banned, especially via Belgium. The result is a reflection of the impotence of the political class. There have been almost a hundred cases of BSE in France in 2000 and, so far, 80 people have died from variant CJD in the UK and two in France.</p>
<p class="contents">Minister, Commissioner, why has it been necessary to wait until 1 October 2000 before banning the specified risk materials in the European Union, even though they are highly infectious? Why wait until 1 January 2001 before bringing in the rapid screening tests which Mr Pasqua mentioned just now? And what about the labelling and traceability system, which will not be complete until 2003, despite the risks for consumers and the absence of a total guarantee for livestock producers?</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in a panic, you resign yourselves to action. But, faced with the crisis, it is necessary to guarantee health and food protection for consumers and an income for livestock producers, butchers, tripe butchers and wholesalers alike, all of whom are victims of the negligence of the public authorities, at both national and Community level. These people are in no way responsible for the crisis, which is why the European Union must show solidarity with them.</p>
<p class="contents">We must condemn those who are really responsible for the crisis – the Anglo-American producers of MBMs – and we must, if necessary, prosecute them if they were aware of the dangers they were causing. We must acknowledge the special responsibility of the Commission, as called for by the committee of enquiry of this Parliament. There are four real causes of this situation: unchecked profiteering; the violation of natural laws which hoped to turn herbivores into carnivores; the watering down of responsibilities, by transferring sovereignty from nation states to the Brussels eurocracy and finally, your policy of untrammelled free-trade. These are the real causes of the crisis, and it is only by tackling these causes that you will be able to permanently solve this appalling problem, which you helped to create. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Farage (EDD).</span></span>   – Madam President, on behalf of all livestock producers may I express my deep concern at the French Government ban on meat-and-bone meal in animal feed. Although a French action, it has widespread international implications. The main substitute for MBM is soya protein. The French ban will create a massive increase in demand, yet supply of this commodity is limited. The result will be exceptionally heavy pressure on prices. Finished animal feed costs throughout Europe could rise by as much as 20 or 30%. Since feed costs amount to 60% of overheads, producers will be heavily squeezed. This may prove to be the last straw for thousands of small pig-farming businesses. Furthermore, the ban creates considerable stress in the slaughtering sector. Waste products could be sold to processors for £25 a ton. They now cost £75 a ton for disposal. For a medium-sized slaughterhouse killing 2,500 pigs a week, this adds £120,000 a year to costs, very little of which can be recouped.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the way out, more funding of the agricultural sector is not the solution. We need species-specific feedmeals dedicated to specific livestock sectors so that MBM can continue to be supplied to the pig and poultry markets without fear of cross-contamination to the bovine sector. If that can be done, there will be no need for a continuing ban or for extra subsidies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I too do not accept the arrogance of certain Member States which, since they do not apply the tests, are not pushing for regulations. This is unacceptable. If France is now in the situation in which it finds itself, it is because it practises controls which do not exist elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, it is not just a matter of a crisis in the beef sector, it is a public health problem, and we are also faced with an economic crisis. The health of European consumers must be a top priority in all decisions that are adopted. The entire food chain is at the heart of this problem. Consumers have lost confidence and, in order to contain this phenomenon, there must be systematic BSE tests on cattle and sheep. Farmers themselves are demanding them. Adopting emergency measures and common sense measures by banning the use of MBMs for all species would indeed be a practical application of the precautionary principle!</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have always had a great deal of confidence in you, but I do not understand why you are being so reluctant to act. How can you imagine that you are applying the precautionary principle if you are refusing to ban MBMs? Mr Byrne, you are well aware that no MBMs are completely safe. It is by adopting measures of this kind that consumers will be reassured and that farmers who support this idea, especially as voiced by their unions, will hear the message of solidarity that we want to send them.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no scientific certainties with regard to the transmission of the disease to other species. But what we are certain of is that we must restore consumer confidence and support the farming sector. Let nobody tell me that we cannot destroy MBMs!</p>
<p class="contents">We have wasted a lot of time. We should have put the necessary tools to incinerate these meals in place years ago. Let nobody tell me that we are unable to replace these MBMs!</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am sorry that your colleague responsible for agriculture is not here and that he does not have the courage to face us and to explain that it is necessary to completely overhaul the common agricultural policy. I condemn the limitations and the worrying consequences of this policy. A reform of the CAP is not just necessary, it is indispensable, because it is intolerable that a European country should adopt draconian measures and jeopardise its economy. European solidarity must also play a role, because our policy has exposed its inconsistencies: set-aside, animal meal for cattle, nitrates, pesticides. The CAP must be reorganised to encourage farmers. Production must be improved, and the budget of the CAP must be used to reorganise this policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of this is to avoid not only microbiological but also chemical contamination of feedingstuffs in future.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the scope of this proposal is already wide, and it takes account of the precautionary principle. In the interests of a sustainable closed substance cycle it should still be possible to use properly tested animal materials deemed fit for human consumption in the production of feedingstuffs. We have to be realistic. There is no scientific justification for a general ban on using animal meal for all animals. Why should it cover pigs, poultry and fish, as some Member States and some Members here have been demanding?</p>
<p class="contents">If you take the arguments of some Members of this House to their logical conclusion, you would also have to ban sales of wild boar meat. What is far more important, in the spirit of the Commission proposal, is to work towards ensuring that animal meal complies with the highest safety standards. Farms and factories that do not at present apply the highest technological standards to animal meal production should have their production licence withdrawn until they can demonstrate that they are meeting those standards. Regular and strict checks of technological standards and compliance with legislation on animal meal production should form part of a comprehensive safety concept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has led to the resignation of a Commission, a British government was voted out partly because of it and now there is an internal policy crisis in France – who knows where it will all end! There are people and countries who are using the BSE crisis as a political instrument. For example, the president of one country has stood up and announced that no more animal meal is to be used as animal feed – animal meal that should never have been fed to animals in the first place, because France has not complied with the standards. And the health minister of one of Germany's <span class="italic">Länder</span> recently stated that she was demanding a new import ban on English and French beef. This minister had refused to introduce the tests which we called for in association with lifting this ban. That would have given us tests in Germany and thus, scientific proof, either that there is no BSE or that cases do actually exist. Had that happened, we would not now be complaining that we have been put in an undesirable category just because we asserted that we were BSE-free. Then Mr Gollnisch turns round and tells this House that his group has been spearheading the BSE debate. Mr Gollnisch, I do not recall your group contributing to the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into BSE. You played no part in it whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Then the President-in-Office comes along and tells this House what measures he now intends to take. Of course, what you say is quite right, Mr President-in-Office. But what you told us goes without saying, it is blindingly obvious! It is European law! We urgently need to give the Commission the mechanisms it requires, and that is something that should be done in Nice. And if new threats arise in future – Mr Böge has already referred to this – the Commission needs powers to close down factories, negotiate and impose sanctions immediately, so that years do not have to pass before we recognise what needs to be done in scientific and political terms and take action! That is the real scandal, and this is not, for the moment at least, a matter for the Commission. We have to recognise that, Mr Byrne, and I welcome your contribution today. But it was indeed a matter for the Commission at one point! Now it is down to the Member States, who do not want to implement the legislation! We have a key role to play in exerting pressure here.</p>
<p class="contents">This is now a European problem. That is why I have taken the liberty of talking about France and Germany, because we have to recognise that this is a European problem and stop indulging in national squabbling! We need to establish a precautionary policy for the European public as a whole, and we have done that in a solid and rational way here. I accordingly welcome the motion for a resolution. We have not let ourselves be lured into calling for a total ban on animal meal, because in that case we would have had to call for a total ban on meat, because if what is deemed fit for us to eat can no longer be fed to animals, that is not just nonsense, it is political populism! We need to steer clear of that and to carry on working in the same sensible way as before!</p>

I tabled a question on the danger of BSE in December 1995, three months before the scandal broke. The Commission replied to the effect that there was absolutely no problem and no cause for concern. So a little modesty is in order, I think.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a question for the Commission: have you measured the cost today of the current policy of cheap meat-and-bone meal and the cost of doing away with it and supporting vegetable production? I am no longer so sure that meat-and-bone meal, together with the cost of controls and the risks, is any cheaper.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the whole House is talking about controls. When did the Commission carry out controls? Does it have the capacity to do so? Which countries have been referred to the European Court for failing to apply the law? For example, Madam President, for failing to comply with beef labelling, on which I acted as Parliament's rapporteur. Does every country apply it? I have yet to see labels in Athens. Has the Commission referred anyone to the European Court? I am sure that we would be most interested in knowing so that we could continue the debate.</p>

All this must be carried out in a climate of transparency and regularity so that the citizens do not feel that they are being swindled or sacrificed on the altar of major economic interests. We must prevent animals suffering from BSE entering the food chain. We therefore need to develop an effective control system in all the Member States of the European Union. It is becoming vital to stop using meat-and-bone meal until it is proven unequivocally that using these feedingstuffs will not spread the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">The panic spreading throughout the public is destroying an entire sector, and those who are least to blame – the breeders – are worst affected, for it is precisely the breeders, and not those responsible, who are the victims of the situation. Breeders feed their livestock on products supplied by the industries, and a similar situation occurred in Belgium a few months ago with the matter of dioxins in chickens. We call for financial subsidies to assist breeders so that they do not have to bear all the costs of the crisis. We also feel that it would be appropriate to ensure that every outbreak of the disease is contained and to place a ban on the export of meat until such time as it is proven to be safe to eat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have talked enough about the procedural aspect and the ins and outs of the whole BSE issue. A trialogue on Budget 2001 is due to start tomorrow. Yesterday, the coordinators of the various parties in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development lent their support to the proposal to earmark EUR 600 million of the EUR 1.3 billion still available in the agricultural budget for the fight against BSE. I understand that it would cost upwards of EUR 150 million to test all slaughtered cows older than two years in the European Union. Well then, Council and Commission, you have a fair amount of financial leeway on which to base your robust policy. Let there be no more discussion of this 600 million in the negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The scope is there in the budget, you have Parliament’s backing on this, and now that everything is in place, it is up to you to see that the funds needed for a robust BSE policy actually hit the mark.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark concerns the procedures. It is noticeable that there is still no official mention of BSE on the official agenda of the Council of Agriculture Ministers due to take place this coming Monday and Tuesday. I ask myself how this is possible when last week, on Wednesday 8 November, the European cattle farmers in the COPA association came together for emergency consultations and proposed robust measures? How can consumer organisations really make their voices heard? We are obviously giving the impression in this public debate that we move at snail’s pace when it comes to the implementation of policy by the Council and the Commission, which is totally unacceptable. I urge you to pursue a robust policy, or a different one at any rate.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of points have been made about the implementation of legislation. I would remind you though, that no human being can go without food, not for a single day. On no account should we fail to give this priority its due from the political perspective. Should it already be a problem with regard to inadequate levels of protein and other products, then I can assure you that European agriculture has sufficient potential to absorb this, also with regard to cattle feed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As an Englishman, I welcome the measures the French have taken. There is a general acknowledgement that BSE, which began as a British disease and today is being presented as a French crisis, is really a European disease – a European problem – and it must be tackled on that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">There should not be any recriminations between the nation states or between different generations of government on this issue. We must tackle this. The Minister said that MBM was a low-cost foodstuff. It is not a low-cost food stuff if it helps to spread BSE and its human derivative. That is the essential problem here today.</p>
<p class="contents">Many speakers have said that we need to extend the ban on meat-and-bone meal as a mammalian food stuff. The UK already bans it from all farm livestock. Our own Food Standards Agency will be pronouncing very soon on intra-species recycling, and I hope they will condemn it also. We need to take these precautions, and we need to take them quickly for the benefit of all the countries of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Byrne did not say very much today, as he was widely trailed to have done, about testing. I am glad that we are still looking at the extension of testing on an experimental basis. There are still doubts about the validity of tests, particularly on younger animals, and we have heard from other speakers about the huge size of the herd in Europe that would have to be tested even if old animals are to be taken out of the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must make greater speed in urging the Council to act on our behalf. Everyone has said that and everyone knows it to be true. You must move. We have just heard that it took four years to agree a ban on SRMs in the food chain. We do not have another four years. We may not have another one year. We must take precautions now, not just on behalf of those of us who are concerned, but on behalf of the complacent minority of Member States as well. It is for their benefit that we do it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would just like to remind certain people that the Greens were indeed alone when, at the top of their voices, they called for the reform of the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to BSE, I welcome the French decision, but the Presidency must not forget that it too must assume its responsibilities as far as food safety at the European level is concerned. I would like to make two points in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that neither the Council nor the Commission has stressed the absolute and immediate need to bring grass and oil seed subsidies in line with those for cereals in order to avoid genetically modified soya being used to make up for the lack of proteins next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that criminal and fraudulent acts should not continue to go unpunished. It is outrageous that, after three BSE crises in the space of a decade, no guilty party has been identified or brought to book. This impunity cannot go on. That is why I am calling on the European Union to carry out the necessary investigations among manufacturers of MBMs and knackers in order to find those responsible for these health, economic and social disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, to respond to the justified and very demanding need of European consumers for food safety, we are going to place the bar of controls and precautions at an extremely high level. But if we introduce generalised screening tests, if we destroy MBMs, if we impose the slaughter of an entire herd for just one sick animal, we must demand strictly equivalent health standards from the third countries who are our commercial partners and who seek to export live animals, carcasses and meat products to the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, even before this crisis, the Community suffered a serious deficit in vegetable proteins, since we accepted, at Blair House, an incredible limitation on our oil-seed production to 30% of our requirements, just to please the United States and its soya exporters. Now, the Community cannot cultivate more than 5.5 million hectares of oil seeds, nor does it have the right to do so, even though our needs are in the order of 18 million hectares. That is why food manufacturers have had to make extensive use of MBMs in their products. In the future, when these MBMs are banned, we are going to need millions of additional hectares of oil seed crops.</p>
<p class="contents">This crisis underscores the absurd nature of the concessions made by the European Union within the framework of the GATT. We denounced this here in Parliament, when Jimmy Goldsmith was here. We have the land, the climate and the necessary knowledge to immediately replace MBMs with non-genetically modified vegetable protein, but instead, while financing set-aside, we have given up the right to grow, on our own land, the vegetable proteins we urgently need to feed our animals and our people.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our group has tabled an amendment calling on the Council and the Commission to find ways of re-launching, in Europe, the farming of vegetable proteins to replace, to great advantage, prion-ridden MBMs and transgenic American soya. We also ask that the disastrous Blair House Agreement, which binds our oil seed producers hand and foot, should be renegotiated within the framework of the COM.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is the duty of the Community to come to the assistance of all the beef sector operators who are the victims of the profound destabilisation of their markets in order to help them fund the costs of obligatory testing and the destruction of animal residues which have been withdrawn from the food chain, as well as the costs of vital promotion measures. Otherwise, there will no longer be any point in talking about a common agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have already heard many times today that the real problem facing us is to implement the decisions we have already taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Byrne, I am extremely grateful that so far you have made excellent progress in putting into practice the undertaking that you gave when you were appointed. You have brought forward proposals such as the White Paper and the hygiene regulations, and I can assure you that Parliament will deal swiftly with those hygiene regulations. We will work quickly enough for them to be effectively implemented in the new few years. But I am not aware of anything happening at Council level here. There are only declarations and opinions, but no decisions as regards directives or regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">What I find incredible is this tug of war in the Council over meat exports and imports. This seems to be all about emotions. The public's feelings have really been whipped up, with the sole aim of securing the market for each country's own beef. Nothing else has happened! Now emotions are being stirred up again with dramatic announcements about banning animal meal as feed for all animals. If you would only implement what we agreed, then you would not need to worry about all this any more. It reminds me of witch-hunts in the Middle Ages. We are pursuing "sinners" who are not guilty at all. The causes are to be found somewhere else altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to suggest rapid introduction of these tests that you too are proposing, Commissioner, and not as spot checks, but for every animal slaughtered, without any age restrictions. Only then can we say to the public "This meat has been tested and you can eat it". There really is no better solution. I have worked out the cost – 10 cents per kilo. So we do not need to argue here about millions of euros – every member of the public will happily pay this, I am quite sure of that! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is intolerable that raw materials or compound feedingstuffs should be dangerous for animals or human beings. Man's food must be safe to eat. At this time, in addition to the developments and progress in our legislation, we must send the citizens a loud, unambiguous message. We must reassure the public that the Europe of rights does genuinely protect the rights enshrined in its Treaties and in the Fundamental Charter of European Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure, Commissioner, that Parliament will lend you all the support necessary for the new initiatives. We need clear measures. I feel that, until it is proved otherwise, a total ban on meat-and-bone meal has become necessary, just as the introduction of general testing and the harmonisation and effective implementation of Community legislation in all the Member States is necessary, and just as it is necessary not just to monitor the application of new labelling rules but to bring forward the introduction of these rules to the earliest possible juncture.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by affirming this principle: the cost of these measures will certainly be very high, but our priority is health. Secondly, without these guarantees, the fall in consumption will impact negatively upon the entire industry. Therefore, consumers and producers must unite to obtain greater guarantees of the inviolable principle that food should be healthy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, I urge you to ensure that these tests are also carried out in other Member States. It is not acceptable if Germany, for example, does not introduce universal testing, but just tests in North Rhine-Westphalia, for fear of no longer having BSE-free status. That cannot, of course, be allowed to happen and I can therefore only hope that the Commission will exert the strongest pressure on those Member States that do not carry out tests because they are afraid of losing their BSE-free status. This amounts to deliberately putting consumers at risk and, as such, is unacceptable. What we need here is a wide-ranging information campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I firmly refute the Commission's suggestion that banning the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs now is panic-mongering. Quite the contrary! I think that France has set an excellent example by finally deciding to take this step. I find it bordering on the cynical, Mr Byrne, when you say that this should not happen on environmental grounds. You cannot in all seriousness expect us to eat hazardous waste just to solve the waste disposal problem!</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I regard it as somewhat shameful that there is so much talk here about compensating farmers and animal breeders.

My reply to you is that we do not need magic solutions, we need two things: first, we need to accept that health, i.e. public health, takes priority over every other policy. Once we have accepted this, not just proclaimed it but believe in it, then we come to the second element, which is the question of political will. Let me assure you that, if we had had the political will then, we would not be facing this problem now, because we all know what has caused it. We know all about meat-and-bone meal and we know that there are tests and that we can find the animals from herds which need to be destroyed in order to deal with the problem. We know all that. What is preventing us from acting and why must there always be a crisis for us to come here and confirm that we, the European Parliament, believe that public health is the number one priority?</p>
<p class="contents">And you are saying the same, but just how well has the Council understood it? Because, basically, at some point we seem to be unable to act. We seem to be unable to apply what we know. And we all know that prevention is the best cure. Except that there is no cure here. We know that this epizootic disease brings terrible suffering and tragic consequences in its wake but we do not know where they will lead us. Because not all its epidemiological elements have been identified. So we are playing with fire. And what amazes me is that we come here and repeat the same things over and over again. I have listened to my fellow members. They are all right in what they say. Our aim must be to apply it. We want application, members of the Council, we want action and we want it throughout the European Union; we do not want fragmented action by France or this or that country. It must be taken everywhere and it must be taken at once. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor is it a coincidence that the President-in-Office and the Commissioner refrained from mentioning the main source of all of these problems in the food chain, which is, of course, the common agricultural policy itself. Parliament has voted half the budget to be spent on encouraging production. Today’s modern farmers are not what they produce; they are what they are able to produce whilst maintaining quality and safety. But you are not helping them to achieve this! I say this because you only help large-scale producers and, as a consequence, you spend a large part of the budget on encouraging these very problems! These problems and those that will follow! You do not, however, want to accept the principle of doing away with animal feedingstuffs that contain the remains of other animals…</p>
<p class="contents">We have already discussed the United Kingdom and Portugal in this Chamber and now we are discussing France. I am now waiting for the Commissioner to announce the next case, because we will have reached this point within a year with another country and further cases. The fundamental issue is that the President-in-Office and the Commissioner must accept that a policy guided by post-war principles is no longer possible today and is no longer acceptable. You must end all aid for production and instead help to bring about quality, food safety and the conservation of resources. Otherwise, we will not have a food chain that can provide guarantees for consumers. We will be perpetuating the fraudulent treatment of both farmers and consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same goes for those dreadful pictures of people affected by the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, despite all the action taken in the Member States, not to mention at EU level. The debate we are having today on the consequences of the BSE crisis and how we can actually tackle them, is dealing with some very crucial issues. Firstly, there is the issue of the tests that need to be carried out, and I welcome the fact that we are not going to stipulate a specific age for them. Secondly, there is the question as to whether it is acceptable to use bonemeal in cattle feed, which has been the subject of lively debate here in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">The link between feeding cattle bonemeal – which is, as it happens a very unnatural way to feed animals – and BSE is now clear to everyone. So action is called for. In the Netherlands, the legislation governing the use of offal in animal feed is already relatively stringent as matters stand. There has been a ban on using proteins from mammals and ruminants in animal feed destined for ruminants since as early as 1989. What is more, this regulation is continually tightened up and complies with requirements made at European level. The use of fat and blood is also subject to strict rules. Therefore, I am amazed, under these circumstances, that it is still permissible for corpses to be used or processed.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there is no evidence of an absolute risk, I welcome the Dutch proposal to place a complete ban on the use of meat in animal feeds with effect from 1 July 2001. We cannot afford, in the light of past events, to allow this offal to enter the food chain, no matter what. Together with my fellow honourable Members, I advocate that we do not wait until July 2001, but enforce this ban now, with almost immediate effect.</p>
<p class="contents">There is clearly a need for stringent European measures. So not just national measures, because the functioning of the internal market will be seriously disrupted if we constantly leave it to the national governments to decide to what extent the use of offal in animal feed should be banned. Therefore, for the sake of the internal market, and in order to boost consumer confidence, I would advocate a complete and immediate ban. I would also ask the Commissioner to initiate something of a uniform European approach to the issue of animal corpses and the collection thereof. There are increasing incidences, also in my own country, of dead sheep or calves simply being left behind because it costs too much to have them collected.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I would ask the Commission to work towards a degree of harmonisation on this score too. If it is not going to do so now, then could it at least put this in writing before long, so that we know where we stand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Parish (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Madam President, I speak today both as an MEP and a beef farmer from the United Kingdom. The farming industry in Britain has suffered greatly from the BSE crisis, both financially and in terms of consumer confidence. However, we have learnt a great deal over the years as to how to put our house in order. We now have a belt-and-braces system for the safety of our beef. Recently, the Phillips inquiry into BSE has been published in the UK. I am pleased that you, Commissioner Byrne, have read that report. I hope that you will act on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Government should also read this report because they are in danger of making exactly the same mistakes as were made in the UK at the time of our BSE crisis. But we now have the benefit of hindsight. I suggest that the French Government should learn from us. I have never been convinced by the argument put forward by France that the whole-herd slaughter policy was the right way to tackle outbreaks of BSE in their country.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent problem in Normandy of an infected animal being presented as a healthy animal highlights the resistance there is in the farming community to having their entire herds slaughtered. Furthermore, the recent tests that have been carried out in France of fallen stock have shown several hidden cases of BSE. I have long been suspicious that in order to avoid having their whole herds slaughtered animals have been secretly shot and buried on farms in France.</p>
<p class="contents">The British system of removing infected animals from the herds and paying good compensation for those animals encourages farmers to declare their cases of BSE. I call upon the European Commission to carry out a total review of the systems that are in place in France to deal with cases of BSE.</p>
<p class="contents">In Britain we have also learnt that it is very difficult to stop meat-and-bone meal, that is produced and incorporated in the feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry, also – either by accident or by intention – landing up in feed for cattle and ruminants. It is very difficult for a feed mill to guarantee that its production lines are completely cleared of meat-and-bone meal before they start manufacturing feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry. I have long been of the opinion that a complete ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal in animal feeds should be in place throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">France has recently introduced a ban on beef on the bone and many French provinces have stopped school children from consuming home-grown beef. One of the main reasons for this action is that the French Food Agency takes the precautionary principle very seriously. I would suggest that the European Commission also use the precautionary principle in regard to beef from France. Until such time as the French Government can guarantee the absolute safety of their beef the Commission should ban all exports from France to the rest of the Community, especially from beef animals that are over 30 months of age.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, at the moment, £2 million worth of French beef for the meat processing industry consumed in the UK. This is totally unacceptable considering the problems regarding BSE in France.</p>
<p class="contents">Over a year ago, 16 of Europe's best scientists, including a French chairman, declared British beef safe for consumption throughout Europe, and yet France has illegally maintained a ban on the importation of British beef. It is total hypocrisy for France to maintain its ban on British beef. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say, on behalf of the farming community, that they are the people at whom the finger is often pointed, but they are not to blame. Commissioner Byrne was very strong today in his opening statement when he said to the House that he was prepared to look at this matter of meat-and-bone meal and take it on.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to him today as he has listened to this debate: does he not realise that this is something that must be taken on immediately? As the previous speaker has just said, the only way to deal with banning meat-and-bone meal is to have an entire ban otherwise it cannot be policed. As a result, the poison goes into the system and, as it does, it destroys the system.</p>
<p class="contents">I make a special appeal to the Commissioner today to take note of what has been said, practically across the board in this debate, and move quickly and speedily to impose a ban on all meat-and-bone meal in the European Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The main thing now is not to be accusing people of delaying implementing regulations or establishing responsibilities, but rather, to have a common imperative, that of ensuring food safety. It is a legitimate demand on the part of all European consumers. It is imperative upon government authorities, be they national or European. I believe that we must now try, following your debates, to define the key ways, in terms of both method and means, in order to ensure compliance with this imperative.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency believes that this method is based on scientific research and consultation. As there is still a lot of uncertainty, we must know what the scientific facts are and what action must be taken. We must also study the feasibility of these measures, and that involves processing MBMs and setting up tests. The speedy implementation of these means comes next, and finally monitoring. You have dealt with all these problems in turn.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the last item, monitoring, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his comments, which demonstrated the Commission’s open-mindedness and showed that it was possible to study all these problems and to set up the European Food Agency quickly. Monitoring can never be anything more than monitoring, however, and if there is still even the slightest possibility that there may have been fraud or embezzlement, or errors of use, this doubt, however tiny it may be, sticks in people’s minds and sometimes brings the entire sector into disrepute.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as carrying out generalised testing is concerned, I believe, certainly, that we must increase the number of tests, as indeed you have all called for. Some countries have already gone down this road. We hope that the number of tests carried out on the targeted cattle and sheep populations will increase. I cannot currently see, however, how it will be possible, given the resources available to each of the Member States, to carry out 28 million tests a year, in either technical or financial terms with any degree of effectiveness. What is more, these tests, however good they are, will still leave a margin of doubt since even the best tests, and these have been highlighted, only make it possible to detect the presence of the disease in the last months of incubation, just before it turns into the full-blown disease, and not right at the start. So there are doubts, there are uncertainties, but I believe that our joint text and your debates here in this House have enabled us to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end I listened most attentively to all your speeches, and it seems to me appropriate and crucial that the debate on the safety of our citizens is settled at the European level. It is indeed difficult to have national legislations and a European legislation existing side by side. I believe we should have a single, comprehensive set of laws, which can be applied to meet this demand and thereby avoid distortions of competition, thus making it possible for the single market to operate smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">Rest assured that, when it comes to continuing the work in the Council and my exchanges with the Commission, I will bear all this in mind, in the full knowledge that reaching agreement within the institutions is one of the best ways of dealing with a problem as complex and universal as that of food safety. On 30 November, during the Council meeting, the French Presidency will launch an important debate with a view to providing the first responses to a situation of widespread suspicion, which calls into question the credibility of our institutions in the eyes of our citizens. We are talking about public health, and hence of serious events, which must be treated as such, in a strict and, of course, transparent manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, rest assured that, in the twofold undertaking which has fallen to us (in which, I will see to it, the Council will play its part to the full), I am determined to restore consumer confidence and to strengthen the credibility of the European institutions. Each of you here has sought to question or to refer to the survival of the common agricultural policy. Some of you have spoken of the inordinate emphasis placed on productivity and the possibility of going back on the Blair House Agreements, which can only take place in the context of the new round of COM talks.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened to all these proposals – I am not insensitive to them. I shall wait for the results of your debates and I am convinced that we will be able to tackle this safety imperative together, and that we will be able together to find ways and means to guarantee the safety of our fellow citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One thing I can say with conviction is that I am aware that all these people before me are experts on the question of food safety. Many of you have been involved in this issue for quite a number of years, particularly in the formidable committee that sat a number of years ago on this question. Indeed you have been involved in this issue longer than I have. I know the commitment that all of you have to it. Therefore, this debate has been of considerable interest and value to me as a Member of the Commission with responsibility for public health and consumer protection, and special responsibility for food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I am struck by one thing that is particularly important in this context, that is, that the spectrum of debate, particularly on the issue of whether there should be a total ban on meat-and-bone meal goes all the way from "do it" to "don't do it" – in a Chamber filled with experts on food safety. That is one of the issues that we have to address.</p>
<p class="contents">What we must bear in mind when considering this issue is the fact that there is already in existence a ban on the provision of meat-and-bone meal to cattle. That ban is in place. That is the law and that is what should be complied with. In addition, there is legislation in place setting out how the meat-and-bone meal, how this feed, is to be processed – another safeguard that is introduced into the system to protect public health and food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">By saying that you must ban meat-and-bone meal from feed for pigs and poultry that cannot contract BSE by this vector, what you are saying is not that you are protecting pigs and poultry, but that you are protecting cattle. You are therefore saying that the legislation that is in place is in some way inadequate or not being complied with. If there is a belief that there is a widespread disregard for the law on this issue, what does that say about what has been happening over the last few months and years in relation to feed for cattle? It raises the question that I am afraid to even ask. Ask yourselves what is the answer to that question.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there has been compliance with the legislation and if I believe that – and I do not think I am being naïve – I do not believe that it is essential to have a widespread ban on meat-and-bone meal to be fed to pigs and poultry. But I am willing to listen to the evidence on this issue. If people from Member States come and tell me that the legislation has not been properly or fully implemented then maybe we will have to think again, but it will not be because the scientists tell us it is necessary, but because there is a failure to comply with the law in the European Union. That is an issue we must seriously reflect on.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me move on to the question of testing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Whitehead asked me for more details in relation to this and I think he is correct in that I should have stressed this a bit more in what I had to say.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two kinds of testing involved here. Firstly there is the one already in place, legislation having been brought before Parliament some time ago by the Commission for random post-mortem testing throughout the Member States amounting to 170 000 tests. The purpose of those tests was to identify the level of infectivity in the European Union. It was to get information. I welcome the fact that France moved quickly and, before any other Member State, started doing this work at a higher level than was set out in the legislation. Now it is getting this information. Therefore it is faced with the current situation. It has been fully transparent in the provision of information relating to these tests. That is also to be welcomed and applauded.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us reflect on another issue here which causes me some concern. If there is a widespread adverse reaction against the authorities in France for doing the right thing, I hope it does not instil timidity in other Member States when they do exactly the same. If they conduct the tests in a similar way to France, ensuring that they focus on animals that are most at risk, and carry out the number of tests that are required, we will get exactly the kind of information that France has and that will be available right throughout the European Union so we can make the required decisions and move on.</p>
<p class="contents">The tests that I am referring to now are somewhat different. They are not intended to give us information relating to the level of infectivity. They are more focused on the question of trying to keep out of the food chain carcasses that may be infected. It has been said that this will be very expensive, will involve a large number of carcasses and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us focus on facts. The three tests available – French, Swiss and Irish – are unable to detect BSE in animals under a certain age. The result will be negative. You will go to the expense and trouble of carrying out those tests and you will get negative findings. Therefore, what is the value of carrying out those tests on young animals? None in my opinion. But we also have the weight of scientific evidence that animals under a certain age do not manifest symptoms of BSE. Therefore, I have asked the Standing Veterinary Committee, sitting today as we speak, to examine this issue to determine at what age these tests should be carried out. What I am talking about is carrying out these tests on carcasses of animals over a certain age to detect whether infectivity exists and, if it does, eliminate the animal from the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a situation of younger animals where there is no BSE, we are told by the scientists, and the older animals above that certain age, all of them having been tested to determine whether there is BSE or not, and they are eliminated from the food chain. This is a consumer protection measure and also a measure to enhance consumer confidence. That is why I have suggested that we take this route and I am looking forward to the advice we get from the SVC this afternoon which I intend to bring before the Council of Ministers next week to discuss this particular issue in relation to the question of the age at which the demarcation should take place.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that is the right way forward. There are a number of disputes on this and, as I see in this Chamber, there are different views in relation to it, but it is important that we row together on this. It is important that we try and achieve a consensus as to the right way forward and find proportionate responses and not make accusations to others who, when they identify a proportionate response, say that you are not doing enough to protect consumer public health and consumer protection. It is legitimate to draw lines in circumstances where you are fairly sure of the line you are drawing in the sand – safe on one side and not on the other. We must make sure we are fair to one another in identifying these measures which all of us believe to be necessary, because the aim of this exercise is the protection of public health and food safety and the enhancement of consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I listened with great interest to my friend, Mr Patriat's, comments both earlier and just now and I look forward to working closely with him in relation to these issues over the next number of weeks. I should tell you that he and I have had a discussion on this very issue as recently as last week in Paris, so I am confident that Parliament, the Council and the Commissioner can work together in a non-acrimonious manner to produce answers to this serious difficulty that we are faced with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
