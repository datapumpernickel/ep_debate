<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lagendijk (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, it has taken the Commission a while to produce a final proposal on the delivery of aid to the western Balkans. As is known, a proposal was submitted back in May but we had to wait until September before there was a definitive proposal on the table. This had to do with the discussion within the Commission on the need to find an alternative way of delivering external aid. In other words, the proposal now on the table reflects this discussion, and as I see it, is also a first example of how we should do things in the future. This also means that the Commission’s new proposal was worth waiting for, because it sets out in clear and lucid terms how the European Commission proposes to deliver aid in future, both with regard to the general regulation for the Balkans and with regard to the proposal for the agency in Kosovo. To put it in a slightly grand way, perhaps it can also be deemed a kind of fresh start for the delivery of aid, based on the extraordinarily negative experiences we had in Bosnia, but also on our positive experiences in Kosovo. There is now a regulation on the table which, as I see it, equips the European Union to deliver aid in an efficient manner and on time, and to put EU funds to good use in the countries of the western Balkans. In this way, and this is very important – I will come back to it again shortly – a good balance has been struck between the Commission’s responsibility on the one hand and the need to involve the Member States in some way, on the other. It is a balance which, in my opinion, and I think also in the Commission’s view, could not always be found in the past, because all too often the Member States tried to get in on the act when it came to delivering aid. The proposals now on the table have been far more successful in striking this balance. Naturally, and I am coming now to the reports compiled by myself and by Mr Westendorp, there is room for improvement. Anyone who sees and reads the proposed reports will see that a number of improvements have been proposed to certain sections. For example, explicit attention is to be given to the construction of the civilian society, support for the media, and the important role fulfilled by education. I happened to be at a conference in Zagreb last week, when once again it became evident how important it is not to teach future generations of mini Balkans citizens – as it were – old stereotypes, or inculcate them with notions of ‘the enemy’, and instead, to made a fresh start in this respect. I think it is important for the regulation to establish that the Commission will continue to spend money on this kind of project in the future, as it does now. However, there are two key aspects of policy I would like to focus on.</p>
<p class="contents">The first relates – and I am sorry to have to bother the Commissioner with this again – to the finances. To be perfectly honest, if we manage to deliver a sound opinion on this regulation, today and tomorrow, then we will have completed one part of our work; the first half I would say. Then we will have it down on paper how things are supposed to be done in future. However, if, when it comes to December, we do not include the funds required to implement the regulation then all we are doing today is building castles in the air. This is not a reproach directed at the Commission. The Commission has been in a position to see that I am expressly calling for the assessment of the costs carried out by the Commission – the famous EUR 5.5 billion for the next seven years – to be explicitly included in this regulation, otherwise, to be blunt about it, what we are doing is pure hypocrisy. We cannot adopt a regulation here in Parliament knowing full well that the funds required to implement it will not be available. That is why this is stage one of the battle for an effective system of delivering aid to the Balkans. Stage two will take place in December when our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets, but ultimately Parliament as a whole, will have to opt for a sound financial basis for this regulation. That being the case, it is a shame that Mr Moscovici is absent at present, because as I see it, responsibility on that point falls specifically to the Council, and to the Member States, who must be prepared to recognise that what we, and what they, want to achieve through this regulation costs money, and that this money must be found in the European Union’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point, the general point about delivering aid, concerns the balance that must be struck – hence the need for an amendment on this point – between the need for the European Union to maintain a high profile in the Balkans, on the one hand, and the need to support smaller projects as well, on the other. The fact of the matter is – and anyone who has been to the Balkans will confirm this – that the United States is extremely good at creating the impression that it is able to do a great deal more with a good deal less money. The fact that the European Union actually spends far more money but is nothing like as high profile, has led many people to conclude that there is a need to substantially raise people’s awareness of our activities in the Balkans. I would agree with this analysis. This almost inevitably means that a great deal of money will go to the large projects, i.e. to road and bridge building projects; to projects that can fly the flag for Europe. As I said, we need to do this to raise our profile. But be warned, this must not lead to a situation where, when it comes to drawing up priorities, all kinds of smaller projects, which we have supported hitherto, are sacrificed in the process. Hence my appeal for this regulation to strike a good balance between high profile activities, i.e. large projects, on the one hand, and continued attention to projects for democracy, on the other, i.e. projects to do with security, projects that are seldom as high profile, but which are all the more necessary to guarantee stability in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of the agency in Kosovo. Seen in a positive light, I sometimes think, and hope, that the agency, by the manner in which it has operated to date, and in which it is to function in the future, ought to serve as an example of how aid should be delivered to the Balkans, and also to other parts of the world. I have drawn such positive conclusions from my various visits to the agency because as I see it, despite all – and I repeat, all – the mistakes that are made there, there can be no doubt that they have found a new and effective way to deliver aid. If we then talk about increasing efficiency, which is the overall objective of this regulation, and relate this to the agency in Kosovo, then we have no choice but to reduce the involvement of the Member States. In quite concrete terms, this means reducing the influence of the Governing Board associated with the agency. In the past, we have been highly critical of the way in which the Commission delivers aid, as this is often bound up in red tape. The procedures involved are often too complex, but we must not turn a blind eye, nor must we want to – and I hope the Member States do not do so either – to their part in this. All too often the Member States have tried to get in on the act where overseas aid is concerned. All too often this has led to delays, inefficiency, and the promotion of national interests. As far as I am concerned, and this is one of the key messages in my report on the agency, the role of the Member States in aid provision will be much reduced in future because there is evidence to show that their involvement causes delays.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President and Commissioner, a final point. Some of my fellow Members are inclined to want to extend the activities of the agency still further than was the case hitherto. The agency is now based in Kosovo, and the Council has decided – rightly to my mind – to extend its scope to Serbia and Montenegro. I feel we will have to call it a day at that point because we can draw a lesson from the work that the agency is doing now, i.e. physical reconstruction, with a view to carrying out the same activities to good effect in Serbia and Montenegro. Delivering aid to the Balkans within the framework of CARDS, to countries such as Croatia, Albania, and Macedonia, demands other special qualities and other capabilities. I would therefore say: let the agency do what it is good at, i.e. physical reconstruction. It will prove very difficult to do this as effectively in Serbia. Let us confine ourselves to this and not dissipate our energies by extending the agency’s capabilities beyond the borders of former Yugoslavia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I do not believe I am being over-optimistic if I say that the European Union is harvesting the fruits of coordinated and persistent action. After the tragedy that the Balkans suffered, these fruits first appeared a few months ago in Croatia with free elections and a regime eager to respect human rights, and have now revealed themselves in Belgrade, where the citizens have confirmed their desire to live together in peace and freedom and to take their place in the family of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not disappoint them in their expectations, and now more than ever these countries need our help. We must continue this process of stabilising the region and prepare them for a longer-term perspective of integration in the institutions of Europe. In doing this, of course, we are staking our credibility and our own stability. But if we want to help them, we must do so more effectively and in a more coordinated fashion than we have done so far; otherwise there will occur what Mr Lagendijk has called the loss of visibility of the European Union, which bears the largest financial burden in the Balkans and yet is far less visible than countries like the United States, which can react practically in real time to any need that arises in the country. So much so that when I was in Bosnia-Herzegovina and visited a village, they would greet me jubilantly with ‘It is so good that you Americans are here to help us.’ The European Union’s action had become that invisible.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report on aid to the western Balkans that I have drawn up, working in close collaboration with Mr Lagendijk, on the two topics that we are dealing with today – a fine example of cooperation between two committees – we have recognised a number of limitations. On the one hand there is a geographical limitation, which suggests that the agency’s action should be expanded to embrace not only Kosovo but all Yugoslavia. We have also found some functional limitations. First, the international organisations that carry out these operations, such as UNMIK in Kosovo or the office of the High Representative in Sarajevo, also need to benefit from this aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there are several measures – I am referring particularly to the CARDS programme – that should go beyond reconstruction and extend to training, education and the reconstruction of civil society in close collaboration with NGOs. It is vital that NGOs should collaborate in this field, and also that there should be some coordination among them, if we really want their action to be more effective and to reach all parts of those regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also highlight the media. The media in that region have often been responsible for the tragedy they have been through, so it is essential to have a completely free media that acts in accordance with the rules that prevail in our democracies. It is also very important to make the judiciary really independent. We have also come across some operational limitations, which are among the causes of the lack of visibility. Operational limitations in the aid management system. Sometimes there is too much bureaucracy, too much red tape, and too much vacillation when the aid is granted. Therefore it is important for the CARDS programme management committee to be a committee that confines itself to the general lines of multiannual planning and does not try to carry out everyday micro-management at too detailed a scale, because otherwise we may again have the same problems as in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that the work of the CARDS management committee and the work of the Kosovo Reconstruction Agency should not get mixed up, or be duplicated or overlap; instead there should be a perfect division of duties. It is also essential to strengthen the role of the European Parliament, and I believe that with the amendments, which are likely to be voted for tomorrow, the European Parliament will be able to perform a greater consultative role in a process of interinstitutional collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I want to mention the financial package. Mr President, you are perfectly aware that nowadays the miracle of the loaves and the fishes is most unlikely to be repeated, and with the precious few loaves and fishes we now have available it is going to be practically impossible for us to tackle all of the European Union’s external obligations. We have to give more effective and more coordinated aid, gathering together all the scattered bits and pieces.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by repeating the Commission’s own words – that these two proposals are the cornerstone of a process that should lead these countries, which have had and still have so many problems, to become fully integrated into the structures of Europe. I am firmly convinced that the Balkans do have a solution and that the Balkan curse can be lifted, but for this they need all our support and these two programmes aim to provide it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which I have the honour of chairing, has endeavoured, through its opinion, to emphasise the importance of this reconstruction work in the Balkans as a possible way of integrating these areas into Europe as a whole. At the same time, in order to include a specifically cultural angle, not in abstract or generic terms but in terms of solidarity, we have proposed amendments which have found favour in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and which, I feel, contribute to providing, on the one hand, economic, civil, supportive assistance while restoring the civil society of these very unfortunate areas and, on the other, the possibility for cultural and institutional – and I stress the word institutional – support, to give these areas a sense of association with Europe, association in terms of civilisation, in terms of cultural initiatives, as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the amendments expressed as an opinion by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport have been accepted and that unanimity has been achieved is, in my opinion, an important factor which this House should note and take into consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course this is only to be welcomed. Our work has borne fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">But I am also happy because I feel that Parliament has succeeded, by keeping the pressure on, in turning round a situation that originally left a great deal to be desired. Rapporteur Lagendijk rightly pointed out that, if truth be known, the Commission’s original proposal drew no lessons from the past, from the comments already made by the Court of Auditors, or from the experiences of the European Agency for Reconstruction. Nor did it take on board the comments in Mrs Pack’s report, which was available to us back in 1999, or the feedback from the ad hoc delegation that we sent to Kosovo, and which submitted some very important recommendations under the leadership of Doris Pack and Terry Wynn.</p>
<p class="contents">When I drafted my report in July, I saw at once that that this original proposal was lacking. I then asked the Commission to withdraw the proposal. I am delighted that they did so and went on to submit a new proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a new proposal on the table since 4 October, and we are working on it now. I feel this is to be welcomed, thanks to the pressure exerted by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">What is it about? We must ensure that the regulations now on the table make provision for EU aid to the Western Balkans to be delivered quickly, flexibly and unbureaucratically, in cooperation with the local population and local bodies. There has been all too little of this in previous years. We need a flexible system to this end, a lightweight structure free of red tape. It is a pity that the President-in-Office of the Council is absent today. It is mainly the Council and the Member States who have, as it were, put a spoke in this large wheel in recent years. They have put paid to things that might have been possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I welcome the proposal now on the table. On behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am able to tell you that we support all the amendments. Naturally we are also delighted that the amendment regarding OLAF has been adopted. It is indeed the case that the anti-fraud unit must also be free to carry out its full range of tasks in the Western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say a brief word, speaking in a personal capacity rather than on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control. I am currently working on a report on how funds are being spent in Bosnia Herzegovina. It is a follow-up report to a special report by the Court of Auditors. We will need to ensure that sufficient funds are earmarked for Bosnia Herzegovina in the CARDs regulation. Our task will not end there, as we will still have quite some way to go. It is a fragile and unstable state. That, more than anything is what we must keep in mind in the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we all realise that a slimmer, more efficient structure is needed if the good work which the Kosovo Agency has carried out in recent months is to be consolidated for future purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, responsibility must be vested in a few people, including a director, if you like, so that really one person is responsible vis-à-vis the committee which selects the individual programmes. I think responsibility must be vested in very few people if we are to raise the profile of European work on the ground. As we have seen in Bosnia time and again, the Americans manage to show themselves to good advantage with very limited funds. In numerous areas, we have spent and continue to spend more money than anyone else but still we are not visible because it sort of runs through our fingers rather than being vested in any one institution.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel that duplicate work by the governing board and management board and unnecessary ritual meetings of their members, where it is the director responsible who needs to take the necessary decisions on time, should be avoided. I hope that Parliament's proposals will be accepted by the Commission and the Council. I repeat: unnecessary expenditure on unnecessary meetings really should be cut back. The money is desperately needed on the ground, where it can be put to better use.</p>
<p class="contents">If, although this was not the case with my report on the Kosovo Agency, the Council could perhaps at last learn from its mistakes, that would help the taxpayer no end. The objectives of the CARDS programme were in fact all right. But something important, one important objective is missing from this CARDS and that is support for education and training in these countries. Without education and training there is nothing, which is why I am delighted that the members of all the committees have helped me to table this proposed amendment. As I understand it, the Commissioner also takes the view that this should be an important objective in the CARDS programme.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be an objective which is close the Council's heart. I really do hope that the French Minister for Education, Jacques Lang, will be able to persuade his cabinet to ensure that the French government does not oppose the inclusion of the objective of education in the CARDS programme in the next Coreper. I think it would be counterproductive and I am certain that Mr Lang will do his utmost and if Mr Moscovici were here, he would perhaps do so too. So my thanks to all my fellow members who see this as an important objective and I am delighted that we shall be able to bring these countries more in the way of content in the future.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wiersma (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I wanted to make a number of general comments today about what I would like to call ‘the political reconstruction of the Balkans region’. Mr Swoboda will say a little more, on behalf of my group, about what I would like to call ‘efforts to reconstruct the EU’, which is also the subject of the reports under discussion today, courtesy of Mr Lagendijk and Mr Westendorp, to whom I offer my compliments.</p>
<p class="contents">In theory, we should be encouraged by the developments that have taken place in the Balkans over the past year. A great deal of headway has been made in the space of a year and the internal dynamics in a number of countries are at long last enhancing the role of the international community, even though the Kosovo crisis is still fresh in the memory. Kosovo is, and remains, a problem child.</p>
<p class="contents">The local elections had a positive outcome. Of course it is ever thus when moderates win, but the internal situation remains tense, as borne out by the recent murder of four Roma who had returned to Kosovo after seeking asylum in Belgium. Naturally the all-important question is: what future does Kosovo have within Yugoslavia? We PSE members reject any fanciful notions of an independent Kosovo. We are therefore looking forward with bated breath to the first meeting between President Kostunica and Mr Rugova. Perhaps the European Union could act as a mediator in this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we ought not to focus on Kosovo alone. By and large, things are moving in the right direction. I would call it a return to normality, all be it a gradual one. Last year belonged to true democracy, which was on the up and up, and to those politicians who eschew nationalism as the sole vehicle for politics. They have replaced three politicians who personified the worst aspects of former Yugoslavia in the nineties. I am referring to Tudjman, Milosevic and Izetbegovic.</p>
<p class="contents">The government in Zagreb is helping us to think about the future of the region, and making real investments in democracy and stability. Tomorrow we are due to receive the new President of Yugoslavia in this House. As I see it, they are the new heroes of the Balkans and of course they are more than welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia must soon be given the opportunity to strengthen its ties with the European Union. As far as I am concerned, apart from Slovenia it will be the first country from former Yugoslavia to qualify for EU membership in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">What Serbia deserves most of all at this point in time is material aid, and the sooner the better. Europe must clearly demonstrate that its aid is making a difference, even <span class="italic">before </span>the parliamentary elections in Serbia. However, as far as I am concerned, this week’s star price goes to the leader of the Social Democrats in Bosnia, and, incidentally, to the people of Slovakia, for not falling into the referendum trap that the opposition set for the government, but that is another story.</p>
<p class="contents">I read in some reports about the elections in Bosnia that the extreme nationalists have won at the parliamentary elections held in Bosnia Herzegovina. On the face of it, that appears to be true, particularly in the Republika Srpska and in the Croatian part. In the Bosnian part, the position of the nationalists has come under attack for the first time ever. In any event, the changes taking place in Croatia and Serbia are starting to have an effect on the situation there.</p>
<p class="contents">The Social Democrats have done remarkably well there. There is nothing untoward about that in Europe, or even in the Balkans, but what <span class="italic">is </span>striking is that this party is multi-ethnic and openly defends this. At recent gatherings in Sarajevo, the leader of this party, Zlatko Lagumdzija, in the company of Serbs, Croats, Montenegrins, Albanians and other representatives from the region, introduced the concept of reconstruction of the spirit, thereby getting right to the heart of the matter. We must concentrate our energies in the physical reconstruction of former Yugoslavia, but this will only work if we manage to alter the people’s frame of mind too.</p>
<p class="contents">Those politicians who openly work for such a cause deserve not only our admiration, but above all, our support. They alone can bring down the bastion of nationalism. The stability of the region will depend on the extent to which the new leaders are able to keep the lid on the national spirit and develop a different kind of mentality. Their political fate will also depend on how successfully the EU is able to deliver aid. The reports by Mr Westendorp and Mr Lagendijk provide the foundation we need for an efficient approach to the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aid has been too bureaucratic and too slow in coming, because the Commission has been too centralised and management-driven in its work. There has been too much management in detail, and Parliament has been complicit in this on a number of points. It is very unfortunate that the agency has been split up into a headquarters in Thessaloniki and an operations centre in Pristina. We have been opposed to this throughout. Moreover, the arrangement has now also been criticised by the Court of Auditors. It is good that, in this year’s Budget, EUR 175 million is being set aside for Kosovo and EUR 200 million for emergency aid for Serbia. It is very unfortunate, however, that the appropriations to the UN’s administration in Kosovo, to the Baltic region and to the rapid reaction facility have been put in the reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very unfortunate that there is no certainty regarding what we have by way of money for Serbia next year. It is particularly unfortunate in view of the fact that the elected Serbian President is coming here tomorrow. It is also unfortunate that a large number of programmes have been put in the so-called performance reserve. I am well aware that Parliament wants in this way to force the Commission to behave better, but one ought not to take one’s own children hostage. We should do much better to give the Commission a free hand in making the work effective, and we must reserve the right to criticise the Commission if the work is not a success. We must not make ourselves partly liable for possible damage to programmes of which we are in favour. Let us give the Commission larger appropriations and permission to delegate responsibility so that it becomes easier to make rapid decisions and to implement initiatives. Let us celebrate the visit by the elected Serbian president tomorrow by now seriously giving the Commission a chance to put the aid we offer onto a new and better footing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

International imperialism is well versed in the art of using the stick and the carrot, of alternating bombing incursions with humanitarian aid, destruction with reconstruction. Its final objective is to subjugate people to the new world order.</p>
<p class="contents">What I want to know is how can those who sowed disaster talk of reconstruction? How do murderers of children and civilians have the gall to give their victims lessons in democracy, the rule of law and human rights? The imperialist forces owe Yugoslavia war reparation, not humanitarian aid. The events which unfolded in Yugoslavia a few weeks ago, the so-called popular uprising, was backed by at least USD 100 million in foreign aid to the so-called "democratic opposition". These events may well have created a climate of euphoria in leading imperialist circles; but they know full well that they have not subdued the spirit of resistance in the Yugoslavian or any other people. That is why they are preparing military and police strike forces. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This year began on a positive note with democratic change in Croatia, as a result of the parliamentary and presidential elections it held. It continued with another major event in the form of the victory of democratic forces in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the fall of Milosevic. We indeed hope that the year will end with the consolidation of democracy on 23 December during the parliamentary elections in Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will be aware, the European Union, has contributed significantly to these historic developments. It reacted immediately to the new order in Croatia, by undertaking the process that will lead, at the Zagreb summit on 24 November, in other words in ten days’ time, to the opening of negotiations aimed at concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with this country. As it had made a similar commitment to the people of Serbia, it took the necessary steps on the election of President Kostunica, whom you are to meet tomorrow. These steps included the lifting of sanctions that had been imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, emergency assistance to the value of EUR 200 million granted by the European Council meeting in Biarritz, and the integration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the international community, all with a view to supporting the process of the consolidation of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to speak in more detail about the priorities set by the Presidency-in-Office for the Western Balkans. Thinking ahead to the summit in Zagreb, we wanted to focus the Union’s action on consolidating democracy and evaluating the Stabilisation and Association Process. To this end we have set two aims; the first is to develop regional cooperation, and the second is to implement a genuine policy to encourage a rapprochement between these countries and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At Cologne, the European Council offered countries the opportunity to join the European Union. At Feira, the Council considered those countries participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process as potential applicants for membership of the European Union. We intend to confirm the offer at the Zagreb summit, but also go one step further and define the measures each country needs to take and the reforms they need to put in place to this end. Lastly, we intend to confirm that the process will receive Community support of the highest order.</p>
<p class="contents">On the initiative of France, for the first time the Zagreb Summit will gather together Heads of State and Government of the European Union and the countries of the Western Balkans that are participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This summit will provide an opportunity to draw conclusions at the highest level, with regard to the decisive democratic changes that have taken place in this region. As a result of this, we will be able to reaffirm the fact that the way is open for a rapprochement between all of the countries in the region and the European Union, within the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like to highlight the value of the process, for example by marking the conclusion of negotiations of the first Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia during the Zagreb Summit, or confirming an individual approach that is adapted to each country’s particular characteristics and, as I have already said, by outlining the prospects the process holds for each of us.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit will also aim to consolidate democracy in the FRY, support the process of reconciliation between these countries and neighbouring countries, and encourage the development of reliable cooperation between the countries in the region. Therefore, the Union, without waiting for the Stabilisation and Association Agreements to be implemented, will remind the five countries concerned that it expects them, as of now, to conclude regional cooperation agreements between themselves. Such agreements, that were provided for within the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Agreements, should, in our view, include the initiation of political dialogue, a regional free trade area, as well as close collaboration in the field of justice and home affairs, in particular with a view to strengthening the judiciary and its independence in the fight against organised crime, corruption, money laundering and all other forms of criminal trafficking. Any rapprochement with the European Union is, in fact, closely linked, in the eyes of the Council, to the development of regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Examination of the reports by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza and Mr Lagendijk on proposals for a Regulation concerning a framework programme on the one hand, and the European Agency for Reconstruction on the other, provide us with an opportunity to assess the scale of the support that the Union intends to give the Western Balkans in relation to the Stabilisation and Association Process. Both reports are along the right lines. The Presidency-in-Office, like you, would like this framework programme to implement the principles of the reform of the management of external aid: fewer procedures, greater coordination out in the field, fewer outstanding commitments. Similarly, we support the extension to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of the activity of the European Agency for Reconstruction, which proved its effectiveness in Kosovo. We would like to see the programmes assigned to it by the Commission implemented more efficiently and speedily.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council Presidency aims to reach an agreement on the proposals for a Regulation regarding the CARDS programme and the European Agency for Reconstruction during the General Affairs Council at the end of November, in other words next week, so as to be able to make an announcement at Zagreb on 24 November. I should like to remind you that the main priorities of the CARDS programme are the strengthening of institutions with regard to democracy and the rule of law, economic development and reconstruction, and regional cooperation. The CARDS programme should therefore improve the cohesiveness, effectiveness and visibility of the assistance provided by the European Union to the region.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Budget Council on 20 July, the Member States unanimously decided to refocus the debate on the total amount of the financial envelope set aside for CARDS for the period 2000-2006 within the context of respect for the ceiling of heading 4 of the Financial Perspective, as determined by the European Council in Berlin. This amount, which will include assistance for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, will result from a unanimous decision regarding the way in which the EUR 10 billion available under the ceiling of heading 4 will be distributed between the two aid programmes, MEDA II and CARDS, the adoption of which will feature among our priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, during the General Affairs Council on 18 September, the Presidency-in-Office adopted asymmetric commercial preferences for the benefit of those countries that are participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process. These measures accord preferential access to the Community market for agricultural and industrial products produced by these countries. By adopting these measures, the European Union has performed an exceptional gesture, as this process of liberalisation, in particular as regards agricultural products, has been offered practically without conditions or rights. Such measures entered into force on 1 November and the Council is currently working to extend them to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency set itself ambitious targets as regards the Western Balkans which are close to being achieved: the development of the Stabilisation and Association Process, the adoption of the CARDS programme, the adoption of asymmetric commercial preferences, to mention but the more noteworthy Community measures. The long-awaited victory of democracy in Croatia, and then in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, forces the European Union, as we are well aware, to take things much further. This is why we must deliver a very strong political message at the Zagreb summit, one that is in line with the high hopes for peace and reconciliation that the peoples of the countries in the region have placed in this democratic change. The European Union must not be afraid to say to these countries: yes, your place, your future is within the European family. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, my initial impression of President Kostunica is that he has been very pragmatic in his political dealings since he assumed power in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He has consolidated his victory but has equally been tactful in his relations with other leaders in the region. He has already visited Sarajevo, he has attended an informal regional meeting in Skopje and he has also been to Moscow. The European Union was right to react positively to President Kostunica's accession to power. Visa restrictions have been loosened and the oil and flight embargo has now been lifted. The fact that the Commission has allocated EUR 200 million in emergency and assistance support from the NGOs is to be commended. I hope that President Kostunica and his supporters will steadily consolidate their position as the new democratic leadership in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at all political levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Elections for the Serbian Parliament are scheduled to take place on 23 December. I welcome the fact that President Kostunica has acknowledged the importance of cooperating with the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. An invitation has been extended to President Kostunica to participate, as the new President of Yugoslavia, at the forthcoming Zagreb summit. This summit, instead of being a showcase award for Croatia's efforts towards democratisation, will now inevitably shift towards celebrating President Kostunica's achievements. It is very important to assure the other Balkan participants that the return of Yugoslavia to the international community will in no way lessen their support from the European Union. Due attention must be paid to the sensitivities of all countries in the Balkan region and to assure them that they will not be neglected in the general euphoria over President Kostunica's accession to power.</p>
<p class="contents">Other objectives of the Zagreb summit must include an announcement of the Community assistance and reconstruction, democratisation and stabilisation programmes for the Western Balkans, a confirmation of the progressive establishment of a free trading zone between the European Union and the Western Balkans and a commitment by the countries in the region for regional cooperation and to putting in place a free trading regime between them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
