<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Skinner (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – </span>Mr President, it is because the Lisbon Summit first of all set its sights on making Europe the most dynamic and knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 that we actually have the risk capital action plan we have today. It was optimistic of governments to set this target, but not unrealistic, given that it is within their grasp to achieve it. A stimulating framework is required for us to promote high-growth industries such as information and biotechnologies and from that the jobs that must come. SMEs are a part of that process and that is what this is about: attracting finance to try to generate those businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we need the risk capital action plan? If we make a comparison of Europe and the US in the areas of business generation and equity financing, particularly amongst small businesses, then venture capital activity demonstrates a huge gap in Europe's readiness to compete. A framework has had to be established in order for us to plot Europe's future.</p>
<p class="contents">To begin with, and the Commission has done this fairly well – after prompting by Parliament – key barriers had to be removed and benchmarks set for their removal. The framework for these benchmarks has now been identified. The first is market fragmentation. How do companies actually raise debt and equity finance across the European Union? There are varied and contrasting pictures across the 15 Member States. There are can best be described on one side as nascent markets, and on the other, rather more sophisticated and developed approaches. Commercial bank loans are how many small- to medium-sized businesses attract finance.</p>
<p class="contents">This is wholly appropriate in some circumstances; but new and exciting projects or spin-offs are not necessarily so appropriate for bank loans. In areas where risk is likely to be a considerable feature of the exchange, dotcoms for example, commercial banking may be deemed inappropriate and unworkable. Alternative processes are then required – business angels or groups of investors, private investors – bringing together people with ideas on one side and money on the other. At the institutional level, there is the possibility of quotation on the AIMS market in the UK, for example, and perhaps even the idea of using pension funds to allow for higher growth returns rather than with bonds and blue chip equities.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the pursuit of those higher returns for potential new and growing firms, it is not perhaps surprising to learn that an entire industry has sprung up in this field. Similarly, the careful approach of these investors, with their application of the principle of due diligence, means that spontaneity is not a part of the risk equation, as one might have first imagined. If the EU wants a place in the "premier division" of industrial growth and competition, then funding the industries of tomorrow is of vital importance. This is the stark reality of a market which is held back, not just by the slow evolution of debt-raising, but also by the nature of the institutional and regulatory barriers which fence in any further development across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us have a look at some of those barriers. On the administrative side, it is nice to see that the administrative formalities for forming a company have now acquired the cornerstone of the company statute. This permits the kind of progress we hope to see.</p>
<p class="contents">I note also that in January 2002 the Directorate-General for Enterprises started to work on benchmarking the administration of business start-ups. The cost of starting up a business varies across the European Union and there is some progress. But look at some of the licensing issues. Look at some of the other issues which hold companies back. It is important to make distinctions, and here we see companies in the areas of hi-tech, drugs, and biotechnology being made to jump through hoops which may have to be reconsidered.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to look at just how these businesses fare. We do not just need to look at start-ups – businesses grow, they develop or they are bought out. So, for any practical observation, we need to consider just what kind of businesses we are looking at for risk capital. Even now buy-outs – and management buy-outs in particular – are the single largest category of acting in venture capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearing the path of regulatory barriers means introducing new directives. There they bind together the approaches necessary for a single market to emerge. Recently the prospectuses directive was adopted and now – I believe, because of the activities of this Parliament – protects small- to medium-sized businesses from the bureaucratic requirements of continual registration or the dangers that threatened their ability to have access to funding.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues of the prospectuses directive which Parliament had to address could have been avoided if there had been sufficient cross-referencing with the risk capital action plan in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also just mention pensions and the need for us to have a good quality directive on pensions – one that avoids the prudential plus approach. That approach, would actually reduce the prospects of any kind of funding from the pensions industry – an industry which, in the US is a major source of small business investment. If that prudential plus approach is used, then we may as well not have a pensions directive in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial services action plan itself gathers together many of the directives necessary for completion of the risk capital action plan, including most of what I have already mentioned. But now that the Lamfalussy issue is practically resolved, progress will be assured, leaving the regulatory framework requirement for the risk capital action plan well within our sights. The impact of small- to medium-sized businesses has long been an issue raised by many parliamentarians who want to see nothing but the most positive advantages passed on to companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's benchmarking of its achievements in these areas has given the European Parliament and the Council the tool to measure Europe's progress. So far that progress has been good, if a little slow.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other areas which have been mentioned, such as taxation, double taxation of venture capital or capital gains tax, tax arrangements for new firms and comparative tax rates with less risky forms of capital. These have been taken up by a number of Member States but some backbone still needs to be put into these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, in terms of human resources, we have to have the kind of training or advice that is necessary to help these businesses flourish in the first place: life-long learning and initiatives in vocational qualifications can seen as the start of the spread of best practice, as is the introduction of business mentors in certain countries and developments in school curricula.</p>
<p class="contents">The high-tech small businesses which, in the end, are the target of the risk capital action plan, are in short supply themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Summit of 1997 threw down the gauntlet of the risk capital action plan for Europe to pick up. The expectation is to reach completion by 2005 in terms of a regulatory framework and 2010 for the knowledge-based economy. The risk capital action plan is not in itself a master plan for increased growth or job creation, but it is the essential framework. Progress has been made but it is quite slow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is that I represent Wales in the European Parliament. Members may know that the risk capital action plan was first adopted at the Cardiff Summit, the capital city of Wales and also the city in which I live. However, a rather more direct financial interest is that I am a director of the National Farmers' Union Mutual Insurance Company in the UK, one of the UK's top ten insurance companies. I should mention that because some of my remarks will touch upon issues that are relevant in the insurance sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Skinner for the work he has done on this report. It is traditional to say that but, in this instance, I really do value the hard work and commitment that he has given. He is a somewhat solitary figure on that particular side of the House in terms of the need to ensure that we develop the interests of business. Nonetheless, his is a voice that we welcome. His report is one that we welcome. My colleagues and I in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have made some variations to the report which make it even more acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is set within the context – I believe – of some of the failures of the venture capital industry. There have been such failures. The venture capital industry has been too focused on areas where there is already significant financial activity. That is why it is necessary for there to be some guidance in relation to the state aid rules. But I should like to caution Parliament in the light of some of my own experience of the history of the failure of government-sponsored forays into the whole venture capital area.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, people imagine that if there is some government-sponsored capital scheme it is bound to mean a guarantee of financial support. Secondly, what are the judgments as to which investments should be backed and which should not? Who is making those judgments?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the effect that there can sometimes be in distorting markets and actually driving good competitors out of business. These are some of the cautions there may be.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we are considering here gets this balance right but we still need to get away from the idea that government, in some sense, can resolve all of these issues. It is important that we deal with the promotion of entrepreneurship. We give too much lip service to this without effectively putting it into operation.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country we have Objective I status but getting the people who are involved in putting that plan into operation to recognise the importance of entrepreneurship is very difficult. Very often we have local and regional administrations run by the public sector who just regard this as yet another income stream. So there must be guidance in those areas as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to make a point about the sources for raising funds. They are pension funds, banks and insurance companies. That is something that is recognised by the Commission and Mr Skinner as well. In this House we have to get away from demonising these organisations. These organisations are the ones that we look to for the funding to create the dynamic economy that we want to develop in Europe. There will be two benefits: we will create new businesses and employment opportunities and we will, at the same time, be funding, very often, income for retirement for European citizens. As a result of that we will be creating a virtuous circle of investment. That is a message that is not heard often enough in this Chamber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s economic recovery, which is absolutely crucial to the Union’s achieving all its political objectives, must depend more on the quality of the policies themselves than on the result of favourable boosts that it receives through recovery in other economic areas. In Lisbon, in 2000, the Union defined the clear and crucial objective of making the European Union the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. Achieving this objective involves, on the one hand, taking full advantage of all the potential arising from the expansion of the information and knowledge-based society and from the liberalisation of some markets, specifically in the area of energy, and, on the other hand, the definition and implementation of public competition and competitiveness policies that create an environment that favours sustainable economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">A Community-based Europe consists of an economy founded on a commercial framework in which private initiative is dominant and a culture of innovation and risk is an indisputable reality. This, therefore, requires the national authorities for political regulation and the appropriate Community institutions to promote and not to hinder all these efforts at innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The risk capital action plan drawn up at the Lisbon European Council, which called for its full implementation by 2003, is one of these instruments and certainly one of the most effective instruments available to us. It is, therefore, important that it is assessed and that its implementation is monitored, not only to record the progress that is made, but mainly to motivate all the relevant bodies in the Member States and to alert them to the need for the gradual and ongoing pursuit of a healthy entrepreneurial spirit underpinned by a culture in which risk is a factor that is permanently under control. The use of risk capital as an instrument to promote investment in new businesses and above all in sectors that face considerable uncertainty at the start of the production process must be stimulated and protected, because the enormous potential that risk capital creates and multiplies is not yet exhausted. Nevertheless, as the rapporteur quite rightly points out, this requires a set of measures for legislative harmonisation and the acceptance of policies for fiscal stimulation drawn up by every Member State, but also some suggested by the Union, which will enable us to break down existing barriers in the field of capital provision and, specifically, with regard to the access of small and medium-sized enterprises to this financing instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">By accepting greater responsibility for the financing of risk capital through the European Investment Bank, Europe is demonstrating its desire to unequivocally shoulder its share of responsibility. Nevertheless, without precluding access to this form of financing by the high-technology sectors, we must strengthen and develop the appropriate political, economic and institutional framework for the full use of the instrument of risk capital for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

For example, Philips invented the light bulb at home and Bill Gates started developing software from his garage. Needless to say, not every innovation is immediately accessible to the public at large. This requires courage, moral fibre, boldness and risk capital.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to allow society to benefit from these innovations, it is important that investments be made. These promote the further development of new technology. However, many small entrepreneurs do not have these investments at their disposal or have no access to the capital market in order to obtain these resources on favourable conditions. It is therefore very important to promote access to risk capital and to remove obstructing rules. Based on the fact that, in the past few years, both supply and demand in respect of risk capital for medium-sized and small businesses have been stagnating, it can be concluded that only an approach which removes obstructions both on the supply and on the demand side will be effective. In this context, I can hardly see a case for making public funds available, if at all.</p>
<p class="contents">It is mainly up to the Member States to provide sound legislation with regard to the way in which pension funds make the resources entrusted to them profitable. Scope to invest in risk capital must be possible under strict conditions, taking into account the risk profile of the funds. Pensions should not be put at risk as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Member States must ensure that incentives do not ultimately become government support. This is undesirable and does not provide incentives to the innovative and creative entrepreneur. Nor is it a solution to the substantial problem of an inadequate capital market. The incentives should therefore certainly be temporary in nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are glad that clear indications were given in Lisbon of the important role played by efficient risk capital markets in respect of innovative, fast-growing small and medium-sized enterprises and thus also in the creation of new and lasting employment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very glad that Lisbon saw the renewed demand made for full implementation of the risk capital action plan by 2003, and that it was made clear that small and medium-sized enterprises are the foundation of technological development and innovation on our continent. We are therefore also most heartened by the result showing that venture capital investments in Europe increased in gross volume from EUR 10 billion in 1999 to EUR 19.6 billion in 2000. Despite this report of success, we are saddened by the fact that we are still a long way behind the United States. Taken as a share of GDP, venture capital investments in 2000 accounted for only 0.23% of Europe's, as against 0.7% in the United States. We must catch up on America, or overtake them, if we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important, in this connection to point out – as my predecessor on the floor has done – that the largest sources of finance are the pension funds, followed by insurance and banks. It is, then, all the more regrettable that the Commission proposal for Europe-wide enhancement of occupational retirement provision in the Internal Market as part of the Financial Services Action Plan has to this moment still elicited no official response from the Council, so that we are at the moment unable to negotiate.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret the fact that we get the feeling that the so-called compromise proposals in the Council cannot and will not be adopted by either Parliament or the Commission, so that Commissioner Bolkestein, who is responsible for these matters, has now felt constrained to say that, if we make no headway here, the need to get things moving would force him to withdraw his Commission proposal. The Council's behaviour also goes against the Barcelona decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">We also know that small and medium-sized enterprises have difficulties when it comes to getting access to capital. That is why the Basle Process is so important, as is the fact that the Basle result makes allowances for the private business sector in Europe and does not make access to capital more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises. We would, then, also request the Commission, not only to monitor the Basle Process in line with the Barcelona decisions, but also, in the interests of European economic structure and in view of the significance of small and medium-sized enterprises for growth and employment, to actively influence it.</p>

<p class="contents">SMEs in Europe face much greater difficulties than their US counterparts in raising loan or equity finance, which may help in part to explain the extraordinary success in US economic growth over the last ten years. Although there is now rapid growth in venture capital funds in the European Union, there is enormous variation in performance. The City of London, which I proudly represent, leads the way at 0.4% of UK GDP devoted to this cause. But even here, most funding comes from US sources. Pension funds are the prime source of capital, and I have advocated UK-style self-select pension plans for the self-employed being permitted to make such investments on a pan-European basis, although this was rejected in committee, unfortunately.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the call for US-style EU-wide insolvency laws along the lines of the American Chapter XI bankruptcy procedures which afford a number of advantages, particularly in so far as they do not disrupt the continuity of trading in failing companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I also lament the lateness in bringing forward the much-needed Community patent, due to excessive sensitivity on the language issue which will only add to the cost for SMEs and make the procedures unworkable. Not radically tackling the language issue now will only get worse after enlargement when there are 40 million Polish speakers who also want their language to be given the same priority as, say, Italian or Spanish.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States should also seriously consider promotion of funds through generous capital gains tax incentives to mitigate the risk to investors. I generally, though, reject State funding directly for SMEs as the State is generally poor at picking winners amongst competing demands for capital. Nevertheless Mr Skinner's suggestion of a one-stop shop risk capital website to facilitate the interface of SMEs and the finance-providers is a very good one.</p>
<p class="contents">This excellent report enjoyed considerable cross-party support in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, in spite of originating from the other side of the House, deserves our full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are to be able to attain the very optimistic objective set in Lisbon two years ago, according to which Europe is to be the world’s top economy by the year 2010, measures must be taken quickly to increase companies’ access to risk capital. Time is running out, and the United States is increasing its lead.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur also points out, it is especially important to review the conditions governing small and medium-sized enterprises, for it is among these that regeneration and technical development take place. It is also small and medium-sized enterprises that can give rise to new job opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that risk capital investments have fallen in Europe. In such a situation, it is easy to revert to the solution applied in the past: public funding. However, that would lead not to strong and healthy companies but to companies which, though certainly new, would be dependent upon subsidies. It is therefore important to emphasise that state support can only be justified in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall business climate is crucial to the success or otherwise of the European economy and the economies of the Member States. One clear example of a country that is deficient in this area is Sweden, which has experimented a great deal with state aid and so excluded healthy competition. Since 1960, not a single large company has been started up in Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">The report discusses much that is important to small and medium-sized enterprises, and what clearly emerges from this discussion is that there are still administrative, legal and cultural obstacles to be overcome and that too little has been done to remove these. It is essential that the work required continue at a brisker pace because access to risk capital is a prerequisite of companies’ growth and development.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be possible for companies which go bankrupt to be given another chance. To try and then fail must not lead to companies’ being stigmatised due to bankruptcy legislation. Otherwise, no one in the end will want to go out on a limb. People who are prepared to do just that, together with the availability of risk capital, are the indispensable features of a growing economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In both our cities we have strong small and medium-sized enterprises, and that is also Europe's strength. It is because firms with under 250 employees account for two-thirds of jobs that we in the political world must always bear in mind the need to ‘think small first’<span class="italic">.</span> First we must think of the ‘small players’ and look to see how we can apply some leverage for them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely for the students or workers who want to become self-employed that we have no help to offer by means of functioning instruments. The so-called ‘one man start up’ is a very important area of concern. It must also be possible to make risk capital available in instalments ranging from EUR 5 000 to EUR 10 000 rather than only from EUR 5 million upwards.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we will have need of that when it comes to the new Member States. We must be aware that they suffer a glaring lack of equity capital, and that even the banks there find this very difficult. If we want to build prosperity there, with a market economy that works, we have to consider how these businesses get their hands on the capital they need once they are working in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major area is the transfer of businesses. There is at present an enormous tax burden when businesses are handed on from one generation to the next. It is, though, precisely at this stage that the enterprise is at greatest risk, as, on the one hand, the experienced generation is stepping down, and the new generation takes risks in its desire to build something new. I would ask the Commissioner to offer alternatives on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add, in conclusion, that it is important that we think about fiscal optimisation. Are the rules on depreciation right? Do new businesses and enterprises using risk capital not need new rules on depreciation, new allowances and reserves? How long are time limits to be, and to what should they apply? I believe that tax also plays an enormous role in the accumulation of equity capital. I request the Commission to produce a Green Paper on this issue, because it is in taxation also that Basle II will bring enormous changes, as we can create the conditions for Basle II only if there is massively reduced taxation of business proceeds, especially of undistributed profits from businesses, and then the Finance Ministers really will have to prick their ears up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report is clearly supportive of the Community strategy to develop the EU risk capital market.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said a number of times this evening in this Parliament, risk capital provides a vital source of financing for new and innovative enterprises, and in that way it contributes significantly to economic growth and to the creation of jobs. The development of a large and efficient EU risk capital market is a key element in the so-called Lisbon Strategy to create a more dynamic and prosperous European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The period since the launch of the risk capital action plan has seen a rapid growth in the EU risk capital market. Investment almost tripled between 1998 and 2000. Growth then slowed in 2001 as the "dot.com bubble" burst and the global economy weakened, but nonetheless the market remains fundamentally sound. Indeed the slowdown in growth may be seen as a necessary consolidation after the rather exuberant behaviour of previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">But despite the real progress that has been made, there are still important barriers to development of the EU risk capital market. As the report points out, these barriers affect both the supply side and the demand side of the market. The risk capital action plan is designed to address those barriers, and in order to meet the deadline of 2003 for implementation of the RCAP a number of key actions are required. Perhaps I may mention four of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the relevant measures in the financial services action plan must be adopted urgently. Those measures include the proposed directive on prospectuses, the proposed directive on occupational pension funds, about which a number of Members have spoken tonight, and the proposed regulation on international accounting standards. The commitment by the Barcelona European Council to have those proposals adopted as early as possible in 2002 is very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say in reply to Mr Karas, on the matter of occupational pension funds, that the Commission is not in the business of making life more difficult for those pension funds that are in operation and that operate efficiently and satisfactorily. Why should the Commission place an increased burden of regulation on those pension funds? That is why I recently said that if the Council were to insist on further restrictions on those pension funds which operate satisfactorily – and basically they are found in the United Kingdom and Ireland, in the Netherlands and Denmark: together those countries account for maybe two thirds or 75% of total capital assembled and saved for the purpose of defraying pension fund obligations – why should the Commission place further restrictions on those pension funds? That is why I have said that if the Council wants to do that then the Commission will have no alternative but to withdraw the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the first way in which the Commission aims at increasing the risk capital action plan market. The second way is that Member States must maintain, and improve where necessary, the pace of structural reform. The objective of reform must be to create an environment in which the risk capital market can flourish. Progress has been made but much remains to be done. The Commission's broad economic policy guidelines for the year 2002/2003 will again call for intensified efforts in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, entrepreneurship must be encouraged. Measures to promote a culture of enterprise in the EU have been taken at Community and national levels, but Members of Parliament will appreciate that to change a culture is not easy. Cultural barriers can indeed be particularly difficult to overcome but our efforts in this field must continue and, if possible, be intensified.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and lastly the efficiency of public funding for risk capital activities must be improved and it is important that public funding should not crowd out private sector investment. We do not want to see that happen. Based on that consideration the Commission has clarified its policy on state aid to risk capital activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard the report from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs as another important building block in our efforts to develop the EU risk capital market. It is encouraging that the recommendations from the committee correspond fully to the measures proposed in the risk capital action plan, and the Commission would very much like to once again thank the rapporteur for his work.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I end my contribution to this debate I should like to say, in reply to a question put by Mr Karas, that the Commission is actively following the negotiations at Basle. As Mr Karas knows, the Commission is an observer in those negotiations. We are now entering a third consultation round. More time has been allotted for those negotiations and one of the prime objectives of the Commission is to see to such a development as will ensure that small- and medium-sized enterprises will have the same possibilities of attracting capital as larger companies. Again, why would the Commission approve something which would harm the possibilities for small and medium-sized enterprises to get capital? After all, all we want to do is to facilitate capital going to SMEs since we all know that SMEs play a very important part in creating jobs; of course they also they play a very important part in the creation of high-tech industries, or rather, activities which may lead to high-tech industries.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to say something about the five amendments which have been proposed by Mr Goebbels. Unfortunately he is not here, but I would like to say that on the first amendment the Commission has difficulties because we fear that his amendment would send the wrong signal to the market. We are particularly concerned that state aid discipline should not be weakened, and therefore the Commission does not really like the first amendment and hopes that it will not be accepted by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment states that a shortage of appropriate finance is the major obstacle to starting a business. The Commission begs to differ. The Commission does not agree that the shortage of funds is the major obstacle. There are a number of obstacles and it would be difficult to say which one is <span class="italic">the</span> major obstacle. Therefore the Commission regrets it cannot accept this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">The other three amendments – Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 – are acceptable to the Commission and no doubt Mr Goebbels will be informed about the opinions of the Commission. We therefore once again accept the fact that those three amendments will be approved by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
