<p class="contents">There were three constraints I had to manage: the doubts and questions of my fellow Members in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the criticisms expressed by civil society, particularly through the CEE Bankwatch Network and finally the answers and arguments presented in response to both these types of question or criticism by the European Investment Bank. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like in particular to thank my fellow Members on the Committee of Economic and Monetary Affairs for the relevance of the questions that they, in a way, entrusted to me to put on their behalf to the European Investment Bank. I would like to thank the civil society volunteers for their competence in monitoring the activities of a bank which, in the final analysis, has an influence on 5% of all investments within the European Union, making it the EU’s largest investor. Finally, without any sycophancy whatsoever, I must thank the President of the European Investment Bank, and his colleagues, for the good will and indeed the warmth with which they undertook to discuss matters with me, to take on board and respond to criticisms, either convincing me of the legitimacy of their approach or accepting our comments and outlining with me appropriate solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have thus arrived at a report on which we are practically unanimous. You have been able to note, indeed, that the amendments concern two mere details. I shall discuss these in the latter part of my speech. Broadly speaking, we were unanimous on the proposals for policy which are directed at least as much to the other bodies of the European Union, and even the Member States, as to the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully share all the priorities which the European Investment Bank set itself and indeed with the pillars forming the basis of the bank’s policy, and grant it full discharge. We must, however, stress that times are changing. Europe is expanding eastwards. It is taking on greater responsibilities with regards to the Balkans, which are not yet included in the accession process. Moreover, Europe has signed up to the Kyoto Agreement which requires it to reduce its production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 8% on average by the year 2010. In other words, this international agreement will become binding in 7 years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, since Lisbon, Europe has given itself the objective of becoming a world power in terms of the knowledge economy and new technologies. Finally, Europe has given priority to the development of SMEs. Europe is seeking to obtain this position of excellence not by means of a ‘Europe Incorporated’ with huge multinational businesses but rather by relying on SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three new objectives, then, in relation to the 1999 report, which we shall examine formally today. However, in so doing, we shall of course be examining all the policy directions of the EIB: accession, Kyoto, the development of SMEs towards achieving excellence. We wished to call upon the constituent bodies of the European Union and the EIB itself to reorient its policy in the light of these three objectives which were perhaps not as clear at the time when the EIB adopted its priorities or drew up its 1999 report. </p>
<p class="contents">The initial paragraphs of the report before you are absolutely unanimous and aim essentially at expanding or facilitating loans in these three areas.</p>
<p class="contents">To briefly mention the points on which we did not achieve unanimity, there was the official importance of the NGOs in the preparations for the EIB’s decisions, the affirmation of the Kyoto objectives as a genuine leading factor and finally, the arrangements for the prudential supervision of the EIB. These three points I refer to the decision of the House.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is the first time that the European Parliament has delivered its opinion on the annual report. Naturally this opinion is of a political nature and it casts a critical eye over the institution. Thus, for example, the report examines such things as the priorities and the internal and external scrutiny of the resources employed by this bank. The EIB is the primary banker and investor for the European institutions and that is why the report analyses what the EIB’s priorities are and whether these priorities are in line with the European Union’s priorities. Where significant differences were found, the rapporteur has looked at what the EIB should give greater or less priority to. For example, the report asks the EIB to concentrate more on those investments that enable the EU to meet the Kyoto criteria. As we see it, the fact that more priority should be given to this does not mean that matters such as the trans-European networks should be given less priority, as the rapporteur proposes in one of his amendments. Next, the report draws attention to the EIB’s internal scrutiny. The rapporteur believes that the EIB should have a better overview of the quality of the loans. To this end, the EIB should devote more attention to evaluation of projects in the fields of regional and environmental investment, for example. At present, there is still too little insight within the EIB into the effectiveness of the loans. In a normal operational management process, a company keeps tabs on the returns on its investments. The EIB should also evaluate effectiveness and the return on investments more.</p>
<p class="contents">A final important point is that the EIB is subject to scrutiny by the European Court of Auditors where the Community resources are concerned. The European Court of Auditors is then required to scrutinise the resources at the disposal of the EIB as to the effectiveness and lawfulness of the investments made. We have tabled another amendment in order to ensure that the EIB is supervised adequately and according to the same rules as any normal commercial bank regarding its banking business. The rapporteur proposes that someone from the European Central Bank should be appointed as a member of the Audit Committee, but an audit committee has more of an accounting function than one of real banking supervision. Both functions must be fulfilled. However, my group feels that the European Central Bank does not have the in-house capacity for banking supervision in the real sense. This must be organised differently, for example by the Luxembourg Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">My other two amendments are adaptations designed to remove a few minor flaws from the text. For example, we recognise the important role the EIB has in the European investment climate and we also feel that the EIB should take more account in its internal scrutiny of the effectiveness of the European funds spent on the environment. I am sorry to say that we do not agree with the majority of the rapporteur’s amendments because he is using them to emphasise a radical and one-sided position. Naturally we also appreciate the importance of the environment and of NGOs, but other priorities must also be given a crack of the whip. The Socialist Group has also tabled two further amendments and one of these has to do with a promise made by the President of the EIB. This promise related to recruiting more women, so that the EIB employs roughly the same number of men as women, or at least works towards that goal. That is also one of the European Union’s priorities. We call upon the bank to make a start with this. I hope that the EIB takes Parliament’s advice to heart, particularly where the scrutiny of European funds is concerned. That is why we support this report wholeheartedly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van den Burg (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, I would like to start by welcoming Mr Maystadt warmly to this almost empty hall, but I can assure him that even when we have the President of the European Central Bank visiting us, by no means all delegates attend. So the fault does not lie with you.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, I would like to propose that we make a tradition of this, just as we do with our debates with the European Central Bank, with Wim Duisenberg. I think it would be a good idea to carry on the tradition of devoting attention to the European Investment Bank here in Parliament, and I hope this will then stimulate more interest than is in evidence today.</p>
<p class="contents">A few days ago, you held your annual press conference, and presented the results for 2000. What we have here is nothing new, but it is something that happened at roughly the same time. I think we may be able to do it next year but in any case, I would like to propose that we put the annual report on 2000 on Parliament’s agenda just as soon as we can, and prepare it at least as thoroughly as we have done with this annual report.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I make a few comments as to content, I would just like to compliment the rapporteur too. If the press report from last week is anything to go by, he has acquitted himself well. I think the said press report also revealed that the bank has given a great deal of thought to environmental groups in its policy, and to the environment in general, and I believe its activities have contributed to this as well. I myself have concentrated, on behalf of my group, on a number of other key points which, incidentally, largely coincide with those of the PPE-DE Group. My first point concerns job creation, particularly in SMEs and the social sectors, whilst my second point is about transparency and supervision of the EIB’s activities. I will talk about employment first. The employment objective, which is also one of the European Union’s priority objectives – I think Lisbon confirmed this once again – is expressed too implicitly in your plans and reports to my mind, and is not sufficiently visible or verifiable. It seems as if the reasoning prevails that economic growth will automatically create jobs and so there is no need to treat it as a separate issue, let alone consider the quality and sustainability of the jobs. You certainly aligned yourself with the policy initiatives from the European Councils, as we can recognise the incentives created by the Luxembourg Summit and the special action programme promised in Amsterdam, in this report. And then you rightly took up the initiatives from the Lisbon Summit held last year and in particular, launched new initiatives for the knowledge-based economy and new technologies, notably the innovation 2000 initiative. I would now like to present you with the challenge of aligning yourself with new initiatives in the coming year, at the Stockholm Summit scheduled for next month. There, the Swedish Presidency will pursue the line taken in Lisbon, and hopefully also succeed in making an annual tradition of these spring summits on socio-economic affairs. The Swedes are not planning to establish a whole host of new procedures and processes on this occasion. What they <span class="italic">have </span>succeeded in doing to my mind, is add a very important feature to the policy agreed in Lisbon, that of attention to the qualitative aspects of employment. The quality of work is an extremely important consideration if people are to be able to function properly in the economy, in an economy based more on knowledge and creativity. Attention must also be given to adequate participation in the labour market. These are very important matters that we must concern ourselves with in the months to come. Perhaps you could take up the challenge of including this investment in quality in a follow-up initiative after Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">Also on the SME front, I see that in 2000 you very nearly doubled your efforts to EUR 6.2 billion. I think that is to be welcomed, but I would also ask that special attention be given to the SMEs that have difficulty acquiring risk capital through normal channels. These are often highly innovative businesses too and so they do not belong to the very sectors of the economy that <span class="italic">do </span>attract capital from the stock market and risk capital, which is precisely why I want to draw attention to those flanking businesses that can provide quality work. That is why we ask that attention be given to the social economy and to the development of what the French so beautifully call <span class="italic">service de proximité</span> (local service).</p>
<p class="contents">I have a final comment to make. Perhaps I should leave it out though because I think I can concur with what Mrs Peijs had to say on the matter, with the exception of her comments on the role of the ECB. What our group <span class="italic">does </span>want to do is pursue the discussion on the potential role of the European Central Bank, also with regard to scrutiny of prudential rules and banking supervision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Investment Bank is a non-profit-making body because that is what the Member States’ governments decided, since its mission was not to obtain economic benefits but rather to contribute to the balanced development of the European Community through granting medium and long-term credits and guarantees for investment projects in the poorest regions, thus fostering economic and social cohesion. But if we examine what the prime orientation for EIB funding is, where have the loans granted in 1999 ended up? We see that most have been used to cofinance investments in the four richest Member States (Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy), which received over 60% of the EIB resources supplementing the Community structural funds, while the so-called cohesion countries, that is, the poorest and most needy ones (Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland) got only 26%.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if I am told that this inequality occurs on account of the populations of these Member States, I believe we have to think about this aspect, since balanced development will not be achieved through proportionality but through solidarity. This will become even more necessary as we proceed with enlargement to include new Member States. Do not let it be said, either, that what is happening is that the less well-off countries do not submit projects to be funded; what is needed is a better policy of information, transparency, aid and monitoring. To that end, it could well begin by facilitating communication with possible applicants, providing for the use of all the languages of the European Union, including regional and minority languages, so that everybody can have access to the European Investment Bank. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is that the bank has had a terrible information policy, and there has been poor supervision of the bank’s decisions and work. The second is that the bank’s environmental work has, as I see it, been extremely poor. There are numerous examples where the bank has supported projects within the EU and in the candidate countries which have actually been indefensible from an environmental point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the area of environmental impact analysis, it is clear that the World Bank, for example, is better than the European Investment Bank at making analyses public before decisions are taken. We have at least recently encountered a new attitude from the EIB. There has been more talk about dialogue, openness, environmental considerations and change. We hope this will lead to real reform of the bank’s work – which we would of course welcome – and to the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters being implemented in full at the bank.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that we support this excellent report and the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today’s debate shows that the work of the European Central Bank has, in the main, been assessed very positively, which, President Maystadt, I am sure you welcome. The European Central Bank has an especially important role when it comes to improving European Community structures in less developed regions. Two thirds of its disbursements go towards this. But I also believe trans-European networks are of major importance, especially for transport, and they need to be set up along European lines.</p>
<p class="contents">We see that a common European economic area is emerging. But we also see that the traffic situation is very often still following the old limitations and priorities of past centuries. I believe that a common European market, a domestic market and an optimal currency area must incorporate a corresponding infrastructure and transport infrastructure. All the activities of the European Central Bank in this area are of special importance.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the work of the European Central Bank in other areas is of great importance, especially where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned. For SMEs, especially those which are innovative and assume risks, simply granting loans is often insufficient; venture capital also needs to be made available. In recent years the EIB has developed its own initiatives which, in my opinion, are especially welcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I regard it as an honour, but also as a sign of Parliament’s desire to take an interest in the activities of all the European institutions, in order to ensure that the voice of the citizens it represents is heard more effectively. May I also reiterate in Parliament what I have already had the opportunity to stress at committee level, namely how much I appreciate the constructive dialogue that has been established with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, at the instigation of its Chair, Mrs Randzio-Plath. With regard to Mr Lipietz’s report, I found it both stimulating and useful, and I can tell you that work has already started on implementing a number of the recommendations made in the draft resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall, if I may, deal with both these recommendations and the questions put by the honourable Members in the following order: first, the bank’s operational priorities, followed by evaluation methods and, finally, external monitoring and the policy of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">To begin with, the bank’s operational priorities. I should like to point out that the new Corporate Operational Plan, which covers the period 2001-2003, redefines our priorities along the lines proposed in recommendations 3 and 5. We have, in fact, included among the five priorities adopted by our board of directors, and here I quote, “encouraging environmental protection and sustainable development, in particular implementation of the Kyoto Protocol”. This approach in practice already existed, given that last year lending for projects contributing directly towards improvement of the environment amounted to EUR 6.4 billion within the European Union, an increase of 39% compared with the previous year, and EUR 740 million in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we have reorganised our Projects Directorate in order to ensure that the environmental impact of the projects for which finance is sought from us is systematically evaluated. With regard in particular to our contribution towards implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, a general policy note will be submitted to our board of directors in May.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, this emphasis on the environment must not, as Mrs Peijs very aptly put it, make us forget the other priorities, which I shall very rapidly refer to. Regional development: we consider that at least two thirds of lending within the European Union must go towards projects located in assisted areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for the Lisbon strategy: we intend, over the next three years, to advance project finance totalling EUR 12 to 15 billion in the fields accorded priority by the Lisbon European Council and, of course, as Mrs van den Burg has suggested, we shall have to take account of the conclusions of the Stockholm Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Preparing the candidate countries for accession: over the next three years we intend to earmark between EUR 3 and 4 billion a year to projects aimed at helping the candidate countries to satisfy the conditions for accession, especially with regard to transport infrastructure, the importance of which Mr von Wogau has rightly stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would mention as the final priority support for the Community’s cooperation policy, notably in the context of the recent Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to assessing the real impact of the projects financed by the EIB, as a number of speakers have rightly dwelt upon this aspect. In particular, recommendation 4 calls upon the EIB to undertake an in-depth study of the real contribution made by projects to regional development.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to point out that, since 1995, the EIB has had an independent unit for <span class="italic">ex post</span> evaluation of projects, a unit whose reports are transmitted directly to the board of directors, without any possibility of their being changed by the hierarchy or the Management Committee. These reports are then made available to the public and Mr Lipietz’s report in fact refers to a number of these. The initial reports were, of course, fairly critical. Why? Because we asked this newly created unit to concentrate first on those cases which we considered to be most problematic.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we have reports covering a larger number of projects and the evaluation results are distinctly more encouraging. Thus a recent report dealing with a number of projects in northern Portugal and southern Italy shows that the vast majority of these have had a positive, and in some cases very positive, impact on the development of the regions concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the same report emphasises the importance of further refining the methodology, particularly in order to identify more diversified and more specific criteria for improving the selection, <span class="italic">a priori</span>, of the projects that are most promising for regional development. That is why, in close cooperation with the staff of the Commission’s Directorate-General for Regional Policy, we are currently working on developing a battery of performance indicators for loans for regional projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that similar work is under way on evaluating global loans, that is, the loans that we grant to intermediary banks for lending either to SMEs or to local authorities. Here again we are endeavouring to improve the ways of verifying that these loans are indeed used for the benefit of SMEs and that the most favourable terms are passed on to the ultimate recipients of these loans.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to external monitoring of the bank, I can only unreservedly endorse recommendation 10. I should like to confirm before you that the agreement entered into in 1999 between the Court of Auditors, the Commission and the EIB concerning the bank’s activities based on Community resources is being implemented to the satisfaction of all the parties concerned and that, of course, the EIB will continue to meet its obligations <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Court of Auditors resulting from that agreement. I should also like to confirm that we are currently negotiating a similar agreement with the Court of Auditors with regard to monitoring the European Investment Fund, which has become a subsidiary of the EIB. I would add that we are amenable to any practicable form of banking supervision. This is a matter that has been discussed by your committee. We are completely open to any proposals in this connection. In any case, in the short term perhaps the most practicable approach is no doubt to strengthen the Audit Committee by seeing to it that members are appointed who have experience and expertise in the field of banking supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the policy of transparency, we are willing to sign up to the guidelines set out in recommendation 11. However, we must emphasise that, unlike the institutions referred to in your rapporteur’s text, the majority of the EIB’s clients are private commercial companies and obviously do not want the confidentiality that is standard practice in commercial negotiations not to be observed in relations with the EIB. But, subject to that reservation, we have decided to move towards greater transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thus able to announce to you that we are going to publish on our website a list of all projects in the pipeline, before they are even submitted to the board of directors, except of course where the promoter has good reason to object on grounds of confidentiality. With that sole proviso, all projects will be announced on our website.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Investment Bank is, as you know, unlike other banks. It was established to serve the objectives of the European Union. It is therefore only natural that it should be called upon to explain itself before the European Parliament. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to do so today and am delighted that I shall be able to continue the dialogue in the future, as Mrs van den Burg has kindly suggested. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I share the idea mentioned by the President and included in the report that the European Investment Bank is an instrument of European Union policies, but we must not forget either that the EIB has the obligation to make optimal use of the resources at its disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">To a great extent the Commission shares the views contained in the report, but I should like to make a few comments on two or three subjects that I think are particularly relevant to the call for the Commission and the Council swiftly to extend the mechanism for subsidising interest rates on loans given by the bank, especially external loans as well as internal ones.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a difficult subject that the Court of Auditors has come out strongly against, expressing clear reservations as to its effectiveness. From the Commission’s viewpoint, it is true that we must do everything we can to ensure that the instruments we have are effective in facilitating investments, but it is no less true that there are projects, such as in the environmental field or from the countries applying for accession, which, in view of the interest rate levels we are working with today, could be resolved more efficiently by means of cofinancing systems, for instance through some of the current programmes. Such efficiency could be even greater at a later stage, when said countries are members of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also calls on the bank to ensure that its risk-capital activities are adequate and to make the necessary effort to attract risk capital via the stock exchange, especially in those sectors with problems. The President of the bank has already made some reference to the efforts made. The Commission, for its part, has supported the bank’s ideas of arriving at a better distribution of functions between the former European Investment Fund and the bank. We think the current model, in which the Fund has become the arm of the bank for carrying out these risk-capital investment projects, is a good one and the current availability of greater resources is without any doubt a clearly positive factor compared with the former situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to comment on the greater importance to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises. Small and medium-sized enterprises are going to be able to take advantage of this possibility of access to risk-capital, but they are also going to be the great beneficiaries in the bank’s Innovation 2000 Initiative, especially in its support for investment in information and the knowledge-based economy. All this supports the Lisbon proposal, but it also supports this possible action on behalf of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">A subject I think especially worth highlighting is global loans, which are also put forward in terms relevant for small and medium-sized enterprises and without any doubt will enable us to solve two problems that some of you have mentioned. First, sharing out resources more efficiently. We must not forget that these global loans at the moment are practically one third of the bank’s new loans. Secondly, the idea of the bank’s activities being more consistent with Community policies is also important. I think all of this will end up benefiting the bank’s activities and the policies defined.</p>
<p class="contents">One last comment: on page 18 of the report the Commission is called upon to perform a monitoring role, especially in connection with risk-capital and also the control and management of interest rates. On this subject in particular I can tell you that my colleagues responsible for these areas, especially as regards external assistance, are analysing the topic so that in accordance with the criteria and comments that I set out earlier we can reach the best possible solution to use the bank’s funds in the most efficient way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
