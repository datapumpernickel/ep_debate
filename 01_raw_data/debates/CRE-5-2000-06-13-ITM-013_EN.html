<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Velzen (PPE-DE). –</span></span>   <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, it is an absolute thrill for me to be able to start this debate in the absence of the rapporteur. You will have seen my look of desperation as I was scanning the room for Mrs Thors, but I am nonetheless pleased to do the honours. I wanted to begin by extending warm thanks to her for the excellent cooperation and the sterling work she has done. This is still the case, of course. But I am still sorry that she is unable to attend. </p>
<p class="contents">Convergence plays a huge role across the globe and naturally relates to both the Internet and the mobile sector, which will soon be closely interwoven. This is one of Europe’s great opportunities, but digital television also plays an important role. There is enormous potential there too, provided we meet three pre-conditions which I will briefly outline for you. </p>
<p class="contents">My first pre-condition is that we need to do more in the field of standardisation and interoperability. What do I mean by that? Interoperability of the set-top boxes is intended to avoid a situation where before long, users are having to place a whole assortment of boxes on top of their digital TVs in order to continue to watch the various programmes. We need to avoid this at all costs. I therefore welcome with open arms the DVB group’s recommendation of the Multimedia Home Platform as a possible standard. This is a step in the right direction. It has to come from the industry. I think that we can guide this process along to some extent, but the initiative has to come from the industry. Given the developments in the DVB group, it looks as if the industry has made good progress. I therefore hope that the industry will continue to seek open standards, because there are all kinds of exciting developments underway which we do not want to sabotage. But if the industry cannot achieve an open standard or interoperability, the politicians can and must speak out. A solution must then be found on a political plane as a last resort. </p>
<p class="contents">My second remark concerns open access. It is of utmost importance that open access be established and that the current must carry rules remain in place, because Europe is more than just a digital economy. It is also a cultural Europe. This is why I think that the amendment tabled by Mrs Thors with regard to her own report is sound. The must carry rules must continue to exist as long as they are proportionate and restricted to those stations which are intended to fall within the scope of Protocol 32 annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is absolutely vital that the directive on television without frontiers be reviewed. I hope that our Commissioner will be able to include this when he presents the new telecom legislation relatively soon, because a total package is desperately needed in order to eventually move convergence along much further in Europe, both in terms of telecomms and digital TV, and I hope that this package will enable Europe to take a leading role, which is what we called for in Lisbon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to thank Mr van Velzen for his work in introducing the debate during my absence. I think it is important that we remember how matters stood when the directive was adopted. It was believed on that occasion that it was conditional access which would present the worst bottleneck when it came to our obtaining open TV. That is perhaps not the case now, but it is other parts of television’s distribution network which will become bottlenecks or gatekeepers if we do not watch out. </p>
<p class="contents">Not only must it be possible to use different types of technical apparatus in combination with one another, but different computer programs must also be required to understand each other. At the same time, consumers have a great need for easily accessible information and can reasonably demand that the market should also be predictable. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that, where TV is concerned, we shall, in the future, have a situation where digital TV will be a part of ever more integrated electronic functions in the home. It is therefore important that we should have an API, an <span class="italic">Applications Programme Interface</span>, which can be used as part of this integrated environment. This is also crucial when it comes to the electronic program guides. It is these two factors which the forthcoming provisions should especially concentrate on. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also draw my fellow MEPs’ attention to the fact that these electronic program guides will be important in, for example, enabling parents to protect young children from material they do not wish them to see. </p>
<p class="contents">Neither the decoders’ operating systems nor the electronic program values are at present mutually compatible. The parliamentary committee shares the view, as did the Commission, that the markets and techniques within the field of digital television have been developed beyond the scope of the directive. The regulations in the special directive we are now discussing ought therefore to be revised and can usefully be incorporated into those clusters of proposed modifications to directives governing the communications sector which we can expect from the Commission in a few weeks’ time. </p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s conclusion is that open standards are now needed. We are now seeing the second and third generation of equipment for digital television. The work being done on creating that kind of open standard for home multi-media equipment is well advanced, and the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute, ETSI, will hopefully adopt the MHP standard. There are good reasons for accepting that this standard will form a basis for the future. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that political decisions concerning standards will be needed in the future if the market cannot reach an agreement. </p>
<p class="contents">Digital TV is distributed in a number of different ways which are technically not quite the same. Like traditional TV, digital TV can be broadcast across terrestrial networks, by cable and via satellite. These distribution systems at present have different degrees of penetration, but satellite distribution is the dominant system. Tomorrow, distribution by cable may, however, gain ground. With distribution by cable, there is an inbuilt return channel which provides direct access to interactive services on the network. I believe that access to interactive services is the <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> of digital TV’s becoming one of the important gateways to the information society. The different distribution systems mean that digital TV can also become a particularly important way for sparsely populated areas to access the Internet. </p>
<p class="contents">An end to analogue TV broadcasts and a total changeover to digital TV are important if we are to be able to exploit the limited resource of the radio spectrum in an effective way. No one has yet been able to define under which conditions analogue broadcasts can cease. </p>
<p class="contents">Digitalisation means that there will be challenges, especially perhaps for public service broadcasters which cannot subsidise the extra equipment required in the same way that conventional broadcasters can. How are licence fees to be collected in countries which finance broadcasting in this way and have a free-to-air tradition? </p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that the rapporteur vigorously supports the ‘must carry’ principle, or obligation on the part of cable operators to broadcast certain channels, and believes that this must continue. On the other hand, we ought not to make such demands as would impede the development of the very interactive services in question. Nor ought we to jeopardise the will to invest in upgrading the network. </p>
<p class="contents">Even public service companies which previously broadcast their programmes free of charge are now in the process of setting up boundaries and making it more difficult to broadcast across national borders. In the background are issues of copyright. The TV companies’ copyright organisations ought to make the most of new opportunities to give those who want to watch digital programmes the right also to do so beyond the borders of the broadcasting country. That is a goal which we are already committed to achieve by the Treaty and by the ‘Television Without Frontiers’ Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This can be attributed to the fact that the market development of digital television has been much slower than anticipated. However, digital television has become increasingly important over the last few months and years, in the wake of media convergence. The Internet and home banking via digital television are examples of how the range of services has widened.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This report will form the basis of a draft directive. Our group has two demands to make of the framework regulation for digital TV. Firstly, the framework must not restrict the meteoric technological development in this sector, and it must not be too rigid. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the framework must, however, safeguard the European internal market and consumer interests. We want to, and must, work within these two parameters. </p>
<p class="contents">This entails the following: firstly, the transmission obligations are still an important means of meeting social requirements, for example minority language programmes or the important role of the public broadcasting sector. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the interoperability of the access systems to digital TV at subscriber level, as mentioned by the previous speaker Mr van Velzen. It is unacceptable for subscribers to need several receptor boxes in order to receive programmes. It should be one box per subscriber and no more.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, technical interoperability must not be compromised or undermined on account of national monopoly formation or abuse of a dominant position.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, our aim is to create a European internal market, promote technical development and bring about television without frontiers – something the two previous speakers touched on – and that includes making sure that in future, citizens of other countries who are resident in the European Union are able to receive their pay TV services.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted with the report by Mrs Thors. We adopted a very well balanced report in committee.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I am unable to endorse the two proposed amendments tabled by Mrs Thors, on behalf of our group, for the same reasons advanced by Mr van Velzen. We intend to vote against both proposed amendments. Apart from that, we congratulate you on this report and hope that in the course of the next few days and weeks, the Commission will present a sound basis for a directive.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, digital TV will be one of the key access roads leading towards the digital highway and will help in the distribution of high-capacity networks throughout Europe, including the more remote areas. As such, this means of communication will grant many more Europeans access to all kinds of information. It is therefore of utmost importance that a favourable investment climate be created for digital television within Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">After all, we are at the dawn of a new era. Traditional boundaries between telecom companies, entertainment industry and journalistic media are becoming increasingly blurred. These industries are being replaced by multinational cable media giants which are created by mergers. This is a pattern which is emerging throughout the industry. Infrastructure and content industry are coming together. This means that two aspects should be monitored effectively. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we should look out for unwanted media concentrations, because otherwise consumer prices will as yet spiral out of control. Moreover, we must guarantee – and this is directly linked to this – journalistic neutrality, which is so important to our democracy. </p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, technological developments naturally affect the legislative framework and <span class="italic">vice versa</span>. Legislation should not hinder the interoperability of different technologies and should, therefore, be laid down at European level, as a minimum, and preferably worldwide. We have noticed that in many Member States, media policy, in particular, is still all too often being adopted at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point, Mr President, concerns the transmission rights which are currently still being sold purely on a national basis. As a result of this, people outside a certain country cannot subscribe to television services from another Member State, whether this relates to free or pay-TV programmes. This is an unwanted development. It should be possible for all citizens to subscribe to television services from another Member State. This means digital television but also television without frontiers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very sound and important report. Digital television is one of the most important contributors to convergence, and will become one of the primary means of accessing the data highways. Digital television will afford increased and wider access, also for the more remote regions. Therefore, it is important to make operators’ lives easier, rather than introducing far too many regulations.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">But this balancing act between investment, development and minimal regulation gets particularly difficult when there is a need to safeguard cultural diversity and general information. This is where we need to look for ideal solutions within the new framework conditions, with all due respect for quality.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, Mrs Thors' report meets with our approval. We echo her demand for separation of content and infrastructure and for the obligation to transmit on particular channels. We are calling for decoder parts to be made part of the information infrastructure, for the interoperability of decoders to be addressed, and for Member States to be afforded the opportunity to demand open networks. We also welcome with open arms the fact that the Commission approves of mergers, provided open standards are used. This will be another useful tool in our efforts to prevent abuse of dominant positions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I too would like to endorse what previous speakers have said. There is no internal market for TV services. We need to tackle this with sensitivity, and fast. In the light of the developments that have taken place, it is absolutely essential that we enter into a comprehensive debate on public service broadcasting. Without infringing the subsidiarity principle, we in Europe have a responsibility not to put public service broadcasters at the mercy of the forces of competition, when they have a duty to provide information and to safeguard cultural diversity. I would urge every one here to be particularly sensitive in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She asked me, “What are you going to do in Strasbourg?” I said, “I am going to speak on the Thors report.” “But what is this Thors report?” “It is a report which deals with the fact that, soon, a pensioner will be able to turn on the television and see Mr Fatuzzo making a speech in the European Parliament and hear what he says.” “Oh, that is very good,” said Mrs Boroni, and then she asked, “but can I see how many contributions I have made to the Italian National Social Welfare Institution as well? Can I see what my pension will amount to when I retire?” “Of course, Mrs Boroni, this is the future, the future of the citizens. There are no more barriers. You will even be able to see what is happening in the pension companies of other States.” “But I have to live on 700 000 lira a month” said Mrs Boroni. “How will I be able to afford this television of the future?”</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken the floor to tell you what Mrs Boroni wants: namely for the European Parliament – and I am sure that this was among Ms Thors’ intentions when she wrote her report and I call upon the Commissioner to see to the matter when he issues the directive – to ensure that the less well-off citizens, whether they are pensioners or not, are able to access the new digital television services of the future free of charge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to mention one or two problems connected with this issue. Firstly, I support the open standard and compatibility: that is only sensible. Access has been conditional in the cable network, which has been spoken about here, but it is also important to have diversity, and not only access. Competition alone does not guarantee it. We know that global competition in the television sector has often led to uniformity of supply: they all compete with the same sort of soap operas. This is a big issue, and it relates to access.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, I support the notion that technical systems are not neutral. They make some things possible more than others. Thus, for example, the ease of availability of interactive services – which the previous speaker was perhaps speaking about, in a way – is a political question. At least it is a social question, if not a party political one, because, for example, Gallup polls and voting in local elections will depend on interactive facilities, as will the extent to which people can intelligently participate. The MHP, or future Multimedia Home Platform, which transfers facilities from the apparatus to software, is, in a way, the final revolution in this chain, making it possible – as the rapporteur remarked – to receive everything off the television on the Internet, obviously including papers and magazines, films and everything else, perhaps even fragrances, which, for us older men, would be a real pick-me-up. It is important that the correct policy is established here as well: the cost of the equipment must not impede public participation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are the new dangers facing new media: mergers between market leaders. Similar discussions to the ones that have already taken place over Microsoft are now attracting attention in this sector. The question of the moment as regards digital TV is whether it is possible to secure a monopoly with the access hardware alone, i.e. the D-box in this case, particularly when leading companies in the IT sector merge with traditional media businesses.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Nor should we be under any illusions from a cultural point of view. There will not automatically be more interactivity or more people who know how to handle their computer via the TV. Therefore it is still important to stand firm on the duty public service broadcasting has to society, to prevent the formation of monopolies, particularly in the media industry, and to work towards fair access and educating people in self-access to these media. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will dwell on a few critical aspects which I feel should be brought to Parliament’s attention. </p>
<p class="contents">For example, in my opinion, it is extremely important to concentrate on the copyright rules because the restrictions resulting from copyright agreements and the differences in standards used for transmissions are likely to hold back progress towards a genuine television without frontiers and a genuine European internal market in television services. This would probably mean losing a unique opportunity to develop a European television industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Citizens who live or work in Member States which are not their country of origin cannot legally subscribe to foreign platforms as these do not own the right necessary to broadcast in the Member States in question. The European Parliament has already raised this issue in the past and the rapporteur analyses it, while drawing attention to the problem as it presents itself in the border regions, where the linguistic minorities live on the other side of the border. In any case, we should place greater emphasis on actions aimed at implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that it must be stressed, as the rapporteur pointed out clearly, that in the new regulatory framework, a balance must be struck between the need to ensure the diversity of culture and content<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>in television networks and the risk that regulation might hamper the will to invest in digital TV. We need a flexible approach in order to regulate the economic situations which are going through a period of deep-rooted change. </p>
<p class="contents">The regulation of the market must not hamper its development and, in particular, the development of new television services. In this regard, I feel that we should go back in the forthcoming months or years to certain factors such as the separation of the regulation of the content in TV from regulation of the infrastructures. Moreover, I would argue that there should also be great focus on the interoperability of systems which, although its aim is general protection of the possibility for users to access the data<span class="bold"> </span>broadcast via the digital platforms, is emerging at this time as a competition protection measure, protecting the possibility of access to the market for the different operators and thus opening up unprecedented legal horizons.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I feel that, over a period of a few years, we have all been able to gauge the progress made in this area and to emphasise that the initial choices which we made were valid ones. Incidentally, today, at a time when we are facing a significant stage of development, I think it important to stress that in all our policies we must find the necessary balance: between the Community approach and Community standards, on the one hand, and the specific national features and national disparities on the other hand; balance between the need, in terms of production, to cover a large European market and promote European products, i.e. developing ‘television without frontiers’, and, on the other hand, the ability to retain options as regards wavelength standards and local television. These are crucial issues for us, requiring the utmost flexibility on our part.</p>
<p class="contents">At the outset, digital television was seen as something apart from high-definition television, another subject area that I knew well. Today, we are coming to realise that it enables vast flexibility and quantity. At present, we must strive to find a fair balance between what needs to be done at European level, what can be done at national level and at local level, since this has implications both for European and national action as regards deregulation, the market and technology.</p>
<p class="contents">It was certainly important to sum up the situation regarding digital television at the present time. Once again I should like to congratulate Mrs Thors on the quality of her report and to say that I shall remain personally very attentive to the work done in this field. The important thing is to keep in mind that information, communication and television should be aimed primarily towards the citizens, and any inflexibility which might tomorrow prove an obstacle to a culture accessible to all should be avoided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a focused report.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by making a link to the next debate on electronic communications. In this whole area we have to be very conscious about how fast technology is moving and how that technology is beginning to change our whole thinking and indeed the whole form of competition in which digital television and other media are developing. I come from a country where there is a long tradition of public service broadcasting and that is one of the areas Mrs Thors has addressed powerfully in her report: the questions of access to this new technology and access to the viewer.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that one of the key things that all people in the industry are facing is competition for a very scarce amount of viewer time. As channels multiply, viewers are having more choice – not just in looking at programmes but in being able to shop, to use interactive Internet media through their digital televisions; interactive media which they can pay for. They can pay for a sports event with interaction to be able to choose the sort of format that they want. It will not be long before they are able to buy a digital recorder which will hold hundreds of hours of television time on a hard disk which will be sorted for them so they will be able to watch things in time shift. They will have different forms of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to make sure that our legislation does not constrict the growth of technology and does not constrain the growth of competition that is going to come through these new forms of technology. That is an issue we have to think about, both in considering Mr van Velzen's report and in the new report on copyright in the information society which will be before this House in a few months' time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission welcomes this report. It raises the need for a balanced approach to regulation. We need to balance two things: first, commercial freedom and incentives to invest and, second, protection of defined public interests in a focused and proportional way. The new regulatory framework will provide regulators with much greater flexibility to achieve this balance.</p>
<p class="contents">The directives that the Commission will propose this month take account of the three key points raised in Mrs Thors' report. First, the need to update <span class="italic">ex ante </span>regulations for digital television. The new framework will allow regulators to address new gateways such as Applications Programme Interface. Second, the report supports limiting "must carry" privileges to channels with a public service remit, as defined in Protocol 32 of the Treaty. The report also points out that there should be negotiation that balances remuneration for operators with the value of public service channels to operators. The Commission will address these issues in its upcoming legislative proposals. Third, the need for increased interoperability between different television platforms.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, the report singles out two key elements. First, the need for interoperability wherever possible and access rules where proprietary standards contribute to significant market power; and, second, the need to define a new, open decoder architecture, the multimedia home platform.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission prefers an industry-led approach rather than imposing standards. We have reserve powers to intervene if the market actors cannot agree. However, the market is developing open standards. In dynamic markets the standardisation process lags behind the leading edge of technology. The use of open standards reduces both regulation and the number of competition cases. The report signals this clear message to the market place very strongly. I fully support this.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also raises several issues which lie on the content side and are, therefore, outside the scope of the new framework for electronic communications. As far as possible, we must separate the network and content regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The reception of encrypted digital television services across borders raises several difficult issues. First, there is enough ill treatment of copyright: pay-TV services only buy the rights for a particular Member State. Even digital free-to-air services are being encrypted. This creates tensions with single market principles for pay-TV services. Differing approaches to content regulation may also play a role. But here I need to reflect on this with my colleagues, Mrs Reding and Mr Bolkestein, who have particular competence in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
