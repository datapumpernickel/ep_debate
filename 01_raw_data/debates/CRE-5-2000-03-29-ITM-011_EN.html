<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">MacCormick (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – It is an honour and a pleasure to have the opportunity to present this report to Parliament today. It is on the very important subject of product liability on which the European Community first introduced legislation as long ago as 1985 in the form of a directive. This was transposed in a somewhat leisurely way, and in some cases we might even say in a shockingly slow way, by Member States. So it is only fairly recently that there has been across the Union experience of the working of the product liability regime, which of course is not absolutely uniform in any event across the countries, because there are areas where different views may be taken consistent with the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation substitutes distributive justice, in a sense, for corrective justice in this very important area of the law of civil liability. The idea is that if a defective product is sold and used and injures in any way a consumer, the consumer should be entitled to compensation without proof of fault on the producer’s part, merely proof of causation of the damage by the defective product. This is a very good idea. It helps to spread the risks of injury widely and ensure compensation. Of course, it does not in itself ensure product safety. That is better done by other regimes regulating various industries, and we have a good regulatory regime in most of our industries in the European Union now.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it should not be thought that this is the only basis upon which people who are injured can be helped. We have other systems of distributive justice on this side of the Atlantic, not paralleled in, for example, the United States of America, which has a different but somewhat tougher product liability law than we have. There, however, it is a kind of forensic lottery, as academics have called it, because many people who are injured get nothing at all and some people who are injured get enormous damages. It is generally, and rightly, thought that plaintiffs’ lawyers are the people who do best out of the deal. We should stick to our own view on social security as the main basis for help, but then have this product liability regime as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper raised the question of whether this scheme should be extended and whether some changes should be made. This was in response to debates in Parliament last year, which led to the amendment of the directive to include primary agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that the Green Paper, although it has started the debate well, will not finish it completely. It gave a useful summary of the way the law has developed and been applied, and then asked a series of questions of interested parties and required replies in by the end of November last year. That is a good way of finding out if there are alarming and urgent matters needing swift action. It is a bad way of producing a thorough and scientific study of the impact of a body of law on civil society and on life in our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We need more and deeper study for that purpose. In the meantime we could take this view, and my report suggests that we take this view: unless the evidence produced shows a strong factually-based need for early change, we should have further and deeper reflection on the matter, and we should have a debate that ranges wider than the debate triggered by the Green Paper itself. There is a great deal of very interesting work of a scholarly and scientific kind and there could be more if it was known that this was properly under consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this approach has disappointed some colleagues, particularly those who raised the debate last year, and it has been suggested that the Parliament would simply walk away from important issues if we left it at that. I would not myself like to leave it at that. I have therefore suggested some compromise amendments which suggest that there must be a further and deeper dialogue about this which pays close attention to the points which have been raised without prejudging what is the right answer to them. I do not think it should be prejudged. I would not myself like to be a party to imposing on Europe the “tort tax” under which Americans have made themselves suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">So I suggest that we urge the Commission to hold a longer and deeper dialogue about this; not to precipitate action but to measured consideration. We have a good law and the saying “if a thing ain’t broken, don’t fix it; but do not be complacent about it either” applies here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A week ago, the European Council in Lisbon spoke out in favour of a Europe of innovation. Under these circumstances the question which arises is, do we need to review our European liability law? Do we want to mimic the Americans in our liability law? How can we formulate a liability law which promotes rather than hinders innovation?</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that the Commission has initially submitted a Green Paper on this issue because we consider it sensible to start by evaluating experience with the present directive before we start laying down new rules. As the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we are in favour, in the interests of legal security, of a clear division between compensation and punitive sanctions, a division not possible under American law. In the interests of medium-sized enterprises, we want to prevent incalculable liability risks and avoid excessive compensation for parties which have suffered minor damage at the expense of consumers as a whole since, at the end of the day, it is they who must pay for such compensation in the form of higher prices. We want a liability law which promotes innovation and does not conceal incalculable liability risks for companies launching new products.</p>
<p class="contents">In evaluating the opinions submitted on the Green Paper, we should like the Commission to have a free rein when it assesses the need to reform the product liability directive. We would like you to evaluate the reports which you receive impartially.</p>
<p class="contents">We think, at first glance, that the present liability law achieves a fair balance between the interests of consumers on the one hand and the interests of product manufacturers on the other. Companies must assume liability for damage to consumers without fault. At the same time, liability is statute barred after ten years and capped at EUR 75 million. We therefore take the view that a review should only be started if there is clear proof of the need to amend the directive. Caution and level-headedness are needed. Millions of cases are affected day after day. We wish the Commission every success in evaluating the results of the Green Paper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gebhardt (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, our honourable friend, Mr MacCormick, has made a thorough and critical appraisal of the Green Paper on civil liability for defective products and he deserves our thanks for his work and for his cooperative contribution. I should just like to make a few more comments on behalf of my group on a number of necessary amendments on which both we and the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party reached extensive agreement in the run-up. I refer to the checks which your department needs to carry out, Commissioner Bolkestein, and the question of the burden of proof which, according to Article 4, rests solely on the injured party. My group believes the Commission should check if prima facie evidence and circumstantial evidence can also be taken into account at all levels at which evidence is taken. This is particularly important because the product world is becoming more and more complex and it is becoming more and more difficult for individual persons who have suffered damage to provide proof in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the question of derogations from general manufacturer’s liability, especially the so-called development risk. We need to examine if these derogations are expedient and conducive to the balance between manufacturers and consumers. This applies in particular in the case of foodstuffs and medication. We do not want to see the consumer alone bear the risks inherent in technical progress. In my view, applying the directive solely to private use and consumption is a questionable move. The Commission should consider if the directive should not be extended to commercial goods. The material damage sustained by a company is, in principle, no different from the material damage sustained by a private individual. And the smaller the enterprise, the heavier the burden of this unequal treatment. Harmonisation of laws at Community level would be in keeping with the purpose of the product liability directive, especially as increasing flexibility in the world of work is tending more and more to blur the clear distinction between the private world and the world of work.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to think about the way in which liability is statute-barred. It is clear from the case of BSE that a standard ten-year limitation on liability may be insufficient under certain circumstances. We could perhaps consider gearing the limitation period to the type of product. However, it is not only these individual points which are important; we also need to seize every opportunity to harmonise product liability still further in the form of comprehensive consumer protection in the European Union. If we supplement the MacCormick report in this direction, the European Parliament will have done a good job in the eyes of the consumer. Which is why we have been elected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would particularly like to focus my comments on the issues raised by this report on the further harmonisation of private law. In our enthusiasm we sometimes forget what a sensitive subject the harmonisation of private law is; it touches the national legal traditions in our Member States, legal traditions born of our differing histories and cultures of separate nations and jurisdictions. Professor MacCormick will be acutely aware of this in Scotland, with its own legal heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not in any way opposed to further harmonisation, it can be helpful to the good functioning of the internal market, but imposed legislative harmonisation needs to be carefully and openly considered, or we may find we have left our citizens behind in this project.</p>
<p class="contents">The traditional push towards harmonisation has been the internal market to which we can now add the aspirations of Tampere for a single area of European justice.</p>
<p class="contents">But harmonisation must respect subsidiarity – we have no need to rush towards uniformity of civil law in this area of product liability. We should be aware that uniformity can stifle innovation and prevent adaptation to local or national circumstances and problems. It is a truism that European law has been able to benefit from the ability to draw on rich comparative material of varying legal traditions in our different Member States. It would be dangerous to stifle this by uniformity.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me suggest that the aspirations of Tampere can be better met in the public law area of the intended Charter of Fundamental Rights than by further imposed legislation which harmonises our private law traditions. Research seems to show that our traditions are tending to converge slowly. Let us perhaps be prepared to assist and guide that convergence and respect the conditionality of the further harmonisation which is integral to Professor MacCormick’s proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In considering the whole issue of product liability we have to say that the current directive appears to have functioned well. There is not a great deal of evidence that consumers are at the moment being seriously disadvantaged. I would argue quite strongly that we have achieved a very fair and reasonable balance of interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pick up the point made by my colleague Mr Wuermeling that we must take particular care about development risks in the environment within which we now find ourselves. It was a crucial issue at the Lisbon Summit and new product innovation is one of the key competitive aspects of European business. If our regulations on product liability stifle competitiveness and innovation, I suggest that consumers will be at a major disadvantage as well. Consumers will be the ones to lose out, if a flow of competitive and innovative products is stifled. So let me echo Mr MacCormick: there is a need for much more clearly-based factual evidence before we make changes to this legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore feel that it is notable and praiseworthy that the Commission has decided to review it. This Green Paper represents a first step towards this review. We must bear in mind the fact that in 1985 certain principles that are today considered to be fundamental were not incorporated, and at that time could not be incorporated into the text of the directive, because debate on the subject had not reached a sufficiently advanced level.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst these principles, the first we should highlight is the importance of the manufacturer accepting, at least in certain areas, the development risks. I come from a country, Spain, where consumer legislation dictates that the manufacturer bears responsibility for development risks. There have been no bankruptcies among insurance companies or manufacturers, nor has technical progress been hampered as a result. For too long the consumer has had to bear the full cost of this risk in the cause of progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The second principle consists of removing the burden of proof from the party that has suffered the damage. We are talking about an objective responsibility and therefore the burden of proof imposed on the victim must be made as light as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The third principle concerns setting levels of compensation. The directive does provide for this eventuality, but we must bear in mind the fact that judicial bodies are used to seeing this setting of compensation as interference by legislative authority in its duties and this issue must therefore also be reviewed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr MacCormick, for the report he has produced and the work he has done. May I also thank the other Members of this House for their comments and questions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, rapporteur, the subject of product liability came up for discussion by the European Parliament around two years ago. At the time, the Commission put forward a proposal to the effect that the principle of risk liability for defective products, which is provided for in Directive 85/374, should also be applied to primary agricultural products and products of hunting. You may recall that during that debate in November 1998, the Commission announced that the report which was being drafted at the time on the functioning of the directive presented the best opportunity to consider revising the 1985 directive, and was the best means of doing so. The aforesaid report will be presented to Parliament and the Council at the end of this year. In addition, the Commission undertakes to initiate a wide-ranging discussion with all parties, based on a Green Paper, which is on the table for discussion in this sitting.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">On 29 July last year, the Commission gave its blessing to the current Green Paper on liability for defective products. This Green Paper was, and still is, intended to elicit information from all interested parties, particularly the business community, consumers, insurance companies and government institutions, on two questions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The first question is how the product liability directive of 1985 actually worked in practice. The second question is as follows: to what extent will this directive have to be amended? This document was intended, as I said, to stimulate reflection and debate. In an important section of the Green Paper, all interested parties are invited to make a firm case for their stance on the need for revision. This section addresses a wide range of subjects, amongst which are the points raised by the European Parliament in a debate two years ago, to wit, the burden of proof, development risks, compensation for brain injury suffered, franchise, the limitation period and financial ceilings, but also other issues such as the need for more transparency, supplier liability and recovery of damages.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">These subjects are also mentioned by Mrs Gebhardt, or at least some of them are. She also talked about burden of proof, development risks and further harmonisation in this sphere, as well as further industrial usage. These two sets of subjects overlap. In any case, it is clear that these subjects will all need to be addressed in a report that the Commission intends to compile towards the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The proposals for a potential revision, referred to in the Green Paper, must serve as guiding principles for open discussion. In fact, Mr MacCormick pointed out in his intervention this evening that the Commission needs to deepen the debate. I undertake to do so on behalf of the Commission, but this must be in concert with Parliament of course, and with the other interested parties, because as an entity, the Commission is, of course, dependent on the views expressed by society and by this House.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the Commission would not wish to anticipate any future initiatives on the part of the Commission. However, the Commission would urge all interested parties to base their response on factual evidence. This point was also emphasised by Mr Harbour, when he said that only convincing reasons of a factual nature could be put forward as arguments for amending the directive. The Commission agrees wholeheartedly with Mr Harbour. Of course, we will always be prepared to reconsider our position in the light of arguments of a factual nature, but under no other circumstances. That also explains why the Commission would call again on the Members of this House not to confine themselves to certain positions purely for reasons of principle.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Parliamentary committee with competence in this matter takes the same view as that expressed by myself a few moments ago, and by Mr Harbour, but the said committee believes that any revision of the 1985 directive should be based on incontrovertible fact. Before undertaking revisions, the Community legislator must subject the effects of existing legislation to careful scrutiny. A number of issues raised in the Green Paper, among others, will need to be addressed in the process. That is why in certain cases, people do not go along with attempts to galvanise the Commission into action, which is an opinion the Commission shares. It goes without saying that all the issues mentioned in the Green Paper will be gone through with a fine toothcomb in the report. So far, approximately one hundred contributions have been received from national and European consumer organisations, various sectors of the business community, government institutions in the Member States and in other European countries, as well as from organisations that specialise in product liability. This shows how important people think this subject is, and how justified Parliament is in devoting attention to this report this evening.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The analysis of the functioning of the directive, which will be undertaken on the basis of these contributions, is to be included in the report. The Commission does not intend at this stage to pass judgement on the debate as to whether or not it is necessary to revise the 1985 directive, but it will be guided by the aforementioned analysis in the course of this debate. If it turns out that it is indeed going to be necessary to undertake a revision, then naturally the Commission’s offices will prepare a draft proposal.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the European Parliament can subscribe to this approach, and that it will adopt the motion for a resolution prepared by the competent Parliamentary committee, in its unamended form. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
