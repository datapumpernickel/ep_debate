An indicative budget of EUR 40 million in the Meda national indicative programme from 2002 to 2004, signed by the Moroccan authorities in January 2002, has been earmarked for the purpose. This initiative forms part of a broader dialogue on migration issues between Morocco and the European Union, which also covers issues linked to legal immigration and the socio-economic dimension of migratory pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific programme is aimed at institution building, developing the regulatory framework, modernising infrastructure and equipment, training officials and developing cooperation between the Moroccan authorities concerned and their counterparts in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">An expert visit was arranged with a view to assessing needs and subsequently drawing up a timetable of concrete measures to improve the situation. During the mission, which took place in July 2002, experts from the Member States and the Commission had an opportunity to visit the main border posts and the frontier areas most affected by illegal immigration, particularly from sub-Saharan countries.</p>
<p class="contents">During those visits the Moroccan authorities expressed their political determination and firm commitment to cooperate with the Union in the fight against illegal immigration and on border controls in particular. In a spirit of openness and fruitful cooperation, in July and September 2002, they provided the experts with information on the regulatory framework and application of the rules as well as statistics on illegal emigration.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the outcome of the on-the-spot visits and after examining the data communicated by the Moroccan authorities, the experts are to finalise their report before the end of 2002. The content of the programme will subsequently be determined.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme is the first initiative on border control management with a country in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 1999 EU legislation was adopted with a view to encouraging research into the development of 'orphan' drugs for the treatment of rare diseases.

The cost of developing and marketing orphan medicinal products would not be recovered by their expected sales. For this reason, the pharmaceutical industry has been unwilling to develop such products under normal market conditions. The regulation on orphan medicinal products which entered into force in January 2000 provides a system of incentives for sponsors to develop and market designated orphan medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these incentives is market exclusivity for a period of 10 years. This is granted if a designated orphan medicinal product obtains a marketing authorisation in all Member States. To obtain this, the sponsor must conduct a series of tests and studies to demonstrate that the product meets the rigorous standards of quality, safety and efficacy required of all medicinal products marketed in the EU. Since 2000, 123 products have been designated as orphan medicinal products and placed on the Community register.</p>
<p class="contents">In a very small number of cases this involves a commonly available chemical that has been supplied by the manufacturer to hospitals which have prepared the chemical for administration to patients. The great majority of these orphan medicinal products contain new innovative ingredients. In a few cases it has been common practice for some time to supply the raw ingredients to treat the patient. However, this chemical has not been tested for its purity and safety and the product is not authorised. Indeed the chemical is not of pharmaceutical quality and may contain unspecified and unquantified impurities. In this situation, it is not surprising that an authorised medicinal product developed to meet rigorous standards of quality, safety and efficacy costs more than the base chemical.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has no powers with respect to either the price or reimbursement of medicines. However, the orphan regulation contains a provision to reduce the period of market exclusivity to six years, if after five years it can be shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify the maintenance of market exclusivity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The longer answer is as follows. I follow very closely the developments of the humanitarian situation in Chechnya and in the neighbouring republics where part of the Chechen population is displaced. In the most recent press statements of 27 November and 5 December of this year, I expressed my concerns about the gravity of the humanitarian and human rights situation there, in particular the growing pressures made on internally displaced persons to leave the camps in Ingushetia and return to Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, ECHO is the main donor of humanitarian aid to the region. It has supported the victims of the second Chechnya conflict since its very beginning and will continue to do so. The Commission, through ECHO, has so far allocated more than EUR 90 million in humanitarian aid in order to help people survive. In 2002 alone, EUR 25 million have been allocated for this crisis and an additional EUR 3 million are now in the pipeline for more emergency food aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ingushetia, at this very critical moment, ECHO provides support to internally displaced persons in camps, spontaneous settlements and host families. Most of the aid provided in the Aki Yurt camp had been funded by ECHO, and we will continue to be present in all other camps.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, ECHO continues to fund a very large part of the humanitarian assistance going to Chechnya proper. This is a very difficult task, as this is one of the locations in the world where working conditions for humanitarian organisations are the worst, both in terms of security and in terms of monitoring. We continue to argue with the Russian authorities on all these points as I have again and again informed this Parliament. The bottom line is that we are able to deliver humanitarian aid both around and inside Chechnya although it is difficult, but we are able to do it and we will continue to do it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They use local drivers, but the whole organisation is provided by that NGO. This is also recognised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and by the UN system in general. It is a very important achievement because it provides access for the humanitarian community.</p>
<p class="contents">So the answer to the question of whether we are able to monitor the whole flow is that we are doing it as well as possible. On a number of occasions over the years I have informed Parliament that we are working on the basis of a so-called 'remote-control' concept, which means that we have to use local implementing partners. However, so far we have not run into problems relating to accountability. We are trying to track every activity as carefully as possible. I would say that, as long as we are able to keep the operation carried out by the Danish Refugee Council up and running, we have some security in terms of knowing what is going on. The input from the UN organisations is also crucial in this respect and our cooperation with them is quite well developed.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of the people who are more or less willing to go back – and we fear they are fewer in number – is that they go back into all kinds of different situations. This is why we are criticising the pressure that they are under. We are clearly worried. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Taxation of fuel supplied in Gibraltar</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 20 November, the newspaper 'El Pais' reported that most vessels passing through the Straits of Gibraltar take on fuel from tanker ships anchored in Gibraltarian waters, instead of doing so in the port of Algeciras, where there are better installations. The reasons are, inter alia, that fuel is cheaper in Gibraltar than in Spain, and that the Spanish authorities are stricter in their application of EU regulations on maritime safety and pollution prevention than the Gibraltar authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no secret that this particular form of taking on fuel presents considerable environmental risks in terms of spillage, which has indeed occurred fairly frequently. Furthermore, the fact that the amount of tax paid on fuel differs between Spain and Gibraltar constitutes fullblown fiscal discrimination, seriously distorting competition, as happens with all products subject to Community customs duties.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Commission intend to do, therefore, to put an end to these practices, which are both dangerous to the environment and harmful to the proper operation of the internal market? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although many ports have equipment for refuelling on the quayside, this type of refuelling is still the most common in ports, not only in small ports, but also in others such as Rotterdam, Barcelona or Hamburg.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that this practice should be carefully supervised in order to prevent dumping and marine pollution. Therefore, many ports have adopted specific regulations and procedures which regulate such activities and the Commission, for its part, in accordance with the Treaty, monitors compliance with the Community legislation on environmental protection and therefore, on 24 January 2001, brought a case before the Court of Justice in relation to the non-application by the United Kingdom of a whole series of environmental rules in Gibraltar, including Directive 93/12/EEC on the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels.</p>

These black oil slicks and this black money always involve groups with structures much more like mafias than like businesses, made up of companies with ridiculous assets in order to evade responsibilities and covered by insurance which is also ridiculous. These groups are always protected by legislation which is lax from environmental, commercial and fiscal points of view, and Gibraltar is no exception.</p>
<p class="contents">The port of Gibraltar supplies much more fuel than the port of Algeciras, amongst other things because less harbour duties are paid there and because – as the Commissioner has acknowledged – maritime safety and environmental rules are applied much less rigorously and, thirdly, because less tax is paid.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not of course referring to special taxes, because any first-year law student knows that the fuel used in maritime transport is exempt from the value added tax on hydrocarbons. The problem is that direct taxes are not paid either, taxes on companies, which also have an impact on prices: 35% in Algeciras and nothing in Gibraltar, as Commissioner Monti knows very well.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask whether or not there are tax differences in Gibraltar when compared to Algeciras. Bearing in mind that there cannot be differences in relation to special taxes, there can be differences in relation to taxation as a whole, which has an impact on costs, as you will be aware, every time you go out to lunch or dinner and pay the bill. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the legal basis, I would refer to the press release issued by the Luxembourg Court on 10 December. The Court believes that Euratom has competences in the following areas: the establishment of a legislative and regulatory framework for organising the safety of nuclear installations; measures relating to the assessment and verification of safety; organisation in the event of emergencies; the choice of location of nuclear installations and, finally, the design, construction and operation of nuclear installations.</p>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 46 by Laura González Álvarez (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2002-0737_EN.html">H-0737/02</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Independence exercised by the Commission</span></p>
<p class="contents">In June 2002 a delegation of the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions travelled to Asturias at the invitation of the parliament of Asturias. One of the petitions handed to the committee chairman, Mr Gemelli, at a meeting with various groups of petitioners criticised the social and environmental impact of routing the ‘autovía del Cantábrico’ motorway through the west of the region. That petition was declared admissible by the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Surprisingly, however, before the petition could be discussed under the usual procedure, an MEP, accompanied by the secretary of his party in the region and three mayors, met with Commissioner Loyola de Palacio and two Commission officials. On their return to Asturias the mayors told the media that the petition had been filed.</p>
<p class="contents">How can a case be closed before the committee responsible has either seen or discussed it? How can Mrs Loyola de Palacio decide to file a petition which – as indicated in a reply sent by Mrs Wallström – does not fall within her department’s remit? Does the Commission not believe that its independence and the duty of confidentiality of the officials concerned have been affected? In its view, does action of this kind not undermine the role of the Committee on Petitions and of Parliament itself and, worse still, show a lack of respect for the petitioners? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As I said in the question, a number of petitioners spoke with Mr Gemelli, in Asturias – my region – and then there were a series of visits to the Commissioner. Now, what appears in the regional press is that the Commissioner and the officials say that this case is closed. It seems to me unfortunate to use the names of two officials from the Directorate-General for the Environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Asturian petitioners quite rightly asked me how it could be that a case was closed when it had not even been discussed in the Committee on Petitions. I therefore say to you that the appearance in the press of the names of these two officials and of the Commissioner greatly damages the credibility of the European institutions and of the Committee on Petitions. It grieves me that your name and those of these two officials should be linked to a political issue which should not have appeared in the press in this way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In reply to question E-1265/02 of 26 April 2002 by the author of the present question, the Commission stated that it would issue a communication on the Third Road Safety Action Plan during the third quarter of 2002.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Protection of Ireland's rail freight infrastructure</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of recent proposals from Ireland's government-owned rail freight operator, Iarnrod Eireann, to withdraw from certain rail freight operations? This proposal would lead to an estimated additional 400 extra trucks involved in transporting freight by road each day. Ireland already has a serious traffic congestion problem due to inadequate road infrastructure, and any further shift from rail to road would greatly exacerbate this problem. Such a development would also run counter to the Commission's rail freight strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission urgently raise this issue with the Irish Government and ensure its current strategic rail review leads to an internal freight policy consistent with the Transport White Paper? Will it seek a clear statement of the sums allocated to rail freight under the current and previous rounds of structural funds and of how it proposes to handle the evolution of a transport pricing policy, and a commitment that its future stewardship of the railway system will be consistent with the principles set out in the Transport White Paper? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The new European regulatory framework providing for the integration and interoperability of the market will allow rail companies to increase their competitiveness and orientate their business activities towards the growth of market sectors such as European goods services.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s financial aid for the construction or modernisation of rail infrastructures, as well as the elimination of bottle necks, creates the physical conditions necessary for the rail system to absorb a greater percentage of the expected future growth in transport volume.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community has co-financed various projects for development of the trans-European rail network in Ireland. For example, in 2000, the projects received co-funding of approximately EUR 3 million from the trans-European networks budget and around EUR 16 million from the Cohesion Fund. Nevertheless, for reasons of subsidiarity, the Commission is prevented from going further than its own competences when it comes to designating or selecting the priority objectives for action of a particular government, at any particular moment, in a specific State of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: New Berlaymont building</span></p>
<p class="contents">The main features of the contract on the purchase of the Commission's Berlaymont building were revealed on 23 October last. The Commission’s total payment will be €553 million and its share of the renovation cost is set at €503 million which includes €35.6 million for enlargement purposes. What provisions have been made for public access to the new Berlaymont building? What savings does the Commission expect to make once the need for its present 'improvised arrangements' have gone and it has returned to its original headquarters and what innovative features have been introduced to ensure that the running costs of the Berlaymont are kept to the minimum and the building will act as a symbol for a dynamic European Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In response to the question originally tabled by Mr Collins, public access to the building was considered to be an important aspect of urban integration during the design phase of the Berlaymont renovation project. The creation of a new public space around the building and the provision of the security glass wall are just two of the consequences of that integrative approach. The design also ensures that, with the exception of some specialist technical installations, the Berlaymont will be fully accessible to people with mobility difficulties. All offices, meeting rooms, interpretation booths and common spaces will be accessible either directly from the lifts or by integral ramps. Easily visible signs and markings everywhere will also be characteristic of the building.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second question raised by Mr Collins, the Commission will make significant savings because the purchase of the Berlaymont building at a comparatively competitive cost puts the institution in a better negotiating position in a property market where the major participants are well aware that the Commission will vacate a number of substitute buildings when it returns to the Berlaymont in the early part of 2004. In order to benefit fully from this situation the Commission has launched a call for an expression of interest for the provision of office space.</p>
<p class="contents">The final savings arising from these conditions can only be quantified precisely when the established location of all Commission offices in Brussels is clear. It will then be possible to make accurate comparisons between the price paid by the Commission – which is stable – and market rates which are patently not going to go down in the parts of Brussels which are of particular interest to us.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, unlike rental agreements that have to be renewed after a period of tenure, the cost of the Berlaymont to the Community budget is fully predictable because the annual payments of EUR 31.9 million and the annual step-up of 2% were determined when the Berlaymont contract was signed with the Belgian authorities, by me, in October.</p>
<p class="contents">Other cost savings which cannot easily be quantified at this stage will include the reduction of transport and communication costs between Commission offices that are now dispersed. In addition the energy efficiency and environmentally-friendly technology of the Berlaymont, together with a design that will restrain technical maintenance costs, will bring further savings.</p>
<p class="contents">The financing costs issue – the third point raised by Mr Collins – is central to the project development. The major design characteristics of the Berlaymont have already won the International 2000 Passive and Low Energy Architecture Award for the best architectural design. A copy of an authoritative specialist article giving details of that will be sent directly to the Member concerned. It clearly demonstrates how investment in innovative techniques in installations reduces the running and energy consumption costs significantly.</p>
<p class="contents">Many other aspects of the building design will keep the running costs to a minimum. For instance, the rain water on the site will be automatically collected and recycled for flushing and for maintenance in hygiene facilities. In Brussels, I am very glad to say, the regularity of rain water is not in doubt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall summarise at this juncture in response to the precise points that Mr Hyland raised. One of the Commission’s fundamental aims throughout the negotiations on the contract on the Berlaymont was safeguarding the interests of the European taxpayer. The whole project has taken so long and will take some time longer – until 31 December next year – partly because of difficulties arising from the clearance of asbestos in the building which was vacated in 1991. This clearance took about two years longer than originally planned for. Secondly, the arrangements for managing the renovation of the Berlaymont were also delayed. Thirdly, disputes of a variety of kinds, including litigation, have added at least several months – indeed we can probably start counting in years – to the renovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that delay means cost, and one of our objectives was to ensure that we only accepted a fair share of the costs. We therefore accepted that any additions that we required, particularly in relation to the further demands of enlargement, would be met by the Commission, as is only fair. We also wanted design adaptations to make the building fully accessible and state-of-the-art. The net result of all that is that the actual annual price that we will pay of EUR 31.9 million per annum, at an interest rate that we negotiated in recent months, will be lower than the cost anticipated when the protocol, the memorandum of understanding, was signed between the Commission and the Belgian Government in 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall cost of the Berlaymont meanwhile has gone up but, because of the contractual arrangements, our contribution to that cost is fixed, whereas the Belgian Government has an obligation to meet additional costs arising. I am more than happy to provide the full figures in the communication that we gave to Parliament and the Council in October and I will see that they are with the honourable Member before tomorrow evening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission encourages officials to move from the private to the public sector and vice versa. It even has arrangements allowing officials to work for a private company for a temporary period. That is a good thing in itself. However, the move by the head of the information policy division to Microsoft raises questions, as the official concerned was involved in the antitrust investigation into the company. The Commission’s spokesman has stated that the official was consulted by the Competition Directorate-General in connection with the investigation. He said that this did not pose a problem, as the person concerned had given assurances in a letter that he would not deal, at Microsoft, with matters being investigated by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">What guarantees does the Commission have that EU officials who go to work in the private sector will not pass on crucial information to their new employers? Do written promises by those concerned provide sufficient guarantees? Does the Commission agree that new rules on the secondment of EU officials are urgently needed? If so, what precise steps does it intend to take? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – I am grateful to the honourable Member for raising this question. Leave on personal grounds from the European Union civil service is governed by Article 40 of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities. That article contains provisions that enable an established official to be granted unpaid leave on personal grounds in exceptional circumstances and at his or her own request. As the honourable Member correctly points out, such unpaid leave may be granted when the official intends to work for a time in the private sector in order to broaden his or her knowledge and experience.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's view is that the institution benefits from such exchanges of expertise and experience and, in principle, it should therefore be encouraged. The Commission recognises that appointment to some posts could constitute – or appear to constitute – a conflict of interest. It is important to emphasise, therefore, that officials on personal leave continue to be subject fully to the provisions of Article 12 of the Staff Regulations, which require officials to obtain permission before engaging in any outside activity whatsoever and which also allow for refusal of permission or imposition of conditions where it is considered that the activity would otherwise be detrimental to the work of the Communities. The Commission would interpret the creation of conflicts of interest as being detrimental to the Community and would thus refuse permission for such activities or impose conditions in order to prevent conflicts arising.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 17 of the Staff Regulations, meanwhile, requires officials, whether in work or on personal leave, not to disclose to any unauthorised persons information not already made public. If an official or a former official who is working in the private sector made use of such privileged information, he or she would certainly face disciplinary proceedings. The purpose of the letter signed by the official mentioned in the honourable Member's question was to signify his full awareness that these requirements always prevail and are unconditional.</p>
<p class="contents">The Staff Regulation rules governing leave on personal grounds will be clarified by the reform amendments proposed by the Commission which, as the honourable Member will know, are currently before the Council. In addition, the Commission is examining means of providing more detailed guidance to officials and to potential employers in order to reinforce understanding of the need to ensure that the objectives of allowing exchanges between the Commission and other bodies are fulfilled, whilst also ensuring that the integrity and the security of the Commission are completely safeguarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But your reply does not entirely satisfy me, Commissioner. I want to believe in the good faith – I certainly do believe in your own good faith, let that be clear – of this civil servant. But an impression has been created. He was working on the anti-trust investigation into Microsoft and he leaves to join that company. I think it should be made explicit what case is involved here. I should certainly like to ask in future for a far clearer and more enforceable framework of agreements. Yes, a change of jobs must be possible, but not to companies or sectors on which you yourself have worked for the Commission because this will create the appearance of partiality that damages your Commission and by extension all European institutions. I should like once again to press the Commissioner on his future intentions. Is it feasible to create such a framework of agreements? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also why I referred to the further work that is being undertaken to clarify beyond any doubt for both potential employers and for Commission officials and former officials what the limits of activity are.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the official whose case is relevant to the specific question that the honourable Member asked was granted leave and permission to work for a company after he had signed a declaration that he was aware of his obligations under the Staff Regulations and would not disclose any confidential information to his employer. As she will understand and she was good enough to recognise both in her question and her supplementary question, in a free society, if we are trying to maintain the advantage of an interchange between the institutions and outside bodies, we must ultimately rely on the honour of civil servants as well as on the fact that they are advised and know that if they stray from the undertakings they have been required to give, they make themselves virtually automatically liable to disciplinary proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be of interest to the honourable Member and the House to know that, at the moment, 566 officials of the Commission are on personal leave. Four hundred cases have so far been examined, all will be examined. About 10% – around about 40 people – are actually engaged in professional activities. The other 90% are on personal leave because of family or educational obligations or they are undertaking external courses. When we have the final figures in the first week or so of next year I will certainly ensure that the honourable Member receives those in detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
