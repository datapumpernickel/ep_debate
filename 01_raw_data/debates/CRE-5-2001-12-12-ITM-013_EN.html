<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President.</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan, Mr Izzat Ghazzawi, Archbishop Zacarias Kamwenho, it is with great pleasure that the European Parliament welcomes you today in this Chamber, in order to award you the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought. Please allow me to offer a warm welcome not only to yourselves but also to the persons accompanying you, and especially to those of your relatives who are able to be present.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1988, the Sakharov Prize has been awarded every year by the European Parliament in recognition of individuals or organisations who have left their mark on the struggle for human rights and freedom in their home countries. At the centre of their actions has lain a deep-rooted conviction: the right to live in an environment of respect for the dignity of all human beings, whatever their ethnic origins, gender or beliefs.</p>
<p class="contents">This year it has been decided, for the first time, that the Sakharov prize is to be shared between three recipients. This is an exceptional decision in response to exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan, you are an Israeli who has been through profound and personal suffering. You once wrote: ‘If war is to be ended, it is necessary to realise that blood is the same colour for everyone and that when a single child dies the whole world dies with it’.</p>
<p class="contents">When your thirteen-year-old daughter Smadar lost her life in a Palestinian suicide bombing, you did not allow the horror to turn your mind towards hatred. Instead, you chose to denounce – and I quote your words – ‘a short-sighted policy which refuses to recognise the rights of the other and stirs up hatred and conflicts’. How many of us can be sure that we too would maintain the same courage and dignity in the face of the worst injustice of all, the loss of a child? All of us must feel affected in the depths of our soul by the strength and lucidity which have made you the symbol of all those Israelis who are campaigning for a peace which will take into account the aspirations of two peoples, the people of Israel and the people of Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">In awarding you the Sakharov Prize, our aim is to show our deep attachment to supporting all those who, through their daily actions, in spite of such difficult historical circumstances and in spite of the pressure of events, are working tirelessly to improve relations between peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Izzat Ghazzawi, you are a Palestinian whose suffering has also been great. In one of your letters from prison, you addressed an Israeli friend and poet, Ya’ir Horowitz, who had recently died. In your letter, you tried to re-establish a dialogue that had been interrupted by death, outlining the dream of peace that you shared and drawing on the resources of hope to fight the despair which threatened to overwhelm you because the dream of peace was fading with time.</p>
<p class="contents">You have tirelessly promoted the cause of peace and encouraged dialogue between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. Your ardour has never slackened, despite imprisonment and censorship and, more importantly, the irreplaceable loss of your sixteen-year-old son Rami, killed by the Israeli army while trying to help a school friend who had been wounded in the school playground. You have resolutely pursued that same dialogue, through your writings, your lecturing at Birzeit University, your leading role as chairman of the Association of Palestinian Writers, your contacts with Israeli writers and your joint publications. You have endeavoured to make mutual understanding and tolerance prevail among the cultures, religions and peoples of the entire region.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan and Mr Izzat Ghazzawi, by honouring you both together, the European Parliament hopes to make a contribution to the advance of the cause of peace over war, to the expression of tolerance and understanding and to the preservation of hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Archbishop Kamwenho, your country has been at war for 25 years. Two generations of Angolans have grown up without knowing the meaning of the word ‘peace’. The death toll of this interminable war makes frightening reading: one million dead, almost four million displaced individuals, hundreds of thousands of war orphans and war wounded, a starving population, meaning one child in five dies before the age of five, life expectancy is less than 45 years, millions of anti-personnel mines scattered throughout Angola, and extreme poverty despite the existence of natural resources which have, unfortunately, largely been used only for purposes of warfare.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has always been committed to the promotion of a political solution to the conflict in Angola, and we have repeatedly stressed the urgent need for all parties to embark on a global dialogue with a view to a lasting peace based on the promotion and protection of human rights. Our Parliament has repeatedly expressed its support for the efforts made in this direction by the churches and the organisations of civil society. As Archbishop of Lubango, as President of the Catholic Episcopal Conference of Angola and São Tomé and of the Ecumenical Committee for Peace in Angola, you have been an apostle in the service of fundamental rights and peace and a symbol of the hopes of the Angolan people, of its desire for peace, liberty and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We salute your life’s journey as an individual and pay tribute to your ecumenical spirit, your determination and your eloquence. We also salute you as a spokesman for the aspirations of all those in Angolan civil society who are working for dialogue and reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">Today and for all these reasons, Archbishop Kamwenho, we award you the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by expressing our wish to honour the memory of the victims of these conflicts, of all those, children, women and men, who have fallen in Israel, in Palestine and in Angola. We declare our support for the three winners of the Sakharov Prize for 2001, and we are profoundly moved by their tragic fate, and affirm a common stand against violence in whatever form.</p>

<p class="contents">I am, I feel, obliged, however, to dedicate this speech to the children who were killed yesterday by the Israeli army, simply because they were born Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a great honour to be here today with you, as winner of the Sakharov Prize. I am well aware that, on such occasions, one should speak of hope and of the human qualities that can lead us to the triumph of compassion and fraternity between people. Forgive me, therefore, for not speaking of this today.</p>
<p class="contents">In Jerusalem, where I am from, hope and humanity are fading away. Israel is becoming a graveyard for children, which is growing bigger day by day. It is like an underground kingdom, extending beneath our feet and destroying everything in its wake. It is the kingdom where my daughter lives, with her Palestinian murderer, whose blood, mixed with hers, flows through Jerusalem, which became hardened to the sight of blood a long time ago. They are there with many, many more children, and they have all been let down. The murderer of my daughter has been let down, because his act of murder and of suicide achieved nothing. It did not put an end to the cruel Israeli occupation, it did not lead him to paradise, and those who promised him that his action would have meaning and value go on as if he had never existed. My young daughter was let down because she believed, just as thousands of her new brothers and sisters believed, that she lived in safety, that her parents protected her from evil and that nothing could happen to sweet little girls who cross the road to go to their dancing lesson. And all the children who are there with them have been let down, because the world goes on, as if their blood had never been spilled.</p>
<p class="contents">In Jerusalem, where I am from, the men who call themselves our leaders have allowed death to hold sway. It appears, however, that these gentlemen know how to live in peace when they have to. On Friday 1 December, the editorial of a local newspaper in a Jerusalem in mourning told us that there had been peace in Jericho for two months. There are no Israeli soldiers there, no Palestinian policemen, no gun shots.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not believe that the Americans have succeeded in convincing Ariel Sharon to stop sending young eighteen-year-old Israelis to kill innocent Palestinians, nor that they have succeeded in convincing the Palestinians to stop blowing themselves up along with their innocent Israeli victims. Far from it. Jericho is at peace because the Israeli and Palestinian leaders have together decided to reopen the casino …</p>
<p class="contents">When I read this article, I could not stop myself from thinking that my daughter’s life is not even worth a single roulette chip. Almost 200 children have been killed since the beginning of the Intifada, of this incessant massacre, and they are worth nothing more than roulette chips. And yet, I was not very surprised, since I always knew that our war was not that of the Israeli people against the Palestinian people, but that of people who destroy lives who call themselves our Heads of State against the people from both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">These cunning politicians use God, the wealth of the nation, freedom and democracy, and even our periods of mourning as political tools, and they use our children as if they were figurines in their games of chance. For instance, you knock over ten of mine, and I shall knock over 300 of yours, and we will be quits until the next time.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this is new in the history of mankind. Leaders have always used God and other sacred values, such as honour and courage, to justify their self-indulgent ambition. And the only voice, throughout history, that spoke out to expose them and to oppose this was always the voice of mothers; the voice of those who produced the Jewish people, who disobeyed the Pharaoh’s orders to kill little boys at birth; the voice of Rachel, our biblical mother, weeping for her children and refusing to be consoled; the voice of the women of Troy; the mothers of Argentina, the mothers of Ireland, Israel and Palestine. It is the voice of those who give life and who are committed to preserving it. It is the only voice that remains after the violence has subsided, and which truly understands the meaning of the end of everything.</p>
<p class="contents">Mothers are the only ones who know that the death of a child, any child, whether from Serbia or Albania, Iraq or Afghanistan, whether Jewish or Palestinian, is the death of the whole world, of its past and its future. When Luisa told me that I had been awarded the Sakharov Prize, I told her that I did not deserve it, since I had never saved a child, not even my own. But then I thought that the prize had not been awarded to me as a person, but to this voice that I took on through death and which transcends nationalities, religions, and even time. This voice that politicians and generals have tried to silence since man first walked this earth and since men have been waging war.</p>
<p class="contents">I have often been asked whether or not I feel the need to exact revenge for the murder of my daughter, who was only killed because she was born an Israeli, by a young man, who had so little hope that he was willing to kill himself and who only killed himself because he was Palestinian. I always quote the verse of the great Hebrew poet Bialik. ‘Satan has not yet created those who would exact revenge for the death of a small child’. And this is not because Satan does not have the means, but because after a child has died, there is no longer vengeance, death, or life. The only feeling that remains, the only desire, the only need, that can never be satisfied, is that of protecting the child. The mothers who have lost their children will tell you that their arms hurt due to the constant need to hold the child and keep it from harm. No mother would ever think of seeking consolation by killing one child for another.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not wish our entire planet to become a kingdom of dead children, we must raise our voices as mothers in order to silence all the other voices. We must once again listen to the voice of God who said ‘Do not harm children’. Otherwise, there will soon be nothing left to say, nothing left to hear, other than this incessant cry of mourning. Ladies and gentlemen, I beg you to listen to the voices that are coming from the underground kingdom of children who have been killed. That is where justice resides today, that is where true multiculturalism holds sway, that is where we know that there is no difference between blood, between skin, between identity cards or flags. Listen to the cries of the dead children and help their mothers to save the children who are still alive.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ghazzawi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Sakharov Prize laureate</span>. – Madam President, distinguished Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends: It is with great emotion and excitement I receive this recognition today. This prize is an act of faith in the ability of the world to promote a sustained dialogue of tolerance and understanding. It only made my commitment towards a nobler future for the conflict in our region stronger and more persistent than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">There are so many events that I would like to tell you about here, but the time I am given is limited. From my prison, for almost three years I wrote a book called 'Letters Underway' where I asked myself during the bleakest moment the following question: could it be possible for me to address in my book an Israeli figure who is an artist, a father, a real human soul, a man or a woman who would abolish the image of a soldier guarding my solitary cell? When the answer was yes, I proceeded with my writing. As soon as I was out of prison, I took part in a writers' meeting in Oslo where a few intellectuals from both sides met to discuss how they could contribute to peace. During ten days of ebbs and flows, the Israelis talked much about the historic distress that befell the Jewish nation and people. The Palestinians talked about their daily suffering under occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">But finally, after ten days, we were able to understand each other's needs. I could not forget one comment by an Israeli writer. During this meeting, on the tenth day, he said, 'I always thought that man is evil... now I am not sure'. In that same year, 1993, my son fell dead to the bullets of the soldiers in his school. The event changed the taste of everything in my life, but I knew that a good human being is a living one.</p>
<p class="contents">Suffering, if we so decide, can be used as a power to heal rather than a blind struggle for revenge and hatred. The principle of an eye for an eye, makes the whole world blind. I knew how to use understatement as a means of compromise in my literature.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, however, that the conflict of man with his heart is the noblest sort of struggle. It is a pity that the conflict of today is between nations and cultures. Left to the generals of war and enmity, they will make it a bloody history of terror. Left to them, we will accept it for a fact that our world is either bad or mad. But those who have read history in a tolerant way, understand that what is needed is a mutual moral commitment towards the facts of existence and the human obligation towards life as the only valuable gift.</p>
<p class="contents">Abnormalities of all kinds do not have a race, or a religion, or a certain home. Only civilisation has its own religion and faith and home. That is because there has been no unique civilisation as a creation of its own: all through history civilisations borrowed from each other and excelled most when they were able to share their merits and values.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the recent fear of a clash between cultures is not groundless. There is an amazing imbalance between the rich and the poor, and there are a great deal of injustices that threaten the very principle of tolerance in our globe.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, our insistence on dialogue between cultures is at its highest now, because we have to search into the roots of terror. As a writer living in an exceptionally troubled area, I must look at this issue of intercultural discourse as a story of attraction and excitement. Whatever happens in our region is doomed to affect the whole world.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not because we are the centre of the world. It is only because the spiritual roots sprang from here to transmit their force among every and each one of us. Both attraction and excitement arise from this tremendous past.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time now to see that tremendous spiritual past as a part of a human culture. It is important to see it as a part of a human culture and not a divine call for a holy land that eats up its children. Man is holy. Nothing else is holy if man is humiliated and deprived of his rights to live in dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be no reason for a detailed map with the human heart being broken in our area at the edge of hope and despair. We are fed up with the illusion of victory. No nation can be defeated if it insists on the meaning of life as a value in itself. Our isolation and anxiety is beyond any proportion, but our faith in the future is also great. We will always need your support for a sustained peace process, and a support for the peace camps that lit the candles for all those who lost their lives in the ignorant battle.</p>
<p class="contents">Once more, with deep gratitude, I thank you for awarding me, together with my partners, this prestigious prize, but it is also with all the anxiety I have in my heart for the future of Palestine and Israel, and the admiration I express for all the men and women who are there now and who have the dream and the vision.</p>

I come from a country whose land is rich and whose people have little hope, where the forest is boundless but hope is not. From that land I bring greetings to you, Mrs Fontaine, President of the European Parliament. From that land I bring friendly greetings to you, honourable Members of this generous Parliament. I bring brotherly greetings to Mrs Nurit Peled-Elhanan and Mr Izzat Ghazzawi, the couple with whom I share this honour. From that country named Angola I bring greetings to the illustrious guests at this Plenary Assembly. Nor should we forget the social, written, spoken and televised communication that makes the five continents one huge human village. Finally, and this is where I probably should have begun, from Angola I bring greetings to this historic city of Strasbourg, home to the European Parliament, a city that I discovered when I was still young, attracted not only by its cultural climate but mainly by the memory of the many missionaries from Alsace who, together with Portuguese missionaries, brought the gospel to our land. So, to all of you, ladies and gentlemen, I bring a warm embrace from Angola.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Fontaine, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Mr José Ribeiro e Castro, the party that has accompanied me here, amongst whom I wish to mention the Deputy Minister for Culture and the Ambassador of Angola, the President of the European Parliament, in her kind letter officially announcing the distinction that befell my unworthy person and congratulating me, wrote that peace has always been one of her main objectives and that my commitment to the ecumenical cause had raised her awareness. In fact, the Episcopal Conference of Angola and São Tomé, which I have chaired for almost four years, wrote in its pastoral message of March 2000 “we cannot spread the gospel without promoting peace”. The Interdenominational Committee for Peace in Angola, also formed last year, seeks to be the voice of believers on the crucial matter of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">In a letter dated 11 January 2001, His Excellency the President of the Republic, José Eduardo dos Santos, in response to a Christmas message of mine, wished me every success in the pastoral action that I am undertaking in the quest for peace and for the happiness of the Angolan people. And on the day following the announcement of the Sakharov Prize winners, the chorus of congratulations from everywhere and from all layers of society, including the President of the Republic and from Mr Jonas Savimbi, highlighted the unifying dimension of the prize; Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and its quality of stimulating the pursuit of ideals of peace. Unfortunately, in the land of prizewinners, particularly in mine, we have witnessed actions and behaviour which, humanly speaking, could invalidate the precepts put forward by the parliamentarians of the European Union. But our sixth sense tells us that this will not happen. The message of the 2001 Sakharov Prize is safe, and so I can assure you that there are many things that will not be the same as they were before.</p>
<p class="contents">I believed and that was why I spoke out. It is impossible not to speak when faced with the tragedy of the Angolan situation. Living side by side with a simple and suffering people qualifies us to speak in their name both in recognising the efforts made by the government and in the quest for improvements that the people themselves are calling for. I said a few days ago that in the 14 years of anti-colonial war there was just one year, 1973, that recorded an unheard of rate of financial growth, whereas in the twenty-five years of the civil war, we have only seen a decrease, that has grown worse day by day, particularly since 1998. Hunger, nakedness and disease have created images which, if caught and projected onto the screens of the warlords would perhaps also give these people a sleepless night and make them begin to think about Angola. Malnutrition affects 47% of the population in some provinces, as attested by the appeal for humanitarian aid launched recently by the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The war in Angola has various causes. Thinking about the Lord who brought us here, to Strasbourg today, 12 December, half way between the 10th, the day of the Declaration of Human Rights, and the 14th, the day of His death, I see that I could focus on one of the causes: intolerance. It was not by chance that the UN declared 1995 as the United Nations Year of Tolerance. Still echoing in our ears and in our conscience are the words spoken by Pope John Paul II on World Peace day this year and those of Federico Mayor Zaragoza, the then director of UNESCO, when he said, and I quote, ‘Humanity must be able to dedicate itself to peace, safeguard it, re-establish it and rebuild it by creating a space for dialogue, consultation and reconciliation. No more violence!’</p>
<p class="contents">It has been very difficult to speak of tolerance in my country because the roots of intolerance run deep, being anchored in the political bipolarisation between the two most popular parties: the MPLA and UNITA. In this climate, a speech on the subject of tolerance is seen either as a betrayal of these parties, which have great popular support – and are, ironically, at war with one another – or as a reactionary attitude, if expressed by an independent person. Given this climate, to speak of change would mean sharing power with rivals; but, for us, the church and civil society, the first change would be to accept tolerance as an issue of survival which is, therefore, necessary, from the foundations to the roof, from the political parties to the government, from civil society and the churches themselves to the national project. Tolerance is the key word, as Locke teaches us, if we want to find a human basis for integrating conflict resolution, including our own, for a harmonious development. In the case of Angola, tolerance would be given form in the specific aspect of national reconciliation, whose foundations can only be reached through permanent and inclusive dialogue, able to break this never-ending cycle of war. Tolerance requires solidarity and fraternity and the lesson that we have learned from Europe is the lesson emerging from this great Assembly, which is meeting here today. Human fraternity, pervading all facets of our relationship, also draws our attention to the economic angle and its ambiguities. In this ‘South’ where we live, wealth generates both war and signs of solidarity. Speaking of mining in particular, I would say that it is already time to increase the transparency that would make it more difficult to finance conflicts but which would also encourage social investment …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... affecting the standard of living of Angolans, and this would be achieved by themselves, not by something that looks like charity.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I shall refer to the thought that inspired the campaign that brings me today to this podium to receive the Sakharov Prize: help Angola to live! This was the challenge that the Catholic Church set the Soviet Union and the United States in 1986 in its assessment of the first ten years of national independence. After spending another 16 years at war, we launched the same message. But to whom, this time? To the MPLA and to UNITA to whom we repeated with a breaking heart: twenty-six years of history have been stained with blood – the blood of brothers killed by brothers, and closing the doors to dialogue would open them to a war without a visible end. This can be read in the pastoral message issued by the bishops.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, with the confidence of the European Union, whose parliamentarians have placed the prestigious Sakharov Prize in our hands, I humbly call for a bilateral and simultaneous cease-fire that will open the way to a cessation of hostilities, as we have called for so many times. Because we can still make up for lost time. Agostinho Neto, Angola’s first President, left us these mysterious verses which I have written down:</p>
<p class="contents">‘I no longer wait</p>
<p class="contents">I am the man for whom others wait’</p>
<p class="contents">Every Angolan is the man or woman for whom others wait. Help them to live! This is why the financial component of this Prize will be going to the Ecumenical Fund for Peace, in other words, to promote education for peace and for national reconciliation amongst the population. So, my friends, help Angola to live! Thank you very much!</p>
