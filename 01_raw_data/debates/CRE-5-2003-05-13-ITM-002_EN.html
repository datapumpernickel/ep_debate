It is a real pleasure to see them in the European Parliament and I welcome them to the EU family.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, let me thank the rapporteur, Mr Manders, for his report concerning the Commission's proposal on environmental liability. Environmental liability is an important subject that has received well-deserved attention and caused intensive discussion for many years. The Commission has been working on this issue for a long time, in close contact with the parties concerned and civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">This process has re-emphasised the strategic importance of the underlying principles, whilst also pointing to a great diversity of opinions on the details of implementation. One is tempted to say that there are almost as many different views on the main issues as there are parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thus well aware that this proposal is a complex and sensitive one. Difficult choices had to be made on many of its aspects and the appropriate balance had to be found among competing interests. We believe that the Commission succeeded in reaching this balance when it adopted the proposal in January 2002. It is with the aim of maintaining, if not further improving, this balance that it will consider the amendments adopted by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly present to you the main features of the Commission's proposal. The proposal aims to establish a Community framework whereby environmental damage – which is defined in the proposal as biodiversity damage, water damage and land damage – would be prevented or remedied through a system of environmental liability. Whenever possible the operator who has caused the environmental damage – or provoked an imminent threat of such damage occurring – must, in accordance with the polluter pays principle, bear the costs associated with the implementation of the necessary preventive or restorative measures. In certain cases, in which no operator can be held liable or a liable operator is unable to pay, Member States must assume the responsibility for finding an alternative source of financing the measures in question.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several key issues that deserve special attention. These issues certainly invite more detailed comments, but today I will be as concise as possible. Firstly, the scope of the proposal in terms of the activities and biodiversity to be covered: in the Commission's view, strict liability should apply to the activities listed in Annex I to the proposal, and also to occupational activities other than those listed in Annex I, it being understood that this second tier of liability is fault-based. The Commission considers that suppressing this part of the liability regime is unacceptable since this would weaken the proposal. Conversely, the Commission does not believe it either justifiable or workable to expand strict liability to all occupational activities in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Having commented on the scope, let me just finish by saying that the debate on the amendments will be an extremely important one, during which I am sure we will hear some new arguments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Manders (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, I would also like to welcome all our new colleagues, and I hope that they will also become involved in this complex report. I would like to thank all my colleagues who have been involved in this subject and who will be involved in it in the future. Particularly everyone who took part in the working party in order to find a compromise. I would in particular like to thank Mr Papayannakis for his excellent co-operation, and I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for the abundant information they have provided and the considerable co-operation they have offered.</p>
<p class="contents">This is perhaps the most complex subject, both from a legal and a political point of view, with a total of almost 900 amendments – if I include all the committees' amendments – which were then reduced to about 75 in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. We have voted on these. There are once again 108 amendments before us in the plenary session now, with the necessary split votes. This will mean that we will have a long hard session in front of us this afternoon, but I think that it will be worthwhile.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to briefly outline the background. I think that this report has prestige written all over it. First we had the <span class="italic">Exxon Valdez</span> and the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and then the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, but the report also has political prestige written all over it, and has had since 1976. If you go faster than you are actually able to, you will not achieve anything. That is my position. So you have to try and make rules that are workable and realistic. The conflict in competence between the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was the starting point of political sentiment in particular. I believe that if liability regimes were not even to be dealt with in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market any longer, we might as well abolish it and set up one committee, the Committee for ‘All Affairs’. It could have 626 members, and possibly even 735 after next year, and then I know for sure that we would never get out of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the conflict in competences, the subject has become controversial and heavily charged, one in which everyone wanted to stake their own political claim with a view to political profiling. That was a pity, because it has meant that up to now it has been virtually impossible to arrive at compromises and to create broader support. I ultimately decided on an approach that was considered on the basis of all the amendments submitted and that does not specifically favour industry and does not specifically favour the environment. I have tried to find a balance that will make a new piece of legislation – because that is after all what we are talking about – workable and implementable, one that will ultimately be able to develop into a piece of workable legislation that will result in a preventative approach to the environment and will ultimately protect the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that it is important to create a level playing field, because I believe that environmental legislation is part of our economy. The first compromises I suggested were based on this. For example, I said that the legal basis should be Article 175. Every Member State is developing its own system, and based on the best examples in the market, the Commission will be issuing harmonised draft legislation on environmental protection throughout Europe in five years’ time. In this way we will get a level playing field, we will avoid environmental dumping and we will avoid a situation in which there will ultimately be 25 different legal systems which will definitely do nothing to promote the internal market nor protect the environment. I understand that there are a number of countries, including my own country, the Netherlands, that will always want to go a little bit further. That is fine, and I think that that should be allowed. On the other hand, I think that it is better that those countries that do not go as far should be brought up to a higher level, which will be ultimately better for the environment in absolute terms. If we apply Article 95, therefore, it will be easier for the European Commission, as the watchdog of the Treaty, to bring those parties who do not comply with the rules before the European Court of Justice, thus ensuring that the environment actually benefits from this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In my initial proposals I opted for mitigating factors instead of exemptions, and I think that that was a good thing. I linked liability for risk with state-of-the-art defence as a mitigating factor; 100 % mitigation would mean that the judge could decide not to hold somebody liable. Unfortunately we were not able to achieve that.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope: I mentioned sites, habitat and species protected under Community legislation, and sites protected under national legislation. I said that this should be complementary to all international conventions so as to ensure that there would be a level playing field and a comparable liability regime in that area too. Unfortunately we were not able to achieve this. I was isolated in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Nobody, neither on the left nor on the right, would support me.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure that we could deal with this here today, I looked for and found support in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. That means that I had to tone down my original suggestions somewhat, but ultimately I am particularly happy with what the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has adopted, and I will support that. I therefore also support the amendments that were submitted and that were based on my initial compromise amendments. I hope that we will have a favourable vote, and I welcome the challenge of being able to continue to play a prominent role in this difficult matter at second reading.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Papayannakis (GUE/NGL),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a draft directive which we have been waiting 20 years for. The practical application of the polluter pays principle appears to be more complicated than we imagined, which is only reasonable because, of course, we need both to establish liability for restoring environmental damage and to find a way so that the taxpayer does not bear the liability and the cost and pollution is prevented, not just suppressed. Consequently, we are talking about the objective liability of polluters and about a set of arrangements to influence the behaviour of operators.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft directive gives rise to conflicting emotions in me: both satisfaction, because it may pave the way for reform, but merely pave the way, and reservations, because the steps proposed are timid, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, biodiversity, as defined in the draft, is restricted to habitats and species covered by the Habitats and Birds Directives, in other words only 13% of the EU's territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the definition of environmental damage needs to be broader and should also include radiation, damage to air quality and damage to biodiversity caused by genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, oil pollution and nuclear damage are not covered with the argument that they are covered by international conventions. However, these generally cover traditional damage and not environmental damage. In addition, several Member States of the European Union have not signed them. Furthermore, they contain clauses expressly prohibiting the introduction of provisions governing wider environmental liability. The directive must therefore be clear and must expressly state what the current liability regime is. There must also be a provision allowing these international conventions to be amended and we must wait for the relevant proposals from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, provision is made for exceptions from environmental liability for emissions or activities for which a permit has been issued or which were not considered harmful when the permit was issued. These are the so-called ‘permit and state of the art defences’. I think that these exceptions undermine the reliability of the objectives of the directive, limit the scope of the liability regime and undermine the polluter pays principle. There is a study which was carried out by the Commission itself, Commissioner, and which shows that 10 of the 15 Member States of the Union do not make provision for this sort of exception. Why, therefore, should the new directive encourage numerous Member States to back off when it comes to the severity of their environmental legislation?</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the proposal for a directive establishes a public law regime, with the competent authority responsible for determining and securing the appropriate prevention or remediation measures. However, this may risk putting the burden on the taxpayer. Thus, initial liability for taking preventive and remediation measures should lie with the operator. The competent public authority must comply with the procedure for ascertaining and restoring the damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of citizens' only having indirect access to justice. The proposal does not foresee the possibility of citizens' taking direct recourse to justice. I think that this violates the Aarhus Convention. I also believe there must be a mandatory operator insurance system with common rules for financial guarantees. If there is, there will be no distortion of competition. However, if there is not, it may be distorted and, moreover, the prevention system will be weak and I think we shall not see the beneficial impact on the economy that we hope for.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for which I have the honour of acting as draftsman, approved an opinion in the spirit of these comments. We are now submitting to the House, together with numerous other honourable Members from numerous political groups, a series of proposals which are less ambitious but which represent a compromise of several views. We are trying to achieve a rapprochement with the Council's positions so that we can see the Greek Presidency achieve political agreement in the Environment Council on 13 June.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ecosystem and the flow of matter and energy follow a predictable, quantifiable course to which human activity must be adapted. We do not protect nature just by putting a fence round it. In order for us to protect the viability of Europe, we need industry and the economy as a whole to turn green. We cannot say that we are neither with one nor the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that the outcome of our vote will send a clear political message to the whole of Europe: that we are determined to lay down a substantial policy which will guarantee better environmental protection, in keeping with the economic and social objectives of the Union.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Niebler (PPE-DE).</span></span>   –<span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will be voting here in Parliament on the environmental liability directive, thus bringing to an end what has been a long and, as you know, very controversial debate. Allow me first to express very special thanks to our rapporteur, Toine Manders, who has worked tirelessly for many months to produce his report. He really has endeavoured to take account of the views of all of those concerned and has constantly sought to compromise. Once again I would express my sincere thanks for the constructive dialogue that we have enjoyed.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I go any further, allow me also to say very clearly, ladies and gentlemen, that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports both this directive and the Commission proposal. We want stricter rules on environmental liability. Those who cause environmental damage in the course of their occupational activities must also be answerable for that. Compensation should also be paid for damage caused to biological diversity, that is, for what is termed ecological damage. As such provisions do not yet exist in the Member States, we are entering new territory here. But I think that it is good that we are entering new territory and my group supports liability for ecological damage, even though we are all aware that it will be difficult to put actual figures on this in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I do understand that it is not always possible to reach a broad consensus where environmental liability is concerned. However, that is precisely why I am particularly advocating the adoption of the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market today, because the Legal Affairs Committee has issued a clear, moderate and practicable opinion. The report represents a major step forward towards improved environmental protection and therefore also deserves to receive strong support in tomorrow's vote in the plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">It begins, ladies and gentlemen, even with the numerous definitions that are placed at the start of the directive and delineate its scope, for example the definition of biological diversity. Here, as I have already said, we are entering new territory. It makes sense, in my opinion, to base the rules on habitats and species that are already protected by European law. Furthermore, the Member States should be free to designate additional national protection areas, but it would breach the boundaries of the directive in every respect if we went any further than this.</p>
<p class="contents">A further example is the directive's scope. I think that here too we found a compromise in the Legal Affairs Committee that refers to the system of international conventions and makes the relationship with them clear. The idea is that for those areas in which international systems of establishing liability are effectively in force the environmental liability directive should not apply in the first instance. I believe that the compromise that has been found here is a sensible one.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my group also firmly supports the exemptions from liability that are named in the Commission draft. There are two points at issue here: firstly, permit defence and secondly ‘state of the art’ defence. We think it is right for these liability privileges to be listed in the directive. We also think it is right that those who work their land in accordance with good farming practice should receive a liability privilege.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, that we reached a good compromise in the Legal Affairs Committee and I would ask that this compromise also be supported here tomorrow by a majority of this House.</p>

That is why it is high time for us in the European Union to create strict rules on protecting the environment, such as the uniform provisions on environmental liability that we are finally able to deal with today in plenary after lengthy preliminary wrangling in the committees responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental liability is not about punishing old ladies who when out walking their dogs are not conscientious about clearing up after their little darlings. We need liability provisions that place obligations on all those who cause environmental damage, without exception. If the money is coming out of their own pocket, those who end up paying for rectifying the damage will soon think twice about how they treat our environment and be more careful. That is why the Group of the Party of European Socialists is in favour of a series of amendments to the Commission text. There is absolutely no reason why the polluter pays principle should not also apply to pollution caused by the oil industry or the nuclear industry or why it should not apply to the release of genetically modified organisms. Are not the names <span class="italic">Erika </span>and <span class="italic">Prestige </span>synonymous with absolutely enormous environmental problems, which still have not been overcome? Can we see why the State and therefore the community of taxpayers should have to pay for the mistakes of others, simply because the risks appear to be hard to assess or difficult to insure against? Must we virtually invite people to be careless with the environment because certain polluters are beyond the reach of the law on damages? No, most certainly not! It is therefore only logical that our Parliament should ensure that managers of companies that put the environment at risk have insurance or other precautionary financial measures in place so that they can pay for repair and restoration of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to address one further point that is of particular importance to us Social Democrats. The State and therefore the people should not be landed with the responsibility or the bill for rectifying the damage and restoring the environment by the back door either. Under no circumstances! The polluter pays principle should apply always and to everyone. That is why we have tabled an amendment to Articles 4 and 5 in the form of an additional clarificatory paragraph. The purpose of this amendment is to enable the authorities responsible to set out the steps that need to be taken without having to take action themselves or incur costs in advance, which may be considerable and difficult to recover afterwards. If the plenary goes along with the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and others in preference to those of the Legal Affairs Committee, we will have environmental liability legislation that assigns the costs fairly and at the same time acts preventively. In these amendments we demand a minimum of what the people of Europe rightly expect from environmental liability legislation at European level. This minimum must be reached. If the results of the individual votes mean that it is not, then to my great regret we will have to reject this important directive as a whole.</p>

I am sure everyone agrees that we are in urgent need of such a scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">However much we agree on the principle, however, the more divided Parliament seems to be on its scope. How far should we go in protecting the environment and the obligation to repair the damage? There are numerous specific points of conflict: the precise description of environmental damage, the exclusion of certain industrial sectors, the extent of the polluter pays principle, the fixing of financial guarantees, the insurability of risks and the fixing of maximum amounts for repairing damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur, Mr Manders, whom I heartily congratulate, has attempted to reconcile what are often highly diverse standpoints, and I believe the result is a well-balanced report and a well-balanced result which takes account of the many interests and economic sectors involved in this subject. That is ultimately what we all want: a good, well-defined, uniform European framework which provides a comprehensive approach to environmental damage with specific European standards and the same rules for the whole of the European Union; one in which everybody knows exactly what they must comply with.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no doubt that many people, including our green fundamentalists, would like to go much further. The question is, however, not whether this is necessary or useful, but whether this is achievable at the moment. After all, the question then arises as to whether this is affordable or insurable for the economic sectors or whether it will remain incalculable for them. Those parties who would like to go much further must realise that they may be striving for the unachievable and that we may end up empty-handed at the final vote. We must not allow this to happen. The most important thing at the moment is to achieve a good general scheme for the immediate future in which we tackle the real responsibilities. We cannot afford to waste any more time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1993, in fact, there was already a Green Paper on environmental liability. The European Parliament, via the ENVI, subsequently urged the Commission, on several occasions, to take rapid action on this subject. We have waited, therefore, a very long time for the day when there would be a sound proposal on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, does this Commission proposal achieve? Obviously it does not live up to its stated ambitions. I believe that the Commission’s original ambitions were on a grand scale, but that the final product is disappointing. I also believe that we should draw attention to the factors which are the cause of this disappointment.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these factors is that the definition of the environment is too restricted. In the case of biodiversity, for example, a proportion estimated to be equivalent to only 20% of biodiversity would be protected, and only 13% of European territory would be covered.</p>
<p class="contents">The second factor is the scope of the proposals. Annex I lists the various economic activities which are covered by the principle of liability without fault. This list of activities is very restrictive. In particular, it excludes anything concerning nuclear activities or the transporting of hydrocarbons, without any real justification. Reference is made to international conventions, which certainly exist but which do not cover the remedying of environmental damage. I would remind the House of what was said here yesterday by one of our PPE members, Mr Bébéar, when he complained – quite rightly – about the low level of compensation envisaged by the IOPCF for the victims of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident. We must, therefore, be consistent, and adopt a very firm amendment requiring that, in the case of accidents of this type, what is not covered by the international convention should be covered by our directive. However, the Commission’s proposal does not do this.</p>
<p class="contents">The third factor which has to be taken into consideration is the exemptions laid down on the basis of the existence of an operating permit or the existence of scientific knowledge which, at the time of the accident, would not have been sufficiently relevant to justify the liability of the economic activity in question. For example, in the case of GMOs or of pesticides which are, amongst other things, endocrine disrupters, if one follows this principle then practically all related activities would escape the application of the directive. This is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that our group supports a series of amendments which are in line with the proposals of Mr Papayannakis to the ENVI, and which have been taken up by Mrs Gebhardt. I believe that these important changes are essential in order to give this directive real substance.</p>

It seems to be difficult to arouse any sympathy for environmental standpoints. This proposal is also suffering from this. We have been dealing with it for many years, and we always seem to lack the conviction to actually do something about it. Now there is once again great disagreement about the way in which we should tackle liability. Industry has been lobbying hard, with arguments which are understandable but which I believe cannot be honoured. Insurance aspects are in particular being raised. Yet this has not convinced me to vote in favour of toning down the present proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary. I believe that strong environmental liability legislation will have a preventative effect with regard to environmental damage and will encourage the repair of the damage. ‘The polluter pays’ should be the logical adage. There has been a limited form of environmental liability based on that principle in the Netherlands for some time now. It works well, and it saves money.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission’s proposal has already bowed to pressure from industry to too great an extent. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has made this even worse. I hope that by adopting the amendments submitted by myself and others, we can change the effect of the directive in a positive way. Over the next few years we will see in practice whether this directive is workable in the European Union. We do not have to bring things down to the lowest common denominator right from the start. If it does not work, we can always amend the directive. It would show real guts if we, as the legislative organ, were to take this risk now in order to avoid the risk of environmental damage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the proposal for a directive on environmental liability which has been presented to us today is a big disappointment to us. Certainly we want to see European harmonisation in the area of damage caused to the environment, which is often cross-border in nature, but it is also necessary that the directive should represent serious progress.</p>
<p class="contents">It features an impressive number of omissions, exemptions, exclusions and limitations of liability, however, which would turn the new rules into an illusion, and often even an opportunity for confusion and for backing away from the objective of protecting the public, unless the taxpayer is called on to make good the deficits. I can give you two examples to illustrate this point. The first example is that, in Article 3, we discover that the directive would not apply to the carriage by sea of hazardous substances, to the damage caused by oil pollution and to the damage caused by nuclear activities. The grounds for this omission are that there already exist international conventions which deal with civil liability in all these areas. However, these conventions are limited in scope, give insufficient protection or are totally inadequate, as we have seen recently in the case of the derisory compensation awarded by the IOPCF following the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster. Consequently we are demanding that this directive should not shy away from the problem, but that it should deal with it, and provide real protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The second example is that of GMOs. When the directive on the deliberate release of GMOs was being discussed, the Commission promised us that the issues of liability and insurance would be dealt with in the general directive on environmental liability, in other words the directive that we are discussing here today. However, we have been deceived. GMOs are certainly covered by this proposal in theory, but under Article 9, which exempts those activities which have been given official authorisation, a category which includes GMOs, they fall within the scope of the directive on deliberate release.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is quite intolerable, particularly at a time when the Commission is seeking to unload onto Member States the problem of the co-existence of GMO and non-GMO crops, which is something that it wants to authorise. In these conditions, we are asking the Council not to remove the moratorium until the issues of liability and insurance in the case of GMOs are clearly resolved in a way that gives optimum protection to the public and to the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would then like to make two points: one specific and the other general. The specific point is also a response to some of the previous speeches. If I am not mistaken, the farming world welcomed the proposal for a directive on environmental liability, particularly because the Commission had opted for a horizontal approach. During the work in Parliament other viewpoints emerged in committee and, as a result, it is now very difficult to accept the idea of farmers being liable for environmental damage the causes of which are beyond their control. In this regard, any extension of the directive’s scope – a compulsory financial guarantee, reversing the burden of proof and, most importantly,<span class="bold"> </span>excluding some means of exemption – would make it extremely difficult for farmers to manage their activities. In practical terms, a farmer might be forced to pay compensation for environmental damage caused by an activity, even though he has been issued with a permit to perform that activity and has observed all the relevant legal provisions. I am sure that farmers are willing to shoulder their responsibilities, but not when they have no control over the cause of the damage. This is the reasoning underlying our work in the Committee on Legal Affairs, and we have adopted this approach, developing a line which will not have serious consequences for the farming world or for the rural environment in general. I hope that the rapporteur will agree with this position and that the European Parliament will endorse it.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the general point, it too reflects a fear. Extending the directive’s scope beyond that of the Commission’s original proposal would, as I see it, be likely to jeopardise the certainty of the legal framework proposed and the resulting insurance guarantees, thus making it difficult to enforce a principle useful to European society in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is timid at a time when there is continuous environmental damage – the most recent example being the ‘Prestige’ – which is causing indignation amongst all our peoples, with mass demonstrations – in my country, for example, where the people are calling for this type of damage never to happen again. And faced with this timid directive, the Group of the European Peoples’ Party, taking advantage of their current majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has established even more restrictions, making it practically impossible to demand that the people causing the damage should meet their environmental responsibilities. The polluter pays principle would be entirely jeopardised if the amendments approved on the proposal of the European Peoples’ Party within the Committee on Legal Affairs were adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists presented a series of amendments intended to reinforce the content of this directive. As I said previously, those amendments were rejected in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market by that mechanical majority of the right, but, taking advantage of the fact that such a majority does not exist in the plenary, the Parliamentary Group of the European Socialist Party has reintroduced that group of amendments – from No 98 to the end – which are aimed at re-establishing the polluter pays principle, at establishing the general principle of responsibility and establishing the possibility of any person affected being able to demand the relevant compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that, in plenary, these amendments presented by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which are aimed, as I said earlier, at re-establishing, on the one hand, the whole of the directive and, on the other, at reinforcing the directive as a whole so that the damage caused, for example, by maritime goods transport, by nuclear accidents, by the damage caused by the spread of genetically modified organisms or even by biotechnology, can be effectively repaired.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the plenary of the European Parliament will approve this group of amendments and thereby rectify the text adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market as a result of this unilateral approach favouring the people causing the damage. I believe this is a justified aspiration, which the citizens of the European Union expect from us, and I therefore hope that the modified text will be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">And specifically, I imagine that the Commission will have to provide a little more detail in relation to the statements by Commissioner Wallström, since we would like to know a little more precisely what the Commission’s attitude is to both the amendments which have been approved within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the amendments which we hope will be approved once the plenary gives its opinion on the group of amendments we have now presented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Environmentalists regard it as a holy grail, the means by which the polluter pays principle can be put into concrete form. Industry representatives have told me that they too agree with the principle and the insurance industry has said that it can make it work, so long as it is introduced gradually and they have time to cost it properly.</p>
<p class="contents">So why does this House, and my group too, find itself so very divided over an issue about which everyone seems to agree? It seems that the principle is fine so long as it is never turned into practice. In this instance I regard myself as a pragmatist, I want to ensure that the legislation is workable and does not impose crippling burdens on industry or on agricultural producers. That is one reason why I oppose the introduction of joint and several liability. If there is a danger to the environment, then someone has to pay and when the polluters can be clearly identified, then they should be first in line.</p>
<p class="contents">All organisations should, above all, be very conscious of the need to take measures to prevent damage in the first place. I believe the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not done this House justice. It has taken positions which are not only minimalist but actually retrograde, and which weaken the Commission's proposals. This House must make changes. I do not agree with altering the legal base. We should extend the definition of environmental damage to safeguard special habitats and species. We should take the chance to put pressure on Member States that have failed to ratify the international marine conventions. We should give citizens the right to go to court directly to prevent environmental damage or to seek redress.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this is very radical. We have all expressed concern about the damage done to our environment by human activity. This measure is one way in which we can start to do something practical to protect it and to put all our fine words into real effect.</p>

As my friend Mr Lannoye said, it is, if not 'too little, too late', at any rate 'not very much and rather late'. But it is a step in the right direction and it is very important to establish the polluter pays principle. After all, most human activities have some impact on the environment. The issue is who tidies up afterwards – the person who causes it or somebody else? Like many members of this House I have received powerful representations from local authorities in my own constituency in Scotland, saying that if this directive is not carried local authorities and other public bodies will continue to have to deal, out of general tax revenues, with the problems which other people ought either to have prevented in the first place or be dealing with at present.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth reminding ourselves that the polluter pays principle is only half the story. The fact of the matter is that those who pollute are engaged in economic activities producing goods or services which other people want to buy, presumably at the price at which they are offered. If the polluter does not pay, the problem is that the price is too low and consumers get a kind of a free lunch for which they then have to pay afterwards in their capacity as taxpayers. We must try to ensure, therefore, that we have a regime which is genuinely directed at those producers and activities which can take better precautions and adequately insure against liability so that the pressure of insurance premium liabilities and the cost of insurance premiums reward those who are most careful and push up prices for those who are least careful, thereby creating a virtuous circle.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to that issue, I have had much doubt throughout the debates about the so-called state-of-the-art and permit defences, as there is a rationale which says that people should be able to work closely to the terms of, for example, a carefully designed permit and thereby guarantee themselves against liability.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole though, I have come to the view expressed in Amendment No 104 that these matters should be treated as matters of litigation rather than matters of exemption, which is a reasonable compromise to reach, so we very strongly support the directive on condition that the relevant amendments are carried. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The ‘remedying’ aspect would be limited to Natura 2000 areas and would exclude non-profit-making activities such as leisure activities, which the directive treats as equivalent to occupational activities. Nor does the directive cover either the transporting of hydrocarbons or GMOs. Remedying should be based on objective and quantifiable criteria, on the nature of the damage and its impact, on the state of the environment where the damage occurs, and on local circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The state-of-the-art and permit concepts should be retained so that the polluter pays principle can be effectively applied, and so as not to allow that principle to be replaced by the ‘taxpayer pays’ principle. Liability must include GMOs, particularly at a time when the United States is putting pressure on to try to get the moratorium on imports lifted in the context of the WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, what is the point of transferring the liability arrangements to Community level, when the Danish initiative for a Council framework decision on the combating of serious environmental crime falls within the scope of legal cooperation, particularly when there are other legal instruments that could be used, such as the Lugano Convention? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, it is essential that the application of such liability should not cause any distortion in competition. However, I have to say that this proposal seems to me to be disappointing and rather ineffectual, and it does not completely satisfy our expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">The polluter pays principle is a fundamental principle, but it must be accompanied by financial guarantees. This proposal does not talk about the marine transport of hydrocarbons, and this is something that I deplore. For example, when we see the example set by the IOPCF in the sad affair of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, when we observe the constant stream of incidents of fuel dumping at sea, we might think that there was still a lot to be done in order to make certain occupations aware of their liability. On this point, our anger is in direct proportion to the extent of the damage done to biodiversity. The proposals on this subject are inadequate, and I should also be interested to hear what the Commissioner thinks about the decision by the IOPCF.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this liability must be in proportion to the acknowledged fault. We must avoid any question of joint and several liability, which would shift part of the liability onto other people. The taxpayer should not have to support financially the damage caused by others.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to say that remedying does not appear to me to be the only solution. There should be more prevention. Moreover, I welcome any efforts that businesses can make in this direction by means of voluntary agreements – something that we shall be talking about shortly – but at the same time I am most anxious to ensure that an effective system of financial guarantees should be put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all I wanted to say to you. I am convinced that it will certainly be necessary to talk about this system of environmental liability again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Seveso, the disasters, with which we are sadly, all familiar, in the Natural Park of Doñana and the sinking of the oil tanker, the <span class="italic">Prestige,</span> and, last but not least, the confirmation of the devastating future health implications of the environmental degradation caused by the Priolo chemical plant, are all incidents which call for the establishment of a European system of civil liability for environmental damage.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to send out a strong political signal, which will help, not least, to stop some regressive tendencies which are emerging here and there. As Mrs Wallström, for example, is quite aware, the Italian Government is about to undertake a revision of the penal code, planning, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, to remove the penalties for crimes against the environment. Therefore, there is all the more need for a system rigorously applying the polluter pays principle and thus creating powerful incentives for preventing and avoiding the repetition of such situations in the future. Indeed, the ultimate goal is prevention, not the provision of compensation for damage.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have endeavoured to achieve the removal of some of the dangerous exemptions which allow wide-ranging, general means of protection and which, in actual fact, turn the environmental authorisations into a sort of licence to pollute, with the serious danger that the effectiveness of the proposed legislative system will be nullified. We have tried to ensure that it is the operator responsible, not the taxpayer, who bears the costs of remedying the environmental damage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, moreover, necessary for all the economic activities which could result in environmental damage to be taken into consideration and provided for in the liability system. This system should lay down, as a general rule, specific liability for environmental damage, irrespective of whether the activity causing the damage is deemed to be dangerous or not.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is vitally important. Now long-awaited, it will be a fundamental element of European environmental legislation, provided, however, that the changes which we have worked on with the 16 compromise amendments to reinforce the text are adopted. I strongly urge you to adopt the compromise amendments, which repropose the substance of the text that was adopted in the Committee on the Environment and then nullified by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market; if the amendments are not adopted, as Mrs Gebhardt has already said, particularly if Amendments Nos 99, 103 and 107 are not adopted, our group will not be able to vote for the Manders report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say that I am also pleased that a level playing field is being created for all parties involved in creating environmental damage. This means that it will be easier for the business community to comply with this directive. There are, however, two things that I would like to point out. The first is the question of nuclear energy and non-regulated businesses. The second question is that of maritime transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I live near two nuclear power stations, namely the only commercial nuclear power station in my country and also the Doel in Belgium. How is this regulated at the moment? The owners of the nuclear power stations only have limited liability, and the State absorbs that. In Belgium, for example, that amounts to EUR 300 million per power station, and in my country the figure is EUR 2.26 billion. This seems a lot of money, but it is in fact very little if you consider that these power stations are located in an industrial area. I find it inexplicable that the public and businesses will be held liable and that businesses allied to the state will be exempted from this kind of liability. I find the amendment that asks for this to be reviewed in 5 years’ time very flexible, and I think that the Commission must adopt it and that we must also vote on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to liability for maritime transport. I asked about liability relating to the <span class="italic">Tricolor</span> disaster two months ago, and I have not yet had any replies to my questions. We are asking for this to also be included in the directive and the international conventions reviewed and for the loopholes to be closed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to come back to nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is always regarded as a cheap kind of energy, but if all the costs were to be charged on, including the costs relating to environmental damage, the question is whether wind energy and other environmentally-friendly forms of energy would not be equally competitive. I would therefore ask the Commissioner to create a level playing field for this issue as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We actually ought to have been ambitious enough to make it the centrepiece of our environmental legislation. It is all the more regrettable that industry has managed to insert a series of exemptions in these provisions. Polluters actually ought to be answerable for the damage that they have caused and ought also to be obliged to take preventive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that there are so many exemptions and that only a very small number of accidents are covered by this directive, I fear that we will not achieve what we originally set out to do. As you know, accidents only qualify as such if those causing them are negligent or otherwise at fault, which means that damage to biodiversity caused by the use of licensed genetically modified seed is not covered at all. This is very regrettable. Furthermore, the fact that the notion of strict liability is linked to the list of dangerous activities in this way means that entire areas that pose a potential risk, such as mining and drilling for oil and gas, are also excluded, as is a large proportion of the consumer goods industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that there is no obligation to introduce general insurance for environmental damage is also a mistake in my view, because we have to ensure that when damage is caused to property and health, liability is not only restricted to Natura 2000 areas, but also applies further afield. Nevertheless, provided that the Commission sees reason, I hope that we will succeed in making this environmental liability directive the centrepiece of our legislation. I also hope that it will not remain full of holes like a Swiss cheese which would mean that it only applied in a very few cases, because if so we would not achieve our aims, which are to give industry incentives to take preventive measures and really to make the polluter pays principle the focus of our action.</p>

That is very significant in a country like Denmark where we drink water directly from the tap. The crop spray is called Roundup and is manufactured by Monsanto. Roundup is approved and used extensively in the rest of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, it is no surprise that poison, when systematically dispersed, ends up in our precious groundwater. It has to be possible, in a case like this, to hold Monsanto clearly liable for what has happened to Danish groundwater. Monsanto is also behind the large-scale genetic modification of plants. Plants are genetically modified so that they become resistant to, for example, Roundup, with the result that weeds can be sprayed more vigorously without the crop being damaged. It should therefore also be possible to hold Monsanto liable for the disease and permanent damage that will be caused by the use of genetically modified crops.</p>
<p class="contents">In Denmark, we have banned a large proportion of the pesticides on the market in the rest of the EU. The EU is now in the process of forcing Denmark to lift the ban on a number of these pesticides. It has compelled Denmark to use the genetically modified plants without making anyone liable for the pollution of the countryside that this involves.

The more people there are, the more sophisticated they become, the worse that pollution potentially gets.</p>
<p class="contents">Some damage, given human nature and the fallen world we live in, is inevitable. Self-evidently, prevention is the first priority and in any event, pollution should be kept to a minimum. But where it does occur, those responsible should make amends. What we must recognise, however, is that much of what creates a threat to our environment may not only be helping mankind in other ways but may actually be helping the environment itself.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation is a piece of civil, not criminal, law. It is not about punishing wrongdoers but apportioning and allocating responsibility for environmental damage. Punishment should be meted out by criminal sanctions not civil liability. There are others who see this as a skirmish in some kind of Manichean struggle between the public sector, which is good, and the private sector, which is bad. Such 20th-century class warfare has no place today. The two are complementary. They are interdependent and responsibility for the consequences of pollution should be shared and allocated between them. The private sector cannot and should not walk away from the consequences of its actions, and the public sector, and indeed society and the public at large cannot wash their hands and privatise the responsibilities incurred in regulating the private sector while enjoying the benefits which accrue from their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, since pollution is a practical problem, remedial actions must be practical too. Fantasy solutions are as detrimental as pollution itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for these reasons that the British Conservatives support the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's amendments to the draft directive. They are not perfect and we expect to see improvements in second reading as the Council further refines European thinking on this important topic. But they represent a further responsible step on the journey of dealing with the consequences of pollution across Europe and the wider world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The amendments we support represent a necessary compromise, not just to prevent the adoption of the directive from being put off, but also to ensure the entire protection system is viable and to prevent distortions of the market. My congratulations to my honourable friends Mr Manders and Mr Papayannakis on achieving the necessary compromises. The implementation of the polluter pays principle is of fundamental importance. However, it calls for the introduction of new concepts and innovative institutions which, however much we want them, are difficult to introduce at once. The compulsory financial guarantees for restoring environmental damage are a <span class="italic">conditio sine qua non</span> for efficient environmental protection. Without doubt, our long-term objective must be to introduce a system of compulsory insurance which will function as a disincentive. However, compulsory insurance must be introduced gradually in cooperation with the operators involved. Account must be taken of the fact that insurance companies need a certain amount of time to prepare. In all events, however, the phases for imposing a compulsory insurance system need to be defined as of now in the text of the directive, together with the type of damage it will cover and the activities to which it will refer.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as restoring environmental damage is concerned, we cannot accept broad derogations from operators' liability. Otherwise, the final financial burden will be shifted to the taxpayer. The exercise of activities for which permits are granted and which are not considered harmful at the time they are exercised must not preclude the operator's responsibility; however, the fact that there is a permit or that the harmful consequences of the activity at issue were not recognised in time could function as a mitigating circumstance when apportioning the cost of restoring ecological damage to the operator, provided that the operator was in full compliance with the terms imposed under current legislation or the permit during the exercise of its activity. We are right to accept the report's differentiation criteria for compensation, from which we can indirectly see the size of the company, thereby ensuring that the viability of small companies is not jeopardised.</p>
<p class="contents">The foregoing also demonstrates that, if environmental protection is to be effective and ecological disasters are to be prevented, the activities that come within the scope of the directive must be revised on a regular basis, together with an evaluation of the most recent scientific conclusions and the experience acquired in the meantime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given a strong and courageous directive, we could reduce environmental pollution and damage, and make the polluter pay. Will this proposed directive face up to the challenge?</p>
<p class="contents">After a gestation period of twenty years, the proposal is disappointing, but it can be greatly improved by the amendments put forward by the Greens and the left. For how can we protect the environment while excluding nuclear activities and GMOs? To try and protect and remedy biodiversity with a directive which establishes liability for only 13% of our territory is unacceptable. Yet the worst thing is the hypocrisy of certain Member States on the issue of environmental liability. French conservationists, who take umbrage at the level of the IOPCF payments, would do well to ask Mr Chirac, who takes pride in his environmental charter, to change the position of his government, which is campaigning in favour of exceptions to permits and against compulsory insurance. This is totally at odds with a real environmental policy, because with permits and without compulsory insurance we can expect dozens of disasters like the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>and the <span class="italic">Erika.</span> We refuse to accept this.

It is necessary if we are to repair and tackle environmental damage, but we also need it as a big stick to wield against damage occurring in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us seems to me to be a very workable compromise that should win a majority of votes. The rapporteur has, and I am very grateful to him for this, taken back one or two things like his tree fund, and the shadow rapporteurs Angelika Niebler and Markus Ferber have been working with the rapporteur to do all they can to achieve a workable compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">That does not mean that I am completely happy with what we have before us. I have, however, promised Mrs Niebler that our group would support her because I want to give the proposal the benefit of the doubt. Why am I not happy?</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder whether excluding certain sectors – the oil industry, the nuclear industry – is sufficiently well covered by the international agreements that are in place. I doubt it somehow.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and this is actually contradictory – we will be creating a new way of bringing the GMOs that are permitted back under this legislation. I have my doubts about this. Then there is the definition of habitat. What will it cost when two wild hamsters are removed when an industrial park is built; who can pay for that? I still have problems with the way in which habitat is defined.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I believe that there is too little commitment regarding insurance. I would have preferred insurance to be made compulsory, because this would be relevant to small- and medium-sized enterprises in particular. This will now be reviewed after five years. Whether that is enough for it to work, I do not know. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For too long now we have operated on the polluter pays principle, but what has the polluter paid in the past? The polluter has paid a small fine which never bears any resemblance to the actual clear-up costs of a site. It is high time that we got round to not 'the polluter pays', but 'the polluter restores the site'. That is what this directive sets out to do.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the directive, as amended by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, is a weak directive at the moment. We have left it unclear, we have left it vague. I will point out some areas in which we have done that. The definition of biodiversity is a very weak and very vague description. It gives no comfort to the operators, no comfort to the environmental organisations and no comfort to the general public. That is why I support the compromise amendment put forward by my own group, the GUE/NGL and the Verts/ALE.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point which the directive, as amended by the Legal Affairs Committee, has failed to address is that of mandatory financial insurance. As it is formulated at the moment, it will allow bad operators to continue to be bad operators. If they fall foul of the law they will go into insolvency. Who will pick up the cost of that? It will be the general public. It will pick up the bill for restoring the site and operators will walk away once more. We cannot allow that to happen. Again, I urge people to look at the compromise coming from the three groups that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of permit defences, again, a full permit defence could be seen as a licence to pollute. We must not allow that. We must look at giving Member States and the courts the power to intervene if they believe that there has been pollution by somebody with a permit defence.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, and the European Parliamentary Labour Party, has some difficulty with the question of GMOs, not because we are against GMOs but because we think this legislation might weaken existing GMO legislation. Therefore we will be asking for a split vote on one of the amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has taken 20 years to translate the polluter pays principle into legislation. It is not getting industry to pay, however, but the national governments. The polluter pays principle has been desecrated by the Commission. Unfortunately, Mr Manders has made the mess even worse and has trimmed the already weak proposal right down to the bone. It is not surprising that the whole of industry is rallying round Mr Manders. If industry has an environmental permit, it can never be liable. A car driver needs a driving licence to use the roads, but if the car driver causes an accident, he or she is most definitely liable. That is where compulsory car insurance comes in.</p>
<p class="contents">We must introduce exactly the same responsibilities for industry. That is the core of the polluter pays principle. We must be able to claim against the perpetrators for accidents like those involving the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, as well as nuclear accidents and pollution caused by genetically modified food. Hopefully the left liberals, the socialists, the greens, the regionalists, the communists and individuals on the right will achieve a majority tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that, at the moment, at a time when there have been numerous disasters in Europe, including the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster, we must insist on the polluter pays principle. I will focus on two specific points of this important Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Article 9, which deals with exceptions, it should not be assumed that all exceptions and all authorisations lead to pollution. The establishment of exceptions, such as activities covered by permits, as well as activities covered by the state of the art, correspond to the principle of legal certainty and legitimate confidence, which are being upheld by numerous judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Communities. Furthermore, this exception exclusively exempts damage caused by emissions and actions which fall within authorised parameters, and we should remember the principle of the IPPC Directive on the integrated control and prevention of pollution. I therefore believe that Amendment No 37 perfectly covers the activities permitted specifically and explicitly by the laws.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to financial guarantees, I believe that this is one of the key points of this report and that we must try to establish some sort of obligatory system of financial guarantees, on the part of the operators, in order to cover the responsibilities stemming from this Directive. Bearing in mind the fear of certain countries that the insurance companies cannot take on this responsibility, the step-by-step approach would undoubtedly allow the financial guarantee to be ensured and the possibility of insuring against environmental damage. The fear that small entrepreneurs may be harmed by the measure would be solved by means of the establishment of a minimum threshold or a minimum insurance. This is an important aspect of this Directive and I believe it is taken up appropriately in Amendment No 92, presented by our group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is something for which we have waited for many years. I do not believe that the Commission’s proposal for a directive is completely satisfactory. On the other hand, to adopt Mr Manders’ report unamended would be totally to undermine environmental protection in the EU. It would genuinely undermine the Commission’s actual proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for important changes. First and foremost, it must be ensured that the polluter pays principle is applied without exception, and we must at the same time ensure, along the lines indicated by several other people, that there are financial guarantees of the polluter’s also actually being able to pay, either through compulsory insurance arrangements or in some other way. We should have strict or objective liability for forms of environmental destruction resulting from commercial activity.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the issue of reducing biodiversity, I think it important that we obtain as broad a definition as possible so that all the habitats and species protected by Community legislation and corresponding national legislation are in actual fact covered.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that the directive should also cover pollution of the countryside by genetically modified organisms. I cannot begin to understand why there is no desire to address that issue in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, a remark on access to the complaints procedure. I believe that, in this area too, we must provide cover that is as broad as is humanly possible so that people really are given the opportunity to make complaints about environmental pollution, and the same thing should of course apply to non-governmental organisations or NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">As a very last point, a couple of remarks about the legal base itself. I appreciate that some people would like, in a few years’ time, to transfer the legal base from the environmental protection provisions to the internal market. That would, in my view, be a total mistake, and it would in actual fact destroy the rules governing environmental liability already established in many Member States. That is therefore something I would very strongly oppose, and I would state that I shall only be able to vote in favour of Mr Manders’ report if it is amended in relation to the points I have just mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, we must also be consistent and not allow unduly major exemptions in connection, for example, with genetically modified organisms, nuclear power and marine transport.

However, the legislation must be well-balanced and take into consideration the expressed requirements of European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The position adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which is summarised in Mr Manders’ report – and I would like to thank Mr Manders for this<span class="bold"> </span>important document<span class="bold"> </span>–<span class="bold"> </span>is an acceptable compromise, although it does involve some sacrifices. Some of the amendments being tabled now are particularly dangerous, in that they would make it impossible for operators to quantify insurance coverage. The definition of environmental damage is central to the structure of the directive, as are the definitions of biodiversity and biodiversity damage.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, Amendments Nos 23, 84 and 98 are unacceptable: if an incident does not have harmful effects, then it is risk, not damage we should be talking about. Amendment No 95 is not acceptable either, in that it disregards the polluter pays principle. Indeed, the concept of liability is independent of the relationship of indefeasible right to use a site. The definition of GMO soil contamination is inappropriate in that it is part of a general definition which does not list all the sources of contamination. There needs to be a reference to proportional liability, not joint and several liability, which would create a system based on mistrust. Prevention can and must continue to be the highest priority in activities which might affect the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the financial guarantees: in order to allow the insurance<span class="bold"> </span>market to consolidate, we need to ensure maximum flexibility even after the first five years of application of the new legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge the Members to support the Committee on Legal Affairs’ compromise, which is a clear, powerful signal furthering environmental protection but does not penalise European industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Adopting a directive on environmental liability would be of enormous value. It would give credibility to environmental legislators, increase protection of the citizens and would send a clear message to economic operators that polluting does not pay.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcomed the proposal for a directive with great expectations, but although it is a step in the right direction, I believe it falls short of what is needed. Furthermore, in seeking to resolve any legal ambiguity, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has ended up further weakening the environmental objectives. Consequently, with regard to the directive’s scope, I would first of all admit that the issue of damage to biodiversity must be clarified but the solution does not lie, in my opinion, in excluding it from the directive. The loss of biodiversity in the European Union is a reality and the commitments given in Johannesburg and Gothenburg must be honoured.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that, in addition to the damage to the ecological and chemical makeup of water, the directive should also cover damage to its volume, as laid down in the framework directive on water.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I feel it is unacceptable for oil pollution in maritime transport and radioactive pollution caused by nuclear reactors to be excluded from the directive’s scope. These activities are amongst the most damaging to the environment and international instruments do not properly address the prevention and remedying of the damage these activities cause.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I call for the directive to contain clearer provisions on making insurance compulsory, particularly for operators in more dangerous activities, in order to prevent taxpayers having to pay for damage in the event that companies become insolvent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only has he got through a pile of work and consulted broadly; he has also managed to achieve a balanced compromise in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market despite the hundreds of amendments and great controversy. This debate makes it clear that the controversy is by no means resolved, but what Mr Manders is presenting is well-balanced, workable and reasonable, and it provides for updates within the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important – more than important – to repair the riches of the environment and even more important to prevent damage. It goes without saying that a strict liability scheme can to a great extent contribute to this. Even though the legislation is not yet complete, this report is taking us a considerable step towards better protection, because let us not forget that in addition to the obligation to repair, we are also introducing objective liability. Objective liability – that means that neither blame nor negligence are relevant. We have naturally been used to this modus operandi in other sectors for some time, but it is and remains a far-reaching principle. I think that we must accept this far-reaching liability scheme, but at the same time I am convinced that the scheme must be legally secure, workable, efficient and reasonable, and therefore I am prepared to vote for the report as it has come from the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us hope that the Council follows Parliament's example, takes a decision and does not delay the directive. Parliament should accept this proposal as a basis for a decision and extend the directive to environmental damage caused by nuclear activities. The directive is important in my view because it will make the polluter pays principle a European principle that can be asserted in practice and because it will strengthen the European model of an environmental and social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Flemming and I tabled 35 amendments on behalf of the Austrian contingent. Of these, 11 were accepted verbatim and 7 have been incorporated in the compromise amendments. In my opinion, the following five points are particularly positive and deserve to be mentioned: firstly, the directive will apply to all those activities that are listed in Annex I and which are now described more clearly thanks to our amendment. Secondly, liability is precluded for normal operations that have been approved by the authorities and for emissions or activities that are not regarded as harmful based on current scientific knowledge. This provides legal certainty. Thirdly, the principle of shared liability has been accepted instead of liability based on solidarity, which means that the costs will be split in cases where there are several polluters. Fourthly, the directive seeks to have environmental damage made good and for that reason the provisions on compensation for interim losses have been deleted. Fifthly, the committee is in favour of voluntary financial security measures and of capping liability and is against compulsory insurance. This also represents a balance between different interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my own country, Finland, furthermore, people are worried when they see the dreadful condition of some of the oil transporting vessels that sail along our coasts. People’s health is inseparably linked to the environment around them. Questions of environmental liability are thus naturally close to the hearts of our citizens and therefore also constitute key areas of focus in our policies. A third of the petitions that arrived at the European Parliament last year, around 1 700, concerned these very problems relating to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal for a directive aims to ensure that the polluter will pay the costs of remedying future environmental damage. This to be a harmonised framework across the European Union, allowing us to avoid a situation whereby a company chooses to establish its registered office wherever the most favourable legislation applies. In order to avoid distortion of competition in the internal market, it is important that the directive is implemented in as uniform a manner as possible in the EU Member States. It is also important to retain the legal basis relating to the internal market, that is to say Article 95, after a five-year transition period.</p>
<p class="contents">We discussed the Commission proposal on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and we are proposing numerous necessary amendments to it. Our amendments are generally aimed at clarifying the legal interpretation of the directive and striking a balance between the interests of industry and of environmental players. To avoid any legal uncertainty we proposed that the field of nuclear safety, which is already regulated by means of international agreements, should be excluded from the directive. The international conventions on nuclear safety are at present being revised, and comparable environmental liability regulations are to be included in them. It would be unwise of the EU to undermine the importance of the international agreements right now, as they are being revised and will be expanded to apply also to the new Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Any fundamental changes to this proposal for a directive would have produced an unworkable and impractical solution to what is already a complicated subject, and I feel that the work carried out by Mr Manders and others in committee represents the great possible convergence in view of this constraint.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not made any fundamental changes to the Commission’s approach, but it has clarified a number of essential principles. The directive does not apply retroactively. The permit and 'state of the art' exceptions should be retained. There should be mandatory liability but not compulsory insurance – the guiding principle of the directive is that the polluter must pay for environmental damage caused by their actions. An awareness of the financial implications of such damage will also lead to greater efforts to prevent environmental damage occurring. The polluter pays principle therefore aims to address remediation and incentivise prevention. A mandatory financial security regime might destabilise this relationship: operators would know that their financial liabilities are covered by an insurance policy, fund or levy and, as a consequence, the incentive to prevent damage is removed. A mandatory system of financial security might well be described as the 'insurer pays principle' in that the risk of liability has been transferred from operator to financial security provider.</p>
<p class="contents">We all must be socially responsible about protecting the environment because it is inherently a finite resource. Operators need to recognise that there are consequences to their actions and that they will pay for any damage that they cause with intent or by way of being reckless.</p>
<p class="contents">The 'polluter pays principle' is acceptable on these terms. Thanks to the reasonable approach advocated by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, a Directive will have been created that reflects the interests of both industry and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I should like to thank Members for all those valuable speeches and constructive ideas on how to improve this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin by commenting on two things: the polluter-pays principle and the scope. Several Members referred to the long history of this proposal; the debate reflected the different views and the need to find a balanced approach in the end. I also understand that many Members want to be more ambitious: to overload this proposal with a lot more. I can understand that, but it is important to see it as a step-by-step approach, because we have a practical view on this. We do not want to overload it with aspects that we are negotiating at the same time in international fora. I am sure that there would be more chance of losing the whole proposal if we were to try to burden it with these aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The polluter-pays principle is the guiding principle behind this whole proposal, and that is why it is quoted in the first article. The idea behind it is to create responsibility and, via that, to achieve prevention. It gives that very clear signal. We also touch upon the fact that in many cases it is not possible to find the polluter, or to make the polluter pay. In that case, there has to be remediation. We want to see an insurance system. However, we believe that market forces should be allowed to create that kind of system. We do not want to impose it today in a situation where it is not clear that we would achieve the desired effect.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Miss Breyer's point: all accidents are covered. I do not know what Members' presumptions are about the targets for this legislation, but our presumptions are very much based on the facts that there are too many accidents and too many cases of negligence, and also that short-sighted greed is behind much of the pollution. This is why we have designed the proposal this way. Therefore, all accidents are covered and we have also covered cases of negligence; this will create a polluter-pays principle and, in the end, pave the way for prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">What about the scope? It was <span class="italic">very</span> important for us to ensure that we have legal clarity if we want to introduce a new system covering biodiversity, because traditional damage – economic damage or damage to people – is already well covered by the legislation in all Member States. We do not have to take over that at Community level, but we want to harmonise the rules for covering damage to biodiversity. That was the starting-point.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to do this and have a credible system, we need legal clarity and a system which is manageable and which can be applied. If the definition is too wide – as it is proposed, it would cover, in some cases, the whole biosphere – it will be unmanageable. For example, we would have to cover damage to weeds! Is that something insurers will be happy to cover? Would that be a manageable system? Digging the foundations for a house would hurt worms. Do we want that to be covered? Is that reasonable? You have to be sure about the scope and make a definition that provides legal clarity. We have to see it as a step-by-step approach. I am sure that as we apply this legislation there will be more legal clarity. However, if we are too ambitious at the beginning and think that we can cover the whole biosphere, then we would not be serving environmental interests.</p>
<p class="contents">On GMOs, nuclear and marine pollution: we can see that this is an area in which we would also like to be more ambitious. However, we have a very practical reason for not covering this in this particular proposal. We are negotiating to improve the rules on these areas. We have international fora and conventions that cover these matters. We do not want to duplicate work: we want to be practical. We do not want to overload this system by taking it on here. We need another few years to work on incorporating these aspects. For international activities, there should be international rules. As I have already said, traditional damage is already covered by legislation in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">What about oil or marine pollution? The polluter shall pay! This is the only rule that can apply. It is a scandal that we have let it go this far. We have seen accident after accident. But, again, this is a truly international activity and we have to work towards international rules that apply the polluter-pays principle. I understand that the Director of the IOPC Fund has announced that claims for compensation would only be covered by up to 15% of this amount. This is not acceptable. The Commission is well aware of the situation and this is why we have always supported the attempt to raise the funds available up to EUR 1 billion. I understand that this week a diplomatic conference is being held in London to sign a protocol to raise the ceiling of the funds available for compensation. I hope that this conference will be a success; we are all determined to work on marine pollution and to do everything we can.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to avoid loopholes and also the absurd situation where neither the directive nor international conventions apply. That is why the Commission agrees that the directive should apply in all cases where the relevant international convention is not yet in force. For the same reason, where the relevant conventions are not in force, the Commission does not support the notion of waiting for five years before the directive is applicable.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been proposed that after a five-year transitional period, the Commission should develop proposals so that the directive applies eventually in a complementary manner to the international conventions where liability or compensation is insufficiently regulated within those conventions. The Commission does not believe that letting the directive play the role of filling in possible gaps in existing conventions would be either constructive or workable. The conventions contain exclusivity clauses that bind the States' parties to the conventions and prevent them from imposing any complementary legal instruments, so Member States would have to denounce conventions they had ratified to be able to follow Community rules. Before letting it come to that, it would surely be preferable to try to improve those conventions by renegotiating them in the proper international context.</p>
<p class="contents">What about regulatory compliance and state-of-the-art and development risks? Some amendments have been tabled that seek to maintain the so-called permit and state-of-the-art or development risk defences as proper defences and, as far as permit defences are concerned, with a formulation that would better specify its scope. Other amendments aim instead to introduce regulatory compliance and state-of-the-art as mitigating factors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that proper defences, with the proposed improved wording, constitute a preferable solution in terms of insurability and legal certainty. The Commission considers it useful, however, to better specify the scope of the so-called permit defence to avoid any suggestion that this might be tantamount to a blank cheque to pollute, because this is not the idea.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not find it appropriate to impose liability on the competent authority when damage is caused by a permitted activity, nor does it find it appropriate that there should be a link between the state-of-the-art defence and any environmental audit and management system. I am sure that these issues will come back during further decision-making on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments have been tabled to impose either proportional liability or joint and several liability. The Commission considers, however, that Member States should retain the right to opt for either joint and several, or for proportional liability, or a mix of both, according to their national legal traditions. I recall in that respect that the proposal offers some safeguards to operators, since it provides that operators who are able to establish the extent to which the damage results from their activities, be required to bear only such costs as relate to that part of the damage.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been proposed that the Commission should present a proposal to supplement the regulatory framework on liability for damage caused by GMOs. Apart from the fact that such a requirement would unduly impinge on the Commission's right of initiative, the Commission is currently considering the issue of economic damage to conventional and organic farmers in the context of the so-called coexistence debate. The outcome of that debate should not be prejudged here. Again, this is what will cover traditional damage.</p>
<p class="contents">On financial security: amendments have been tabled either to propose that financial security become compulsory after the directive enters into force, or to oppose such a move towards compulsory financial security. I think we can agree that financial security will become an important factor in the proper implementation of the directive. Member States and market operators, as well as the Commission, will have an important role to play in encouraging a timely emergence of financial assurance systems, products and markets to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, it is clear to me that Member States should have the possibility to develop financial assurance solutions at their own pace; solutions which are well adapted to their own needs and institutional conditions. In addition, financial markets should be given time and leeway to develop market solutions following the demand for insurance that is very likely to take off once the new liability regime is established. In the light of this, it appears premature to impose fully-fledged financial security for all Annex I operators within a few years.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, it would certainty be fruitful to revisit the situation when the Commission carries out its general review of the implementation of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">There is general agreement that the polluter-pays principle should imply, for the liable operator as polluter, to pay for all the damage it causes to the environment. In addition, there is a clear need for a common understanding within the Community that the costs of environmental damage should be borne by the polluter. Furthermore, the rules set out in the proposal specify the full range of remediation actions to be carried out by the liable operator.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments have now been tabled to narrow down the scope of damage remediation by suppressing the remediation of interim losses, together with suppressing the concept of a natural resource service. Deleting elements from this range of actions would inevitably result in the polluter not having to carry the full cost of the damage he causes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the difficult context of this debate on environmental liability, the Commission has tried to reach an overall balance which has already been built on compromise solutions. At this stage the Commission is still of the opinion that the proposal is fair and workable in many respects and should be supported. I am also aware, however, that we are still at the beginning of the legislative process, and thus entirely conscious of the need for all the institutions involved in this process to reach agreement in due course. Such an agreement implies necessarily the willingness of all parties to find appropriate and satisfactory compromises. The debate has reflected this need to ensure that we bridge the different views and find a workable solution in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall hand the Commission's position on all the amendments to Parliament's services for publication<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. However, I should like to say one word about the amendments we have accepted. In addition to the technical amendments that the Commission can support, I would single out the amendments to Articles 4 and 5. The Commission can accept these – at least in principle. These two articles are at the core of the proposal since they specify via whom and how preventive and remediation measures should be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
