<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Thomas (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it was three years ago that the European Council, meeting in Lisbon, decided on a thoroughly ambitious strategy, according to which the European Union was to become the world's most competitive and dynamic economic area by 2010, and was to do so on the basis of qualified knowledge. This was intended to achieve lasting growth, along with full employment, more and better jobs, and greater social cohesion. Were we too ambitious, too euphoric? Were not today's crises foreseeable even then? Eurostat tells us that we currently have almost 14 million unemployed. The primary causes of this are the failure to resolve structural problems in the Member States, such as bloated bureaucracies, the distortion of competition by the failure to remove subsidies, and extremely high unemployment among women, young people, older workers and people with disabilities. Official figures indicate that there are 4.7 million unemployed in Germany alone, the highest level for five years, and the wave of bankruptcies among its businesses and the high level of taxes and duties, which spare neither businesses nor private citizens, are set to reach record levels.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the European employment strategy has achieved successes by coordinating national, regional and local employment policies. Although the subsidiarity principle has been adhered to, the continual expansion of the European employment strategy, from horizontal objectives to the Four Pillars, has led to constant reductions in its effectiveness. I agree with the Council and the Commission in their assessment that the new guidelines should be tightened up for the sake of greater efficiency. We need, above all, evidence of their having been transposed and of resultant changes in labour markets. Whatever the orientation in the medium term – the Commission proposed three years – it is my view that we must keep checking up on an annual basis whatever happens, so that there will be healthy pressure on the Member States, some of which have problems with implementing their National Action Plans. What we need is voluntary undertakings, of the same calibre, let me add, as the Stability and Growth Pact, and these elements must not then be altered in the way they once were when the stimulation of growth and investment are high up the agenda. Strict adherence to the Pact is the foundation for stability, for confidence on the part of the markets and the public, and so economic dynamism and employment are essentially dependent on it. The one is inseparable from the other. The new thing about the European employment strategy is the adherence to three priorities: firstly, getting as close as possible to the Lisbon employment rates of 70% for men and 60% for women up to and including 2010; secondly, improved quality of work, the direct effect of which is to increase productivity; and thirdly, the opening up of the labour markets to the vulnerable and those on the margins of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Jobs call for the right financial framework conditions. The tax laws of many Member States are inimical to enterprise and employment. Far from there being further increases in taxes, these should be reduced. Consumers and enterprises must have the burdens lifted from them, and administrative expenditure must be reduced. We must get back to job creation being worth it in financial terms. Reducing VAT on services up to the end of this year was the right way to go about it. I propose that there should be more mini-jobs subject to reduced taxation and levies, quite independent of full-time jobs rather as an alternative to them – as I am alleged to have said. It is always a matter of balance between, on the one hand, greater flexibility, and, on the other, long-term security.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, small and medium-sized enterprises need favourable conditions, for they are, after all, the driving force behind employment, providing as they do 70% of all jobs and 80% of all traineeships. I have not contented myself with generalised commitments to support for SMEs, but have made very specific demands. They range from the making available of venture capital at favourable rates via favourable tax treatment for start-ups to the speeding-up of approval procedures, from networks for people starting up businesses to ways of freeing them from bureaucracy. Different experiences at national level meant that there was intensive debate on these proposals in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but together we achieved compromises with some reservations. Let me, at this point, thank all the groups' shadow rapporteurs for their constructive suggestions. We learned a great deal together and from each other.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also expect employment to receive impetus from more flexible ways of organising work, such as contract work and part-time jobs, from which women benefit in harmonising work and family. We call on the Member States to do more to provide childcare facilities and tax benefits for the people who work in them. Flexibility is also of benefit to the long-term unemployed, to those starting work and to those with few qualifications, who can acquire new employment skills. Too little attention is paid to demographic change and the lack of specialists. The way people are treated when they are in their fifties is not acceptable; many of these, who find themselves laid off and excluded are willing and able to work, and want to learn more. They want more training and can take the strain. Experience is a bonus; it cannot be a defect.</p>
<p class="contents">One final thought: if this new European employment strategy focuses on the three priorities I have mentioned, we may well not have long to wait for effective changes in our labour markets, and so we will be taking a significant step closer to the Lisbon targets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, five months ago I presented the results of the evaluation of the European Employment Strategy to Parliament and Parliament passed a resolution approving the core results of this evaluation and the basic guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The presentation of the results was followed by an extended debate between all the European institutions. Broad consultations were also held with the social partners, so that the Commission could present the results of the debate together with specific proposals for future priorities and improved management of the Employment Strategy. As a result, the Commission presented a document in January containing a new approach to the Employment Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, the new approach focuses mainly on implementing the Lisbon objectives. As Thomas Mann said, the situation is different, the economic situation is not auspicious, and this is having a significant impact on unemployment, with certain groups of the populace being harder hit than others. Thus, despite the positive evaluation of the results of the Employment Strategy, with reforms in all the Member States and ten million new jobs created between 1997 and 2001; despite the positive approach, there can be no doubt that we need to activate more policies and speed up the reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to be able to focus more on Lisbon, we have set three basic objectives: full employment, labour standards and productivity and a cohesive labour market. I should like to emphasise that the gender dimension has been mainstreamed in all three objectives and in our priorities and specific reference is made to the particular conditions faced by women in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Having agreed on the three basic objectives, we then come to the substance of the guidelines. Both Parliament and the Council called for fewer, simpler guidelines focusing more clearly on results. Our objective, therefore, is to cut the number of guidelines, if possible by half, and to articulate them around highly specific priorities. We have selected eleven priorities; the new priorities and those that have come up against the greatest resistance, in the sense that some countries accept them while others do not, are undeclared work and immigration. So we have three basic objectives and eleven basic priorities around which the guidelines on employment are structured.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe, in the light of experience over recent years, that the quantitative approach plays a very important part. In other words, the guidelines need to include quantitative targets, if policy is to be quantifiable, and governments need to be judged on the basis of specific targets. Our proposal therefore includes specific sectors which can be used as a basis for discussion and in which Member States can agree on European or specific national targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is partnership. The method of administering the procedure for the Employment Strategy does, of course, vary from one country to another. Each country takes a different approach, depending on its culture and on how the social partnership and local authorities are organised. However, the evaluation identifies certain points which are common to every country. The social partners need an enhanced role, the procedure needs to be advertised in order to increase awareness among as many citizens and agencies as possible and, of course, in the European and national parliaments, the territorial dimension of the strategy needs to be developed in the form of regional and local employment plans, civil society needs to be galvanised into action and, finally, parliamentary bodies need to be more involved in the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">This last point brings me to timetabling. I should like to say from the outset that I understand perfectly Parliament’s concerns this year, as far as approval of the guidelines is concerned, because this year is the first time we shall be implementing enhanced coordination of economic policy cycles and employment policy cycles.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to implement this coordination, which has been called for on numerous occasions, including in Parliament, we need four different stages. The first stage is to decide on the general guidelines for the strategy on employment and the broad economic policy guidelines at the spring Council. The second is to submit the guidelines as quickly as possible after that, as a package. This means that, once we have the spring Council’s guidelines, the Commission will present a package of guidelines on both economic policy and employment. The third is to approve the guidelines; this needs to be done as quickly as possible, if possible at the June Council. The fourth, once these guidelines have been approved, is to draw up national action plans and the joint report on employment by the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, therefore, we are all under a great deal of pressure this year if we are to keep to this timetable, but may I remind you that we shall not be starting the debate in April from square one. The debate on the reform of the Employment Strategy started back in July last year. A very specific debate was held in Parliament, followed in January by the recent communication and I think that, if Parliament and the Commission work closely together, we should be able to overcome timetabling problems and coordinate economic policy and employment policy this year. This is very important if we are to avoid overlaps and ensure that one procedure does not take precedence over the other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pronk (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, first of all, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for his report, which I see, moreover, as a courageous one. For the first time, some new ideas are raised, ideas which have not always come up in recent years and which also tie in somewhat with the new reality that we are now faced with, in the context of a less favourable economic situation than we have seen in recent times. That is why I find it a courageous report, and, moreover, it is not very politically correct on a number of points. I think that that is a good thing too, because if there is to be a genuine debate on employment, it cannot just be politically correct, and that is something I believe applies to this aspect as much as it does to others.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, we are faced with a kind of economic slump. That is always bad news for employment, with unemployment rising, as a rule. In that case, we generally see unemployment among young people increasing more sharply than unemployment as a whole. That is because it is harder for young people to find a job than it has been in the past. The minute the situation suddenly improves, young people are the first to find a job. The minute the situation is less good, however, they are left standing. In order to prevent that happening, and precisely because we can see it coming, we should be focusing on this in particular. That does not mean that we should completely forget about the other groups we have indicated – that is, women and older people. On the contrary, you take the view that we should also continue with this, but I believe that young people need extra attention that they have not received in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to the matter of comparisons. At present, unemployment in the European Union is approximately 2.5% higher than in the United States and Japan, but the differences are not as great as they seem at first glance. Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Ireland, Denmark, Great Britain and Sweden are doing better than the United States. The other countries are therefore doing somewhat worse. If, however, we look at the differences, that is very alarming. It is precisely for that reason that this policy and these ideas are so important. One cannot help but see that if a country has very high unemployment and this unemployment does not go down, something is not right. There are countries that have historically had high unemployment, whose unemployment is going down. On the other hand, there are other countries that have historically had low unemployment, whose unemployment is rising. This is especially the case if one part of such a country is doing well and another part is not. In Germany, for example, which is of course our greatest concern at the moment, there are states that are simply at the European level. How is that possible? That is a very interesting question. It is not a valid approach to only look at the countries, but also at the regions. That is the way to bring it together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Lancker (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to be frank, it gives me a bad taste in my mouth to be discussing a new employment strategy in the midst of an international crisis situation and maybe immediately before a war in Iraq, but it is perhaps important to do so. The Lisbon process must be kept on the rails even in difficult times.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I can tell you that the Commission’s new approach to the employment strategy has been received very favourably in our camp. Increased stability in the employment strategy is indeed necessary. That does not mean that we must be less ambitious, but it does mean that, in future, we shall possibly have to concentrate more on depth and make the employment guidelines more results-orientated.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with the Commission that there should be more cohesion between the coordination processes. It is becoming increasingly the case that the broad economic guidelines are in practice playing the role of overarching instrument. In our opinion, however, that also means that the economic guidelines must take more account of the ambitions with regard to employment, the fight against poverty, the future of pensions, and health care. In our opinion, it also means that the economic guidelines should actually be economic and social guidelines, on which not only the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs express their opinion, but also the Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs, the Ministers for Education and possibly the Ministers for Science Policy. In our opinion, that means that, while the processes must run autonomously, a great deal more coherence is needed between the various political processes. That also has consequences in terms of content, because it means that, in our view, the economic policy must also stimulate economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, a lot more work must be done towards innovation, research and development, and investment in people. In the opinion of our group, this means that the Stability and Growth Pact must also fulfil its role as a growth pact and must enable counter-cyclical operation in the Member States and breathe life into the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">My group fully agrees with the Commission that greater coherence is also needed in the coordination in the social sphere; that is to say, between the pensions issue, the pension process, the poverty process and the health process. We should therefore like to lend our full support to the intention of the Greek Presidency to activate these processes and give them more continuity.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully agree that more attention should be paid to an effective implementation of the employment strategy. We must not let this strategy become a paper tiger. At present, the disparity between the Council’s intentions and reality is still too great: not only with regard to the employment participation of older people, young people and migrants, but also as regards investment in people. For example, we see that there are serious shortcomings in businesses’ training efforts and that people with low skills and older people are treated unequally. That is why we think that the involvement of all the stakeholders is very important. That is why we also say to the Convention that the open coordination method must be incorporated into the Constitution not only with regard to employment but also to the social process, in order to guarantee more democratic legitimacy and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">My group thought that the Mann report was reasonably balanced, reflecting our main concerns, just as it came out of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. We have no intention of tabling any amendments, therefore. I have to be frank: the amendments that are now on the table threaten to distort the whole report. This is not, Mr Pronk, a question of political correctness or anything of the sort. In our opinion it is a question of the efficiency of this Parliament. A report like that, with a consensus in this Parliament, may not be sexy, but the intention is to present a report which applies to the whole of the Union and not just to one Member State, and which sets out guidelines for a common policy. Such a report does not lend itself to national political deliberations or ideological debates on specific points of this or that policy orientation. My group is therefore inclined to reject these amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, then, also only natural that the two topics be linked, since they are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="contents">Success in employment policy is crucial to achieving the objective of economic policy. The fact is, moreover, that an economic policy that increases competitiveness and flexibility and so improves the economic incentives for creating jobs is the core of employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there are the factors so brilliantly emphasised in Mr Mann’s report, which those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are able to support and which we think will be improved by the amendments tabled by ourselves and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, amendments that we too shall of course support. Mr Mann’s report emphasises that we must have a stronger commitment to training, to improved incentives for accepting and creating jobs and to less bureaucracy and more flexibility in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the common employment policy is seen, from the job figures and unemployment statistics, not to be an unqualified success. We are much too far from the ambitious targets set in Lisbon three years ago. It might be enquired whether they were too ambitious. No, they were not; but there are trend-setting countries that do not feel sufficiently bound by the promises. There has been progress in some areas, but this is overshadowed, I believe, by a general picture of too modest a desire to comply with the common objectives. I agree with the proposal you have tabled, Commissioner, for simplifying and clarifying the open coordination of employment policy with a view to having fewer guidelines. These are constructive reforms that have been presented, and I also think it good that we should have better coordination with the common economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must also become much better at monitoring and ensuring that the Member States do in fact feel bound by the fine promises given at the Lisbon Summit, and this also applies to the large countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was disagreement over one area in particular, namely the conditions under which small businesses operate, together with their role in employment policy. Two different approaches were thus pitted against each other. Advocates of the one view wanted to make life easier for small businesses by means of tax relief, lower wage costs, less red tape, what are known as mini-jobs and such services as cannot be provided without government aid and public subsidies, for example household services.</p>
<p class="contents">The other approach was quite different. The representatives of this approach wanted to put their faith in small businesses with good business ideas, skilled management, possibilities of growth and ambitions to grow and to employ more people. We are concerned, then, with small businesses that are also strong or are able to become so and that can manage to pay good wages and ordinary taxes, provide their employees with good working conditions and maintain good union relations.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have here, then, are two different approaches, but not varieties of right- or left-wing policies, for I know that many people in industry prefer good, strong small businesses and that it is precisely to these businesses that they wish to provide capital, opportunities for growth and support in terms of knowledge. It is also precisely this route that my group too wishes to go down.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, we of course have too many small businesses in Europe. By far the largest number of small businesses is to be found in those countries and regions which are weakest economically and in which unemployment is very high. We have a large number of businesses that can scarcely support one family. We have a large number of businesses that start up with the aid of state subsidies and that immediately disappear once the periods of subsidy have come to an end. In brief, we have a situation in which statistics show that, of ten new businesses, there is perhaps only one, or possibly two, that will survive the first three or four years.</p>
<p class="contents">We must put our faith in quality. We could unite all the political groups in this Parliament around a progressive policy in this area, a policy that would take our overarching objectives and the Lisbon strategy’s objectives seriously, that is to say ‘good jobs for all’. Such a policy would require that, in small businesses too, the jobs should be of good quality and be the source of sufficiently high productivity to provide a social surplus.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mann’s report contains a number of constructive proposals for a modern and forward-looking policy of this kind towards small businesses. I hope that those amendments that point in the opposite direction will be rejected and that Parliament will send the Commission and the Council a clear signal to the effect that we want to see small, and not so small, businesses that are of good quality and in line with the Lisbon strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report that eventually came out of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was indeed a reasonable report. However, my group had one major problem with it over the support for the rigidity of the stability and growth pact. Consequently we are going to be supporting the amendment on that which will be coming from another group this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">Because we felt that what came out overall had a sense of balance to it, we are not going to be supporting many of the other amendments seeking to reinstate certain parts of the original text, e.g. Amendment 17 concerning GATS. We do not agree that the General Agreement on Trade in Services will be a job engine, either here or in the developing world. That was the subject of the extensive debate that Parliament had on Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">What concerns us as well is that the present text again lacks a mechanism for sustainability, that is, an environmental dimension that really must be incorporated into all that we are doing. Too often we see that the poorest people in the worst quality jobs also live in the worst environment. If we are really going to do something to upgrade employment or our social environment, we need to take account of the physical environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with a lot that the Commissioner said about the ownership of this employment strategy. It would be very useful if national parliaments debated the national action plans that were put forward by governments. In our delegation visits from this committee, we have found all too often that national parliaments do not have a clue that these plans even exist and they certainly have not participated in them. That would be a welcome step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">To pick up on the issue of small- and medium-sized enterprises: yes, they are important, but only if - as Mr Schmidt said - they are of high quality. You can have a small sweatshop as well as an ethical business and regulation is there to support the latter, not the former. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nobilia (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that Mr Mann has done an excellent job. Indeed, his proposals are based on the highest Community tradition in social matters and employment policy and, in terms of proactive measures, incorporate a broad range of innovative points and fields such as the knowledge-based society and its strategic implications. I am certainly not making the points that follow out of a desire to criticise, therefore, but, if anything, in order to share our hopes, although I fear that they may be quite insubstantial in areas such as small and medium-sized enterprises, with regard to which a number of different points have been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we all know that, as regards taxation, if we want to implement the recommendations made we have three options, which can either be treated as alternatives or employed in parallel: the Stability Pact and its durability, particularly with regard to the possibility of complete exemption for SMEs for the first three years, in view of their substantial contribution to national GDP; a review of the areas covered by the subsidiarity system; or, again, a review of the areas requiring a unanimity vote in the Council. I am not being pessimistic here, just realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">Another good example in the area of financial matters is the proposed policies for making credit available to small and medium-sized enterprises, which would appear to be in contrast with the contents of the 2002 Basel agreement, which does not allow the necessary raising of sufficient venture capital for small and medium-sized enterprise and for the internationalisation thereof. The same may be said of incentives to promote employment, as the rapporteur calls them, which are considered to be a different matter from flexibility and bureaucratic relief. If they are, then they are direct examples of State aid pursuant to Article 87(3)(a) and (c) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which, as the rapporteur is aware, only apply in areas identified in 1998, apparently without possibility of amendment, not even where situations have changed with the passage of time.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the social partners, however, which the rapporteur has rightly emphasised, is a consideration worthy of mention. Called upon to implement forms of local partnership and contractual flexibility within a coherent framework of principles, the social partners are now, despite the European social dialogue, in a position where they do not, in practice, have the bodies or policies to lay down minimum social standards for enterprises, particularly in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, notwithstanding, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the fact that a great many of these enterprises originate from current Member States. This is a situation which, in these countries, usually combined with lower taxation and a gradual increase in the consideration given to the Community acquis in environmental matters, is certainly creating new jobs, although it does mean that there is no hope of narrowing clear social gaps, even in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">A further point concerns the knowledge-based society itself, aims and objectives of which we support. As the rapporteur is aware, the knowledge-based society cannot be achieved just by increasing the number of computers in families and schools or by introducing better, more focused training, although that is needed, but it is based on both the full, appropriate exploitation of useful information and the availability of this information.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, what I fear is that, despite all the emphasis continually and repeatedly placed on the importance of employment and social policies and their horizontal integration with other policies, they will remain merely a kind of by-product, a by-product which, within the Member States which are unmindful of the content of the European social agenda, combines the sterile display of positive or negative quantitative results with, I am sad to say, constant rhetoric and equally persistent erosion of quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, we all recognise that encouraging investment and enterprise fosters job creation; that reducing fiscal pressure and bureaucratic constraints boosts activity; and that training young people and older people to enable them to enter or remain in the world of work is a good thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Having broken down these open doors, however, having explained that, in addition to employment and growth, a third, environmental dimension is required, not to mention the objective of promoting health and well-being in the workplace, having listed all these good intentions, we must wake up, leave behind our daydreams and come back to reality. And that is a severe shock: instability, social plans, delocalisation, social dumping, increasing unemployment, mass immigration, falling growth, demographic collapse and a social protection system about to implode. We owe all of that to a European political class that has managed to combine the problems of bureaucratic socialism with the problems of ultra-liberalism and globalisation. In other words, we are struggling with the worst of both worlds.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is clear that eastward enlargement will now throw the doors wide open to large-scale delocalisation and mass immigration. It is clear that the Union’s economic policy of opening up its internal market to global competition is selling off what is left of our labour-intensive industries. Allowing irresponsible free-trade extremists and globalisation fundamentalists to take charge of the future of our economies and our social structures is dangerous. Economic and social recovery is to be achieved through the recovery of our internal markets, through national and Community preference, through national and Community protection and by redefining WTO trade rules, and certainly not within the framework of the terrible nation-grinding machine that the European Union has now become.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For ourselves as Christian Democrats, it is extremely important that an employment strategy and a strategy for social welfare in Europe should combine fixed, stable values, built upon the ethical and moral basis that is European cultural history, with a social, market-oriented economy. I would emphasise that, in this context, we are concerned with both social and economic values and not, therefore, with a free-market economy devoid of ethical, moral and social values.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly draw the Commission’s attention to item 37, which emphasises the importance of making it easier to combine family and professional life by creating greater opportunity for parents to spend more time with their children, by extending childcare facilities, by enabling parents to take parental leave and by providing tax concessions for childminders and foster parents and care and assistance facilities for the elderly. This item is also about allocating greater resources to programmes for combating female unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">I want really to focus upon what is in actual fact the biggest issue for Europe, namely the demographic challenge. I know that we have a Commissioner with a strong personal commitment to finding ways of solving the issue of obtaining a large enough European workforce and population in the future. Item 37 indicates the value of combining working life and family life and of giving more time to children. This report is therefore about seeing the Stockholm European Council’s decision of March 2001 on the demographic challenge as one of the absolutely most important issues for Europe. Item 37 emphasises this extremely clearly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This of course is partly due to a number of demands which have a very specific national character and which do not really belong in the European debate at all. I support the intention expressed in his report, which is that the guidelines should concentrate on what is essential and that annual reports should also continue to be produced in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Also in terms of the objectives, I believe that we have achieved broad consensus, especially as regards flexibility on the labour markets, without subjecting the workforce – the employees – to any unnecessary dismantling of their social protection. The path towards this goal is undoubtedly a matter of debate. Fresh ideas would be all well and good, Mr Pronk, but in some areas, we can detect very clear retrograde steps, starting with the involvement of the national parliaments. Mr Mann has called for the national parliaments to be allowed to exercise greater control, yet we agreed some time ago that they will not only exercise control but will participate through the framework of legislation – which goes much further. Indeed, Sweden and Denmark have already applied this in principle. Moreover, Mr Mann calls for implementation of the national further training plans to be pushed through. Here too, we agreed that there should be legislation imposing a binding obligation and setting out workers' rights to further training.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore – and this, of course, is where we cannot agree with him – he calls for indiscriminate tax cuts and wage subsidies. These are not fresh ideas. They are completely obsolete. Nor do they promote the entrepreneurial creativity that we urgently need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that, in the context of economic development, demographic developments, technological developments, enlargement, and a possible war, we have together ended up in a complicated situation in which the things we like, such as a comprehensive approach, will become increasingly difficult. That was something I just wanted to say on this day when elections are being held in the Netherlands. For, although we have taken pains over it, it will not be easy, for example, to continue in the coming period to attain the standards of employment creation to which we have become accustomed. In any case, I concur with remarks such as those by Mrs Van Lancker with regard to the linking of economic and social policy. In my opinion, we should also adapt the economic policy to the social policy. I also concur with a number of remarks by Mr Pronk regarding the frequently erroneous comparison between the United States and Europe. You have to have a much better, much more careful look at this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in agreement with the main objectives of the new employment policy and should like to call attention in particular to the second objective. The first objective, full employment, needs be elaborated, including with regard to the social economy, but of course it is also necessary to devote attention to better employment, and that will become even more difficult in this period. Looking at the priorities, it is funny to see that some eleven remain of the original eighteen guidelines. I think that we have to look very carefully at how to present and systematically secure the new fields, such as immigration and undeclared work. If we look, for example, at those elements which the evaluation of employment policy revealed to be relatively poor – the improvement of the organisation of work, and better work, for instance – we have to ensure that we do not break these down again into all manner of categories, when we are presently just at the stage of initiatives in this field. In other words, I think that we need to do some work on this in the coming period. With regard to the streamlining of the whole package of guidelines, which makes sense to me, this also means that – as I said at the beginning – we have to adapt these to each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I think – and hope – that the Council will also commit itself in the coming period to implementing the method of working which we have adopted together, namely the open coordination method, without any kind of deviation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we wish to be serious about how we develop people's opportunities and give them the tools of freedom and independence, then giving and assisting in employment is one of the most important tools for combating poverty and exclusion. Whatever side of the political divide we come from, we all agree that more needs to be done to achieve a more effective Europe-wide employment strategy. Many of the proposals in Mr Mann's report and some of the amendments will help towards this final goal.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also learn from the mistakes of the past. In particular, the guidelines need to be simplified and reduced. Appropriate targets have to be put in place to guarantee the delivery of proper results rather than a mere tinkering with figures. We need to create proper conditions for full and stable employment to improve quality and productivity at work and labour market cohesion. We need to ensure that all employment policies are people-centred, not merely a response to an urgent need in one or other Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Our strategy requires not only that people be given training and skills but also that there be no discrimination between men and women. This year, in particular - the International Year of the Disabled - we should also be working more actively towards integrating people with disabilities into the workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">We must maintain and improve the incentive to work. The most effective way is by guaranteeing proper wages and ensuring that people can maintain as much of their own earning potential as possible to reduce labour taxes. However, this is where we differ from some of the speakers and from the proposal in Mr Mann's report, in particular Paragraphs 11 and 13, which deal with taxation. These issues are exclusively for Member States. If a Member State, or a group of Member States, wishes to follow the best practices of another Member State, then so be it. However, you can look at all the models that you wish and analyse all the processes that have been put in place but the only way of increasing employment that has been successful is the reduction of labour costs.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns my own amendment to Paragraph 24. The purpose is to boost consumer confidence through proper corporate social responsibility, which can create and contribute to higher innovation performance. The idea is to distinguish between how an enterprise relates to internal stakeholders, shareholders and employees. Corporate social responsibility can also have beneficial effects in terms of building good relationships with consumers, suppliers and others. If we can deal with the question of taxation, we can all support this report. However, the question of taxation has to remain outside the responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now that five years have passed since this strategy was launched, this is the right time to assess the experience, to evaluate its weak points and to try to provide responses that are both realistic and bold, to the emerging challenges that are common to the current and future Member States and bring them into line with the aims of the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy for employment has undeniably contributed to reducing unemployment, but we are today facing a different scenario, with Europe's economy in a period of stagnation, a situation to which the Member States must pay particular attention. We must also focus on clear issues, on adopting global priorities in the medium term and on achieving results. One of these issues is that of active ageing as a response to the demographic challenge, whilst not forgetting young people and the least-favoured social groups. Recent history has shown that the greater the involvement of regional and local policies in policies adopted at national and at European level, the more the strategy for employment has to gain. The importance of the role of the social partners, civil society and non-governmental organisations in achieving the objective of full employment and of better jobs for all cannot be over-emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">The report rightly highlights the role of the small and medium-sized enterprises in particular. These have indeed been the driving force behind job creation in Europe. Consequently, measures promoting the creation and existence of SMEs will surely have a positive effect both on the quantity and quality of jobs created. I also wish to highlight and express my total agreement with the idea of cooperation between the various universities, in addition to there being a genuine interface between universities and businesses. Lastly, I shall refer to the principle of equal opportunities: a lasting increase in the general employment rate is only possible if the female employment rate is strongly improved, and this will require effective measures to square the demands of family and professional life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The strategy implemented has made genuine progress possible, and, as has been stated, Commissioner, we fully support the proposals regarding the way in which you plan to follow up this work. Today, however, in a difficult context, a context of waves of company restructuring and mass redundancies that are increasing instability on the job market, the European Parliament must once again send out a strong, clear signal. Mr Mann’s own-initiative report, however, takes the opposite view to the message we should be sending, presenting to us an exclusively liberal creed, and the work carried out by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in order to balance the text is in danger of being completely nullified by the amendments reintroduced in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mann, what we need today is not just increased flexibility: we also need a policy that is both durable and flexible. We do not want second-class jobs or deskilled casual work, as you are proposing. We must focus on training and qualifications, and support the most vulnerable categories, which are women, young people and the elderly. Nor do we want a policy that insists on seeing fiscal pressure as the cause of all evils in this matter. Nor do we want deregulation, uncontrolled opening up of the service trade markets, sacrificing all the social acquis on the altar of free competition.</p>
<p class="contents">If the report were to be amended in the way you are proposing in plenary, we would have to oppose it. I shall end, Mr President, by saying that, in promoting employment strategy and social policy in the European Union, which is the title of the report, we cannot overlook the principles of solidarity and social cohesion, which are guarantees of the prosperity of our economies.</p>

I believe this report will not allow me to move towards workers at Metaleurop, Alstom, France Télécom or many other companies, who are currently clearly threatened by mass restructuring and harsh, unacceptable mass redundancies, often due, furthermore, to shareholders’ completely uncontrolled actions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the endless calls for social dialogue are a rather surreal figure of speech. The commitment we must make today is very clearly to a policy of democratisation within companies that breaks with this unacceptable way in which employees are currently hired and fired, given intermittent work or made redundant. I believe that the social situation, which is further exacerbated by the economic recession, is currently creating a despicable climate to which this report is certainly not capable of responding in a credible way.</p>
<p class="contents">Must we, in this kind of situation, forbid ourselves from investigating, from taking a closer look – I am well aware that it is rather unusual to talk about this in this House – at certain experiments in reducing working hours, negotiated experiments which create jobs, which have considerably improved the economic performance of certain large companies, which have considerably improved the quality of social relations in the workplace and the quality of work? Must we prevent ourselves from taking a look at these experiments and drawing the conclusions that, in my opinion, are generally extremely interesting?</p>
<p class="contents">Must we stop ourselves examining the capacity to develop many activities that are useful socially or for environmental management and whose potential we suspect, but which, I regret to say, receive very little support or recognition. I believe it would be far more interesting to show imagination, rather than to keep trotting out old-fashioned ideas that we have heard all too often. We must start to show an interest in this kind of debate and initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In short, nothing has happened. The increases in the United States’s and our own competitiveness have been so markedly different that the discrepancies between the United States and the EU have increased, rather than decreased, since that target was set.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have a very great problem, and all we can say is that, up until now, the Lisbon strategy has not worked at all and that the target is now even further away than it was when it was adopted. As will have become apparent from the debate in Parliament, there is too much bureaucracy and there are too many regulations. What we lack is training, better access to capital and a long list of structural changes to enable us to cope successfully in the new knowledge-based economy. The key to progress will be more basic research so that the new knowledge can quickly be converted into exciting, well-paid and interesting jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say that Mr Mann’s report is a step in the right direction in promoting economic growth and increasing the number of jobs in the Member States. He emphasises the importance of small and medium-sized businesses and sets out a long list of initiatives that I believe will enhance the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Then, because of the ambitious goals we set ourselves, the Lisbon Summit was a decisive step, with the goals being updated each year by specific indicators, just as the Commission’s assessment of the national plans and the respective recommendations are a point of reference and an incentive to follow the example of those countries which are more successful than others in obtaining positive results by means of a proactive policy involving the social partners at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Each year, the European Parliament has consistently succeeded in its resolutions in finding the right balance between flexibility and security and putting economic policy, employment policy and social policy on an equal footing. Now, in the face of the new generation of guidelines proposed by the Commission, which seek, as has been said, to achieve three objectives – to bring the employment rate further into line with the Lisbon objectives, to improve the quality of jobs and to promote a labour market which is open to socially vulnerable groups – it is a little surprising that the rapporteur proposed in committee and is proposing once again in the form of amendments in the House a series of instruments – reducing taxation across the board, recourse to what is known as<span class="bold"> </span>‘minor work’, the introduction of excessive flexibility – which are incompatible with improving job quality, investment in human resources or effective reconciliation of family and professional life which is not detrimental in terms of security.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that these instruments serve the purposes of the ideological debates taking place in some of the Member States – Italy, for example – rather than stimulating and coordinating the Union. This line was partially adjusted in committee and the result is more balanced, and that is why, as has been said, we do not support the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end with a comment. Mrs Bastos rightly upheld the paragraph of the resolution which calls for greater cooperation between universities and research centres. It is a shame that her group has tabled an amendment seeking to replace cooperation with competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I might only be looking at one side of the coin, however. Nonetheless, it is pleasing to note that the number of people unemployed in the European Union has fallen dramatically. The total stood at 17 million in 1997 but by 2002 it was down to 13.5 million. The scenario and pace are now quite different.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I have to admit there is another side to this coin. A hard core of 7.4% of the unemployed have never actually worked, have lost their job, or face major obstacles in getting back into work. In general, these are older people. At least, they are likely to be too old to benefit from schemes for the young, and too young to be considered for early retirement. Alternatively, they might be young and lack the necessary experience and training.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already referred to two groups in particular need of protection or initiatives, namely the young and older people who have lost their job. Turning to a third such group, on 8 March we celebrated International Working Women’s Day, and its memory should still be fresh in our minds. Women also need support. It is important to honour the commitment given at the Lisbon Council, namely to ensure that over 60% of women are in employment by 2010 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal we are debating today encompasses three main objectives. These are to increase the rate of employment, to improve job quality and to open up the labour market to the most disadvantaged groups in society. 2003 is the year of the disabled, and this should be in the forefront of our minds. In addition, the horizontal policies so frequently referred to in the House must permeate all our activities. It is difficult to rank these horizontal policies, but health and safety in the workplace, equality and sustainable development are certainly amongst the most important. It is also vital to ensure the involvement of society as a whole and of all levels of administration, regardless of how close they might be to the citizens. The enlargement countries will be watching our activities with interest too.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mann’s report takes account of all these considerations. The report is to be commended in its original version, and also as it now stands following the improvements made in committee. I congratulate Mr Mann and call for a vote in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the light of the present situation, however, it is even more necessary to make every effort to improve this strategy, particularly as we face up to a war situation and its aftermath. The Commission’s communication and reform must therefore be more than welcome. Let us hope that the second half of the decade that began in 1997 will actually surpass the first.</p>
<p class="contents">I must begin by echoing what other Members have said. I do not know whether to start by commenting on Mr Mann’s report or on the amendments to it. Further to the statements made by the rapporteur and by Mr Pronk, I find I am bound to state strong opposition to all the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mann’s report does indeed contain a number of positive ideas. These enjoyed broad support in committee. Unfortunately, the amendments amount to a strong reaction against the most sensible and balanced ideas of the European strategy for ideological reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus on the objectives and point out that there can be no valid strategy if the objectives are scaled down. As the Commissioner stated, the Lisbon objectives are crystal clear. There is no doubt that the objectives for the coming five years are more jobs, better job quality and better social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mann, more jobs is not synonymous with full employment. It is not acceptable to maintain that it was over-ambitious to hope to attain the rates of employment set at Lisbon. That is backtracking. Similarly, better quality is not synonymous with lower taxation, nor is more social inclusion synonymous with fewer fiscal demands. Public resources will be needed to launch proactive policies and to ensure those in danger of being excluded from the labour market are drawn into it.</p>
<p class="contents">If these amendments are adopted, I shall therefore be obliged to vote against your report, Mr Mann, along with many other Members in my delegation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I do not accept the basic thrust of the report that one of the solutions is to strengthen the roles of the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I am all for social dialogue, but this should be between employees and employers within their companies. The rapporteur confirmed the importance of SMEs as the motor of employment, but SMEs have only a tiny voice within UNICE and most of their employees do not have membership of trade unions. So within the social partners their voice goes virtually unheard, and yet the social partners presume to speak for them.</p>
<p class="contents">There was an interesting report in the UK press at the weekend about Germany: Chancellor Schröder was apparently finding it increasingly difficult to get acceptance of much-needed labour market reforms because the social partners were blocking them. A German minister was quoted as saying 'when it becomes necessary to drain the swamp, you don't stand around asking the frogs'. With unemployment approaching 5 million in that country, the swamp is getting bigger and the need for change is very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">So I am all for social justice and social inclusion, but the biggest enemy of both is unemployment. Governments need to do what is necessary to address this. Clinging on to outdated concepts does not help; strengthening the role of the social partners simply leads to more paralysis. If some countries wish to persist in this, it is of course up to them. But please, rapporteur, please, Commissioner, do not inflict such concepts on the rest of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karamanou (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, today we are debating the future of the European Employment Strategy, at a time when the economy is seriously overshadowed by the threat of war in Iraq, rising oil prices and economic problems in the countries in the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the current labour market is not dynamic enough to create new jobs. As far as women are concerned, to whom you alluded extensively, despite the increase in the number of working women, who now account for about 41%-42% of the total workforce, and the gradual increase in the number of women in purely male-dominated sectors, unemployment is far higher among women than it is among men.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon objectives to improve the position of women in the labour market would appear to be some way off, given that unemployment is still about double among women: 14.6% compared to 8.7% among men. We also note that exploitation is rife among women, with over 250 000 women working at home with absolutely no social protection. At the same time, the black market is flourishing, relying heavily on hundreds of thousands of mainly female foreigners who are left out of labour and unemployment statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Employment Strategy recognises the role that women can play in increasing employment rates, and we are delighted that it is moving towards eroding the differentials between men and women as far as wages and the representation of women in all sectors of the economy are concerned. We are also delighted, Commissioner, with the importance you have attached to gender mainstreaming in all sectors. However, it is clear from the statistics on the number of women in work that the policies already being applied require greater momentum and evaluation. Most importantly, quantifiable, qualitative and quantitative targets need to be introduced at both European and national level. For example, we could set ourselves the objective of halving the current differential between men and women on pay, training, pensions and promotions and the length of time women stay in work by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the forthcoming spring Council will accept your proposals and that we shall have new national employment plans by the autumn, as you said in your speech. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, as we have discussed the individual subjects broached by the honourable Members on several occasions, I have just three brief comments to make.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the objectives of the spring Council. It is important that the Greek Presidency has made employment a priority at the spring Council. This will be the second time since Lisbon that employment has been one of the Council’s priorities. Interestingly, it would appear from a series of initiatives between prime ministers over the last month that they are all promoting employment as a priority and at the spring Council, war permitting, it will be top of the agenda. However, we must bear in mind that the quantitative target of full employment by 2010 set in Lisbon depended on two basic preconditions: 3% annual growth and the implementation of a reform package.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the first target is concerned, we are clearly behind schedule. In several countries growth is below 3%; in fact, a number of countries have almost zero growth, which by definition will make it very difficult to achieve our targets.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second issue, the positive evaluation of the employment strategy notwithstanding, numerous reforms need speeding up. The message, as far as reforming the Employment Strategy is concerned, is that we cannot insist on reforms relating to the labour market and to the modernisation of social systems and to another set of policies relating to the employment strategy. I think this is where the main difference lies; in other words, labour market reforms are part and parcel of the Employment Strategy, which is much wider and which, as many members said, ranges from taxation to education.</p>
<p class="contents">So we believe that it is very important that the spring Council and Parliament will be sticking to the Lisbon objectives; it shows that we all hope to be able to make up the last two years’ lack of growth over coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point has to do with discrimination. Briefly, one of the three basic objectives is a non-discriminatory job market, and what we are proposing to the Council is that there should be individual quantitative targets for groups vulnerable to discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point has to do with women. For the first time, more women than men have entered the labour market. Of the ten million jobs created between 1997 and 2001, 75% were filled by women, a clear signal that our targets are being achieved and our polices are effective. I shall of course be insisting on gender mainstreaming in all measures and priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
