<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, the issue of the patentability of essentially biological processes is very sensitive, and the patenting of plant-related inventions is particularly sensitive for plant breeders.</p>
<p class="contents">Biotechnological inventions relate to biological material, meaning any material which contains genetic information and which can either reproduce itself or be reproduced. Such inventions concern either a product consisting of, or containing, biological material, or a process by which biological material is used or produced.</p>
<p class="contents">Biotechnology is very diverse and covers agriculture, pharmaceutical, medical or industrial applications. Therefore, biotechnology offers a great potential to assist us all in our daily lives and in life-saving circumstances. It is a hallmark of the European capacity for innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of patent applications relating to plants in Europe has been stable over the last decade, with an average of 800 applications per year. Since 1990, some 1 700 such patents have been granted, of which slightly less than 100 concerned non-genetically modified inventions. This may seem low compared to an overall number of 2 100 patents granted in 2011 in the sole field of biotechnology. However, because of rapid technical progress in breeding activities, the granting of plant-related patent rights creates potential tensions.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on biotechnological inventions, or ‘Biotech Directive’ for short, sets limits on the patentability of biotechnological inventions. Similar provisions also exist in the European Patents Convention (EPC).</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be very clear here: elements occurring naturally cannot be patented. They are mere discoveries and not inventions. To be patentable, an invention must have a technical character, be new and inventive, and must not be exempted from patentability.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the third condition, the Biotech Directive and the EPC set strict exclusions. Essentially, biological processes for the production of plants may not be patented. Such essentially biological processes consist purely of crossing and selection.</p>
<p class="contents">Breeding techniques have, however, substantially evolved in the past years. Modern, so-called ‘smart’ techniques make breeding more efficient; they use markers which allow for the targeted selection of existing plant material genes for further breeding. In the so-called ‘broccoli’ and ‘tomato’ cases, the enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patents Office clarified that conventional breeding methods are still excluded from patentability even if they make use of marker techniques.</p>
<p class="contents">However, some grey areas remain, in particular, as to whether a new plant which is a product of conventional breeding may itself be patentable. Of course, if this product is a plant variety – for example, Angel’s Dream, one of the 3 000 varieties of tulips – it cannot be patented. But the issue arises where the invention can be applied to different plant varieties. This question will soon be examined by the enlarged Board of Appeal. We therefore expect further guidance in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">A biotechnological patent is granted in order to promote innovation. Under the breeders’ exemption principle, it should, however, not keep breeders from innovating further by using protected material to create new plant varieties. The Biotech Directive does not explicitly address the question of a breeder’s exemption. In some Member States though – Germany and France for example – such an explicit provision exists in national patent legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to take a closer look at questions concerning the breeders’ exemption, and also at the issue of essentially biological processes, in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">As already mentioned in our replies to written questions by honourable Members, the Commission will indeed publish a new report under Article 16(c) of the Biotech Directive covering breeders’ relevant issues, national developments and the relevant case-law.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me assure you that the Commission is taking the concerns raised – especially those related to blend breeding – very seriously. We are already looking closely into the matter and will deal with all relevant topics in full transparency and openness. Commissioner Barnier will be happy to provide further information on this subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you very much. Sometimes, figures say more than words. Up to this point, as you have mentioned, the European Patent Office has granted almost 2 000 patents for plants and almost 1 200 patents for animals created with and without the use of genetic engineering.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention two prominent examples. The first is the approval of patents on barley which has been genetically modified and modified by breeding. This applies to the entire chain from the seed through to the plant and, therefore, affects both our farmers and our brewers, both producers and consumers. This example shows the devastating scope of the patenting processes.</p>
<p class="contents">The second example concerns the so-called long-life tomato, which is not to be confused with the long-life oil in the engines of your diesel cars. The ploy used by the applicant, the US company Arcadia, enabled it to obtain a patent by circumventing current EU regulations. It was not the tomato that was patented, but its genetic material, in this case, selected enzymes.</p>
<p class="contents">This shows the lengths that companies will go to, despite the fact that, as you have said, Mr De Gucht, Article 4 of the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions of 1998 clearly states: The following shall not be patentable: (a) plant and animal varieties; (b) essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals. We are of the opinion that this definition should be made more precise. Technical processes used to support conventional breeding activities must not lead to patentability. We would like to make it quite clear that there must be no patents on life. We need to send out a clear signal that there needs to be a more ethical approach and greater honesty with regard to creation. I repeat: we are opposed to the patentability of life throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr De Gucht, we are calling for a clear statement from the Commission that patents on genetic material and genetic resources are, and will remain, banned. Secondly, we are calling for a clear position on Article 4 of the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions: no patents on life. Thirdly, Mr De Gucht, on behalf of many farmers and breeders in Europe, we are calling for the breeders’ and farmers’ privilege to be clearly enshrined in all legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, we are all in favour of inventions being patented and of protecting new products in a way that genuinely benefits the people who have invented them.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when it comes to breeding methods in biological fields, we need to consider very carefully what actually constitutes an invention and what is just a discovery or a development of a natural breeding method. That is one of the questions which arises in the context of patenting. There are some cases, including tomatoes and broccoli, where we have to ask ourselves in which direction the Convention on the Grant of European Patents is moving.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr De Gucht, you have yourself just admitted that, as far as patentability and the implementation and interpretation of the law in this field are concerned, there are some grey areas. It is precisely these grey areas we are referring to when we say that we need to think about how we handle this issue. We must ensure that the wide range of different varieties and breeds that we have in the European Union and the varied breeding methods, all of which have their own value, are not destroyed by patent claims that are too far-reaching.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also ensure that small and medium-sized businesses can continue to develop and exercise their breeders’ privilege and that this is not ruined by granting patents which will prevent this privilege from being applied and which will no longer allow these businesses to make free use of the natural material that is readily available.</p>
<p class="contents">This is one of the points that concerns us and we are asking the Commission, Mr De Gucht, to focus its attention on this area and to evaluate to what extent the bans which we imposed in the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, and which involved heated debates at the time, are really being respected. The principle that what the European Patent Office has laid down, in other words, that not only the explicit wording of the claims but also the overall technical theory behind the application needs to be considered, must be applied and respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the fact that, as I understand it, the work on this resolution has been going on for a long time – more than a year – the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has only been included in the process now at the very last moment.</p>
<p class="contents">When we are facing important European challenges, I think it is important that we are open in our debate and in our approach, as we need unity in Parliament when it comes to strategies for growth in Europe beyond the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">When, only a few days ago, we were finally able to study the text of the resolution, it was just as clear as it was regrettable that we would not be able to support this proposal. We have not been able to study it in detail, we have not been included in the process and we have therefore chosen to withdraw. However, in order to enable discussions to continue, we will propose tomorrow that the vote be postponed until the next part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">If the vote nevertheless goes ahead tomorrow, we will vote against the resolution. We will also vote against the two amendments concerning embryonic stem cells. Including embryonic stem cells in a resolution concerning intellectual property for breeding and improving plants seems strange to put it mildly, and I wonder where our intellectual integrity has gone to in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are seeing today is an imbalanced resolution that seeks to interpret various decisions by the European Patent Office in such a way as to score its own political points. It has been negotiated without any scrutiny by our group, the ALDE Group. It contains blatant factual errors – in paragraph 7, for example, in which it is claimed that there is a comprehensive breeders’ exemption in patent law in the EU for plant and animal breeding. This is incorrect. It exists in certain countries, Germany for example, but absolutely not at European level. This ought to be corrected, and therefore we propose that the continuation of the vote be postponed.</p>

<p class="contents">We have a number of standards, including Directive 98/44/EC, which clearly state that patents cannot be granted for breeding animals and plants. However, to put it mildly, the European Patent Office (EPO) has interpreted the rules very broadly. There have been several cases where it is clear that the European Patent Office has breached the terms of the directives adopted by the European Union. In order to explain this independent interpretation of the directives, it is only necessary to say that suddenly granting patents for conventional processes for breeding plants and animals does not comply with what is clearly stated in Directive 98/44/EC.</p>
<p class="contents">The products of these breeding processes will also be protected by patents and this goes against the spirit of what we want to see happening in the European Union. Therefore, we must warn the European Patent Office that it must comply with the terms of the legislation and not overinterpret them.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still 1 000 applications outstanding for plant breeding and a total of 3 986 applications for animal breeding. This means that there are still plenty of things to discuss, including in the European Parliament. Of course, we must take seriously the concerns of farmers and breeders. The increasing number of patents brings with it the risk that large companies will monopolise plant and animal breeding. To a certain extent, it also reduces the variety of genetic resources available, which puts further restrictions on farmers, and conflicts with farmers’ inherent right to breed plants and animals themselves. We must prevent this from happening.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the European Patent Office had to reverse a decision concerning the separation of sperm. This is also a point which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance complained about at the time. Now this patent has had to be withdrawn. We have achieved a clear victory, but this is only the beginning of the process of political evaluation of what the EPO is doing in many areas. Nevertheless, I would like to see us adopting this resolution with a large majority. This will send out a clear sign that the vast majority of Members of the European Parliament want a change of course. We want the Commission to focus on this issue and ensure that it is clarified. Mr De Gucht, you have just said this yourself.</p>
<p class="contents">If necessary, the Convention on the Grant of European Patents must be made clearer. Breeding is not invention and there is a farmers’ privilege. None of us want patents on life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The processes in these breeding techniques introduce additional steps beyond those contained in conventional breeding practices. These steps and processes require considerable research and development, and therefore entail costs. We must be mindful of the need to protect those investments in order to provide appropriate incentives for future innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst it is right to consider the need to facilitate access to genetic materials, we also need innovation to address the huge challenge that we have with food security in the future. I therefore support my group’s amendments, which call for a detailed debate on this issue.

Any breeder is entitled to freely use a variety in order to develop a new one (restricted breeders’ exemption) and is also entitled to freely place his/her new variety on the market (broad breeders’ exemption).</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary that we also incorporate such a breeders’ exemption in patent law. It seems to be the case, namely, that varieties are even being patented indirectly, for example, through patents on a particular characteristic. Incidentally, I reject such an exclusive claim to God’s creation on the grounds of principle.</p>
<p class="contents">My first question to the Commissioner – and I promise you that I will wait until the end of the debate for your answer – is as follows: is there a prospect of a revision of the Biopatent Directive?</p>
<p class="contents">My final question concerns the regulation of a unitary patent. The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), which has been asked for its opinion, advised the committee responsible, the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI), to incorporate a restricted exemption for breeders in the regulation. Unfortunately, the amendments to that effect, contributed by my esteemed colleague, Ms De Lange, among other members, were not accepted by JURI.

This broad-based movement, rooted in various national campaigns, has drawn attention to the way in which the legislation on patents in the European Union has been implemented, in that it paves the way for the patenting of plants and animals, genetic material and essential biological processes: in other words, life itself. This unacceptable path has led, for example, to the creation of genuine monopolies in the production processes of the agriculture sector. Two multinationals control and divide up the market between themselves at the cost of ruining many small and medium-sized producers and reducing product diversity and consumer choice.</p>
<p class="contents">The ethical, social and political implications of this issue are far-reaching. For this reason, we applaud the citizens and organisations that have taken part in this campaign. It is one thing to invent genetic transformation processes by using molecular biology, but the product – the living organisms created by such technologies – is something different.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable for there to be intellectual property rights over these organisms, just as it is not acceptable for there to be patenting of conventional genetic selection processes, cross-breeding processes or selected products of such cross-breeding, such as new varieties of plants and animals, or laboratory-assisted selection processes where entire genomes are involved. From that point of view, this regulation introduces some clarity where it was needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, personally, have a background in biotechnology and understand that we need to strike the necessary balance between protecting intellectual property rights and providing the opportunity for breeders to develop new varieties and to protect them, too, with plant breeders’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">However, some of these debates have been brought to a head in this resolution. In the 1998 Patent Directive, plant and animal varieties, as well as essential biological processes, were excluded from patentability. There is, nonetheless, a lot of disagreement about the interpretation of this principle and, therefore, the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office has concluded in its previous decisions that it is impossible to provide an unambiguous interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need a more thorough and balanced debate. The fact that the Commission has indicated that it wants to come up with a new and transparent proposal is an important signal. After all, in this resolution, not only have traditional and conventional breeding methods and their products been excluded from patentability, but new technologies, such as marker-assisted selection and other innovative technologies, have been rendered unpatentable. This is a potential constraint on innovation in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem is the broad exemption for plant breeders’ rights which has been proposed in the resolution. This breeders’ exemption is already included in plant breeders’ rights, but it is restricted by the concept of essentially derived varieties. Under patent law, too, this exemption exists in only a few countries and, even then, it is extremely restricted and intended only for the development of new plant varieties, and not for their commercialisation. The resolution takes absolutely no account of these facts. Amendments concerning stem cell research, too, are unacceptable to us and are unconnected with the rest of this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The present resolution displays too many factual errors and steers the debate in a direction that is not where we want to go. We need to find a balance between protecting intellectual property, safeguarding and encouraging innovation, and providing the opportunity for breeders to develop new varieties. We, therefore, want to change some important points of the resolution and we cannot support it in its current form.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has driven out much of the plant biotechnology industry because of inappropriate and ideologically inspired regulation in the past. Let us not make the same mistake again with this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without doubt, the most difficult determinations involved when creating a potential trail of case-law for patenting essentially biological processes is where to draw the line between a method rendered entirely in a laboratory and the extent to which natural viable processes will then be governed by law. Producers, universities and enthusiastic gardeners and breeders must not be vulnerable to multinational industrial giants who are monopolising designs for naturally-rendered new species.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s 1998 directive does not clearly define the boundaries between classical and modern methods of breeding and does not consider the social, economic or ecological implications. Cultural discrepancies and the social and moral implications of genetic modification and manipulation and the propagation of new life forms for scientific investigation or commercial or agricultural purposes must be heeded and should remain the sovereign prerogative of nation states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this resolution. These are not merely empty words; I mean them most sincerely. I regret the fact that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has not been involved, but I think that it must also accept some of the responsibility for that itself. We requested a debate on this subject a few weeks ago. In the Conference of Presidents, the ALDE Group said that they did not want to discuss the matter. I then took the initiative myself, approached my fellow Members and suggested that we nevertheless talk about this together. If they refuse to cooperate to begin with – I do not know who in the group made the decision – then they cannot complain after the event. We now have to work with what we have on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Patenting is important for innovation. That is something on which we should all agree. There need to be limits, however. Otherwise, innovation will be hampered if the claims go too far, and ethical limits must also be observed, of course. That was the request of the European Parliament when we adopted the directive in 1998. The directive is better than it is reputed to be; it merely needs to be implemented correctly. That applies to plants: Article 4 has been interpreted inconsistently by the European Patent Office. The resolution gives the correct guiding principle for interpreting Article 4.</p>
<p class="contents">It applies to other areas, too. It also needs to be clarified once again that deception should not be used in the patent application in order to be successful. Where plants and other biotechnological inventions are concerned, it is often the case that only certain steps in the technical procedure are specified rather than the entire procedure in an attempt to avoid potential exclusion from patentability as laid down in the directive. That has happened in relation to plants and also in connection with other patents, such as in the patenting of embryonic stem cells, concerning which the European Patent Office and the European Court of Justice had to take a decision just recently.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Court of Justice and the European Patent Office implement the directive consistently here, then we should indeed commend them for that. That is the purpose of the amendment – to make it clear that someone cannot obtain a patent in an underhanded manner by deliberately leaving out certain information, but that the directive must be implemented consistently. In some cases, the European Patent Office has not done this. In other cases, however, it has done so. Therefore, we should not merely criticise, but also express praise where this correct approach has been followed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The last stages of work on its final form are under way, the objective of which has been to make it easier and cheaper to patent an innovation in the European Union’s Member States and to give us a guarantee of better protection of intellectual property and European technological ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">This course of action is absolutely right, but in taking this course, we must not forget the fact that cases of patenting may occur – although I hope this will not happen – which will hinder the course of development determined by the decisions on establishing the European patent. These questions are particularly addressed by the motion for a resolution tabled by representatives of most of the political groups in Parliament, in which we want to point out to the European Commission certain solutions and interpretations of the provisions contained in the 1998 directive on the protection of private biotechnological inventions which are already being applied both by EU judicial institutions and by agencies of the European Patent Office.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear that the provisions contained in this document have so far caused certain difficulties. Mr Liese has spoken about this and about the different ways in which they have been interpreted. This concerns, in particular, Articles 4, 5 and 6, which speak about areas that are considered unpatentable. Fortunately, recent decisions of the European Court of Justice and the European Patent Office have dispelled these doubts. I personally very much welcome the interpretation applied by these institutions, and I would like here to express the wish and the conviction that the European Commission will take these decisions and this idea into account in its future work and proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is quite simply an important subject that we should not postpone, as we really had a very long discussion process prior to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Patenting is important, as my fellow Member said, but there must also be limits. Let me make it clear at the beginning of my speech that a patent on life is unacceptable, and I also reject the patenting of conventionally bred farm animals and crops on principle. This is a clear limit that must not be exceeded.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation as it stands is that people are attempting to achieve precisely that by circumventing certain elements in the patenting of technical procedures. We could almost talk of a kind of gold digger mentality when there are several thousand applications that are simply attempting to do all of this. There is a need for action here, and I am pleased – and, in this regard, I do indeed agree with Mr Liese – that we are not only very quickly making it known that there is a need for an amendment to the law, but that we are, of course, also attempting to provide real support for the existing interpretation and for the European Patent Office where it is coming down on the correct side in terms of this interpretation. In other words, I am pleased that we are not only going in all guns blazing, to coin a phrase, but that we also want to intervene in a supportive way.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, we need to be careful, because the diversity of our genetic engineering resources quite simply must not be reduced, and we must not withhold the use of these resources from the general public. With regard to agriculture in particular, it must be ensured that our genetic engineering resources remain available and agricultural production and breeding also continue to be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, no one would dispute the fact that intellectual property must be adequately protected, but this should be done without restricting access to genetic engineering resources. Most importantly, however, we need to answer the question of how we should distinguish between a patentable technical procedure and a conventional breeding method. The decisive factor in this regard is that it should be a new product based on a new and innovative procedure. We must also rule out the possibility of someone at the same time indirectly including all identical products, genes or genetic engineering properties in the patent by patenting a technical procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">This balancing of interests is certainly not an easy task, but it is one that we should take on.</p>

Until now, farmers have, in principle, been able to utilise genetic potential in their own breeding and propagation; there is a corresponding licensing fee. If plants become more or less patented, the risk is obvious – because in effect, this would result in a reversal of the burden of proof. In other words, if a farmer is found to have such plants, it will be assumed that he has used these patented plants and he will then be prosecuted accordingly under patent law. Eventually, this would result in a few big players using patents to massively restrict genetic diversity and farmers’ opportunities for cultivation and propagation. That is what we want to prevent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European farming and market gardening have grown so big precisely because they constantly keep reinventing themselves by developing new and better varieties all the time. This applies not just to my country, but to all agricultural regions in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This innovative capacity of European agriculture, of agriculture worldwide, will become ever more relevant. Very soon, we will have 9 billion mouths to feed and we therefore need varieties that, for example, use less water and fewer pesticides and are more resistant to diseases. Our breeders are up to that challenge, but then we need to offer them room for manoeuvre and legal certainty and that is what is missing at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to plant breeders’ rights – and here I am referring, among other things, to the international UPOV Convention, but also Article 4 of the Biopatent Directive – we state that people are allowed to use each other’s varieties in breeding, developing and discovering new varieties. We call that breeders’ exemption. However, according to patent law, every time you use a variety, you need to obtain the licence from the patent holder.</p>
<p class="contents">With the rapid development of patent law in Europe, the breeders’ exemption, the developing freedom, is coming under threat and we must not allow that to happen. It is unacceptable from an ethical point of view – as previous Members have already adequately explained – but it is also not economically desirable because, that way, every innovation becomes paralysed. I therefore join my colleagues in calling on the Commission to enshrine the breeders’ exemption firmly in European patent law, at least the restricted breeders’ exemption, which provides freedom for the whole process until the moment you start commercialising and placing a final product on the market. It is therefore relevant that we get answers, especially to Mr Belder’s specific questions, and, if the Commissioner cannot answer them himself, he should have a member of his team answer them in writing.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, we have already named a tulip after Robert Schuman and I am pleased about that on this Europe Day. We have also named a tulip after Princess Máxima. If the Commission now speeds up the establishment of legal certainty in this field, who knows, Commissioner, that might very well lead to a tulip named after you, a ‘tulipa Guchtiniana’. Looking at you now, that would, of course, be a beautiful pink tulip. I sincerely hope that this will be the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is also paragraph 7, which talks of a comprehensive breeders’ exemption, which is not the case. This depiction of us as supporting the patenting of plants simply does not ring true.</p>

Despite this, patents have recently been granted by the European Patent Office for the production of conventionally cultivated plants such as broccoli, tomatoes or melons. As a biologist, I completely disagree with the patenting of fundamental biological processes by multinational corporations which jointly dominate the sectors of breeding, agriculture and the food industry, and thus the provision of food for the world’s growing population. As a politician, I fully support the European Parliament’s request for a consistent implementation of the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, and for the Commission and the Member States to ensure that the EU continues, in its patent law, to apply an extensive breeding exemption for the breeding of plants and animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are witnessing an increasing conflict between private and public interests. On the one hand, a patent, as a temporary monopoly, makes it possible to cover the costs of demanding research and development. Without patent protection, the risk to investors would increase so much that many inventions and improvements would never happen. Their authors would not be able to raise the necessary funding. On the other hand, we see that our patent protection is facing an ethical problem in sectors such as agriculture and health care: we see that the higher prices for patented plants or medicines prevent them from being distributed to places where they would make it possible to save millions of people from poverty, disease and death. This conflict is all the more complex for the fact that the private interest and the effort of the individual to achieve well-being through his own work – including intellectual work – is an integral component of public well-being. In other words, the well-being of society as a whole increases only when the well-being of its members increases. It seems to me that we are not yet ready to propose a fundamental reform to intellectual property protection, whether in terms of patents or copyright. We therefore have no choice but to proceed in small steps. One of these is to differentiate between traditional breeding and modern biotechnologies, as proposed by this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
