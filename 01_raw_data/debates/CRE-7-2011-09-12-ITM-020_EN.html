<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. −</span> Mr President, thank you for giving us the opportunity to make a declaration on the state of play of the multilateral trade negotiations. Allow me first to briefly recall the present state of the Doha Development Agenda negotiations within the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the negotiations were revitalised in early 2011 following strong political guidance by the leaders of the G20. The objective was to reach outlines of a comprehensive package by the summer, and to finalise the agreement by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the spring it became clear that a full Doha outcome could not be reached in 2011 due to a political impasse in the negotiations on industrial tariffs. The cause for this is fundamentally divergent expectations regarding the reciprocity of commitments that developed and emerging countries should make in opening their markets: one side asked for almost full harmonisation of commitments, while others insisted on far-reaching special and differential treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s position has been somewhere between the two extremes, asking the emerging countries to make ambitious commitments, while recognising that a certain degree of flexibility is still justified. Although the EU compromise proposal got large support from the industries concerned, there was unfortunately not enough traction around the negotiating table to negotiate further on the basis of this – I believe – good proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">WTO members then tried to agree on a narrower set of results by year-end. The idea was that this interim package would address particularly the specific needs of the Least Developed Countries, complemented with other components, such as an agreement on Trade Facilitation.</p>
<p class="contents">But progress proved very elusive, and at the Trade Negotiations Committee at the end of July, the WTO Director General had to conclude that the package was not taking shape. Mr Lamy then suggested that the membership shift its focus to preparing discussions at the December WTO Ministerial Conference regarding regular WTO work, as well as the negotiating agenda beyond 2011. Prospects for reaching concrete negotiating results in the short term look rather bleak.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Commission, this state of affairs is deeply disappointing. The EU has played a proactive and constructive role in the negotiations throughout 2011, including by developing a solid compromise proposal in the key area of tariffs on industrial goods, and by consistently calling for deliverables to Least Developed Countries without payment. But in the absence of political will and flexibility in WTO members’ positions, it has not been possible to reach tangible progress in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has always been a staunch defender of multilateralism. All institutions see eye-to-eye on this. Therefore, the Commission welcomes the strong support that the motion for a resolution expresses for the WTO as the guarantor of a rules-based trade system and as a key instrument of global economic governance. The Commission fully shares this view, and considers that the EU has a strong interest in a process of multilateral trade liberalisation which advances and remains relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will therefore participate in a proactive manner in the consultation process that the WTO Director General is leading regarding the next steps in the multilateral negotiating agenda. The Commission’s approach to these consultations will be guided by three basic principles: first, the WTO needs to have an ambitious negotiating agenda that contributes to the recovery and rebalancing of the global economy; second, WTO members must not throw out the baby with the bathwater, but build on what is already on the table; third, particular attention should be put on addressing the legitimate needs of the Least Developed Countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Honourable Members of Parliament, I thank you for your attention, and look forward to hearing your views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am convinced that international trade needs a strong and powerful World Trade Organisation. The economic and financial crisis has shown that existing commercial law has protected most Member States from protectionist measures. This is a genuine success, even though some trends are evident in the opposite direction. The WTO, and with it the entire system of commercial law, is a major gain. It is essential that the previous approach of intensive global cooperation should continue and that further integrationist steps should be taken in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with regret that I see the lack of progress and the fact that the Doha Development Agenda may fail. However, we must also understand the following: the countries involved in the negotiations are no longer the same ones who were at the table when the Doha round began 10 years ago. We have all changed in this time, which is why the discussions should be resumed on a sector-specific basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally I believe it is unrealistic to stick to an all-encompassing draft plan. However, we can make the best of the situation in which we now find ourselves, thus avoiding further damage. The European Union in particular needs a strong WTO. We need to strengthen it because we are going to need it more than ever in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately it will not mark its success. On the contrary, we are now clearly facing the fact that the window of opportunity, which last year was expected for this year for a comprehensive, equitable and balanced global trade agreement, is rapidly closing, as Mr Lamy stated on 26 July in an informal meeting of the WTO’s Trade Negotiations Committee, and I quote: </p>
<p class="contents">What we are seeing today is the paralysis in the negotiating function of the WTO (...) What we are facing is the inability of the WTO to adapt and adjust to emerging global trade priorities, those you cannot solve through bilateral deals’</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(PT)</span> End of quote.</p>
<p class="contents">What in fact is at issue in the Doha Round is the need for a broad, harmonious opening-up of international trade, and for this to be used to support development, especially in least developed countries. In this context, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament fully supports the resolution adopted by this Parliament’s Committee on International Trade, relating to the ongoing negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda. However, we have decided to table some amendments that will underline precisely our commitment to the multilateral system and to the development objectives of the Doha Round.</p>
<p class="contents">The S&amp;D Group deeply regrets the fact that the Doha negotiations appear to have reached an insurmountable impasse. Nevertheless, that is why we must put pressure on the Commission of the European Union to continue to give priority to a rules-based, multilateral trading system, established through the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Even if the Doha Round fails, the Union must continue to strive for a global order in international trade that will realise the objectives of Doha by building on what has been achieved over 10 years, instead of just casting it overboard.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the global economy has changed a lot over the last 10 years, we socialists believe that developing countries, especially the least developed countries, remain, more than ever before, the key issue at the negotiations. We therefore support the proposal of the Director General of the WTO for an early harvest planned for December this year at that ministerial meeting. However, after the ministerial meeting, we will continue to give our firm support to the conclusion of a general multilateral trade agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issue of the Doha negotiations is far removed from most citizens, the media, and even many governments, which are now busy dealing with far more pressing financial and economic priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a debate that truly excites Brussels, nor even, it seems to me, Geneva, at least not from what I have seen this year, both in the WTO Parliamentary Assembly and in its steering committee, of which I am a member. There is an air of resignation about the fact that nothing is happening now, that nothing must happen, that nothing can happen, that the challenges facing a better-regulated and more generous global market are too complicated, and that the boundaries between the opposing blocs – between emerging countries that regard themselves today as powers and the former powers of old, which are now struggling, countries in constant transition, with an identity crisis – are themselves always shifting and vague.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the ship that the World Trade Organisation – and, therefore, we too – are aboard does not know where it is heading, because, as Seneca wrote, ‘If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favourable.’</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, Commissioner, the poorest countries are losing out: they were encouraged to comply with international trade rules, and a good 32 out of 48 of them have joined the WTO, but what good has it done them so far? Theirs is a paradoxical situation: they account for less than 1% of international trade, but have 12% of the world’s population, people who are often forced to live without access to basic services. The forthcoming Eighth WTO Ministerial Conference has a duty to adopt at least – I repeat, at least – a package of measures to help them, and yet we have received no guarantees on that score – anything but. We call on you, Commissioner, to look into this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it would have no significant impact on international trade balances, the poorest countries would benefit greatly from measures such as the introduction of duty-free access quotas for their products, the simplification of rules of origin, the introduction of measures to correct market distortions in sectors such as the cotton sector, the provision of technical assistance to internationalise their economies and – an extremely important requirement for us members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – the extension of the TRIPS waiver beyond 2016 for pharmaceutical products and data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we understand, none of this has been agreed yet. I understand your disappointment, Commissioner – we are disappointed too. We support you and the Commission in your commendable efforts. If there is no prospect of meeting the needs of the poorest countries, then we can well imagine the situation regarding much more complex issues, such as the balance between emerging countries, the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">If I am not mistaken, Pascal Lamy today inaugurated work on the construction of the WTO’s new headquarters in Geneva: this is a first step, and I must say that the need for proactive and industrious efforts to revive the work programme, objectives and the identity of international trade itself has never been so great. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The other anniversary is that of the start of the Doha Round of negotiations towards a trade agreement. I would say that this in fact has killed millions of people – the people in the greatest poverty – or shortened their lives. I think that if we look at the responsibility for that, we see that the WTO has not fulfilled its aspirations to meet the Millennium Development Goals. It has failed the less developed countries in its belief in free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have in this resolution today is recognition that the Doha Round is dead in the water. It needs to be concluded as swiftly as possible with a package for the less developed countries. We need to concentrate on multilateral agreements because every single bilateral or plurilateral agreement tends to put trade into smaller regional or subregional blocks, and this undermines the multilateral direction which this Parliament believes is the right way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I am very pleased to see that the resolution calls for a reform of the WTO, because it is simply no longer fit for purpose. It needs to be revised around the principles of democracy and – bearing in mind that the WTO has never taken a single vote on anything, as it is all done by consensus – it needs to have transparency and accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Group believes that the wholesale enthusiasm for free trade has ultimately not delivered the promised benefits. We believe that we should be basing WTO reform around trade justice and sustainable development, which should be the watchwords as we develop a new trade body for the planet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Everyone gathered here today recognises the status quo, which is why we must have an eye to the future – as Mr Taylor has just said: do you remember the start of these talks? The Doha Round was instigated 10 years ago in the shadow of the attacks in New York and the intention was to contribute to an improvement in living conditions in developing countries by further developing the WTO, thus eliminating the basis for the propaganda of hatred. However, the Commission’s negotiators and those of its competitors are mainly concentrating on the opening up of the global markets for services and penetration into previously protected sectors of general public interest. Developing countries were able to come together within the WTO to prevent this opening up from being forced upon them.</p>
<p class="contents">In turn, you responded by switching the emphasis to the conclusion of bilateral agreements that enabled you to pursue your chief interests more effectively. This approach has patently failed to help reduce poverty. It actually threatens the establishment of a system of fair trade rules with worldwide validity under the umbrella of the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, my group urgently calls on you to return to the primacy of multilateral agreement. The least you should do in Geneva is to obtain an agreement for the so-called least developed countries package, which would bring improvements for the world’s poorest. We would also call on you to withdraw the Commission’s threat to abandon the promise to abolish the EU’s export subsidies for agricultural produce should the Doha Round fail. In view of the present catastrophic famine in East Africa and the increasingly difficult situation of the farmers – not just in the developing countries, but there in particular – it is actually necessary to speed up the abolition of export subsidies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This book has a slightly less well-known sequel, ‘Alice through the Looking Glass’. In that book there is a passage where the Red Queen tells Alice ‘the rule is jam tomorrow and jam yesterday, but never jam today’. Alice objects that it must happen sometimes that there is ‘jam today’. To which the Red Queen says – and here I paraphrase – no, there is never jam today.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, that is rather like the EU Trade Commissioner and the successive Doha rounds. We never do get the jam today. There is at least one reason for this. Parliament’s own Library briefing states that the focus of the Doha Round was to be on development.</p>
<p class="contents">For most developing countries, the critical aspect of the Doha Round is agriculture. Around three quarters of the population of most developing countries reside in rural areas and, in consequence, a majority depend on the agricultural sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s common agricultural policy, or CAP, is equivalent to about USD 80 billion a year, and this huge subsidy is a distorting factor in world food markets. It erodes the fair operation of the market in food, generates export dumping and damages the ability of farmers in the developing world to earn a living. I think that some colleagues who do not agree with me about everything will agree with this.</p>
<p class="contents">I must further point out that a disproportionate amount of the CAP goes on subsidising the growing of sugar beet. This crop, grown in the developed world, can never be fully competitive – without subsidy – with sugar cane. It is the continuance of the CAP in its present form which sabotages a proper result from the Doha Round.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, are the prospects for meaningful reform? The answer is that there are too many politicians here in the European Parliament who oppose the reform of the CAP. It is just not going to happen. No meaningful reform of the CAP means no meaningful outcome to the Doha Round. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quotas are barriers to free trade. The Commission sets quotas on fishing, for example. However, when certain Member States ignore these quotas, they become barriers to trade for law-abiding communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Import licensing requirements can be barriers to trade. European companies seeking to import from outside the EU may have to comply with licensing requirements as well as pay tariffs set by the Commission. Some of those imports may be from a third country with which a nation has strong historic and cultural ties. I am sure that many developing nations would benefit from the chance to trade more freely with the United Kingdom without being hampered by EU red tape and tariffs.</p>
<p class="contents">The anti-dumping policies so beloved by the Commission can themselves be barriers to free trade where they are cynically used to protect inefficient domestic producers from foreign competitors at the expense of the general public. Anti-dumping laws can stifle consumer choice and violate the rights of producers to enter into contracts freely.</p>
<p class="contents">Laws and regulations are necessary. However, I have just given you three examples of how EU legislation actually stifles free trade within our own borders. Should a political union that regularly has to bail out its own uncompetitive and bankrupt States really be advising the WTO how to stimulate trade in developing nations? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The world was a completely different place 10 years ago. For example, how have the BRICS countries developed in the last decade? Conditions have changed radically since then. However, from my point of view, the objectives that the partners have identified are still the same: we urgently need to help the poorest of the poor and we must reinforce the multilateral trade system. This will only succeed if we also have a strong World Trade Organisation in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of the WTO becomes apparent when you think what the world would be like if it did not exist. In response to all the criticism we have heard I would ask: what is the alternative? Today’s European Union has 500 million citizens. In a few years’ time we will constitute 5 or 6% of the world’s population. Who is going to look after the poorest of the poor if we do not succeed in making progress in the context of the WTO? What about emerging countries like China, India, Russia and Brazil? Who is going to persuade these countries to sit down at the table to work on a common system of rules and to adhere to these rules? That is why we urgently need a strong WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would have liked from the Commission is an answer on how things are to proceed – I would be very grateful, Commissioner, if you could elucidate that for us. How are we, the European Union, to respond to the fundamental changes in the world over the last 10 years? I get the impression that the answer we would get in most areas in the trade strategy you have put forward would be ‘business as usual’. That certainly makes sense in the short term. But when are we going to take the time to consider what our answers are to be to today’s changed world? What should a European Union trade strategy be like if it is to meet the needs of the world in 10 or 15 years’ time? I would be very grateful if we could hear a little bit about this today. However, we also need to take the time to consider the consequences of the likely failure of this WTO round.

It was necessary to initiate the Doha Round negotiations to remedy the inequalities caused by the Uruguay Round, which focused on the interests of the rich countries to the detriment of the developing and least developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the level of development of the participating countries has not been taken into account throughout the entire duration of the current negotiations either. Indeed, before granting some concessions on agricultural subsidies, the industrialised countries asked the developing countries for reciprocity in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make development more than a principle promoted for show in the Doha Round, products originating from less developed countries need to be given access to the market, free of customs duties and quotas, in keeping with the decision adopted during the Hong Kong Conference in 2005. Other requirements include ensuring special, differential treatment for developing countries, the removal by developed countries of export subsidies for cotton, improved preferential certificates of origin applicable to imports from the least developed countries, as well as greater financial input from the United States and the European Union in the area of Aid for Trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The very credibility of the World Trade Organisation in managing global governance depends on the success of the Doha Round. The WTO is at risk of being reduced to nothing more than an ineffective talking shop. The challenges we are faced with, such as the sovereign debt crisis, the alarming unemployment rate, volatile food prices, illegal trade and climate change require global management.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I think that the multilateral trade system needs to be reviewed so that the development objectives proposed by the Doha programme can be achieved via the WTO and the links between trade and global challenges can be dealt with more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, stepping up the cooperation between the WTO and other international organisations and agencies, such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the International Labour Organisation or the UN environmental and development programmes could help establish international standards which would tackle not only the commercial but also the social, development and environmental concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to highlight the need for greater democracy and transparency in what the WTO does. If we really want to achieve free trade and economic globalisation under fair conditions, we need to give greater consideration to a number of factors which are essential for achieving an economic balance, such as the need to encourage exchanges, especially involving technology and innovation, and averting the damaging impact on citizens’ quality of life and on the environment.</p>

We are well aware that the Round was, in a way, stillborn: it had so many contradictions in its genes that it could not succeed, but it was the international situation – it was just after 11 September – that ultimately forced all the countries to sign in Doha.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are seeing above all today is not a crisis of confidence within the international community, but a crisis of globalisation. We need to stop thinking about ever more liberalisation and focus instead, of course, on regulation, in a world in which every one of us today can see the damage caused by the globalisation of trade, whether it be from an environmental point of view or from a social point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">What kind of economy does Europe want to create for itself? How can we put a stop to environmental, social, fiscal and monetary dumping? How can we ensure that people can exercise their trade union freedom throughout the world without restriction? How can Europe make global trade dependent on the recognition and exercise of trade union freedom? These are the questions that we need to be asking ourselves today, that Europe needs to ask itself when it operates within a multilateral framework.</p>
<p class="contents">We must acknowledge that the Doha Round is finished, adopt a package that is limited and restricted to the least developed countries and, above all, launch an ambitious and transparent process for reforming the World Trade Organisation, one that guarantees the fair participation of all stakeholders and safeguards the interests of the weakest countries in particular, that makes trade law subject to social legislation, environmental law and, of course, human rights, and that actually promotes a multilateral regulatory agenda that puts globalisation back where it belongs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Free trade, over the last two decades, has been one of the pillars of the neo-liberal response to the systemic crisis in capitalism. It is a response that panders to the interests of major corporations and the major powers, by seeking to ensure that they have access to new markets, greater availability of manpower, a reduction in unit labour costs and easy access to raw materials, that is, better conditions for exploiting workers and nature.</p>
<p class="contents">This has meant, and still means more profits for those major corporations, without doubt; but for the workers and people the promised wonders of free trade, much vaunted by its advocates who are well represented in the Commission and this Parliament, have never materialised; on the contrary, what we are faced with is the destruction and relocation of productive activities and jobs, an attack on social and employment rights, the ruin of millions of small producers and many small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as the destruction of the environment and natural resources. This is the path of Doha. It is a path which urgently needs to be redirected in the interests of the workers and the peoples of Europe and the world.</p>
<p class="contents">International trade must be geared towards establishing fair and equitable relationships that are mutually beneficial; it must be based on relationships of complementarity, and not on competition between producer countries and the workforce. It must support the development of peoples and countries, and not just a few economic and financial groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commissioner communicated this fact quite clearly. Originally, 2010 was supposed to be the year of breakthrough, but now that has changed to this year, 2011. However, we are still not seeing any real success in getting the Doha Round going. Even a minimum package for the least developed countries seems an unrealistic prospect. The failure of Doha would harm international trade and promote protectionism. Therefore, everyone will have to make concessions to give this round a chance of success.</p>
<p class="contents">I asked a question almost two years ago during a similar debate, namely whether the WTO’s negotiating system had managed to keep adequate pace with globalisation.

I am also one of those who was involved in the Doha process 10 years ago as a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. Our current position is a very bitter pill to swallow, because it is apparent that we cannot achieve results without clear European guidelines for sustainability – we have started to hear talk of ‘resilience’ or even a rollback – without embracing human rights and openness in trade. A number of points have been made. With regard to the common agricultural policy, it would be hypocritical of the EU to enter these negotiations. It is difficult to accept that something similar is not happening there.</p>
<p class="contents">When Mr Caspary tells us: ‘we need a strong WTO’, we do not always remember to ask what a strong WTO actually means and what it would look like.

However imperfect the arrangements put in place by the World Trade Organisation may be, they are preferable to no arrangements at all and they are certainly preferable to an anarchic trading system.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, we are in favour of completing the Doha negotiations under an ambitious, broad, cohesive and balanced agreement. Of course, it is now clear that it will be impossible to reach an agreement in 2011. Under no circumstances must it be at any cost to the Union, which has made ambitious concessions and ambitious offers.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries shaping up as emerging economies must bear their share of responsibility as global players and must make concessions commensurate with their level of development and competitiveness. Of course, developing countries need to be differentiated for the benefit of the least developed countries (LDCs), for whose benefit a broad package of – if possible – immediately applicable measures should be agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as agricultural negotiations are concerned, I would stress that agriculture is not simply an economic activity; it also helps to generate basic public requirements, such as food adequacy and food safety. Be that as it may, regardless of the outcome of the Doha Round, and possibly following the reform of the WTO, the need for which we have heard argued in this Chamber, the WTO will need to respond to the new global challenges and we shall need to safeguard the credibility of the multilateral trading system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, I believe that developed countries have to give greater consideration to the needs of and imbalances in the developing countries and ensure that they receive special, differential treatment, in line with previous agreements, including a services waiver and a different monitoring mechanism. New investments are required to boost economic recovery and the stability of the developing countries, many of which have been affected by domestic crises and disastrous conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I call on the European Commission to continue to support the achievement of the ambitious objectives envisaged in the Doha Ministerial Declaration in 2001, as well as the commitments adopted at the World Trade Organisation’s Hong Kong Ministerial Conference held in 2005, by promoting development as a key objective of the Doha Development Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that, in the current climate, the European Union can and must play a more active role, mediating between the different positions of the members of the World Trade Organisation. In this respect, I would like to remind you that Article 208 of the Lisbon Treaty on the consistency of development policies obliges the European Union to consider the impact of trade and other policies on developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking ahead to the Eighth WTO meeting in Geneva, the most suitable solutions must be identified for addressing the main challenges facing these states so that trade stimulates sustainable development. Especially when it comes to restrictions on natural resource exports, they need to be regulated comprehensively by international trade rules. These wealthy assets are the main source of income for many developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also point out the impact on emerging economies. I believe that it is appropriate for us to reissue our appeal to these states to assume their responsibility as major global players and to make concessions commensurate with their level of development and sectoral competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The changes over the last decade, triggered and influenced by the economic crisis, may have an adverse impact on the Doha Round which needs to be adapted more dynamically to the new global situation. The lack of food security, caused by huge price rises and climate change, is one of the key factors that need to be borne in mind in this respect. As far as subsidies are concerned, those supporting the agricultural sector in developing countries and those supporting exports for developed countries have a negative impact, which requires a solution to be found that will not affect the economic balances within and between these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It allowed developing countries to sit down at the negotiating table – they knew what they wanted and they stood firm. However, that was the only positive, because they did not end up getting what they were entitled to.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not had enough involvement with any of them over the last decade and, as a result, a whole raft of bilateral agreements have been signed in the meantime. Bilateral agreements between Western countries, including the European Union, and developing countries have led to these countries being played off against each other. It is essential that we work towards multilateral agreements, but I fear that we are not going to see that happen in Geneva. Why not? Because the players at the table, Europe headed by Mr De Gucht, and the WTO headed by Mr Lamy, have sent out a message over the last decade that we are not prepared to give developing countries their rights. I therefore hope that we, here, will speak out in favour of the completion of the Doha negotiations and in favour of changes being made at the WTO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You confirmed Europe’s commitment to the multilateral trade negotiations, to the World Trade Organisation and to the Doha Round. After all, even though we may have an ambitious programme for bilateral free trade negotiations, we all know that it is only the multilateral, global agreements that can provide the growth and free trade that we know we need.</p>
<p class="contents">It is rather tiresome to have these debates on the Doha Round over and over again. I have been in the European Parliament for seven years and debates and discussions on the Doha Round have come up time and again. There are always new hopes and new disappointments – it would be easy to give up, but the Doha Round is too important for us to let it go.</p>
<p class="contents">The Doha Round was launched straight after the dreadful terrorist attacks on 11 September 10 years ago. I have to say that this is one of the few really good responses to the horrors that happened at that time – a response that is about global cooperation and bringing prosperity to the world’s poor. It is no less important now than it was then.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we could say that the Doha Round is more important than ever now with the debt crisis pervading both Europe and the US. We can expect lower rates of growth, perhaps even a recession, in large parts of the world. We know that it will affect Europe. However, the world’s poor will be hardest hit. It is therefore more important than ever to ensure that we do something to give the global economy a real boost.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Doha Round is a little out of date. It concerns duties, and it mainly concerns agriculture and to a minor extent industrial goods. At the same time, we all know that the economy is characterised today by services, by the digital economy and not by peripheral barriers to trade. It is therefore important to bring this to a conclusion. It is important for people’s confidence in the global trade system and in the WTO and a global regulatory framework, but it is also important in order to enable us to deal with future challenges – new trade regulations for a new economy – an economy that is digital in nature and characterised by services. Everyone will benefit from an agreement. It would be the single most important and best boost for new growth throughout the world. However, this requires leadership – courageous political leadership. Here in the European Parliament, we do not expect anything else of the Commission and of Commissioner De Gucht than to simply have the courage to demonstrate this leadership in the negotiations. We need more free trade in the world, not less, in times of crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not quite as pessimistic, however, as the article published recently in an international journal by former United States chief negotiator Susan Schwab, with a title suggesting that the Doha Round was dead. According to the former chief negotiator, the Doha Round has died because the World Trade Organisation (WTO) was unable to keep pace with the major changes that have taken place in the world over the past 10 years. For example, it has failed to keep pace with changes linked to the growing economic importance of China and Brazil. The author believes that China, Brazil and all the other countries that have hitherto benefited substantially from the WTO should make much greater concessions in order to help the least developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The WTO has also failed to take account of the changes that have taken place in climate policy in the past 10 years. It is very difficult to envisage any new system of trade regulations that does not address climate protection issues. Despite the increasing scarcity of resources worldwide, the WTO is incapable of taking effective action against countries that restrict access to resource markets by imposing export restrictions. There is another important issue that has been referred to in several of today’s speeches: as the number of starving people grows, food security is also becoming an increasingly important global issue. This, too, needs to be addressed in the WTO context. It may not be possible to conclude the Doha Round, but this does not spell the end of the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">The WTO will not necessarily cease to operate. WTO regulations currently in force will continue to apply. These regulations need to be enforced much more rigorously, as many of those who have benefited on the whole from the WTO are the worst offenders when it comes to violating WTO regulations. Let us now focus on implementing the existing regulations, especially with regard to export restrictions. It is unacceptable that some parties impose export limits, for example on rare earth metals. If it does indeed prove impossible to finalise WTO negotiations and conclude the Doha Round, there are many other options for expanding European Union trade by way of bilateral, balanced reciprocal trade agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is still no sign of the talks coming to a conclusion anytime soon. On Wednesday, this House will witness the adoption of a cross-group resolution clearly favouring a multilateral trade system rather than more bilateral agreements. During the course of the Doha negotiations, the European Union has made concessions in many areas, taking significant steps to close the gap with its negotiating partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I genuinely hope that the European Union will strongly support a functional and dynamic World Trade Organisation. Commissioner, this is something that lies mainly in your hands. Above all, a global trade system with a clear set of rules must enable us to offer less developed countries the support they so desperately need. Slipping increasingly into a pattern of bilateral agreements is the wrong path to take.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sceptical about this development, particularly in the context of European agriculture. We must not forget that many European countries have an agricultural system built around small structures. Measures to support the market have always been, and continue to be, a key component in retaining regionalism and rural life. Food safety is a central concern, particularly in Europe. However, there is no disputing the importance of the SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) standards and the TRIPS (trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights) agreement for the European economy. The same applies to price fluctuations in the commodities and food sector. These problems cannot be resolved on a regional or bilateral basis, but need global solutions. We need a solid, sustainable and well-balanced trade system rather than a series of cobbled-together trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I am hopeful of some positive developments during the next round of talks and that you will continue to press for a conclusion. Good luck! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Obviously we would have preferred a much stronger multilateral commitment than the one that exists now, and a positive outcome to these negotiations would certainly be excellent news not only for us in Europe but also for the rest of the world economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that over the next 10 weeks Commissioner De Gucht and his staff will step up their efforts and contacts, and the Commissioner has instructed me to tell you that he will be pleased to hold further talks on the future of Doha in the Committee on International Trade.

<p class="contents">We can only reiterate the importance of Doha when it comes to keeping the world markets open, improving the functioning of markets that are already open, and opening the market still further in line with the requirements of a world economy in the era of globalisation, with a number of steadily growing stakeholders, and in a context in which not everyone carries the same economic weight.

It is an instrument, the results of which are dependent on their application. I am of the view that international trade should not purely be a tool for achieving profits and a platform for a competitive battle between countries where the stronger one often wins. It should also be a developmental instrument. I will therefore hope that at the December Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation this position will be promoted not only by representatives of the so-called developing economies, but also by representatives of the EU. Development must be central to the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). In this regard, I appreciate the fact that the draft EP resolution from the Committee on International Trade received similar requirements. Besides the fact that development should come under the spotlight of the Doha Development Agenda, the resolution also sets out the need for sustainable development. I agree that it is important to improve access to environmental goods and technologies, and it will therefore be necessary to reduce or eliminate tariffs and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services. If international trade is to develop in this direction, that is to say towards equitable and sustainable development, it will certainly also have fewer critics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is showing the most willingness to compromise in the current negotiations: thus, 64% of the concessions in the agricultural sector came from Brussels. In exchange, the EU can expect only 8% of the profits. The United States will contribute a mere 6%, but can expect 13% of the profits. The biggest winner is Brazil – with absolutely no concessions, this emerging economy will profit all the more from the opening up of the markets in the other WTO states. There is clear inequality here. When making its generous concessions, the EU must not forget its own farmers. European farmers need support and protection in order to survive.
