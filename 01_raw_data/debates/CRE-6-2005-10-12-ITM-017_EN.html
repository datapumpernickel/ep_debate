<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Guy Bono (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, I would like firstly to remind you briefly of the context in which I have drawn up this report, then to tell you about the six priorities that have guided me in producing it, and then lastly to draw your attention to six key proposals contained in it.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the context, I must point out that this report is intended to alert the Council to the European Union’s delays in implementing the Lisbon Strategy in the field of education and training. As you know, ladies and gentlemen, the Spring European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005 set the objective of making the European area of education and training a reality. However, the Member States must move on from great declarations to concrete measures. This report therefore defines the priority fields of action.</p>
<p class="contents">In a very recent working document dedicated to the progress made in the achievement of the Lisbon objectives in the fields of education and training, published on 11 April 2005, the Commission services have analysed the performances of thirty education and training systems. On the basis of the analysis of the very precise data available in this document, I would like to comment on the six priority fields in which I believe the Member States must act urgently, if we want education to keep its place at the heart of the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">These six priorities, which I have already listed within the Committee on Culture and Education, are the following: to reduce the high number of young people leaving school early; to tackle the need for a sufficient number of scientists; to implement lifelong education and training strategies that are consistent and that promote social inclusion; to attract more than one million people to the teaching profession over the next decade; to tackle the fact that most pupils in the European Union do not achieve the objective of learning at least two foreign languages; and, finally, to strengthen the open method of coordination and the exchange of good practice in the field of education and training. On the basis of these six priorities, therefore, and of the comments of my colleagues within the Committee on Culture, I would now like to draw your attention to six proposals which appear in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, with the aim of developing skills in keeping with the needs of a knowledge-based society, it would appear vital that the Member States quickly take initiatives to, on the one hand, speed up the mobility of students, trainees, workers and their families and researchers and, on the other, to develop social inclusion policies for underprivileged young people afflicted by poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this report urges the Commission and the Member States to encourage guidance for young people into technical courses of study with potential for jobs and integration. In this regard, I feel that it would be useful for us to propose that the European Union launch an information campaign to promote high-quality technical trades among young people in order thereby to remedy their often negative social image.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the report stresses the need for our Parliament to indicate its support for the initiative of a pilot project aimed at creating an Erasmus-type programme for apprentices in order to facilitate access by apprentices to ‘new generation’ Community education and training programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, within the framework of the budgetary debate, I feel it would be useful also to point to the need for the European Union to guarantee sufficient methods of funding for the new integrated action programme in the field of lifelong education and training. We must also ensure that the European Social Fund continues to be available after 2006 in all the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the report calls on the Council to provide for an appropriate budgetary allocation in the next financial perspective for all measures relating to lifelong education and training, on which attainment of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy will largely depend.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, sixthly, this report alerts the Member States to the need to implement, without delay, more consistent national training policies aimed at improving the conditions for access by job-seekers and workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are at a crucial time for the European Union. Recent political events have alerted us to the need to place citizens’ education and the fight against unemployment at the heart of all of our public policies. We will not have a competitive economy unless we have an adequate and competitive education and training system. Furthermore, and I say this clearly both to you and to our colleagues in the Commission and the Council, unless an appropriate budget is allocated to education at European level, there will never be any real European citizenship and it will still be just as difficult for the twenty-five countries to agree on a common European project that they can pursue together.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore counting on your support so that we can send a strong message to the Member States that they must urgently put education back at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are in the middle of the road and the role of education and training in implementing the strategy now is being increasingly discussed and supported. I am glad to note that such support is also expressed in this report and in this House, in particular with regard to Parliament’s position on the financial perspective and on education within this framework. I think that Europe’s greatest assets are brains, knowledge, skills and the creativity of our citizens. In particular, I want to thank Mr Bono for his excellent work. The ideas developed in this report will be very helpful for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As you rightly state, education is the cornerstone of the Lisbon process. Indeed, there will be no serious increase of growth, innovation, employment and social cohesion in the Union without an increasingly efficient investment in human resources through education and training. Your report helps us very much to voice that central message to policy makers.</p>
<p class="contents">The report underlines a number of areas which are of major strategic importance for the success of the Lisbon strategy. Let me emphasise just three such areas, where we consider that substantial progress needs to be made in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to lifelong learning strategies, Member States have committed themselves to developing such strategies by 2006. We will continue to follow national developments in this area very closely. More and more countries are defining national strategies but implementation remains the key challenge across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we appreciate the report’s focus on the needs of the less advantaged, as well as target groups such as young people – as is required now by the European Youth Pact – and jobseekers. I am particularly concerned about the lack of progress as compared to the EU benchmarks, which relate most closely to social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless further significant efforts are made in the areas of early school leaving, completion of upper secondary education and the key competences, a larger proportion of the next generation will face social exclusion at a great cost to themselves, the economy and to society. The Commission plans to adopt a draft recommendation on the issue of key competences for lifelong learning, which we hope will make a vital contribution to the necessary reforms in this important area.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I shall refer to the issue of improving governance. Perhaps the biggest challenge of all in making lifelong learning a reality is the need to reform the modes of governance of the systems. Governance needs to be coherent and coordinated, requires synergy between the relevant ministries, strong social dialogue and the awareness and active involvement of other key stakeholders. We intend to follow up on these areas closely, through concrete peer learning activities whereby Member States support each other in the implementation of reforms by learning from the experiences of other Member States. In parallel, we are continuing to develop the European area of education and training. We are currently consulting on a proposal for the European qualifications framework, which we hope will provide a very concrete contribution to support greater mobility of students, trainees and workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Parliament for its continued support, especially with regard to the priority given to education and training in the context of the discussions on the financial perspectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My government is not here. I have no particular problem with my government – my Prime Minister made a wonderful speech here. I have a small political problem, which is that he does not represent my party, but even if it were my party in government, I would criticise my party and my government as I criticise my opponents, because they never take education seriously. We are failing our young people, we are failing because we think we know how to teach.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many members of the Committee who were teachers in their earlier professional lives. Teachers know about teaching, governments know nothing about education. Governments know nothing about job creation. Employers create jobs, governments do not. Governments frustrate the creation of jobs. They frustrate the profession of the teachers. I will give just one example, very briefly, of British teachers trained in England who cannot find employment in France or Italy because the educational authorities deny respect for their qualifications because they come from a different Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I am running out of time, so I shall conclude by saying that something must be done. If you are a teacher in England and you want to teach in France, Italy or Lithuania you should be able to do so. When I next have the opportunity of speaking to the British Presidency, I will continue this discussion. But I would urge everybody to support the Bono report, my group will do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new Member States are less developed than the older ones in many areas, but not in relation to education. Despite its ideological barriers, the Hungarian educational system became rather successful after the Second World War. There was hardly any social discrimination: children from different social backgrounds attended the same schools and extra lessons were either free or particularly inexpensive.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want non-discriminatory access to quality education, we should have more general standards and fewer exceptions in education. For example, the teaching of foreign languages as part of the general curriculum should be paid by the budget and not by the parents themselves. Non-discriminatory access should mean equal chances provided by the Member States to children from the lower classes as well as ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In some Member States, such as Hungary, universities have entrance examinations. The general schooling system should provide enough knowledge for those exams, because the special courses are exclusive and expensive for children of the lower classes, for single parents and for children from ethnic minorities. The cooperation of the universities, on the one hand, and industry and its research centres on the other hand, should be regular and strong. This should also mean not only the development of education but the training of teachers.</p>
<p class="contents">Just today I met a young Turkish expert from Junior Chamber International, hosted by our Socialist Group. She told me about a pilot project run by them and the European Union, which already provided useful information on entrepreneurship for around a thousand Turkish teachers. This kind of pilot project should be encouraged by us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On this basis, we can no doubt be honest and observe that the half-time result for the Lisbon Strategy is a disaster. Very few indeed of the key figures laid down have really been achieved. In order to achieve the objective, we have only half the time left but, in actual fact, twice the work. While we are sitting in this House mulling over why we are limping behind the United States in terms of economic growth, the Americans are wondering why growth in China is twice that of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the rapporteur has prepared a very good report but that, if I may say so, it is far too kind. We have agreed with the Commission’s proposal and supported basing the whole process on Europe’s need for a knowledge-driven economy but, if this is to be done, not only will some quite tough decisions have to be taken but the ambitions in the budget debates will also have to be lived up to. What we observe is that the proposals made by the Commission and supported by all the large groups in the European Parliament are not at all supported by the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget debates now being held on the financial perspective are, frankly, embarrassing, for, instead of increasing the research appropriation from the present level, the present proposals would in actual fact reduce the research appropriations by more than 40%. The same applies to the proposals in the EU area on the subject of education. The issue of lifelong learning was mentioned in the debate. That is obviously an incredibly important basis for all citizens’ being able to participate in this knowledge-driven economy. I would therefore ask the Commission to explain why there are budget headings with incredibly large sums for lifelong learning that are not used, that are locked up and impossible to apply for and that no one will be able to get at before the present budget period has expired.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wonder whether a very important issue in this connection is not that of improving the administration. In my view, a very great deal falls to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the report itself, I have a question about language education. Language education is, of course, extremely important, but why focus on neighbouring countries’ languages? Students are surely free to choose which languages they wish to study, and that is not something that the Commission and Brussels should control.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our group will support this report. We think that the rapporteur has done a very good job, but we do in actual fact require much more stringent measures. We demand not only that Parliament comply with its objectives but that the Commission do so too and release the money for lifelong learning so that it can be applied for. We also demand that the Council answer the question of why it talks in one breath about a knowledge-driven economy and, in the next, does not appropriate the resources needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are just two aspects that I want to highlight – one is vocational training and the other is mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with vocational training, and a brief account of an experience I had. An Italian policy-maker in the educational field was boasting to me about how his region produced more people with advanced school-leaving certificates than any other, so I asked him two questions – firstly, what all these people do with their qualifications, and secondly whether it was difficult to find tradesmen if, for example, you had something wrong with the wiring at home. Yes, he told me, both these things were major problems; many of these people were out of work or spending years ‘out of the action’ at university, and practical people, people who were skilled with their hands, were hard to come by in his part of the world. That is an example of the wrong-headed education policy that is pursued in many parts of Europe, where vocational training is seriously neglected, with the consequence that there are lots of young people out of work at the same time that there is a serious lack of skilled workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is mobility; it is a matter of complaint that only 1.5% of Europe’s workers are resident in a Member State other than their own. One very useful means of training them and updating their training would be for them to serve as apprentices and journeymen, a practice that goes back to the Middle Ages and should be revived. Socrates and Erasmus have injected life into Europe’s schools and universities with splendid success. Apprentices and vocational trainees, young professionals and people undergoing practical training still need much more to be done to get them on the move.</p>
<p class="contents">When, though, we see how negligently and half-heartedly the Commission has been preparing itself for 2006, the European Year of Mobility, and knowing as we do how much effort has been required on the part of the Committee on Budgets, and how difficult it has been, over the past few days, to extract even a mere EUR 4 million for this special initiative, it is clear that something is wrong here. No real initiative is in sight, unfortunately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It highlights a number of the problems that we are currently facing, which in my opinion is the correct approach. At the same time, however, I should like to state my opposition to the report as it presently stands, since it reduces education to nothing but a tool for economic growth, and ignores its value as a tool for personal growth. The latter interpretation of education has already gained acceptance once before in our history, thanks to Jan Ámos Komenský, the teacher of nations. This problem notwithstanding, however, I agree that education must be our priority, in particular with regard to the budgetary support referred to in paragraph 17.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to highlight the problems faced by young people. They are often provided with opportunities to gain an education, but find it difficult to engage in the education process, to find an appropriate career or to secure recognition of the education we offer them. As well as focusing our attention on young people, we must also change our approach to people of other ages. As I see it, education must be a lifelong right, obligation and requirement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It might even reflect a call by my Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who in 1997 launched his general election campaign with the mantra ‘education, education, education’. However, decisions on education must be made by the Member States. It is certainly not within the competence of the EU, despite the wish that it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of realism within this report is emphasised by the appeal for a 15% increase in the number of science graduates in the EU between now and 2010. This is unachievable because young scientists, once graduated, are emigrating in ever-increasing numbers, mainly to the United States. Even today the Commission’s own survey says 400 000 European science and technology graduates have emigrated to find jobs. Why is this? The answer is startlingly simple: endless EU regulation and red tape is smothering innovative businesses, leaving them with little choice but to relocate or close down.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context the report serves to highlight the fact that, irrespective of the level of investment made by the Member States in education and training, if businesses and industry have relocated due to suffocating regulation, the investment will not be returned. This report ignores the fact that, at the current rate of progress, the Lisbon objectives will not be reached. Attempts to prevent this failure, even by further EU misguidance, are doomed to fail.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said before, if the EU is the answer, it must have been a stupid question. You do not have to be a graduate to understand that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased to report that we in Slovakia respect this fact, and I am very pleased that there is a Commissioner from Slovakia in charge of this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Levels of education in our country are among the highest in the European Union. Our students already study two foreign languages as compulsory subjects at secondary level, and most university study programmes are of a five-year duration. Three-year bachelor programmes are offered in only some fields of study.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union, many students from Slovakia have taken advantage of the opportunities created by free movement and have pursued part of their education abroad, either within the framework of the Erasmus programme or through postgraduate studies. However, our students have had to confront a particular problem related to the free movement of persons. Because of the considerably higher cost of living abroad in comparison with Slovakia, most students who temporarily stay abroad must take a job. To be able to work, they need a work visa, with the exceptions of Ireland and the United Kingdom, since most countries have imposed a transitional period on our country that prevents the free movement of workers. Visas often limit the number of working hours to 20 per week, sometimes even less.</p>
<p class="contents">These restrictions frustrate the free movement of students. Tuition fees in universities sometimes amount to more than EUR 1 000. Because of the weaker economies of the new Member States, our students should be allowed to study and work at the same time, and we should therefore try to remove the administrative barriers to granting work or student visas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Society benefits on a great many levels from the promotion of education, and the Lisbon Strategy, the aim of which is to achieve a highly dynamic and competitive economy, highlights the fact that education plays a supporting role as a cornerstone or foundation stone. Since we are talking in such terms, I would have expected today’s report at the very least to set out interim goals and a strategic framework of objectives to be achieved en route to these goals, or in other words to provide a more readily comprehensible structure.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I am delighted that the report ‘stresses the crucial role of universities’, it does so in paragraph 21, which is the last but one paragraph and followed only by an instruction to the President to forward the resolution. Yet the recommendation that the ‘importance [of universities] be reinforced by strengthening synergies between European higher education, the European research area, European lifelong learning and the productive sector’ is of such significance that it may be regarded as a strategic priority. In view of the time I have available, it is obviously impossible for me to discuss every detail of these synergies, which could ultimately result in more modern universities and hence better university education. I should, however, like to highlight a number of points.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a well-known fact that research turns money into knowledge, and that innovation turns knowledge into money. Increasing university funding in an arbitrary fashion will not produce the desired outcome, however, and the involvement of universities in innovation is one of the crucial structural changes to which the European Union should lend its full support. Economic research has shown that cooperation between universities and business, the availability of capital for innovation and development and the promotion of public-private partnerships make a major contribution to a country’s overall innovation potential.</p>
<p class="contents">Such areas therefore provide ample scope for EU funds to be targeted meaningfully and effectively, thus acting as a driving force and catalyst for measures aimed at improving innovation potential. The quality of projects must be the deciding factor when granting access to such funds, rather than compliance with convoluted official requirements. Straightforward, flexible and transparent projects, together with the relevant legal requirements, are crucial if the modernisation of universities is to get off to a flying start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to achieve this goal, a widespread educational transformation must be set in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">In our increasingly materialistic and purely economy-based societies, it is not surprising that many policy makers have wrongly understood this transformation to mean mainly the mass production of first class economists, scientists and other professionals, and have accordingly given most weight to the achievement of this aim. I believe this to be profoundly wrong and I am particularly happy that Mr Bono also agrees with this in his excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">Not every child in our schools will grow to become an Einstein; neither would many of us like to live in a world full of Einsteins. We undoubtedly need a few fast-track academic achievers and we must give them every possible opportunity to reach their highest potential. However, in a humanistic, caring society we also need the ‘not-so-brilliant’ as well as the poor achievers. We must also care for them with equal zeal.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, many of our much-discussed educational systems are still unable to cope with those children that need extra help. They are unable to deal with the special needs of the physically disabled or those with learning difficulties such as dyslexia, which accounts for approximately 10% of our student population. Equally, they are unable to deal with the special needs of children from problematic socio-economic backgrounds and disturbed situations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not, therefore, surprising – but it is rather disturbing – that according to a UNESCO report in the mid-90s, more than 2 million Britons, Mr Beazley, were completely illiterate. This comes from a country which is known to have an educational system of a high standard.</p>

<p class="contents">The adoption of the European Youth Pact by the Heads of State or Government on 22 and 23 March 2005 is a development of particular importance for this sector. That is because, for the first time, common lines of action are being defined for all the Member States in important fields of European policy, such as employment and education.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this pact is to improve education, training, mobility, professional assimilation and the social integration of the young people of the European Union. Consequently, it is a basic precondition to safeguarding constant and viable development in Europe, given that young people are the future manpower and the future source of research capabilities, innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, it is necessary to apply the European Youth Pact, which is mandatory for the Member States, meaning that the Commission has to be informed of progress in the application of the pact within the framework of their annual reports to the European Commission on progress being made in national programmes to reform the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States should also bear in mind that 17.9% of unemployed are young people under 25 years of age. Consequently, the society of knowledge is the key to the success of Lisbon. Another proposal which would make it easier to achieve the Lisbon objectives is the convergence of the education systems of the 25. In this way, the quality of European education could be guaranteed and the Member States could plan more cohesive policies, in order to improve their performance in relation to the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, reducing the number of young people who leave school early and widening access to higher education are fundamental objectives which should be achieved by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, improving the foreign language skills of young people is an important requirement for the young people of Europe and contributes to the society of knowledge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, it contains many challenges to which Europe should rise.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that education and training should be focused on young people and job seekers. Teachers should not be overlooked, however, and more attention should be paid to their needs. Today’s young people are growing up in a world characterised by ruthless competition. In a society governed by money it is common for a lack of money to result in aggression and a range of disorders. The number of juvenile delinquents is increasing at an alarming rate. Teachers therefore have a very important part to play. In addition to their subject knowledge they require appropriate psychological training. That is why I believe that the Union’s educational programmes should not overlook the important issue of good quality teacher training.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue I should like to raise concerns the quality of higher education. Some of the subjects young people are studying are irrelevant to contemporary society. In many countries the educational system has still not responded to the challenges of globalisation, the world of the Internet and cutting edge technology. It is important to learn foreign languages, but teaching them should also involve raising awareness of cultural and religious differences, and also of differences in customs. All languages should have equal opportunity, and none should be discriminated against. We should teach tolerance of other skin colours, customs and religions. This is particularly important in connection with education for peace, as the declaration on educating societies in the spirit of peace states that: ‘just as wars begin in the minds of men, peace also begins in our minds’. This can only be brought about through an appropriate educational system based on teaching tolerance, openness, equality and knowledge about others.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s world, schools bear the main responsibility for the upbringing of young people. Textbooks ought therefore to be revised and any content likely to awaken hatred and aggression removed. It is important to teach respect, the joy of giving, sharing, altruism and how to help those weaker than ourselves. It is on these fundamental values that education in 21st century schools must be based. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we wish to achieve the goals set out in the Lisbon Strategy, or in other words the sustainable growth of a knowledge-based economy, more and better jobs, greater social cohesion and equal opportunities, we cannot afford to neglect one of the key factors in meeting these goals, namely human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Investment in education never goes to waste. My professional experience has shown me that good professional teachers are the main prerequisite for good teaching. In order to ensure that such teachers can hold their own in a knowledge-based society, they too must be provided with opportunities to undertake further education, above all in the field of information technology. Lifelong learning plays a key role in education, which is about much more than just schools. In order to achieve the Lisbon goals, it is essential that national strategies for lifelong learning and vocational training be drawn up, and that national reforms be placed in a European context. Adequate sources of funding must be made available in order to ensure that the majority of these demands can be met, and I should therefore like to add my voice to the calls for the EU to guarantee sufficient funding to cover the relevant costs. All EU Member States must continue to have access to the European Social Fund after 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Comparisons of individual education systems have revealed a great many astonishing findings. It would therefore be highly desirable to create further indicators in key areas or in areas that have lacked such indicators to date, such as languages, information and communication technologies, the effectiveness of investment and adult education. This would allow the performance and progress of individual education systems to be assessed. I should like to thank the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A special responsibility and mission has fallen to the universities of Lithuania and all EU Member States as we implement the Lisbon Strategy and strive for a European Union that is a knowledge-based, economic union for dynamic development.</p>
<p class="contents">For the EU’s universities to fulfil their mission and meet citizens’ expectations, it is necessary to raise the level of educational quality for colleges and universities, and develop academic research. Another equally important task is the education of society, so that it is ready to accept present-day challenges. Europeans live in a complicated social and political world; they aspire to plan their own lives; they have to live and work in conditions of cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity; and besides, they are expected to take an active part in society and decision-making. Our societies and citizens must understand that the idea that a university diploma is enough for one’s entire life is a thing of the past. Lifelong learning must become an important principle, and we must make a combined effort to strive for this vision, by implementing national programmes, with the active participation of Member States, and where necessary, with support and contributions from communities. After all, one of the goals of lifelong learning is to increase employment opportunities. Moreover, it is linked to an increase in innovation, economic modernisation and competitiveness, and this in turn increases the number of jobs and alters the character of work qualitatively. To achieve this goal it is necessary to change and adapt the means of education and learning, and it is very important that lifelong learning becomes all-encompassing, that is, that formal and informal ways of learning complement each other and are qualitatively cooperative, to allow the establishment of communities with advanced experience.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that the successful implementation of the Lisbon goal of lifelong learning depends very much on it being funded soundly and consistently, and this ought to be the responsibility of the entire EU and national governments. We must give priority to this goal and find sufficient funds in the new financial perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whether we refer to education as a cornerstone, or a central or key theme, it is obvious that without improved, higher-quality and more accessible education and training it will be impossible to develop suitable economic and social responses to the Lisbon Strategy or to the current problems of Europe or the Member States of the Union. I am convinced that education should be a central priority both here and – of course <span class="bold"></span> particularly in the policies of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me respond directly to just one comment concerning mobility and the 2006 European mobility year. In my opinion, the best way to contribute to increasing mobility would be to lift the moratorium on the movement of workers imposed on new Member States by many older members; the date of 1 May 2006, marking the first two-year initial period, would be the right time to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, lifelong education is neither a luxury nor a hobby; it is a necessity if people are to develop their abilities, digital literacy, language and other skills. The same goes for teachers, who transmit these abilities to their pupils. Lifelong learning should be applied as a principle, a policy, a strategy and a programme. On the one hand, we are concerned about insufficient progress towards achieving the results that we have agreed on with the Member States; on the other hand, there are encouraging signs that they can be attained. The Lisbon process, PISA studies and benchmarking also show good results, although on average they are not satisfactory. I want to state, however, that we cannot allow ourselves to drift towards ‘averageness’; we should rather strive for excellence, and look to the best examples. It is clear that European countries can be the best in the world in areas such as science, skills or literacy, and in many of the important preconditions for competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim, and also the solution, is to invest more in education, and to target investments more effectively. More effective investment is about reforms and adjustments – ones that are essential, reasonable and timely. Investing more is about the real need to strengthen the budgets of individual countries (some are setting a very good example), as well as the budget of the Union. I would like to thank you for these kinds of approach and for your support over the financial issues. I look forward to developing these types of policy and cooperation for the benefit of education in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
