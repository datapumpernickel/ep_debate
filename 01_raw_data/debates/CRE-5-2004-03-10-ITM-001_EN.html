<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roche,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – Mr President, I am very happy to address you today in relation to the preparations for the Spring European Council and the IGC follow-up.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will be aware from our detailed discussions on the Lisbon strategy at the last part-session, the Irish presidency is determined that the primary focus of the Spring European Council should be, as set out at Lisbon and Gothenburg, the follow-up to the Lisbon strategy with a strong emphasis on implementation and the need to target specific areas for concerted action by the Union. The future financial perspectives and current issues on the international agenda will also be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency has consistently reiterated the need for the Spring European Council to give a strong signal as to the continued importance of the Lisbon strategy in providing a framework for simultaneous progress on economic, social and environmental renewal throughout the Union. When I addressed Parliament last month, I outlined the issues on which we intend to focus at the Spring European Council on 25 and 26 March.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Member States share our conviction that the agenda for the European Council should remain focused, and have given broad support for our approach of concentrating on a limited number of key issues. Similarly, Member States have also agreed that the overreaching priorities for the Council should be those of sustainable growth and employment as identified by us in the first draft of the annotated agenda issued on 17 February.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication on the future financial perspectives – 'Building our Common Future' – was launched here on 10 February by Commission President Prodi. The presidency’s approach, which has been agreed by Member States, is that while no discussion is expected, the Spring European Council should agree conclusions on the procedure to be followed in considering the dossier over the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">The Taoiseach will present the Irish presidency’s report on where matters stand in the Intergovernmental Conference. It is intended that this will be discussed over dinner on the first evening by the Heads of State and Government. It is the presidency’s intention to invite representatives of observers at the IGC, including the President of the European Parliament, to be present. On the basis of our report and following discussions at the dinner, it will then be for the European Council to decide how best to proceed, and in particular whether the time is ripe for the IGC to be re-convened.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope you will understand that it is not appropriate for me at this time to go into any detail on what that report will contain. We have still not definitively concluded our analysis of the situation. Consultations and contacts are ongoing. The Taoiseach owes it to his colleagues to present matters to them in a very direct manner. However, I would offer the following observations.</p>
<p class="contents">In keeping with our mandate from Brussels in December, the Irish presidency has consulted widely among participants in the IGC, including the European Parliament. The Taoiseach has spoken with all other members of the European Council. Intensive and detailed discussions have also taken place at ministerial and official levels. Partners have agreed with us in good faith and in a positive and constructive way. As a result, we have a deeper appreciation of the concerns of all involved. We also have a greater understanding of where scope for compromise and possible agreements might lie.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had very useful and detailed discussions with Parliament’s representatives Mr Hänsch and Mr Brok. They have made clear to us Parliament’s general approach to the IGC, and its priorities in the negotiations. We very much appreciated the constructive and frank way they have dealt with us. More generally, Parliament’s strong support for our efforts is greatly appreciated. In particular, you have tried to keep us and partners focused on the big picture, on the immense prize which adoption of the Constitution would represent, and on the very significant and considerable dangers for our Union which would flow from a continued stalemate.</p>
<p class="contents">In our consultations, we have confirmed that there is a range of outstanding institutional and non-institutional issues, of varying complexity and sensitivity, which have been raised with us. Most of these were identified by the Italian presidency in the paper published ahead of the meeting of the European Council in December, though others are also on the table. We have gone through all of these questions carefully and in some significant detail. While there has been particular public focus on the institutional side of things, I can assure Parliament that our discussions with partners are not limited to those aspects of the draft Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Our broad sense is that, while there are a reasonable number of outstanding issues, on the great majority it will be relatively easy to find consensus in the context of a process leading to an overall conclusion. Moreover, we have ascertained that there are many other issues, including some of considerable importance, on which there is effectively already agreement – although formally nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Of course, the great bulk of the Convention’s text has not been called into question at any stage of the IGC, and I am glad to say that very much remains the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot say today whether it will be possible for the IGC to conclude its work during the Irish presidency. I can say this, however. If it were a matter for the Irish presidency we would resolve it. We have made it clear to this Parliament and we have made it clear in many statements that we are anxious and ambitious to achieve a resolution. It is also, however, very important to put it on the record that 25 Member States and 25 governments have a responsibility in this matter: it does not come down to the presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether it is decided to convene a further meeting of the IGC in the near future is very much a matter of judgment for the European Council. However, I can say, and I have said it several times, that if political will is present, it will be easy to find a solution to the outstanding issues. The key to early agreement is political willingness to agree.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now over two years since the European Convention began its work. The issues have been debated intensively and extensively. At this point, I do not believe that outstanding differences will become easier to resolve over time. I have said this on several occasions in the last week or two: the difficulties that exist today will be more difficult in the future. In the second half of this year it will not be any easier to resolve the issues. There is a whole series of other issues that will make it more complex. Parliament will change, the Commission will change, the political players will change and it would be unwise to take the view that we have time on our side.</p>
<p class="contents">There are important issues to be considered in the second half of this year. It is my strong belief that these are all better considered independently of each other and that is another reason why we should go for the earliest possible solution, because if the issues come together it will make resolution more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">I continue to believe that the new Constitution is profoundly in the interests of the Union and its citizens. It is a quantum leap forward in terms of clarity and accessibility. It will provide the Union with a solid foundation for its future growth and its future development. It will enable the Union to respond more effectively to the concerns of citizens and to play a more dynamic role in the wider world. In a sense it is a prize well worth striving for.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is a will to compromise – and let there be no doubt that without some compromise on all sides there will be no agreement – then I believe it should be possible to move things forward rapidly. As we have said before, if there is a serious possibility of progress, the Irish presidency will immediately move to seize that possibility.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock, Neil,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I regret the unavoidable absence of President Prodi but, as you know, he has official obligations elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the opportunity provided by the discussion this morning to draw attention to the importance of a satisfactory agreement on the proposed constitution. Obviously, the analysis made at Laeken still holds good and the enlarged Union still needs reform in order to ensure that it can work in the public interest with higher standards of efficiency and with greater democracy and transparency. This is plainly unfinished business, and, equally plainly, it must be tackled with determination. In the unique association of democracies that makes up the European Union careful deliberation is always necessary but no constructive interests are really served by prolonged stalemate. That is why the Commission fully supports the approach taken by the Irish presidency. Minister Roche's report is clear. The Commission is convinced that the presidency has done, and is still doing, exactly what is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">After the breakdown of the Brussels European Council, the only realistic course was to proceed in the way followed by the Irish presidency and to sound out the prospect for progress through bilateral consultations. It is an arduous course and no doubt Mr Roche and his colleagues have the air miles to prove it. However, our Irish colleagues have a true talent for promoting understanding – except, of course, where English rugby is concerned – and we hope that their diligent efforts will bear fruit and that the presidency report to the European Council will be able to conclude that all delegations are disposed to sign the constitutional treaty before the European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Such progress will require some willingness to revise original negotiating positions, but the Commission continues to believe that such developments are feasible and that the conclusion of a constitutional treaty can be achieved under the present presidency. As Mr Roche said on this issue – it is not always true in politics but it is in this case – time will not change the basics or make a resolution easier.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the factors which propels such a view is recognition of the reality that, if the IGC was not satisfactorily concluded this year, the prospects for establishing a constitution for the Union will begin to appear remote. The momentum provided by the Convention will then manifestly continue to diminish and, in the very nature of politics, debate about the Treaty will become entangled with other controversies, such as those which naturally and inevitably will, for instance, be associated with the financial perspectives. No democrat could, or would, fear the prospect of multiple debates, but clarity and rigour in all discussions would obviously be served best by ensuring that each salient issue is tackled on its own terms and merits.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the rational desire to conclude the IGC successfully and with reasonable dispatch should not deflect us from the course which Parliament and the Commission have followed on the content of the constitution. I am sure that the Commission reflects the majority opinion in this House by emphasising that the text drafted by the Convention should not be diluted.</p>
<p class="contents">We have all heard the maxim 'better no constitution than a bad constitution' and no sensible person could possibly disagree with that. But those can hardly be considered to be the sole true alternatives. The risk is surely not a bad constitution, since it is highly unlikely that the IGC would agree to something that was noxious or ineffectual. The real risk is rather that the Convention draft becomes amended to the point where, cumulatively, almost accidentally, the ambition and the attractiveness of the constitution dwindles and the singular opportunity of clarifying and developing the Union provided by drafting a constitution slips away. The representatives and, more importantly, the people of the European Union would then inherit problems rather than answers.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the basis for the constitution should continue to be the text presented by the Convention. Obviously, on some points, improvement is possible. For instance, debates in the months before the Brussels European Council showed that the fact that a proposed change attracts widespread support from Member States does not necessarily make it a move in the wrong direction, as some seemed to contend at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, in the Commission – and, I emphasise, explicitly in the interests of the Union – we were glad to note that most, if not all, delegations realised that making a distinction between voting and non-voting Commissioners would simply not work. We trust, therefore, that no variations on that impractical and divisive theme will reappear.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, Parliament, the Council, the Commission and everyone else has to continue to exercise care. For instance, the Italian presidency has helpfully made it clear that some of the texts circulating in the final hours of the December European Council – which some regarded as presidency compromises – have no formal status. Most of those suggestions would, as it happens, have been unacceptable to either the Commission or Parliament or, indeed, both. We are certain that the Irish presidency will, characteristically, show its own constructive sensitivity, regardless of the hour of the day or of the night.</p>
<p class="contents">The House is fully aware of the controversial issues that remain. The Commission has made it clear on many occasions that it holds the view that the compromise reached in the Convention on the 'double-hatted' status of an EU foreign affairs representative should not be changed, that the enhanced budget powers of the European Parliament should not be altered, that the scope of qualified majority voting should not be reduced. The Commission has also made clear its opinion, particularly when we are only weeks away from a European Union with 25 Member States, the practical case for an extension of qualified majority voting is stronger than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">On that particular point, the House will know that the Commission considers that the double-majority proposal of the Convention is the best approach for the definition of QMV. That also reflects practicality and proportionality. It is clear that full and necessary articulation of arguments will ensure that decision-making in the enlarged Union is never easy. To make effective agreement on necessary decisions even harder by fixing a QMV threshold which is so high that the focus is on forming blocking minorities rather than on reaching consensus would, however, be a formula for <span class="italic">stasis</span> and the Union as a whole could not benefit from that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's view continues to be that a double majority of 50% of the Member States representing 50% of the population would be both clear and balanced. However, the Commission accepted the Convention's compromise of 50% of Member States and 60% of population, although, I have to say, the Commission still believes that a 50% and 55% formulation would fit the purpose of effective decision-making still better.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever compromise is eventually reached, it is obvious that no one should forget that the draft constitution will need approval and ratification through the democratic processes of 25 Member States. An arrangement that increases complexity and intensifies the difficulties of making the enlarged European Union work well would hardly be likely to attract understanding or support in either parliaments or plebiscites. We are certain that the Presidency, the majority in this Parliament, and a wide spectrum of governmental and public opinion understands that.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish the Irish presidency well in its sustained efforts in the interests of a modern Union and its citizens.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin with a few words to the President-in-Office on behalf of my group to express our sincere appreciation and admiration of the way in which the Irish Government is conducting its presidency of the Council. It is working with goodwill, a strong sense of purpose, discretion and efficiency. I believe this is a good example of the way in which even our less populous countries can achieve major political progress. Mr President-in-Office, I emphatically welcome your statement that, if it were a matter for the Irish presidency, you would bring the Intergovernmental Conference to a successful conclusion during your tenure. This confirms our impression that your presidency is giving of its best.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that we warmly welcome the fact that things have started to move and that this movement extends to unresolved issues, particularly that of the double majority. For my own part, I have always urged the Government of Germany to be flexible and move forward. Since this is now happening, I must clearly acknowledge it. But these efforts by the German Government must be accompanied by similar efforts on the part of other governments. This is not the time or place to be apportioning blame for mistakes or for obstructive rigidity; the time has come for all governments to make compromises, and we call on them to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The stakes are high; the President of the Council spoke of dangers – that is how his words were translated into my language – and so it is important that we remind ourselves again of what we seek to achieve through this constitution. Our European values are described in the preamble, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The functions and responsibilities of the European Parliament are described in the draft constitution. Its provisions represent a huge leap forward for the European Parliament, democracy and parliamentarianism in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislative activity of the Council of Ministers is to become more transparent, even though we will not get the legislative council we have asked for. Under the Convention’s proposals, the Commission will be appointed in such a way, with the President of the Commission being proposed by the Heads of State or Government, that its composition will reflect the results of the European elections. This is truly great progress, because it would enable the people of the European Union to influence the nature of the Commission through the ballot box. While we are well aware that this is not yet applicable law, we advocate the introduction of such an arrangement in time for this year’s European elections. This would mean that, in proposing a President of the Commission, the Heads of State or Government would take account of the result of the European elections. This accords with democratic principles; it is a fair solution; it is not motivated by party-political considerations but is a matter of principle. Mr President-in-Office, when the nomination of a President of the Commission is discussed under your presidency, we urge you to take the outcome of the European elections into account in your deliberations.</p>
<p class="contents">We do need to call to mind the strenuous efforts that were made before the Convention’s proposal materialised. I should like to reiterate my thanks to the two representatives of Parliament, Klaus Hänsch and Elmar Brok, for their great work and, of course, to Valéry Giscard d’Estaing for his chairmanship of the Convention as well as to all those from our Parliament and from the national parliaments and governments who contributed to the final draft. This whole effort must not be allowed to end in failure now.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember very well how the President of the French Republic, as President of the European Council, explained the Treaty of Nice to us in December 2000 and how, in his response to our criticism of the outcome of the Nice Summit, he made a declaration of intent. The first step towards the creation of the Convention on the Future of Europe was taken when the French President agreed that there was a need to think about introducing a new method of reforming the EU, and the next was the Laeken decision and the work with which we are all familiar. That work must not be in vain.</p>
<p class="contents">From the first of May, we shall be a Community of 455 million people. We need clear and sound legal foundations for the European Union of the future, so that this whole structure can be held together. At the heart of the constitution are the means by which we can agree on common methods and peacefully resolve conflicts of interest and disputes. In short, the constitution is all about a peaceful future for our continent, and it is a project that must not be allowed to fail.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, I wish you every success and hope that you will harvest the fruits of these efforts before the end of your presidency.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the time has come to genuinely apply the principles of fraternity, solidarity and equality and to bring forward the European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Taoiseach</span> has taken up that task and I would suggest that the Irish Presidency – a country of poetry and literature – remember a phrase by a great European, a French citizen, who proposed a United States of Europe in the nineteenth century, Victor Hugo, who said: the future has many names. For the weak, unattainable. For the meek, unknown. But for the brave, opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that moment has come, because we must remember that, according to the Eurobarometer, enthusiasm for Europe is decreasing in almost all of our countries. Nevertheless, 78% of citizens are in favour of having a Constitution, including the British – 51%– which is interesting.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore appeal to the Spring European Council to renew the Intergovernmental Conference or, better still, to take the bull by the horns and for the Heads of State or Government to sit down to resolve the outstanding issues. That is what they should do if they really understand what an historic moment we are at.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issues that are still contentious, we should work on the premiss that our Union’s power must not lie in blocking decisions but in reaching decisions by majority. In this regard, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to express the support of my group – and specifically my Party – in order to unblock the situation in my country, in order to replace the cat-fighting method with constructive debate. It is truly an important step; to use the double majority and a weighting which allows us to move forward and to function.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue – above all fundamental to Parliament – is the scope of qualified majority voting and the balanced distribution of legislative power between Parliament and the Council, including budgetary power. There have been significant backward steps in the recent drafts of the Italian Presidency. And it is an issue of serious concern to us. I believe that Parliament should express its opinion clearly. We are not prepared for there to be a clear backward step because the Constitution is approved.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point dealt with in the informal meeting, as well as many others, which was held in Berlin amongst three countries is the creation of a person in charge of the economy in the Commission, a minister for coordination. Parliament had repeatedly argued that we needed responsible economic governance. We have a draft Constitution in which there is a Minister for Foreign Affairs but there is none for the economy. If we seriously want the Lisbon strategy to make progress, a strategy which creates employment and which also creates technological conditions for the future, we must give it a face. There is no reason why this cannot be subject to consideration and an amendment to the Constitution by the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the financial perspectives – which also continue to be a contentious issue – we support the Commission’s presentation of the proposal for the financial perspectives in accordance with its responsibilities and we cannot accept being haggled down, above all at a time of enlargement. Parliament could have said that it is in favour of 1.4% of GDP. We have accepted the Commission’s position, but we do not believe that haggling is a good sign for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, my group is clearly in agreement with taking account of the result of the European elections, on the basis that we all want to win them. In any event, however, there is a fundamental point: given the European political landscape, no party is going to have a hegemony and, if we apply parliamentary thinking when it comes to proposing the President of the Commission, we must be consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">In a parliamentary system, the important thing is the capacity to create majorities, and that is done according to a programme. Therefore, Mr Poettering, it makes no sense to issue vetoes prematurely. We are also prepared to win the elections and we are then prepared to create a progressive and Europeanist coalition. We will now have to see how prepared you are to do the same.</p>

Yet there is something a little strange in talking about the future of Europe when the draft constitution fashioned to facilitate that future languishes in Council. Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House welcome the intensive consultations undertaken by the presidency. Signs from most national capitals suggest that it should not be beyond the wit of our Member States to deliver a deal. President-in-Office, we urge you not to give up on your efforts to break the deadlock at the IGC and secure a constitution for Europe before the elections to this House in June.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank you, President-in-Office, for going off-script in your remarks. Your line that it is 'possible to find a consensus in the context of a process leading to a conclusion' is one of Sir Humphrey's finest. I am pleased to see that he is alive and well in Justus Lipsius.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">However, your line that the key to it all is political will is exactly right.</p>
<p class="contents">The potential problems of an EU of 25 are painfully clear. Without institutional reform this Union cannot function effectively. It is time to stop pretending that life will somehow go on if the IGC fails. Forget the infamous Polish slogan 'Nice or death'. For an enlarged Europe, Nice<span class="italic"> is</span> death.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the Commission's concern about tinkering with the draft constitution. Some of Europe's leaders are playing poker with the Union's future in the last chance saloon. It is time to show our cards: governments, people, parliamentarians alike. Do we demand a stronger, more credible Europe at home and abroad? Do we insist on integration where it is needed? Do we want the President of the Commission to be Europe's best and brightest, able to command support across party lines? Liberal Democrats and Reformers are in no doubt about our answers to these questions: yes, yes and yes!</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that the European left, which gave us the inspirational leadership of Jacques Delors, now seems to lack conviction about the future of our continent. Mr Poettering's platoon seems more concerned about making the next President of the Commission their political plaything than about the content of his or her programme. It is alright, Mr Poettering, for Wilfred Martens to claim that the PPE-DE is 'uncompromisingly pro-European': you look more like <span class="italic">uncomfortably</span> pro-European to me! Do you speak in the name of all of your Group, or just one part of it?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council also has to debate Europe's external relations. It should be recognised that without exception, Europe speaks more strongly in the world when it speaks with a single voice. That is why, President-in-Office, I make this appeal to you: last night, five of the nine British detainees at Guantanamo Bay were repatriated to the United Kingdom. Even as a British citizen, I see this less as a gain for Britain than as a loss for Europe. Because if the Council had pushed Europe's case over bilateral bargains, we might have had a more united and principled stand. We should have insisted on securing the release of all Europe's detainees from Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I challenge your presidency to stand up for our Union's values by speaking for Europe as a whole at the EU-US summit on the issue of the remaining Guantanamo Bay detainees.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to pull together now as a continent or we will fall apart. The pro-European forces in government and this House have to make their case with conviction, because we need a new constitution, a new credibility and a new self-confidence, and we need them now.</p>

I will of course reassure Commissioner Kinnock that the Commission’s document refrains from drawing such conclusions from the four years of the Lisbon strategy, but its circumlocutions and other understatements are eloquent testimony to its authors’ embarrassment at having to draw up this particular balance sheet.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the objectives that the EU set itself at Lisbon was full employment by 2010. How far have we got? Employment has proved pretty resistant, or so it appears from the report, which goes as far as to invent the piquant neologism of ‘delayed improvements in employment levels’, before admitting the bitter truth that, ‘in its first decline in ten years, the euro zone recorded a loss of some 200 000 jobs (in net terms) in 2003, and the unemployment rate should continue to rise slightly in 2004’.</p>
<p class="contents">At Lisbon, the EU also set itself the goal of becoming, by the same date, the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. What view does the Commission’s interim report take of that? Let me quote: ‘following the implementation of the Lisbon strategy, this has given rise to undeniable progress, instituting the transition needed towards a competitive economy characterized by growth, etc.’. Then come the facts in all their brutality. After four years of the Lisbon strategy, let me quote the Commission, ‘the percentage of young people dropping out of the school system without any qualifications was over 18% in 2003, 17.2% of young Europeans aged 15 do not have the minimum necessary skills (reading, writing, arithmetic)’. Those are the words of the Commission. This unsparing judgment is followed up by reference to ‘the decline in overall investment, in both the public and private sectors, to the detriment of the priority areas identified by the Lisbon strategy, such as research, innovation, education, and training’. Finally, the Commission’s report offers a new and bold definition of another of the Lisbon strategy’s key concepts: ‘the sustainable development approach is beginning to be taken into account in the definition of policies [...] it is thus that several Member States have embarked on reforms to their pension systems in order to face up to the problems of an ageing population’. If that is what sustainable development is, then the Council must surely be full of ecologists.</p>
<p class="contents">Having laboured and brought forth this diagnosis, the Commission offers its solutions: the free-market model is getting nowhere, long live the free-market model – or so its watchword appears to be. It thus sees it as ‘vital to maintain a strong-competition policy in the internal market’, going on to add that the Stability Pact must be adhered to, that it is necessary to press on with reforms to pensions and healthcare systems, that environmental policy must be made to pay, and even that the most profitable areas of education and training must be identified.</p>
<p class="contents">How bad, though, must the social and political crises brought about by this free-market ideology be before a glimmer of critical intelligence has the chance to make its presence felt in the EU’s corridors of power? All the evidence indicates that the only way of saving the European ideal is to make a clean break with this machinery for churning out human mess and despair. After the Spring Summit, it will be time to work towards a new spring for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the members of the Convention affixed their signatures to it, thereby declaring their consent to the Convention’s great draft Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday I asked President Giscard d’Estaing to release this board. My proposal is that it should be displayed in front of the next summit of Heads of State or Government, some of whom have completely forgotten that they sent their own personal representatives to take part in that constitutive process and that the signatures of those representatives attest to their having endorsed the result of the Convention’s deliberations. In addition, this might also make the Heads of State or Government remember what the Convention was and what it achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time we have two main problems. The first of these is that the Convention cannot defend its own draft and, with the Convention having completed its work, the European parliaments have lost the only place where they could coordinate their efforts and join forces to defend the parliamentary and democratic dimension of the constitutional provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second main problem, Mr President-in-Office, is that the Convention was public. The Intergovernmental Conference marks a reversion to those clandestine, discreet and conspiratorial gatherings of our imperial potentates, who presume to develop the European constitution in this feudal manner – a constitution which, by its very nature, is a parliamentary matter. It would therefore be good and seemly if governments were to show due respect to parliaments and to the authors of the draft constitution by ensuring that their deliberations are not governed entirely by one single motive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention had aims. Those aims related, quite simply, to democracy, effectiveness and Europe’s place in the world. What has driven the governments to formulate the 320 proposals of which we here have become aware? Only one motive: more power for the national governments. That is their one and only goal. All 320 proposals have but one common denominator: no more social Europe, no more democracy, no more fundamental civil and other rights, no more parliamentarianism, no more efforts to build an effective EU, but only more power for themselves. Whether that upsets the democratic balance, whether it is an affront to republican principles or disenfranchises parliaments, is of no consequence to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who is seriously concerned about this trend might recognise a second motive, namely nationalism. The entire Intergovernmental Conference is imbued with a spirit of nationalism that we no longer want to see in Europe, and this mixture of more power for governments and nationalism represents the greatest danger to our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">I marvel at the gentle patience of the honourable Members of this House. Every four weeks, we submit a petition in the form of a resolution: ‘Most gracious Intergovernmental Conference, we humbly beg that democracy might exist alongside the power of governments; we plead for fundamental rights, including civil rights; we beseech you to let parliamentarianism exist alongside the power of governments’. But we are not even successful supplicants, for they do not listen to us, and nothing changes. Five months! It took 105 people 16 months to develop a constitution for Europe, but it has taken 25 governments only five months to tear it to shreds.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, thank you for your patience. Perhaps you can help in some way to ensure that this board, which will have historic importance one day, is displayed on the wall in front of the Council. Let it serve as a reminder that the future of Europe is at stake.</p>

I also thank Commission Vice-President Kinnock for his congratulations and good wishes for Ireland winning the Triple Crown, particularly after their tremendous win at Twickenham last weekend.</p>
<p class="contents">The spring summit will focus on two primary issues: first, to move forward a raft of new EU legislative provisions to ensure that the European Union becomes more competitive; second, to assess the state of negotiations with regard to enacting a new European Union treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">A strong competitive and stable economy is essential in order to deliver sustainable growth and a better quality of life to the citizens of Europe. We must do more to advance the Lisbon strategy so as to ensure the Union becomes the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. In creating more and better quality jobs in Europe, we must implement a broad-ranging set of policies at EU level. We know that the internal market is said to have created over 2.5 million jobs within the last ten years alone. We must fully implement the Action for Growth initiative, which will bring about an increased level of investment in the European energy and transport networks. The Action for Growth initiative must also ensure that the research and development investment target of 3 % of GDP within the Union will be met by 2010. All new EU legislation must be subjected to strict tests for its impact on enterprise and competitiveness. The financial services action plan must be implemented so that there will be an integrated financial services market in the Union by 2005. A Community and patenting system must also be enacted within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union cannot become the most knowledge-based economy in the world unless it takes full advantage of the new and evolving information technologies. The e-Europe 2005 programme will seek to introduce a greater level of broadband to schools to guarantee access to high-speed Internet services and increase skills development for our young people. I firmly believe that the benefits of the information society must be spread to both urban and rural areas and to all regions within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, will present to this meeting an assessment as to the state of the negotiations with regard to the new EU treaty. Mr Ahern has accelerated the process of negotiation with other EU governments, in an effort to move quickly forward the discussions concerning the key bottom-line issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that we must put in place a new European Union treaty, if the European Union is to modernise and become more effective in a Community of 25 Member States. Enshrined within this process must be recognition of the role of smaller states, which must be protected within any new future institutional framework. It is never easy to broker an agreement and that is why it is taking time to enact a new European treaty. These negotiations should not detract from one particular fact, namely that the enlargement of the Union will take place on 1 May 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will recommend the voters politely to reject a Constitution that would give the EU legislative power in 15 new areas instead of limiting the EU to cross-border issues; that would abolish the right of veto in approximately 40 areas instead of giving the last word to voters and their elected representatives; and that would demand recognition of the EU Constitution’s priority over the national constitutions instead of respecting the Member States’ constitutions. We would especially warn against the prime ministers being able to alter the constitution without asking the voters.</p>
<p class="contents">Use the Brussels Summit to decide that the Constitution must be debated and voted on in referendums in all the EU countries before it can come into force. Why not have the draft Constitution subjected to advisory referendums at the same time as the elections to the European Parliament in June? We could then debate our possible common future jointly and choose representatives according to our view of the Constitution. We could then ourselves decide whether we wish to transfer more power from the voters and elected representatives in the Member States to EU officials and ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, a question: will the Presidency say what is happening regarding the secret negotiations concerning the Constitution? Who is involved; who is being excluded; and who, for example, was present in Berlin? Is the Presidency fully informed? Is there agreement as to a compromise draft that can be presented when Chirac thinks the time is ripe?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a brief question to Mr Watson: if the Treaty of Nice is death for enlargement, why, then, did the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party recommend it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can therefore draw the conclusion that these people are in favour of the idea of clarifying relations between the EU and its Member States, but there is certainly nothing more that we can learn from this.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, and following the statements just made by the Council and the Commission, as well as those made by Mr Giscard d'Estaing to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs yesterday, we can perceive the outlines of a federalist strategy, which I would regard as repugnant, and which can be described in the following terms. A principled compromise is announced just before the European elections; this makes a favourable impression on the electorate, who will go to the polls without having had any real debate on a written draft; finally, if the outcome of the elections appears to be sufficiently favourable to the advocates of a constitution, it is announced that these elections would be seen as equivalent to a consultation, and that such consultation made a referendum unnecessary. Paradoxically enough, this strategy would end up distorting democratic debate at the same time as it was declared that the old Monnet method had become obsolete for lack of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">The European elections cannot function as a substitute for a referendum; they combine far too many different issues and their results would be far too confusing to allow any message to be validly discerned from them. If the Heads of States really had, immediately prior to the European elections, agreed on a draft derived from the Convention’s version – which would be too rigid a model for an enlarged Europe, and something that I would not welcome – then the only way forward, in France at any rate, would be to call a referendum on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, I believe that the Irish presidency has been pursuing the right approach by probing for potential compromises in a host of bilateral talks.</p>
<p class="contents">With Mr Hänsch, Mr Duff and others, we have visited a great many other capitals over the past few months and have been given the impression that everyone wants the treaty to be concluded. Only on one particular point did it prove impossible to reach an agreement. It seems to me, however, that views have begun to converge and that those who stand in the way of the agreement are now fewer in number. For this reason, and because it will become more difficult as time goes on, the Irish presidency should be encouraged to propose at the summit on 25 March that an extraordinary summit be convened even before the first of May so that an agreement can be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">What we stand to lose if we cannot reach that agreement on the Constitutional Treaty is the chance to link enlargement with a more efficient European Union and to anchor the European Union to a bedrock of common values and transfer more power to the people, who would elect the President of the Commission through their vote in the European elections and, by virtue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, enjoy a wide range of legal entitlements and safeguards.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we must not jeopardise the achievement of this aim by perpetuating the myth that there is a crucial difference between the large Member States and the small ones. In all my 24 years as a Member of this House, I have never once experienced a vote in the Council or the European Parliament in which the representatives of the large Member States lined up against those of the small Member States. Voting is based on interests – whether countries produce wine or not, and so on. That is how things are, and this myth must not stand in the way of decisions. The Heads of Government must clearly acknowledge their responsibility for ensuring that this myth does not obstruct progress and must not use it as a pretext for stalling.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is why I wish to make this one point: with this draft constitution, we have a truly unique opportunity to bring the whole of our united Europe together on the basis of the equality of nations and governments. If this endeavour should fail, Europe will relapse into groups advancing at different speeds with all sorts of barriers between them – not overnight, but at a steady pace. Responsibility for taking this opportunity lies with the 25 Heads of State or Government, and they must accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by drawing a comparison with the present situation. In my country, the parliamentary assembly that met in St Paul’s Church in Frankfurt in 1848 adopted a democratic constitution that would have paved the way for a united democratic Germany, and that the King of Prussia declined to accept. We are all well aware of the consequences of his decision for my country and for Europe. Today’s monarchs are the Heads of State or Government. I hope that they will not make the same fateful error that the King of Prussia committed in 1848.</p>

You see, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we all appreciate – I think I speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which has discussed this a great deal in recent weeks – the determination and delicacy with which the Irish Presidency is acting. It is a fact, though, that we have been in darkness for three months. Following the strong element of transparency provided by the Convention for 16 months, we are now in the dark. You talked of a range of important issues, both institutional and non-institutional, which have been raised with the Irish Presidency. What issues? Raised by whom? By how many and which governments? We do not know. You used – and I also acknowledge this – a confident tone, and said that it will be relatively easy to find consensus over the vast majority of outstanding issues. We can only try to guess at these. With regard to the most well-known issues, the only ones which have been openly discussed, we set great store by what Mr Giscard d'Estaing said yesterday to our committee: on no account may the double majority criterion be called into question for the calculation of qualified majorities. Furthermore, Mr Giscard d'Estaing called for us not to ‘torture’, on the one hand, the double majority figures, and on the other, the range of subjects for which decisions can be made by qualified majority. In this regard, I would like to reaffirm, since you spoke of papers presented by the Italian Presidency ahead of the December Council, that those documents, in our opinion, contain serious reversals precisely in this respect, and are therefore not acceptable to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, you were absolutely right when you claimed that the key to early agreement is political will. We hope that an awareness of the importance and gravity of this time for the Union will prevail among the Heads of State or Government at the forthcoming summit: not adopting the Constitution would amount to a real leap in the dark for the European Union. Nevertheless, if the path to the Constitution should still appear blocked during the occasion of the forthcoming summit, with all the consequences that we can easily imagine, the positions and responsibilities of the individual governments must in that case be clear to Parliament and to the citizens.</p>

Firstly, as regards the qualified majority formula, we need to raise the number of states needed to form a majority, while at the same time raising the population threshold needed to form a blocking minority. That should please the smaller states and not frighten those larger states which are genuinely committed to making it simpler for the Council to reach a decision. The sensible equation which seems to be commanding greater support is 55-55.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the IGC needs to drop from the constitution a specific number for the size of the Commission, a college which needs to grow and shrink according to supply and demand like any national administration. We should also drop the principle of equal rotation. Frankly, having a Commission without a representative from France would be fairly implausible. Mr Giscard d'Estaing himself concedes that the Convention's formula for the Commission was not the most glorious of our many achievements, and Commissioner Kinnock agrees.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the IGC should be convened at summit level, preferably before 1 May, to enable a genuine political debate with a European dimension to be held. So far, unfortunately, this has simply not taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and finally, our leaders need to find the moral courage to shape Europe politically. If they fail to do so they will be consigned to history as foolish cowards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why it is crucial to revise the policies responsible for this situation, and consequently the Commission and the Council need to clarify three issues that I believe are fundamental and require immediate resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, are these institutions willing straightaway to set about making the necessary adjustments to the economic and monetary policy guidelines, with the aim of replacing the Stability Pact with a Social Progress and Employment Pact, in line with the aims of full employment, economic development and economic and social cohesion, in order to guarantee further public investment, more and better employment and greater social inclusion?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, are they going to ask the European Central Bank to reduce interest rates in order to support economic growth and exports, a key issue for countries with weaker economies such as Portugal?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: are they going to approve a moratorium on liberalisations, review the Lisbon Strategy and undertake an in-depth study of the consequences of what has already been implemented in the various economic and social sectors, specifically in terms of employment, the quality and universality of service provided, the degree of user satisfaction and in terms of extending the democratisation of the operation and management of services, without overlooking the problems and shortcomings in most enlargement countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Unless these measures are adopted, it will be impossible to implement a policy to boost the economy and to sustain demand in the short- and medium-term. What is needed, therefore, is a re-evaluation of production and labour with a view to promoting economic development, employment and social cohesion, based on a steady increase in national and Community public investment, particularly in basic infrastructures, in education, in qualifications and vocational training, in research and innovation, in the environment and in support for small- and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

Europe has always been a source of hope for its citizens; even the governments, regularly failing to solve problems, point to Europe as the place where solutions can be found. Today, however, Europe instils fear in people. Unemployment is rising and people fear that this will get worse after the enlargement. The Member States, whether they are large or small, cannot handle this problem on their own. Decisions need to be taken at European level in order to promote real economic recovery and a real increase in the level of employment. At the same time, the Member States must in that way provide an efficient answer to globalisation. That is why it is their plain and simple duty to ensure that a constitution is adopted. It is not difficult to explain to 14-year olds or 70-year-old pensioners that we need a constitution, so why is it so difficult for our Heads of Government to brace themselves to put this constitution into practice? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This shows us clearly that it would be a mistake to end the system of rotating the Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I also appreciate Mr Barón Crespo’s quotation from Victor Hugo, saying ‘the future belongs to the brave’. I often compare the process of European integration with the epic poem on the discoveries, in which the great sixteenth century Portuguese poet, Camões, said that we were sailing ‘on hitherto uncharted waters’. We must indeed maintain this openness of spirit, this daring and this capacity for adventure.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to take care to ensure that the ship does not run aground; we must ensure that the crew is informed and motivated and does not start a mutiny. I am therefore concerned to see that, following a period of some secrecy, it should be announced that the IGC might be concluded hastily. This could be a life-saver for those who wish to base their campaign in the European elections on euro-scepticism, because public opinion is barely interested at the moment and we still do not know precisely what was put forward in the first phase of the IGC under the Italian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people have spoken about the issue of qualified majority voting, but I would remind you that this was not the only matter discussed. Also on the table were the composition of the Commission, the issue of the Union’s Presidency, defining certain competences, in the field of fisheries and marine resources, for example, the fundamental principle of the equality of States, clarifying the precise scope of the principle of the primacy of Community law, transparency and openness in the Council’s legislative workings and deliberations, the preamble and the express reference to the legacy of Christianity and the limitation on the flexibility or <span class="italic">passerelle</span> clauses. In other words, the agenda is enormous and I therefore support and understand the words of the President of the Portuguese Republic, whose pro-European feelings are well known, calling a week ago for more time to allow the negotiations on the European Constitution to take place. He criticised the fact that things are being done under pressure, called for more time and asked us to concentrate on the immediate problems such as the Lisbon Strategy, enlargement and negotiations on the new Community support framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, however, like to take this opportunity to refer to an emergency very close to our hearts as Radical Members, and for which my colleague, Mr Dupuis, has been on hunger strike for over 30 days. We consider it to be an emergency for Europe’s present, one which unfortunately, was not an emergency for Europe’s recent past. I would like to turn once more, Mr President—in—Office of the Council, Commissioners, to the Chechen question. This debate is certainly important for the future and for the institutions, but if we let the present go by, the horrors of the present, we will lose credibility when we want to construct a different future. Well, Mr President, Mr President—in—Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows – but no one reacted – over the course of recent weeks, the Russian authorities organised, using the puppet government in Chechnya as a cover, a series of about 30 arrests of relatives of Umar Khambiev, Chechen Minister for Health and emissary of President-elect, Aslan Maskhadov. His brother Magomed<span class="italic">,</span> Minister for Defence, gave himself up to avoid further bloodshed.</p>
<p class="contents">Starting on 29 February, in dramatic raids, dozens of masked armed men from Russian forces and Chechen militia surrounded villages, entered houses, hit, insulted and threatened to kill members of the Khambiev family to the last; they abducted and took away those members of the Khambiev family that they managed to find there. There has been no further news of them. Seven hundred men arrived in armoured vehicles in Benoi, the village of birth of the Khambievs, and having beaten the inhabitants and destroyed everything they could destroy, they kidnapped seven people and demanded that Umar and Magomed surrender.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening in Europe – and Parliament has repeatedly spoken out in this regard, from a humanitarian and at times even political point of view – must form part of our political present. Concern has already been expressed even by the US administration. In accordance with the Geneva Conventions, we are calling for the Red Cross to be authorised to visit the Khambiev family and the Minister for Defence, Mr Khambiev. These Geneva Conventions should be observed, Mr President. We are going to put a question to the Council straightaway, but I think it is our duty to at least react to these methods. Not just with radical non-violence but also by means of European political presence and compliance with the Geneva Conventions. We achieved this even for Saddam Hussein, who received a visit from the Red Cross; it is inconceivable that we cannot even achieve this in this case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What official business could be more important than this debate this morning? Perhaps we could have an answer before the end of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin by welcoming the moves made by the Irish presidency so far towards garnering consensus for the draft Constitutional Treaty. In recent weeks a number of positive indicators have suggested an increased willingness on the part of Member States to agree a workable compromise. Outstanding differences of opinion need to be ironed out in a committed and systematic way to break the remaining deadlock.</p>
<p class="contents">Minister Roche and, indeed, the Taoiseach, have my wholehearted support in rising to the difficult task ahead of them in the months leading up to enlargement and the European elections. A simplified single Treaty will make the EU of 25 more intelligible to the citizens of Europe by defining the EU and Member States' competences clearly. It will introduce reforms that streamline the workings of the EU and will facilitate decision-making in an enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally and very importantly, it will also help to dispel the many myths that have grown up. Primary among these myths is the one about the draft Treaty leading to the creation of a so-called super-state. An entity that cannot raise taxes autonomously, is not authorised to run budget deficits, has no right to raise a military force and, most importantly, cannot act outside the competences given to it by the Member States is not a recipe for a super-state by any stretch of the imagination. The EU can only spend a maximum of 1.2% of the combined GDP of all its Member States. Compare this to the only super-state in the world today – the United States – the federal government of which spends 20% of GDP, and you can see what a nonsense this accusation is.</p>
<p class="contents">The Constitutional Treaty is a voluntary agreement made between consenting governments whose national parliaments would, under its terms, in fact be given stronger roles with regard to scrutiny of the Commission's legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The foremost achievement of the European project to date has been to put an end to the rivalry and antagonism of the last century that pushed this continent into two world wars, which cost 56 million lives. The recent conflagration in the Balkans highlights the latent potential for destruction. We should have the courage to use our experience and our position in the world to promote peace and stability in the global arena and to treat the problems of displacement and terrorism at source, for example by helping to ensure an economic future for the millions of young people living in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the President-in-Office what stage has been reached in meeting the Lisbon commitments. This is on the IGC agenda as well, but so far all we have heard about is a European Commission action plan for enterprise – which received a very lukewarm reception indeed and was accused of lacking focus and tangible recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would end by saying to the President-in-Office that the jury is out, the ball is in his court and that he has all our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Council in Italy looked foolish when it failed to dispose of the narrow-minded national interest and to opt for a more democratic, efficient and transparent Europe. Many wonder whether the Council will make the same mistake again.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the Irish Presidency has already done a great deal of work over the past couple of months. There is willingness to reach agreement; very tentatively, things are moving in Europe. I would urge the Irish Presidency to tread carefully, for another failure would be disastrous for the confidence among the European electorate as it heads for the ballot boxes in June. If the Heads of Government drop another clanger this time, it will be impossible to convince the European electorate of Europe's power.</p>
<p class="contents">In this light, it is preferable to wait a little longer than not to have a constitution at all. I would stress here once again that the text should actually benefit Europe. Let us not produce another insignificant document, as happened at the meeting of Heads of Government in Nice in 2000. The European Convention's draft Constitution was good news for Europe and its citizens. It provides for a more democratic, understandable and, above all, decisive Europe. That is why we should adhere to those proposals as closely as possible, without detracting from the rights of the European Parliament, without resorting to back-room politics and without any loss of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of one Commissioner per country should be accepted, the defence agreement of Naples must be utilised, and social Europe must be reinforced. I would therefore urge the Heads of Government, this time round, to produce a meaningful document, rather than an insignificant one. I take the view that if a constitution is not forthcoming, the Heads of Government will throw Europe into crisis, further enlargement will be made impossible and the financial problems will become insoluble. For them and for Europe, this is a decisive moment. The Irish Presidency is working in a way that instils much confidence in this House, and I wish it every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To me, one who has always been a European, it gives the opportunity to bring the point home that Europeans have now had enough of a Europe that is essentially economic and financial, one that all too often, for the sake of the free market and of competitiveness, sacrifices jobs and ignores the day-to-day problems faced by the public; so I join with them, the people, this morning, in recalling the dream of Europe’s founding fathers, the dream of building a Europe of peace, culture, diversity, social security and citizenship in freedom and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifty years on, the Europe in which we live is certainly economically strong – for some – but it has neither heart nor breath of life, believes in nothing and is too full of injustice. We are having what we call a spring summit, we are on the threshold of enlargement, a new Intergovernmental Conference is about to be held, and there is very little in the budget, yet I still want to believe that there is still time to set a new course.</p>
<p class="contents">Having been at first a rather euphoric European, and having now become, after fifteen years in the European Parliament, a more realistic, more critical, not to say more uneasy one, I wanted to use my two minutes to shout, ‘Look out! Danger ahead!’ If it took fifty years to build the European Union that we have now, there is no small risk that we will one day see the structure implode for lack of sufficient popular support or of any ambitious vision of society, through failure to give priority to jobs, to respect for national and regional differences, and in the absence of any real solidarity. It is the richest, rather than the poorest, who must pay for the most disadvantaged. A European constitution is not an objective in itself; it is meaningless unless it meets the public’s expectations, and this morning, I have reminded you of what – in my view – their essential expectations are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will be delighted if Ireland is able to achieve this, not only because Ireland is a Celtic country like my own, Galicia, but also because this would show, once again, that it is one of the Union’s great pro-European countries. As a Member for one of Europe’s stateless nations, and one that is not even recognised as such, I have reservations about this draft Constitution arising from the shortcomings in cohesion policy and from the weakness of the positions we have adopted on our role in preserving peace in the world. I have confidence, however, in the direction the European Union has taken historically, which is unequivocally in favour of diversity with solidarity, in contrast with the uniform approach of the Jacobin States that today prevails in the State of which I am a citizen.</p>

What does the Commission stand for? What have we achieved here in Parliament? Not very much; we still have peace – if we disregard the latest outbreaks of civil war. We have made little progress on democracy. I believe there is a huge problem with the legitimacy of this Union, and what has happened in recent months seems symptomatic of further disintegration processes rather than of integration.</p>
<p class="contents">This is dangerous, but I need hardly say that it is also dangerous for us to hide behind the illusion that we in Parliament are the free voices in the institutional structure. We should know better, for we saw, when Nice was being discussed, how the party leaders coaxed and cajoled the supposedly free Members of Parliament. Here in the House we also suffer time and again from the way in which Stalinist instincts in the Socialist Group, which frequently takes the unwarranted liberty of calling itself Social Democratic, lead to repeated logjams. This will have to change, not only here in Parliament but elsewhere too, and particularly in the Council. There can be no democracy without transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the constitutional debate, France and Germany hold forth about the need to move Europe forward, but they are the very ones who have persistently ignored the common ground rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The effects of such behaviour are, in my opinion, fatal. When Jacques Chirac speaks of an advance guard and outlines the notion of a two-speed Europe, that in itself is not the end of the world. The Schengen Agreement and the euro have already established the principle of differing speeds. The real tragedy is that friction has been generated. This will not help Europe to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The prospects for the draft Constitutional Treaty have not become any brighter. The negotiations on the EU budget may well pose the threat of some sort of linkage between the constitution and the financial framework. I can only recommend vigilance.</p>
<p class="contents">The substance of the draft Constitutional Treaty is a mixture of good ideas that would bring progress and, alas, questionable features such as pre-programmed conflicts of authority, which are destined to occur, for example, in the field of foreign policy between the future EU Foreign Minister and the President of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time that the EU prepared itself for a larger Community. It smacks of absolutism, in my view, to proscribe the discussion of constitutional matters by the Heads of State or Government. I refuse to treat these Heads of Government as if they were the insurgent rebels of Europe. At the same time, these leaders must not be allowed to forget that they sent representatives to the Convention.

What do they ask us about? Most of all, they ask us about the role of the European Union. What does it do? How is it run and by whom? What they ask of us is clarity in decision-making, precision and comprehensibility in the division of its competences. Seeking closer identification with the European Union and with its actors, they would also like Europe to be closer to them and to care more about their future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention has done even more than to outline the face of the new Europe; by specifying its competences and putting faces to decisions, it has fashioned the European Union’s body. It has created essential linkages that will enable our political design to progress. I believe it needs to be said, and repeated, that the draft constitution produced by the Convention under the former French President, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, is a good one. What makes it the best of compromises is the fact that, rather than aiming to combine national institutions, it proposes a wholly new structure, one that makes for greater effectiveness and clarity and is in line with modern thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it regrettable that last December saw a triumph for introversion, for individual interests, for the self-centredness of the nation states. What place is there for the European public in this masquerade? Above all, as this House had said, the Intergovernmental Conference is a thing of the past. The Convention, a novel form of institution, was a gamble that paid off, even demonstrating that the intergovernmental method is no longer suited to the modern-day needs of the EU. The way the IGC works reflects a former ambition that left no room for the real European designs, the one that gives us a glimpse of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is changing its nature before our very eyes. The debates between those, on the one hand, who favour an intergovernmental approach, and on the other, the proponents of federalism, bear no relation to the realities of the EU. The draft constitution embodies realism and modernity precisely because it bridges the divisions of the past that prevent us, today, from driving the European project forward. It gives Europe’s citizens more power. Let me conclude by saying that our House will respond to this blockage by standing firm, by seeing to it that we get a modern constitution, one that enables Europe to act, that makes it visible and gives it credibility. I wish the Irish presidency every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By failing to adopt the Constitutional Treaty, at best we run the risk of a restrained, weak Europe, unable to act in political terms and to be a protagonist on the international stage, and at worst, the political collapse of the Union, that is, a dangerous step backwards with regard to the significant progress made in recent years. This is why I am convinced that the Irish Government’s action, unobtrusive but effective, should be supported. We certainly need to be quick, and sign the Treaty before the European Parliament elections, but we absolutely must do things properly too, as Mr Giscard d'Estaing said yesterday to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. In short, we cannot accept watered-down compromises which thwart the precious work of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right to resume the process on the basis of the achievements of the Italian Presidency, which in any case managed to obtain the consensus of all the countries involved on 90% of the proposed text. Now we need to make an additional effort to rise above the obstacles which concern, above all, qualified majority voting. The question is, however, not just formal or technical: the real problem we need to overcome is selfishness in some quarters, which in any case must be addressed. We need to discuss this, but if we want Europe to be strong politically and to be a leader in the peace initiative, this selfishness must be overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">One final remark, Mr President—in-Office of the Council: we should not forget to include a clear reference to Europe’s Judeo-Christian roots in the preamble.

Yesterday, Mr President-in-Office, I handed over to you more than 10 000 signatures of people in my constituency who are petitioning for the inclusion of a reference to the Christian heritage of Europe in the preamble to the Treaty. Quite frankly, any building that is not constructed on firm foundations will ultimately be doomed to collapse. We must not build Europe on weak foundations but on the common basis that incorporates the heritage of our continent. The people of my constituency have great faith in the Irish presidency and are confident that you will yet be able to present proposals for the inclusion of such a reference in the preamble.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to say a few words about the competitiveness of the European Union, because it is a subject that will receive special treatment at the spring summit, and I should like to address my appeal to the Commission in particular. It is not sufficient to organise a summit on competitiveness once a year, and then consider the matter closed, when, throughout the year, we are inundated with proposals that would make Europe less competitive, of which the legislative and policy proposal on chemicals is but one example. This proposal is designed to de-industrialise the European Union. The Commission must be in no doubt about that. Withdraw it, and you will be contributing to a more competitive Europe. The same applies to advertising restrictions. I could name many other directives too. What I would suggest is that the Commission should declare its willingness to withdraw the ten worst proposals for directives. That would greatly enhance the competitiveness of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second point I should like to raise, namely that the Member States must honour the commitments they make. I myself come from a country whose government, even though it has been told for years what it needs to do, has done nothing in years to free up the labour market and create a more competitive economy. This is where there is also a need to reflect on ways of exercising stricter control to ensure that the Member States actually fulfil their obligations. Then we shall achieve growth and employment throughout Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who seek to retreat from the draft produced by the Convention are snubbing their own representatives and showing contempt for the members of the national parliaments and hence the people of their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A total of 84 out of the 105 members of the Convention were representatives of the national parliaments and of the Heads of Government: this demonstrates anew how closely the Member States are involved in the consultation and decision-making processes of the European Union. We want this constitution, we need it, and we demand that an agreement be reached before the first of May.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me move on to the second point, Lisbon, and say that the Lisbon strategy is the programme for the implementation of the European model of an environmentally and socially responsible market economy. It is not the sole purpose of the spring summit to emphasise vigorously every year that the Lisbon Declaration is still valid, despite the lack of commitment and political will to implement its provisions. This commitment and will are lacking among the national governments, which are equipped with the necessary instruments, but they are also lacking within the Commission, whose preparation and monitoring of the spring summit ranges from sloppy to unsatisfactory. The summit must not degenerate into a talking shop. It must supply straight answers to people’s questions about growth and employment as well as social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I demand a concrete innovation and investment pact for the promotion of competitiveness, growth and social cohesion. This pact should prescribe exactly who should take what action and achieve which targets by when.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect the Commission to make this pact, along with the adopted projects, the basis of the policy that underlies its financial planning. We need a public discussion, a public debate, on the level of compliance with this innovation and investment pact, analogous to the discussion on observance of the Stability and Growth Pact. Failure to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact obstructs the effort to achieve the Lisbon objectives, and the non-compliant countries – France and Germany, along with Belgium – are also trailing furthest behind in the transposition of the directives on the single market. So let us not play off the one against the other, but rather let us do what we have to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Speaking on behalf of the French delegation within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and joining with the great majority of my fellow MEPs, from whom you have already heard, what I ask of the forthcoming Brussels European Council is that it should demonstrate its determination, in political terms, to overcome difficulties which, whilst important, are still secondary to what is really at stake: making the unification of our continent a political, economic and social triumph. It is absolutely vital that the draft constitution put before us by the Convention, the exceptional success of which we can see today in the light of the difficulties the IGC had with it, should be adopted with the minimum possible delay. That is our message to the Irish presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Lisbon objectives, which are ambitious but realistic, necessarily involve putting in place proactive policies enabling us to compete with our trading partners, first among them the United States and Japan, in the strategic areas of research and development, education, and lifelong training. Let us therefore implement these necessary reforms and overcome our fruitless divisions in order to make Europe a success on every front.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s citizens will be summoned to the polls in June to elect their MEPs, and they expect more of the European Union than is often articulated. They are relying on us to make it possible for them to live harmoniously beyond their own borders, to work freely and as much as they want, and to save them from being swamped by forms and pointless taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Spring European Council is certainly not the culmination of European history, it could well be a key staging post on the way to the speedy adoption of a Constitution and as we progress towards putting in place the economic and trading frameworks that are indispensable if Europe is, at last, to enjoy growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The implementation of internal market legislation at national level is an absolute precondition for achieving the Lisbon objectives. An increase in the implementation deficit will cause EU markets to splinter and erode the benefits of the internal market. An accusing finger cannot just be pointed at the inertia of the Member States in the implementation of the Lisbon objectives. The work of the Competitiveness Council has to be made more effective and it must return to a fundamental question: what impact will each drafted law have on the EU’s competitiveness? It is also time for some spring-cleaning in the Commission. At present the Commissioners are very torn on their directives. The drafting of the chemicals package was a good example of this. EU competitiveness will not improve with laws like these. On the contrary, it will become seriously endangered. Next autumn a Competitiveness Council Commissioners’ portfolio is to be established in the Commission. Its task will specifically be to finalise the Lisbon objectives and coordinate and harmonise the work of the Commissioners for Industry, the Environment and Employment. Competitiveness and a healthy Europe are not a Utopian dream. New magic remedies are not required. The medication exists: it was discovered in the spring of 2000 in Lisbon. Countries just have to do what they said they would. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been reading about the Spanish and Polish Governments possibly shifting their positions, with similar reports about the German Government. The UK press is now saying that Mr Blair and Mr Berlusconi are writing joint letters together – there's friendship for you! – and now we understand that Mr Blair is travelling to Dublin tomorrow for talks with the Taoiseach. As Mr Napoletano said earlier in the debate, it is all very frustrating and unclear for those of us who are outside.</p>
<p class="contents">All this underlines the importance of restating the demand for democratic legitimacy, something which was conceded by Vice-President Kinnock in the course of his address. I see that as coming through the process of a referendum. Mr Barón Crespo told us that 51% of UK citizens want this Constitution. I might doubt that but, unlike his Labour allies, I am very happy to have the matter tested in a referendum. I can tell you, Mr President, that more than 80% of people in my country agree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will restrict my remarks to the latter issue, as I consider it to be crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has been the mainstay of federalist policy, as acknowledged by the President-in-Office, whose prudence and perseverance we welcomed also today. We also agree with his concerns: time is against the Constitutional Treaty. In fact, we are at an historic turning point and not just because the reunification of Europe makes a constitutional charter both more difficult and more necessary, but also because the next Parliament will see a significant generational replacement of the parliamentary groups which created the European Community. Europe’s future would be threatened by deadlock in the Intergovernmental Conference, and another failure, instead of ending the democratic deficit, would increase the danger of there being a democracy with no voters, threatened by populism. A failure would also be a negative signal for the objective of making Europe’s economy more competitive, since this objective calls for greater economic integration, greater social cohesion and greater democratic transparency. Nevertheless, we agree with Mr Kinnock: better no Constitution than a Treaty which does not live up to the Convention proposal. We would therefore call on the Council, through its decisions, to rekindle enthusiasm for a more democratic Europe, united in its diversity and capable of having a common foreign and defence policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall begin with the Lisbon Strategy. The bulk of the debate was on the IGC, and I shall return to that. Mr Watson made a very interesting link between the future prospects for Europe and the new Constitution. He suggested that we should move in tandem in both cases. He is right. Mr Watson and Mr Collins also made a very clear point about the importance of the Lisbon Strategy and the need to keep Lisbon to the fore. Again, they are right. Mrs Sudre has just made a very interesting point about the significance of the strategy in terms of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spring European Council and the Lisbon Strategy are key priorities of the Irish presidency, and we look forward to a successful and focussed debate on the vital questions regarding the future economic, social and environmental development of the Union. It is interesting that many of the key issues raised during the debate are ones we have indicated in our preparation and on which we have decided to focus. Our strategy approaching the Lisbon discussion has been to limit the number of areas, and to focus on these in order to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I was intrigued by all the comments made on the Intergovernmental Conference and the Constitutional Treaty. The views of the clear and overwhelming majority of this House confirm to me the urgency of the task at hand. Mr Duff kindly drew my attention to a motion that is being prepared for adoption by the House. As Mr Barón Crespo reminded us, the recent Eurobarometer poll shows that the people of Europe want a Constitutional Treaty. That is a very significant poll. I note that there are variations in the level of support for the Constitutional Treaty, but the fact that the people want a Constitutional Treaty is something that should weigh heavily in all our considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">My good friend and fellow member of the Convention, Mr Voggenhuber, can rest assured that I well remember the day at the Convention when we chinked glasses, listened to the Ode to Joy and all signed a very large postcard. I must say that I do not recognise the rather negative characterisation of the Constitution by another good friend – Mr Bonde. I agree with Mrs Doyle, who was much closer to the mark, that this Constitution certainly does not pave the way for some super-state.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already mentioned, I am not in a position today to go into greater depth on the issues. I fully understand Members' frustration. However, Members understand equally fully that negotiations are at a stage at which it is impossible to be more detailed than we have been. We have entered into discussions in confidence with Member States. We understand fully that people belong to different States and have different views. The presidency's job is to try and create a space in which people can come together to negotiate and align those views.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore understand the frustration at there not having been more detail, and would also confirm that the presidency is anxious to seize any opportunity that exists. We note that there have been changes in attitudes in recent times. Mr Poettering's analysis, for example, was very interesting and he is quite correct that it is critically important to keep the momentum going. It would be a disaster for that momentum to be lost.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Brok was also correct. Everybody now says that they want a Constitution, but one of the frustrations of being in the presidency is that everyone says they want to achieve success but this is always qualified with a 'but'. Mr van den Berg also made a very interesting point. He said that the presidency must bear in mind that a second unsuccessful rendezvous would be a disaster. He is quite correct and we must balance all these issues as we move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Members – particularly Mr Napoletano – have made the point about detail. He has spoken with me on more than one occasion about the outstanding issues.</p>
<p class="contents">On the institutional side, there are obvious issues to be resolved, including the questions of representation in Parliament, voting in the Council and the composition of the Commission, while detailed suggestions have been made in relation to the EU Foreign Minister and the presidency of the Council ministries. On the non-institutional side, there are different approaches to the question of the extent of qualified majority voting in the Council. This is not stating anything new, but these are the issues. We will need to strike an overall balance in order to reach agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn specifically to some of the matters. In response to a number of enquiries regarding the issue of voting rights, the presidency's view on this has been made absolutely clear. The Taoiseach has said that a solution based on dual majority is the one most likely to achieve an overall consensus. In fact, it is clear that is how the decision will be made on voting rights. There continue to be different views as to how the dual majority will be calculated. However, it is interesting and intriguing – and a number of Members have made reference to this – that we are indeed now talking about a dual majority system.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Commission, there is a shared view that we need a strong and effective Commission. There is also a need to find an appropriate balance between equality, the equally valid requirements for the Commission to be effective and for it to have some form of representational view. Any agreement will have to take all these considerations into account and it will not be difficult to bridge all the different requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón Crespo and a number of other speakers also mentioned the issue of the budget. On the question of the budget, I believe the balanced approach is the one most likely to secure agreement. The Italian presidency made a proposal in December which built on that brought forward by the Convention and on the discussions it had with partners in the IGC. We have further explored the matter in recent consultations, including with Parliament, and there is a consensus that budgetary procedures must respect the overall institutional balance.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I very much enjoyed today's debate. I have to say that I was heartened by it and I am very grateful to Members for their positive words and encouragement. Members who have spoken with me on a one-to-one basis know my particular anxieties in this regard, and they know the ambition of the Irish presidency to achieve progress, if progress can be achieved. I have very carefully noted the points that have been made. I very much look forward to a successful outcome to the European Council on 25 and 26 March.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Kinnock made the point that the IGC is stage one. This was also touched on by a number of other contributors. That is true. Stage one is agreement at Member State government level and the next stage will be to go on to the various and multifarious ratification processes. This leads me back to the point I made in my introduction: delay will not help the ratification process. I would reiterate that point. Time is not on our side, we need to reach agreement on this matter, as early as it is possible to do so, and the Irish presidency is ambitious that should be the case.</p>

I want to add to the remarks made by Mr Roche in what has been a very interesting debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps it is most appropriate for me to begin by thanking Mr Brok for reminding the House about the basic reality that the healthy divisions in modern Europe are on issues and – contrary to what is represented in some parts of politics and the press – not between big and small. This is a fundamental point, and understanding it means understanding that it is the equitable inclusion and representative rights of countries of large, medium and small size which makes this a Union and makes the Union a stable, developing, 50-year success, in place of centuries of grand diplomacy by grand governments, which ended repeatedly in terrible grief and war. On an occasion like this it is as well to remind ourselves of those basics, as Mr Brok did.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there were interesting references to the Lisbon strategy which, we must recall, was unanimously agreed by Member States to secure the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. There can never have been a more devout aspiration. It is interesting to heed what Mr Wurtz, Mr Collins, Mr Ferber, Mr Karas and Mrs Doyle had to say on the issue. Since we are all engaged in supporting the Lisbon strategy – maybe with differing degrees of enthusiasm – success in achieving such a knowledge-based, dynamic and competitive economy is not going to be propelled by hesitancy in the further development of the single market, by false economies with reduced public and private sector investment, or by a ceiling on the financial perspectives which disables European Union engagement in research and development, regional development and efforts to combat poverty and under-development throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to offer a quick comment on the points made by Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo, with a degree of elegant nuance from both gentlemen, on the fact that it would be wise to take account of the results of the European Parliament elections in the nomination of the President of the Commission in future. No-one seriously democratic could turn their back on such an idea, but nevertheless it is necessary to be careful because, if the impression was ever given that partisan reasons determined the appointment, that would reverberate over five years in Parliament, in the Commission, in the Council and more widely. The consequences would be divisive, destabilising and disadvantageous for the Union. Neither real democratic accountability nor legitimacy would be served by such a prospect and I am certain that nobody advocates taking proper account of the result of the elections is in any sense advocating partisan predetermination of the political alignment of the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention what I consider to be the curiosity of the debate. It was a remark from Mr Bonde, who called on the presidency to use the Brussels European Council to require a process for national decision-making on the constitution. That was somewhat paradoxical from an honourable Member, whom I think of as an evangelist for European fragmentation, especially since, if the advice he offered was followed, it would constitute the most massive act of superordinate centralisation in the history of the Union. I am certain he will forgive me if I say, as a great enthusiast for subsidiarity, that not for the first time I have to disagree with him on his proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point, which I cannot resist making – Mr Evans will not be surprised by this. I did not in any sense concede the case for democratic legitimacy. Indeed, as I am sure Mr Evans will acknowledge, it is a fundamental belief of mine. Taking a completely detached view of internal United Kingdom affairs, which befits a Commissioner, I have got a certain divergence from him on the issue of a referendum on the constitution for a basic and simple reason. As I understand it, in the United Kingdom referenda take place when a proposal is made for a change in the system of government, whether it involves devolution or the decision to have elected mayors, or in relation to a number of comparable issues. The proposed constitution does not change the system of government in the United Kingdom. I also recall that the only precedent for the party of which Mr Evans is a distinguished representative providing a referendum was on the acute question of Sunday opening of public houses in Wales. For Mr Evans and me that is a fundamental issue of democratic rights and good governance but it does not bear comparison with the European constitution.</p>
