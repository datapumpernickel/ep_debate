Indeed, the Council instructed the Special Committee on Agriculture to conduct a thorough examination of all the issues and to prepare a report which the Council will examine at a future meeting. This work has just started this month (September) at technical level. Although it appears difficult at this moment to anticipate the outcome of the examination, the impact of the Commission’s proposals on both farmers and industry will certainly be part of this thorough examination.

<p>(EN) At its session of 17–18 June 2004 the European Council invited the Council to agree at the latest in December 2004 on an EU Drugs strategy for the period 2005–2012. The strategy should take account of the forthcoming evaluation by the Commission of the 2000–2004 Action Plan as well as the results of the Conference of the Irish presidency on 10–11 May 2004: EU Strategy on drugs – The way forward. Subsequently the Netherlands presidency has presented a text on the new strategy. This text is being discussed now in the framework of the Horizontal Working Party on Drugs in view of its adoption before the end of 2004.</p>
<p>As regards drugs from Afghanistan, the draft strategy suggest to intensify law-enforcement effects directed at non-EU countries especially producer and transit countries.</p>
<p>In the chapter on international cooperation more effective, coordinated and visible action by the Union in international organisations and fora as well as more targeted assistance to third countries are suggested.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Parliamentarian knows, the situation in Afghanistan is very worrying. Opium cultivation may be much higher this year than in 2003. In December 2003 at the Kabul International Conference action plans were agreed in key drug control areas. Subsequently in April 2004 at a major international conference on Afghanistan drugs, this action was recognised as a priority and Afghanistan and neighbouring countries adopted a declaration to counter narcotics. The European Union is actively engaged in the drug component of the reconstruction process in Afghanistan by supporting alternative livelihood efforts and the institutional strengthening of police, justice and customs systems. The activity of the European Union concerns action inside Afghanistan and action targeted on trafficking routes from Afghanistan. The EU strengthens and supports efforts in Central Asia, the Balkan and candidate countries to fight drug trafficking and intercept shipments from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>It is to be underlined that some Member States play a special role in this field: the UK co-ordinates all anti drug activities in Afghanistan, Germany is responsible for co-ordinating police efforts and Italy co-ordinates judicial matters while the Commission stands as a major contributor to the international efforts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0230"></a>

<p>In this perspective, the EU is focussing at this stage on measures to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot Community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community.</p>
<p>As a first step, the Council adopted on 29 April 2004 a "Regulation on a regime under Article 2 of Protocol No 10 to the Act of Accession" (the so-called "Line Regulation"). This Regulation is intended to facilitate trade and other links between the areas in which the government of the Republic of Cyprus exercises effective control and the areas in which it does not, while ensuring that appropriate standards are maintained. The full implementation of its provisions is subject to specific rules that take full account of the particular situation in the island of Cyprus. These implementing rules were adopted by the Commission last month and entered into force on 23 August.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in July the Commission submitted comprehensive proposals to the Council for the purposes of economic integration of the island and improving contact between the two communities: a draft Regulation establishing a financial instrument which foresees the release of the 259 million Euro already earmarked for the northern part of Cyprus in the event of a settlement; and a draft Regulation on direct trade between the northern part of Cyprus – in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control and where the application of the acquis is suspended – and the rest of the EU. These proposals are currently under discussion.</p>
<p>The Council believes that the door to a comprehensive Cyprus settlement should not be considered closed and efforts to facilitate reunification should be continued. The Council is working towards this end through the initiatives mentioned earlier. Nevertheless, it goes without saying that the establishment of a climate of co-operation and confidence between the two communities depends very much upon their own willingness. At the same time, it should be recalled that the Cyprus issue remains on the UN Security Council agenda and that the Annan Plan is still the point of reference.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0241"></a>

<p>The US Department of State has recently admitted that there are no objective grounds for considering the Iranian opposition movement People's Mujahedeen to be a terrorist organisation.</p>

<p>Given that the Council has never been able to put forward any indications, still less proofs, to link this organisation in any way with terrorism or any other kind of violence outside Iran's borders, while a recent US Congress report has contained the public admission that it is the Iranian regime, not the former regime in Iraq, that is linked to large-scale terrorist acts such as 9-11, when will it finally admit its errors and cease treating the victims of terrorism as 'terrorists' and the ringleaders of international terrorism as 'victims of terrorism'?</p>

<p>(EN) In accordance with the Thessaloniki Declaration and Agenda adopted in the EU-Western Balkans Summit in June 2003, Kosovo is an integral part of the European perspective of the Western Balkans. The implementation of the Thessaloniki commitments within the framework of the enriched Stabilisation and Association Process are key objectives of the Dutch Presidency's Priorities for the Western Balkans. The European Perspective will continue to provide Kosovo with a framework for progress. The Commission has planned several Stabilisation and Association Process Tracking Mechanism Meetings in Pristina and Brussels, to which representatives of the member states will be invited. These EU instruments will help the Kosovo institutions in their efforts to implement the UN-endorsed Standards for Kosovo and embed them in a European context.</p>
<p>UN Security Council Resolution 1244 remains the basis of the international community's engagement in Kosovo and the lead and overall responsibility in Kosovo lies with the UN. Together with the newly appointed SRSG Jessen-Petersen and the international community, the Presidency will support the adjustment of UNMIK’s role where needed and aim to enhance the effectiveness of the international community in Kosovo in implementing Security Council Resolution 1244. However, regardless of the future status of Kosovo, it is clear that people of a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo will have their place in Europe and that the EU will be called upon to assume an increasingly greater role. The EU, therefore, given also the European perspective of Kosovo, intends to be actively engaged in the broader international debate about the future of the international presence in Kosovo.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0246"></a>

<p>(EN) Article 24 of the UN Charter provides that the UN Members have conferred on the Security Council the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The specific powers of the Security Council in discharging its duties are laid down in chapters VI, VII, VIII and XII of the Charter. Chapter VI encompasses the prerogatives of the Security Council with regard to the obligations of UN Members to settle disputes by pacific means. Article 39 of the Charter confers upon the Security Council the right to “determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Article 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security”. The Council would like to recall that all EU operations which have taken place or will be launched have been decided on the basis either of a request of the UN Secretary-General in pursuance of a mandate by the Security Council or by invitation of the Host Country.</p>
<p>The European Security Strategy adopted by the European Council on 12 December 2003 establishes the commitment of the Union to an international order based on effective multilateralism and in particular to upholding and developing international law. The Strategy provides that the UN Charter is the fundamental framework for international relations. The Council recalls that the EU concept of conflict prevention implies working closely with a range of international, regional and local actors and in particular the different UN bodies. These partnerships underpin all conflict prevention activities. Equipping the United Nations to fulfil its responsibilities and to act effectively remains a priority for the EU. Two policy documents, the EU/UN Joint Declaration of 24 September 2003 and the EU contribution to the UN High Level Panel on Security Threats (May 2004) have each aimed to strengthen the EU-UN relations in different ways. The EU-UN Joint Declaration of 24 September 2003 sets out a framework for closer co-operation in crisis management, especially in the areas of planning, training, communication and best practices. On matters of peace and security the EU aims to consolidate international support behind UN objectives and to facilitate joint planning, the development of strategic partnerships with specialised agencies and direct and pragmatic co-operation and co-ordination. A strategic partnership with the UNDP was also negotiated covering conflict prevention.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 11 of the Treaty on the European Union, without trying to comment on the Draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, the Union has to act in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Council would like to recall that draft article I-3, paragraphs 1 and 4 as well as draft article I-40, paragraph 1 of the Draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe contain the same duty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0248"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council recalls that freedom of movement for persons is one of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by Community law and includes the right to live and work in another Member State.</p>
<p>Similar to what was agreed in earlier enlargements, the Accession Treaty foresees a transitional period for the free movement of workers for the eight countries of Central and Eastern Europe that joined the EU on 1 May 2004.</p>
<p>It foresees a two-year period during which national measures will be applied by the EU-15 Member States, which can include specific bilateral agreements or can de facto result in full market labour access. After this period, reviews will be held, and, depending on the outcome, such national measures can continue to apply for a maximum of three more years, after which the transitional arrangement should in principle come to an end. Only in exceptional and serious cases will an EU-15 Member State be able to continue to apply national measures up to the end of the seventh year after accession. The Council furthermore stresses that the new Member States concerned may apply equivalent measures.</p>
<p>The Council underlines that the EU-15 Member States must give preference to nationals from the eight new Member States concerned over non-EU labour, and that the rights of nationals from these new Member States who are already legally resident and employed in an EU-15 Member State are protected. In addition, the rights of family members are also taken into account consistent with the practice in the case of previous accessions.</p>
<p>The Council stresses the strong elements of differentiation and flexibility in the arrangement for the free movement of workers. It also stresses that EU-15 Member States declared that they shall endeavour to grant increased labour market access to nationals from these eight new Member States concerned under national law, with a view to speeding up the approximation to the acquis. As a consequence, the employment opportunities in the EU for nationals from the eight new Member States should improve substantially upon their accession. Moreover, the EU-15 Member States will make best use of the arrangement to move as quickly as possible to the full application of the acquis in the area of free movement of workers, in particular if, as was the experience from previous enlargements, actual levels of migration turn out to be lower than expected.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0254"></a>

<p>As in previous years, there was a large increase in traffic on all roads during the holiday season, a time when millions of people take to the road in their own vehicle.</p>
<p>One of the main trouble spots on Europe's motorways, although not the only one, was the crossing point of the Atlantic border between France and Spain on the A8 motorway. On the French side, there are three tollbooths over a distance of less than 25 km where drivers must stop and pay the appropriate amount and on the other side of the border there are two more tollbooths over a similar distance, meaning that within a distance of 50 km drivers must stop at a tollbooth five times. This results in major hold-ups stretching back several kilometres, which impede the flow of traffic, add to drivers' and passengers' exhaustion on hot days and lead to a high risk of accidents.</p>
<p>What measures does the Council intend to take to prevent these kinds of jams? Should a harmonising regulation not be introduced at Community level to abolish the majority of these tollbooths situated along the motorway (while maintaining those at entry and exit points), so that drivers collect a ticket at the beginning of their journey and do not have to stop to pay until the end?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Council is well aware of the problem of traffic jams on motorways as a result of the different toll systems operated on them by the Member States. It is for this reason that the Council, in close collaboration with the European Parliament, fast-tracked the proposal for a directive to encourage the use of electronic toll systems in the Community. So it was that, on 29 April 2004, barely one year after the Commission presented this proposal, the Council and the European Parliament adopted Directive 2004/52/EC on the interoperability of electronic road toll systems in the Community (OJ L 166, 30/04/2004, p. 124). The directive was intended to promote the use of electronic road toll systems in the Community, for instance by creating a European electronic road toll service, which would enable drivers to use motorways without having to halt at toll stations, having concluded a single contract with one of the service’s operators and installed in their vehicles a unique device capable of being used on all the electronic toll systems in the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0257"></a>

<p>At the end of August 2004, at a time when the legal persecution of women who are obliged to seek abortions is continuing in Portugal, the Portuguese government, in a clear breach of the right to information and expression, banned a Dutch ship belonging to the organisation 'Women on Waves' from entering Portuguese waters or docking at a Portuguese port, thus impeding the holding of the debates and information sessions on sexual and reproductive rights scheduled with Portuguese and European parliamentarians and organisations.</p>

<p>(FR) Road safety is a shared responsibility. With this in mind, and respecting the competences of each party involved, the Commission launched the European Road Safety Action Programme, which describes in detail 62 courses of action, not all of them of a legislative nature, that it intends to undertake by 2010. Before this action plan was even adopted, the Commission proposed a series of items of legislation which have already been adopted or are at present subject to legislative scrutiny. Among these are measures aimed at improving the training of professional drivers, observance of driving times and rest times and safety in tunnels, whilst others aim to step up checks on road vehicles or harmonise the acquisition of driving licences.</p>
<p>The efforts made have meant that the number of deaths on the roads has fallen from 40 000 in 2000 to 35 000 in 2003.</p>
<p>The Commission has also made provision for developing accidentology at European level by bringing together the expertise and knowledge that are present in the Member States. With this is mind, it has started work on setting up a European road safety observatory, as a structure within the Commission, at the beginning of 2005. Such a structure has been considered preferable to an agency, which would result in inappropriate empowerment and bureaucracy. It should be borne in mind that the intention is to collect, analyse and disseminate data and knowledge on road safety.</p>
<p>As to whether it will be necessary to create an agency at a later date, it will be possible to ascertain this by assessing the observatory’s operation after a period of years.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0244"></a>

<p>(EN) The new Guidelines for Trans-European transport Networks (TEN-T) were adopted on 29 April 2004 by the Parliament and the Council. These Guidelines include a list of 30 priority projects – or major Trans-European axes - which are declared to be of European interest. The cost of these axes is approximately 225 billion €. The extension of major European axis to the new Member States should help to make enlargement a success and provide the Union with a new opportunity to reduce congestion, improve accessibility and encourage intermodality.</p>
<p>The transport axis referred to by the Honourable Member is presently being covered by three of the 30 priority axes, namely n<span class="sup">o</span> 4 (High-speed railway axis East), n<span class="sup">o</span> 17 (railway axis Paris-Strasbourg-Stuttgart-Vienna-Bratislava) and n<span class="sup">o</span> 22 (railway axis Athens-Sofia-Budapest-Vienna-Prague-Nurnberg/Dresden).</p>
<p>While some subsections of project n<span class="sup">o</span> 4 are expected to be completed by 2007, for projects n<span class="sup">o</span>s 17 and 22 many sections will be completed only between 2010-2015.</p>
<p>Community funding of these priority projects started in 1993 with the “Eastern high Speed link” Study (for which 4 million € were disbursed). For the period 1993-2001, the support given under the TEN-T budget amounted to approximately 139 million € and was implemented through 21 different projects and studies.</p>
<p>Given the importance of this major axis, the revised Multiannual Indicative Programme (MIP) covering the period 2001-2006 – devoted a total estimated budget of approximately 241 million €, 148 million of which have already been committed.</p>
<p>The full completion under schedule of these projects depends on the Financial Perspectives 2007-2013, in which the Commission proposed to increase substantially the budget for TEN.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0240"></a>

<p>(EN) The demographic future of Europe is now widely recognised as a major challenge. While the increased life expectancy, which is a clear sign of Europe's success, is to be welcomed, its demographic future raises difficult questions about how Europe can remain competitive, reinforce social cohesion and achieve higher employment and economic growth.</p>
<p>Ageing has become a major focus of three policy areas: economic policy – and in particular public finances – employment and social protection. These are interdependent. A successful response to the challenge of ageing requires action in all three areas. And it highlights the need to accelerate both employment and productivity growth and the modernisation of social protection.</p>
<p>The Commission agrees entirely that Europe must prepare for ageing in good time. This is why the Commission has insisted that Europe's response to ageing should be developed as part of the overall strategy of mutually reinforcing policies launched at Lisbon. And as the driving force behind the Lisbon Strategy the Commission has been keen to underscore the urgency of getting the right policies in place in time.</p>
<p>In response to the first part of the question it should be pointed out that the Commission has a particular role to play in supporting Member States' efforts by setting the right policy framework. The issue of ageing has become a central element of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, the European Employment Strategy and the Open Method of Coordination on pensions (OMC). It is also one of the main reasons to move forward with the OMC in the area of health care and long-term care.</p>
<p>The drive for policy initiatives, which can moderate the impact of population ageing and help Member States maintain sound public finances, sufficient labour supply and adequate pension and health care even at the height of ageing are at the core of Commission collaborations with Member States in the Economic Policy Committee, the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission is currently implementing a preparatory action requested by the Parliament (i.e. the initiative of the Honourable Member Mr Walter) which specifically addresses the need for European and national policies to take better account of future demographic changes.</p>
<p>In response to the second part of the question, it should be stressed that population ageing affects all policy areas and Europeans of all ages. Adequate responses to ageing must therefore go beyond attention to the currently old and draw on contributions from most policy fields. At the same time there are ageing and senior citizens' issues in almost all policy fields. Hence, there are good arguments for letting each Commissioner be responsible for addressing such issues where they appear within his or her particular dossier.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0251"></a>

<p>According to Eurostat, unemployment in the EU has risen from 8.9% in 2003 to 9.1% in 2004. 19.4% of young people and 26.3% of women in Greece are affected. This is the result of the implementation of the Lisbon strategy to increase the competitiveness of enterprises. At the same time, the mass privatization of public sector enterprises, the relocation of enterprises to other countries with a cheaper workforce, the extension of partial and temporary work, and the further commercialization of the insurance, health and education sectors have all contributed to boosting the profits of the rich and worsening the plight of workers. The large-scale mass mobilization of workers in Germany is an indication of just how exasperated workers are.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission can share the concerns raised by the Honourable Member. Levels of unemployment and in particular youth and female unemployment are worrying. Whilst progress has been made over the period 1997-2002 in increasing employment rates and combating unemployment, the recent economic slowdown has reversed this trend.</p>
<p>While it cannot be argued that unemployment is the result of the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, it is widely accepted that the acceleration of globalisation has increased competitive pressure and rapid economic restructuring both at EU and national level. Faced with this situation, what is needed is more – not less - Lisbon.</p>
<p>In Lisbon, Member States signed up to a 10 year strategy for economic and social renewal with the aim of becoming the most competitive knowledge based economy with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.</p>
<p>National examples (in particular Sweden, Denmark and Finland) show clearly that Member States with the best performance on the Lisbon objectives for economic, employment and social progress (outweighing the US in many aspects) are those which are most advanced in putting in place the measures called for by the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p>It will therefore be important to press ahead with the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, as complemented by Göteborg, which, for the first time, builds upon a positive, mutually reinforcing interaction between economic, employment and social policies within sustainable development.</p>
<p>Focussing on the employment dimension of Lisbon: the European Employment Strategy (EES), which translates the Lisbon of more and better jobs into concrete action, has started to bear fruit. This is not just semantics: employment policies in Europe have become more far-reaching, including a widening range of actors, with more emphasis on active and preventative policies, greater attention to gender gaps, a greater endeavour to improve adaptability of labour markets and work organisation through flexible working arrangements, and to develop new securities for workers through lifelong learning, more and better investment in human capital and social partnerships. The EES has also steered a new monitoring and benchmarking culture, with an increasing use of input and output indicators and greater emphasis on effective delivery of reforms and on improved governance.</p>
<p>However, as the employment situation highlighted by the Honourable Member points out, more needs to be done. What is really needed is a vigorous implementation by the Member States of the policy agreed at EU level in the context of the EES. Particular attention should be given to the most difficult areas where little real progress has been made on the ground, for instance active ageing policies, more and better investment in human capital and better integration of those furthest away from the labour market. Lisbon in general, and the European Employment Strategy in particular, will only be successful if Member States implement at national level the policies they have signed up to at EU level and if all actors, notably the social partners, fully take up their responsibility.</p>
<p>Regarding corporate restructuring, the Commission has sought to widen and deepen the debate on the contribution that can be made at Community level to ensuring that change and restructuring are managed having due regard to their social consequences.</p>
<p>As a result of the first stage consultation of the social partners on this very issue, the European social partners submitted to the Commission in October 2003 a joint text 'Orientations for reference in managing change and its social consequences'. The Commission welcomes the fact that the social partners have indicated their intention to pursue work on topics relevant to this theme in the future. In fact, a lot remains to be done with a view to ensure that the agreed principles are developed and applied throughout the European Union. The Commission will take any required initiative with a view to ensure that its initial goals are met.</p>
<p>Company relocations have always been a challenge for regional policy and have become an even greater concern within an enlarged Union. In its programme negotiations for the 2007-2013 period, the Commission will, in partnership with the recipients of Structural Funds, pay particular attention to the issue of relocations and restructuring. This issue should also be addressed in the annual discussion in the Council on the Cohesion Policy.</p>
<p>Also the Commission communication on Industrial Policy and its follow-up has sought to provide further momentum to the debate on the role of industrial policy at EU level. It stresses that we must develop a more coherent approach to accompanying and, where possible, anticipating structural change, centred on the key role of knowledge.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0269"></a>

It includes three main parts: 1) a reaffirmation of international and European agreed principles; 2) an analysis of CSR drivers, obstacles and success factors and 3) a set of recommendations addressed to the Forum members and/or the EU institutions and other reference players on CSR.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently assessing the Forum's results. Overall, it believes that the merit of the Forum has been to promote a better understanding of CSR, its boundaries and the expectations of the different stakeholders, as well as their roles and responsibilities. The Forum has proven to be a learning process and a unique platform for dialogue between business, traditional social partners and other stakeholders. The Commission is aware that some divergences between the positions of the different stakeholders remain. It has taken note of the different views on the process, and will take them into account in the preparation of the Commission's forthcoming Communication on CSR.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0215"></a>

<p>(EN) The principle of subsidiarity laid down in the EU and EC Treaties applies solely to relations between the EU and its Member States. As Romania is not yet an EU Member State, the Commission is not competent to comment on this country’s compliance with the principle. The Copenhagen criteria for accession merely require "stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities". Consequently the issue brought up by the Honourable Member has not been dealt with in either the Commission's opinion on Romania's 1997 application to join the EU or in the subsequent regular reports on Romania's progress in preparing for accession.</p>
<p>Would Romania be an EU member, the Commission would not be able to answer this question either. The principle of subsidiarity does not concern Member States' internal organization or arrangements for the exercise of power. In other words, the Member States are free to decide on the number of tiers of government they have and on the allocation of competences between these tiers. Ensuring that these arrangements are upheld is the responsibility of the country's political and judicial systems (constitutional court, etc.).</p>
<p>The Commission is therefore not in a position to tell the Honourable Member whether the Transylvania regional authority exercises powers that satisfy the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p>This notwithstanding, the Commission is in a position to indicate to the Honourable Member that the concept of regional authority does not exist in the Romanian legislation which only provides for counties at the local level; 9 of which are located in the Transylvanian geographical area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0217"></a>

<p>In its most recent report (the Third Report on the Stabilisation and Association process for South East Europe) the Commission states that an additional amount of EUR 71 million (an increase of approximately 13%) has been granted to the Western Balkans in the 2004 budget for reconstruction. In addition, in its initiative 'the Thessaloniki Agenda for the Western Balkans', the Commission introduced, alongside European partnerships, certain new measures to reinforce the capacities of these countries to implement their reform programmes.</p>
<p>Within these new frameworks, has the Commission taken into consideration the need to promote and reinforce economic and trade cooperation between the Balkan countries and the EU Member States? Does it intend to take specific initiatives to reinforce regional cooperation in the economic sphere, given that the Western Balkans remain only a modest EU trade partner and accounted for less than 1% of the EU's total trade in 2002? Is the Commission satisfied with regard to the implementation of commitments by the countries in the region for enhanced regional cooperation and the promotion of a series of specific goals and initiatives decided on at the Thessaloniki Summit?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Economic and trade cooperation between the Balkan countries and the EU Members States, and also amongst the countries of the region, is one of the key objectives of the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP). Assistance provided under the Community assistance for reconstruction, development and stabilisation programme (CARDS) Regulation is geared to that end. While economic and trade assistance at the outset was more focused on supporting the establishment of functioning market economies it has shifted towards adoption of Community legislation and practices on issues like standards and certification, intellectual property protection, competition policy and customs. This benefits not only the countries of the region but also EU entities who are involved, or plan to cooperate, with the Western Balkans. This has been - and will continue to be - taken into account when designing assistance programmes/projects in the economic and trade related spheres.</p>
<p>A key instrument underpinning the SAP is the EU’s autonomous trade measures, under which the beneficiary countries enjoy free access to the EU market for almost all products. The Western Balkan countries’ exports to the EU have increased substantially since the late 1990s. This is due to a combination of factors, including the trade measures, high levels of post-conflict reconstruction, the transition to a market economy. It is true that the region’s export potential is considerably higher, however. To exploit this potential, the countries need to increase their levels of foreign direct investment, broaden their export base and increase their production capacity and productivity. They also need to ensure they comply with EC standards. Governments need to pursue structural reforms, modernise their administrations, particularly the judiciary, and to ensure the rule of law to realise this objective. As for the EU, the Commission’s efforts in institution building, justice and home affairs in addition to the more specific economic measures all contribute to creating the basis for enhanced links between the Western Balkans and the EU.</p>
<p>Much progress has been made in implementation of the commitments made at the Thessaloniki Summit last year. In terms of regional cooperation, the Commission would like to mention particularly the areas of transport and energy. In that regard, two significant landmarks were the signature in June 2004 of a Memorandum of Understanding on the development of the South East Europe Transport Network, which aims at the connection of the Western Balkans to the Trans-European network and the opening in July of negotiations on a Treaty establishing the Energy Community in South East Europe. Finally, the South East European countries have completed a network of bilateral free trade agreements between them. These will enhance regional economic integration and contribute to preparing the countries eventually to join the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0223"></a>

<p>(EN) As the honourable member points out, the Commission’s proposals for a European Fisheries Fund covering the period from 2007 to 2013 include support measures for small-scale coastal fishing. These measures are more generous than similar ones for other categories of vessels. For example where the Fund provides financing for equipment onboard fishing vessels or for selective gear, the required private investment is 20% less for small-scale coastal fishing vessels than for bigger vessels. Equally the Community financial participation towards eligible socio-economic measures will be higher in the case of small-scale coastal fishing. Furthermore, as proposed, the fund should be able to provide more direct assistance where necessary under a policy for the sustainable economic development of coastal areas and, therefore, will be able to play a greater role in the development and maintenance of the economic and social fabric of communities involved in fishing.</p>
<p>As regards the overall benefits of the proposed new fund for the Irish fishing industry and coastal communities dependent on fishing, it is for the Irish authorities to draw up a national strategic plan for the industry setting out their priorities and defining the measures and communities which could most benefit from the fund’s assistance.</p>
<p>In line with the Common Fisheries Policy, Ireland has stated its intention to develop sustainable fisheries to ensure a secure future for the industry and coastal communities dependent on fishing.

<p>The Commission monitors compliance with primary law (the Treaties) and with secondary law (Community regulations).

<p>For the purposes of monitoring compliance with Community law, the Commission has specific powers under the infringement procedure laid down in Articles 226 and 228 of the EC Treaty and Articles 141 and 143 of the EAEC Treaty.

The import quotas are making it more difficult to restrict consumption by means of setting high prices through the state monopoly as well as undermining the monopoly that Sweden was promised during the accession negotiations. Article 30 of the Treaty gives the desire to protect public health and public policy as grounds for restrictions on trade; higher alcohol consumption demonstrably results in failure to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>Is the Commission willing to allow Sweden to reduce the quotas in order to protect public health and to maintain the monopoly on direct sales which for many Swedes was a condition of voting in favour of EU membership? If not, why does the Commission not consider Article 30 to be applicable even in such an obvious case of public health protection?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member asks whether the Commission intends to authorize Sweden to diminish its quotas on alcohol brought into Sweden in order to protect public health, and, if not, why the Commission finds that Article 30 of the Treaty is not applicable in this case.</p>
<p>To answer the question, it is necessary to distinguish between quantitative and fiscal quotas i.e. between absolute limitations on the volume of alcohol which may be brought into a country from another Member State and limits on the volume of alcohol that can be brought in from another Member State without payment of Swedish excise duties.</p>
<p>Article 28 of the Treaty prohibits any quantitative quotas in the movement of goods between Member States. An import quota system constitutes one of the most significant kinds of barriers to intra-community trade. It would appear that health objectives can be safeguarded adequately by less restrictive measures rather than quotas. Moreover, in the case of Sweden, a quota system would likely to be inconsistent with the fact that the Systembolaget sales are not subject to any quantitative limits on sales of products in stock or from other Member States.</p>
<p>As for fiscal quotas, Sweden until recently enjoyed a derogation under the Community rules on excise duties (Directive 92/12/EEC) which allowed it to limit the quantity of alcoholic beverages which a private person could bring into Sweden from another Member State without having to pay excise duties in Sweden. On goods exceeding these quotas, Swedish taxes had to be paid. However, this derogation expired on 31 December 2003 and under Community law, a private person may acquire any quantity of goods duty paid in another Member State and bring it to Sweden. The excise duties are then paid in the state of purchase, as long as the goods are only intended for the holder's own use.</p>
<p>Taxation in the Member State of purchase is necessary to ensure private individuals the freedom to purchase duty-paid goods in the Member State of their choice and transport them to another Member State without having to pay duty again. This is legitimate and a fundamental freedom for citizens in the Internal Market which the Commission is required to uphold.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0237"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission reiterates its strong endorsement of the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Iran. The next IAEA Board meeting takes place in mid-September.</p>
<p>At the most recent Board meeting in June 2004, the Commission joined its EU partners in welcoming the work of the Agency and their progress on understanding the nature and extent of Iran’s nuclear programme and in resolving many aspects of Iran’s uranium conversion and laser enrichment activities. The EU also welcomed positive decisions by Iran with regard to the active implementation of the provisions of the still-to-be ratified Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement with the Agency, and to the voluntary suspension of enrichment-related activities.</p>
<p>However, the Commission also noted that not all questions have been satisfactorily answered as yet with regard to these matters, and that a number of serious issues remain outstanding, notably with regard to the sources of all highly-enriched uranium contamination in Iran and the extent and nature of work undertaken on the basis of P-2 advanced centrifuge design. The Commission therefore reiterated its call on Iran for full, active and transparent cooperation over the next few months, so that a complete and final picture can be presented as soon as possible, and hopefully no later than the end of the year, to the Board of Governors for its consideration.</p>
<p>However, Iran’s subsequent announcement that it intends to resume manufacturing centrifuge components and the assembly and testing of centrifuges, together with reports of the re-starting of production of uranium hexafluoride, cannot be regarded as positive developments.</p>
<p>The Commission had occasion to discuss the situation with the IAEA Director General, Dr ElBaradei, in mid-July. He noted that a constructive rather than an overly confrontational approach might best serve the purpose for the moment. On other occasions, Dr ElBaradei has also advocated a de-dramatizing approach. The Commission will bear these points in mind in its approach to the preparations for the forthcoming meetings of the IAEA Board of Governors.</p>
<p>The Commission hardly regards this as a “policy of appeasement” and despite the difficulties in relation to Iran, no other participants in the debate have been able to identify a better and more effective approach. The jury is still out on this difficult issue. At the EU-US Summit in June, the Commission agreed with its American partners on common language concerning Iran’s nuclear ambitions.</p>
<p>With regard to the authorship of the 11 September attacks, the Commission is not aware of any definitive evidence that would support the Honorable Member’s conclusion.</p>
<p>Finally, as the Honorable Member is aware, no EU-Iran contractual relations exist at this stage and the Commission has continued to advocate a pause in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) negotiations since summer last year. Calibrating EU policy on Iran is a continuous, delicate balancing act with no quick-fix solutions. The Commission counts on the continued collaboration of the European Parliament in this difficult task.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0247"></a>

<p>(EN) The deliberate release of genetically modified organisms (GMO) for research or commercial purposes is regulated by Directive 2001/18/EC<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. According to this Directive the potential negative effects of a GMO on human health and the environment have to be properly assessed before it is placed on the market in EU.</p>
<p>Furthermore the varieties derived from this GMO have to be registered on a national (or Common) catalogue of varieties before seeds of such varieties can be marketed in the country in question or whithin the Community.</p>
<p>Three GM maizes, have already been authorised for cultivation within the Community. 32 maize varieties derived from the 3 GM maize in question are inscribed in the national catalogues of Spain, France and of the Netherlands and seeds of those varieties can be marketed in those countries. The commission agreed on 8 September to register 17 GM maize varieties derived from MON 810 in the Common Catalogue of varieties. Those varieties can thus be freely marketed within the Community.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that farmers are fully informed about the GM status of the seeds they may use, the Community legislation prescribes that GM varieties that are placed on the market the must be labelled as containing GMOs.</p>
<p>The situation is different in the case of adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of GM seeds in other products. Indeed, during the cultivation, harvest and subsequent storage and handling of non-GM seeds, presence of traces of GM seeds may not be avoided even if segregation measures are taken. In this case, if GMOs found in a seed lot of a non-GM variety are authorised for the placing on the market under Directive 2001/18/EC, Member States cannot prohibit the placing on the market of the lots of a non-GM variety with traces of GM seeds but Member States must require the presence of GM seeds on the label to be mentioned in accordance with the Directive.</p>
<p>Article 21(1) requires that Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that at all stages of the placing on the market, the labelling of GMOs comply with the relevant requirements specified in the written consent of the GMO in question.</p>

In Portugal, there are approximately € 149 million from the EAGGF available for the prevention of fire and the restoration of the agricultural and forestry production potential for the period 2000 - 2006. In Spain, within the context of rural development, the total budget allocated to forestry measures for the period 2000 – 2006 amounts to approximately € 820 million (afforestation of agricultural land excluded). Forest fire prevention measures and measures for restoring forestry production potential are included in the above-mentioned amount and it is estimated that they vary between 30 % and 70 % of the amount allocated to forestry measures in the different regions.</p>
<p>Forest restoration after the occurrence of fires can be co-financed through the Rural Development Regulation. This Regulation provides to Member States support for restoring forestry production potential damaged by natural disasters and fire: it is implemented by national/regional authorities and it is open to them to decide the reorientation of the priorities between the different measures according to the needs.</p>
<p>The Commission aims to continue forest fire prevention activities after 2006 through the new Rural Development Regulation and the new environmental financial instrument still to be proposed. The Commission will also continue and further improve its civil protection mechanism, concerning cooperation between countries in the field of forest fire fighting.</p>
<p>As concerns the European Union Solidarity Fund, this instrument has been established to respond to “major disasters” having caused direct damage of more than 3 billion Euros (in 2002 prices) or exceeding 0.6% of the affected countries GNI. Only in very exceptional cases and when a number of severe conditions imposed by the Regulation are met can the Fund be mobilised for smaller disasters. In any event the Solidarity Fund can only be mobilised upon formal request from the national government of the country affected by a disaster, submitted within 10 weeks of the first damage. On the basis of the application the Commission assesses whether the conditions for mobilising the Fund are met. If so, the Commission proposes to the budgetary authority</p>
<p>(Parliament and Council) to make the necessary budget appropriations available. No applications concerning this summer’s forest fires have been received.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At the end of August 2004, at a time when the legal persecution of women who are obliged to seek abortions is continuing in Portugal, the Portuguese government, in a clear breach of the right to information and expression, banned a Dutch ship belonging to the organisation 'Women on Waves' from entering Portuguese waters or docking at a Portuguese port, thus impeding the holding of the debates and information sessions on sexual and reproductive rights scheduled with Portuguese and European parliamentarians and organisations.</p>

<p>(FR) Although the Commission has followed the progress of the situation to which the honourable Member refers, it does not have sufficiently precise details available to it to be able to rule on the merits of the case.</p>
<p>The Commission wishes to point out that Member States may restrict EU citizens’ fundamental right to free movement, enshrined in Article 18 of the Treaty on the European Communities, only when this is justified on the grounds of public policy, public security or public health.</p>
<p>When a Member State takes steps to prohibit entry to its territory on the basis of one of these considerations, it must abide by the general principles of Community law, including the right to freedom of expression, the principle of proportionality in particular, and the provisions of Council Directive 64/221/EEC of 25 February 1964 on the coordination of special measures justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Communities.</p>
<p>Where decisions are taken by reference to public policy and public security, the conduct of the persons concerned must constitute a real and sufficiently serious threat to fundamental interest of society. The only diseases or disabilities capable of justifying refusal of entry on the grounds of public health are those described in the annex to Directive 64/221.</p>
<p>In accordance with Directive 64/221, the person concerned must be notified of any decision to refuse them entry to, or remove them from, the territory, and he or she must be made aware of the reasons of public policy, public security or public health involved. He or she must be able to appeal against the decision.</p>
<p>If the persons concerned have availed themselves of their right of appeal against the decision to refuse the Borndiep entry to Portugal, it is for a Portuguese judge to rule on the decision in question in accordance with the general principles of Community law and the provisions of Directive 64/221.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The requirements of the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive (2001/42/EC<a href="#defann_35_2" name="refann_35_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>) apply to certain plans and programmes. Under the terms of the Directive, Member States were obliged to notify national implementing legislation that applies to existing national plan- and programme-making provisions. Ireland met this obligation by notifying two statutory instruments through a letter dated 16 July 2004 addressed to the Commission’s Secretary-General. One instrument concerns plan- and programme-making with respect to current Irish land-use planning provisions<a href="#defann_35_3" name="refann_35_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The other instrument concerns plan- and programme-making in sectors other than land-use<a href="#defann_35_4" name="refann_35_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It is always possible that new plan- and programme-making requirements will arise at national level, in which case further provision may need to be made to implement the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive, including provision for possible notification of new measures to the Commission. However, this does not invalidate previous notifications. The fact that new primary legislation in the field of water is currently passing through the Irish Parliament does not mean that the notification made in July 2004 was either misleading or invalid. As far as the Commission is concerned, there is no defective notification that needs to be addressed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The delay follows improvements which have been incorporated in the Labour Force Survey: the household sample has been re-designed to take into account the 2001 population census figures and the calculation method has been adjusted to correspond more closely to the population structure.

<p>(EN) The Commission considers that, in order to develop an effective policy on fighting illegal migration, co-operation with third counties is essential and will require increased attention in the coming years. In its Communication on integrating migration issues in the European Union’s relations with third countries, the Commission presented the policy approach it will take. It elaborates how the EU’s various external policies and instruments, including development policy, improving living conditions, conflict prevention and strengthening of democratic structures, can make an important contribution to helping to remove the underlying causes of migration flows. The dramatic increase of poverty and exclusion and a serious lack of respect for human rights in certain parts of Africa, especially south of the Sahara, make this region one of the areas which must be targeted.</p>
<p>Three action plans, all based on previous Commission Communications – on illegal immigration, on integrated border management and on return policy - define EU action and contain proposals for common measures in the fight against illegal immigration. In addition, the Commission has presented to the Council a study on maritime borders which contains a thorough analysis of the phenomenon and a number of recommendations concerning the improvement of maritime border surveillance. The study considers possible developments in maritime law as well as on improved regional co-operation, in particular in the Mediterranean context.</p>
<p>The “Programme of measures to combat illegal immigration across the maritime borders of the Member States of the European Union”, adopted by the Council in November 2003, proposes measures that cover firstly controls between ports in the EU and from and to the ports of third countries. Secondly, the programme outlines solutions for surveillance and control and encourages the conclusion of agreements with countries of origin or transit of illegal immigrants. The establishment of a European Agency for the Management of External Borders, which will be operational by 2005, will reinforce Community action.
