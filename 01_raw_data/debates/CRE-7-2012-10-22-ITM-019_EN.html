<p class="contents">Before going into the merits, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and all the committee members, as well as the officials and other contributors, for the work they have undertaken over the past months. As you know, the Council proposed a significant number of cuts, in stark contrast to the statements from the European Council of 28 and 29 June, at which the decision had been taken at the highest political level to invest in order to support growth and development across Europe. So, in our reading, we decided to reinstate the draft budget from the Commission and to make selective increases to resources in certain chapters of the budget which were closely related to the policies of growth and job creation, in particular for our young people.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have had occasion to point out before, this is not a feckless gesture, given today’s climate: we all know the fiscal difficulties confronting each Member State. But the answer to the crisis – as the European Council also pointed out – must be more Europe and not less Europe. I would characterise the position that we are to vote on tomorrow as responsible. But responsible does not mean defeatist: it means contributing to economic renewal by certain precise and selective increases, which are more limited than those in a normal reading at the European Parliament, especially in terms of commitments made, but taking account of the general climate of austerity and the sacrifices being imposed at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I don’t believe that the Member States can accuse us of calling for increases which are not in line with today’s crisis, and I repeat that we are determined to maintain sufficient investment to bring about a new boost to the economy, responding to the pleas from our people who are suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to address the question of payments. It will not have escaped anyone that this is the most delicate aspect of the negotiations, but I think we have to approach the topic from a technical rather than a political viewpoint. The level of payments set by the Commission in the draft budget has been established for each item on the basis of the Member States’ own estimates, revised downwards. So the motion for an increase of 6.8 % on 2012 is merely a realistic indication of the resources required to pay the claims from the Member States and to honour all the commitments we have made since 2007. We cannot now consider jeopardising the implementation of particular European programmes – as has happened in the past few days – and I find it inconceivable that the reading of the Council and the statements made by some ministers could be based on figures which are clearly insufficient to finance these programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">We have all agreed in our press statements that the answer to the crisis is Europe. It is a shame that, when we get down to specifics, these words are not followed by practical actions. I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that the problem we are faced with is one of the credibility and trustworthiness of the European Union. In fact, paying the Member States’ claims is a legal obligation, which we cannot simply ignore; and it is certainly not for Parliament to explain this to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would remind you of the wording of the resolution accompanying tomorrow’s vote, in which Parliament gives its Conciliation Committee a mandate not to accept the level of payments, either for the draft amending budget No 6 or for the 2013 budget, if the latter does not sufficiently cover the needs for payment during 2012 and 2013 as estimated by the Commission.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regarding the latter, it is always difficult to set your own budget, and this year it is even more difficult, as we face tough economic and financial times. Therefore, the European Parliament took very seriously the Commissioner’s letter earlier this year when he suggested to all the institutions that they limit the increase for 2013 to 1.9 %. Since the start of this year, the aim of this Parliament has been to keep our increase below 1.9 %, including the extra costs incurred because of Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">We started with a figure of 2.4 % earlier this year, but straightaway we started to look for savings. We agreed to freeze all Members’ allowances – the daily and office allowances – and we agreed to cut our travel budget once again. We also set up a working group between the Committee on Budgets and the Bureau to look at further savings. This working group, I am glad to say, has been able to identify more savings. We have been able to find a 5 % cut in the travel budget. We have decided to save EUR 5.3 million from the budget line for the House of European History, and we have found other ways of finding EUR 3.1 million to fund the expansion of wifi within the European Parliament buildings themselves. I am pleased to say that, at a recent conciliation meeting between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets, we agreed a 1.9 % increase for Parliament’s budget – including the extra cost of Croatia – but also including the 1.7 % proposed salary increases. So when colleagues do the mathematics and look at the actual increase proposed for Parliament’s budget next year, they will see it is well below 1 % – indeed I believe what we are proposing is nearer 0.6 %.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage I want to thank the members of the Budget Committee and the Bureau for their cooperation, but also all my shadows for their cooperation. We have worked extremely hard to get an increase at this level. I think that shows in the fact that there are no budget line amendments to be voted on tomorrow and that we are able, I believe, to stick to the agreement we reached with the Bureau some time ago. Therefore, this Parliament is able to say that we have set in place a responsible budget for 2013 and that we will continue to look for further savings.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I have also been encouraging other institutions to set a responsible budget. I believe it was a mistake by the Council some time ago to propose a blanket freeze for all the budgets of all the institutions. All the institutions are different, with different needs and different pressures, and therefore we should be looking at their budgets individually. Certainly that is what I have done as rapporteur – I have sat down with each institution to look at their budgets in great detail. I am therefore proposing that we partially reinstate the budget of most of the other institutions to around the 1.9 % figure I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are a few institutions which are likely to come in a little higher than that because of their own special circumstances. I believe the Ombudsman, the Court of Justice and the European External Action Service also have special circumstances and may warrant an increase of slightly above the 1.9 % figure. I hope that tomorrow, my colleagues will accept these proposals for Parliament’s budget and also for the budget of all the other institutions. It has been a tough budget, but I do believe we have achieved our aim – a 1.9 % increase – while at the same time making savings but also protecting the effectiveness of this Parliament and of individual Members of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 11 September I also had the honour of presenting to you in detail the Council’s position on the draft budget for 2013, as adopted by the Council on 24 July.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, at the budgetary trialogue, I had the opportunity of giving some initial reactions to the amendments which the European Parliament intends to vote on. I wish to recall that the Council reached an agreement on its position on the draft budget for 2013, following difficult negotiations, and accepted a limited increase in commitments and payment appropriations compared to 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the considerable effort and budgetary constraints that Member States are currently facing at national level, and we have to take these into account. I believe that, as the Member States endeavour to consolidate their budgets, it is crucial to deliver the right message to European citizens. Today I will take note of the positions taken by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now focus on some issues to which the Council attaches particular importance. Firstly, the Council considers that the existing ceilings of the multiannual financial framework must be respected. It is also important to ensure adequate margins under the different ceilings in order to be able to cope with unforeseen situations. The Council is therefore concerned about the European Parliament’s amendments, which considerably reduce the margins in all headings, the only exception being heading 5. Moreover, the European Parliament proposes to go beyond the ceilings of subheading 1a, requiring the mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council regrets the increasing payment appropriations that the European Parliament intends to vote on, especially when their level exceeds the Commission’s draft budget. The Council is aware of the European Parliament’s intentions to support and highlight several of its political priorities. However, the overall level of payment appropriations retained should be sufficient but not overestimated.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Council wishes to find an agreement with the European Parliament on a reasonable level of payment appropriations for the current budgetary year, including draft amending budget No 5, the global transfer and the upcoming draft amending budget No 6.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to remind you that the Council is opposed to the broad use of reserves that you intend to vote on, especially when their release is accompanied by conditions which are not in line with the provisions of the Financial Regulation. Appropriations should only be entered in the reserve in the absence of a basic act and in cases of serious doubt about the adequacy of the appropriations or their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me reiterate the Council’s hope and conviction that the existing excellent climate of cooperation will prevail during the rest of the budgetary procedure, leading to a mutually-satisfying agreement on the 2013 budget. We fully respect the European Parliament and your intentions, even when we are not in a position to entirely share the stance you adopt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we should draw on the experience of the tensions we have in this year’s budget; they should be kept very strongly in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I welcome – not surprisingly – the reading of the proposal by the Committee on Budgets about the restoration of our draft proposal for next year. We share the same priorities. It is very clear to me that budgetary efforts nowadays should be undertaken in close conjunction with the growth, jobs and competitiveness agenda of the European Union. This should not be just an illusion of a growth strategy; it should be very well equipped with money.</p>
<p class="contents">We notice that Parliament is very restrained as to the level of commitments. That is why it is leaving some unallocated margins for unforeseen events, and it is easy to foresee that this will also be needed for next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Friday we adopted the amending budget for agriculture for next year that more or less confirms our early estimates, but as Mr La Via clearly stated, the main sensitive issue is the level of payments. We cannot endorse the Council’s decision to cut our proposal by more than EUR 5 billion, because this is simply contradicting earlier announcements on the growth and jobs agenda for Europe: they were made in June, and in July come cuts of that amount. This ignores the reality of what is really needed this year, and next, and we cannot simply continue with the systematic underfunding of the European budget, as it is hindering the implementation of so many programmes. This year we should also base our programming of the implementation of the budget – which is now more than EUR 10 billion bigger than last year (an indication of the maturity of many programmes) – on the need to cover this year all that should be paid this year in order to enter next year with a clear vision of what is really needed in 2013 and not carry forwards all the accumulated problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In some areas we are really running short of money. For example, for the Social Fund we have to stop payments in the area of competitiveness, as there are no more resources available. There is a very high level of implementation generally in cohesion funding. As for the research grants, they already needed to be reinforced back in July. So the tension this year indicates the need for an amending and correcting budget for this year in order to cover what is really needed in the remaining period of this year before we can discuss and agree on the 2013 level.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the position on administration that Mr Vaughan takes is the right one. We should be constrained, but of course there are limits to savings, given the new responsibilities of the European Union. So this should be below the level of inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our letter of executability is coming soon in order to complete the full picture. That is also about pilot projects and preparatory actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we are not happy with the reserves, but I understand that we could end the conciliation after the written explanations without reserves. Our role is to submit everything that is needed as the basis for sound programming for 2013 so that Parliament has a full picture of what is really reasonable in the 2013 budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The budget of the common foreign and security policy should be more transparent and more detailed than hitherto. Crisis management operations and special representatives’ budgets should appear separately in their own budget lines. This would give the budgetary authority, Parliament, and citizens a better indication and more information about where money is used. It would also make it easier to request money for a specific item. Money is not the problem facing the European common foreign and security policy, rather the problem is that the EU does not have a common will, a common line. The priorities of the EU’s foreign policy have not been set, and, as a general rule, there are two lines.</p>
<p class="contents">I would again highlight the external action service budget in which a 6 % increase is proposed. That’s a large increase. I do appreciate that this is a new way of working, but here, too, consideration must be given to where savings can be made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we have reinstated the totally incomprehensible cuts the Council made to the Commission proposal. After all, the Commission did also subscribe to the commitment to sustained growth. In any case, the Commission was already being very cautious when it drew up the budget. It provided for a rise of no more than 0.72 % for climate and environment policy. In plain words, that simply means a cut. For the inflation rate is in fact 2 %.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more dubious is what the Council is doing with the agencies. Let us make it quite clear: the Commission has already included the minus 1 % for staff in its proposal, and, moreover, it is as usual also reducing the appropriations the agencies regard as necessary. That means the available budget for the agencies is pretty low from the outset. And then the Council comes along and snips away at it even more. Soon we will be down to the bare bones! This most affects the agencies to which the legislator, i.e. the Council and the EP together, have transferred new tasks. They cannot fulfil them if they do not receive adequate funding.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect the Commission to produce a supplementary and rectifying budget as soon as possible in any case and at all events. We expect the Council to take on board our good arguments when it negotiates with Parliament.

In line with the rapporteur, I am obviously fully in agreement, and can declare my agreement, that there is a need for more Europe and not less Europe. It is, therefore, obviously gratifying that the Committee on Budgets supports lifelong learning, the programme for 2013 that is at the heart of efforts towards achieving growth in the 2020 strategy. We obviously have to continue to ensure that students, teachers and academics have the necessary mobility. These programmes are crucial in ensuring the growth we all need. It is, therefore, obviously a matter of great concern that the Council has decided to cut the payments. This is close to being absurd, and is completely the wrong signal to give in the situation we are now in.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to sport, we have a number of actions under way, and there continues to be broad support for us being able to test these areas before we obtain an actual sports programme in 2014, and that is obviously also really, really good.

<p class="contents">I should like to highlight the issues relating to the 3.89 % increase in this year’s budget for the European Ombudsman and to point out that this increase is due to technical reasons, such as the increase in rent in Strasbourg and the necessity of moving to new offices in Brussels because the European Parliament decided to convert the current offices into a museum. As a result, the cost is not flexible and it should not be thought that there is a real increase in the cost of the European Ombudsman’s procedures in relation to this move, which has a cost, at a time of crisis, for Parliament. Finally, I should like to note that the increase in credits for contract workers of approximately EUR 110 000 is, according to the information we have, completely natural and is subject to the general Staff Regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr La Via, as the rapporteur for this budget, for all his magnificent work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like the Council to know that, for European socialists, this position is the very bottom line, because we are convinced that more can be done. We believe that there is room for manoeuvre within this budget and that there are many European programmes to which more resources can be allocated.</p>
<p class="contents">In January, the members of the European Council issued a statement in which they emphasised the need to invest in growth and jobs. In June, at another Council meeting, they decided on a ‘Compact for Growth and Jobs’, and yet they have done nothing to put this initiative in train.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the budget can help to do so, and, to that end, we have submitted amendments aimed at supporting all those programmes which reflect our priorities: SMEs, education, youth, research and innovation through the Seventh Framework Programme, and not forgetting development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures has the Council put in train? What budgetary measures has it taken to ensure that those programmes come to fruition? None. Not only has it made no proposals, it has even proposed cutting the budget by EUR 1 billion. It is continuing to impose austerity as the sole recipe for tackling the crisis. We told them then that they were wrong, and they didn’t take any notice of us. Unfortunately, events are now proving us correct. They are not calming the markets; macroeconomic data are not improving; deficit figures continue to escalate and, what is worse, citizens are having a very bad time of it and many countries, as a result of that austerity, no longer have a welfare state to help them to survive the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">How long is it going to take you to realise that we need to change course? Members of the Council, you carry on ploughing the same furrow – we saw it here today – not only are you cutting back on your commitments for the coming year, you are also cutting pay, just like you did last year and the year before.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mavroyiannis, cutting pay means failing to fulfil commitments; it means that you have decided not to pay your bills; it means that many programmes will have to be halted, such as the Erasmus grants; it means that many of our town councils and regions will not receive the money that they have already invested in projects which are financed by European funds. This Parliament is not going to allow that to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position on this matter is unwavering and clear: if you fail to allocate the necessary money in order to prevent a recurrence of what is happening this year with regard to pay, Parliament is going to say no to your budget proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe sees it as a consequence of commitments entered into earlier. Contracts simply have to be fulfilled. If payments really need to be reduced, there is one very simple solution: to cut back on commitments. That is what the ALDE Group has tried to do in this budget procedure. We have said that it should be possible to reduce commitments by 5 % for the countries that do not make good use of their Structural Funds. Unfortunately, that proposal could not count on a majority, and we did not present it again. But we firmly believe that commitments have to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">If the budget authority – the Council and Parliament – initially voted to implement certain projects and the contracts were signed, then you can’t say later, ‘I’m afraid we need to economise now’ and ‘we don’t have the money’. That’s not on! A self-respecting government has to honour its contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, every year, money is refunded to the Member States because the accounts that are now presented to us are not submitted early enough. In the opinion of the ALDE Group, if those accounts are submitted too late, that does not mean that they no longer need to be paid. We therefore find this 6.8 % increase in the budget very hard to justify. We are fully prepared to listen to the Council, we are always willing to let ourselves be convinced, but, at the moment, we find the Commission’s arguments stronger than the Council’s. I should also like to ask the Council whether it is true that the original estimates that were submitted by the Member States were even higher than the 6.8 % that the Council is now asking for? I should be grateful for an official answer from the Council. Were the original estimates by the Member States, where the Member States were asking individually and not collectively, higher than 6.8 % or not?</p>

I deeply regret the fact that the Council can still not find the right balance between austerity and the need to boost growth at European level. We need sustainable growth! We need to make progress in combating climate change! We have to bring forward the energy revolution. We have to invest in renewable energy because that creates new jobs. And, above all, we have to instil new confidence in the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But how can you instil the hard-pressed people with new confidence when they find that, even now, in 2012, the Commission is no longer in a position to pay out the money for the European Social Fund? Surely you are sending absolutely the wrong signal here. And that is why I very strongly criticise the approach the Council is taking here, in now failing to make the necessary appropriations available for the agreements it subscribed to in the first place. Let me repeat that this undermines people’s confidence in the European project and in the European Council’s sense of responsibility. It is a wrong policy and that is why we must reject it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just heard that there are now payment problems even with programmes such as Lifelong Learning – programmes that really are directed at individual citizens, at students and schoolchildren. This situation just cannot go on! Things must change next year. If you want to create more confidence in Europe’s ability to act at European level, then you cannot cut this budget in the way the Council is currently proposing to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens take the view that of course we also have to propose savings: for instance in regard to the ITER nuclear fusion reactor, which unfortunately a majority here in Parliament and in the Council want to fund. We do not think that sets the right signal at a time when we need an energy revolution and we believe that instead we must focus more on wind energy, photovoltaics and other sustainable energy sources. A brief word to say that we are prepared, even where it affects us ourselves, to handle the resources in a very responsible and careful manner. As Mr Vaughan has said, we have only a 1.9 % increase in the European budget. We MEPs could in fact save even more if we were prepared to give up short-haul business flights. I hope Members will give that some thought! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular I want to mention Derek Vaughan with Parliament’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in one vital area we cannot agree: notably the overall size of the budget. This is a critical time for financing in all the Member States’ national budgets, and in particular they have an urgent need to direct all possible resources to creating jobs and restoring growth within their economies. To that end there are two ways in which we in the European Parliament can help.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we can control the size of our budgetary demands. If we do that, we reduce the burden of cost on the Member States. But secondly, we can set an example. Of course we support jobs and growth, but I consider that much of the money which we need to do that could be found from savings elsewhere in the budget – indeed, it <span class="italic">must</span> be found from savings. I also acknowledge the problems with payments caused by the ‘reste à liquider’ issue, and I would recommend that in the long term this Parliament, as a scrutinising body, needs to take steps to address this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">However, for the 2013 budget, I urge this House to show more ambition. I urge it to support the Council’s demand for restraint by freezing the size of the budget. By doing this, it could send a very clear message to the electorate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The governments that announced their commitment to employment and growth at the June Summit are the same governments that have imposed unprecedented austerity on Europeans, and that have increased the number of unemployed. They also wish to make work permanently insecure and seek to withdraw all acquired rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore no surprise that their proposal on the EU budget fuels that unchecked austerity. Over the past four years, all they have been able to do is cut, and 2013 will be no different.</p>
<p class="contents">They want to make cuts in European research, education and training programmes and regional development and cohesion, as if the EUR 9 billion of cohesion funds and the European Social Fund in arrears, I repeat, in arrears, were not already enough for countries such as Portugal, Greece, Spain, and Italy, putting various programmes at risk, including Erasmus.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Parliament is trying, to a certain extent, to reverse some of the more swingeing government cuts, such as the Seventh Framework Programme, Erasmus Mundus and Intelligent Energy, by actually going beyond the Commission proposal. It also true that the proposal has raised the appropriation for aid to Palestine, and that the European Parliament has taken the initiative to cut almost EUR 9 million from its own expenses, which I personally regard as clearly insufficient. Unfortunately, however, these proposals are not enough to change the nature of the EU budget and to counter divisive and recessionary austerity policies when solidarity-based policies are needed. In any event, one thing we cannot accept is the fact that the only institution with direct democratic legitimacy, that is, Parliament, is excluded from negotiations with the governments. For that very reason, as we have seen, leaving decisions exclusively to the governments makes no sense at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot help thinking of them today, when we are debating the 2013 budget. How do I explain to them that the Commission wants a 6.8 % increase in the 2013 budget? I can certainly tell them that subsequently the Council of national Ministers was angry about the increase and was not willing to approve it.</p>
<p class="contents">If I have to tell them, though, that the European Parliament wants an even bigger increase, as much as 7 %, that is impossible for me to explain! Mr President, I cannot explain that, nor do I wish to. We cannot saddle our parents, who have built our countries up, and our children, who should be able to go on living in hope in the future, with such a terrible proposal by the Commission and this Parliament. So the most sensible thing we can do today is to throw the Commission proposal straight in the wastepaper bin and ask for a different budget proposal, this time with substantial savings and a sizeable reduction in the 2013 budget. The PVV cannot settle for less, nor, I hope, can any other sensible Members of this Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents">There is a problem here, but it is a political one: there are some groups and individuals here who do not understand or do not subscribe to the concept of European added value as being the way in which the Union budget has an added effect and a very positive one on the economy of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems perfectly normal to me that some MEPs should not agree with it and want to reduce the budget by around 10 % or 20 %, or indeed end up without a Community budget, and why not? That would be the best saving that you could make… My concern, however, is that the Council itself has lost sight of what European added value is. Shall I tell you why? It is because the Union budget is managed by Finance Ministers, whereas the Union budget should be discussed by Ministers for European Affairs, who have an idea of what Europe is all about, not Finance Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem points to why we will never agree on the budget and why we will never reach agreement on the forthcoming financial perspectives. The 2013 budget illustrates this point perfectly: they gave us a few commitment appropriations to enable us to launch a few Community programmes, and yet they are denying us the possibility of obtaining enough payment appropriations to carry out those programmes. By acting in this way, all we are doing is increasing the frustration of European citizens and playing into the hands of those who feel that the Union budget is pointless. It is not pointless; it is the most useful instrument we have in Europe for promoting growth and jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have done a very good job at an extremely difficult time. Very few citizens are aware that there is a trend for the EU budget actually to fall as a proportion of the Member States’ economies. Most people believe that it is merely growing and growing. That is not true. It is falling despite the EU having gained new tasks and new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, the European Parliament, in view of the economic crisis, is very cautious about 2013. Our proposal largely means a freeze in terms of new budget commitments. The reason why we nevertheless do not accept a cut in the budget is that we feel that it might worsen the crisis. The budget in fact consists of job-creating and growth-creating investments with a redistribution profile marked by solidarity to the benefit of the most vulnerable countries, regions, young unemployed and so on. In many of these countries, there would be no job-creating investments without EU support.</p>
<p class="contents">The most controversial issue appears to be the payment appropriations. This ought to be a technical issue. It ought to be self-evident that budget decisions that are taken must be implemented, that contracts must be paid for, that exchange students must receive remuneration and so on. It is simply not acceptable that important programmes such as Erasmus and the Social Fund are now finding it difficult to carry out their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Our assessment is that the Commission’s proposals for payment appropriations for next year are not excessive but are exactly what is needed. It is very good that Mr Lewandowski, Member of the Commission, has now started talking seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a few words about Parliament’s own budget. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has, for several years, advocated savings without jeopardising parliamentary work. We are now continuing with this line. We are in agreement on a rate of increase of 1.9 %, including the costs of Croatian accession. There is, in fact, a real slimming-down of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would really need to make progress on the issue of Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg. The Committee on Budgets has now, partly on my suggestion, by a large majority adopted a more detailed proposal than previously, which requires a ‘roadmap’, an action plan, in order to tackle the issue in practice. There are ways of resolving this with respect for history, without harming the city of Strasbourg and its citizens. In the longer term, it is unreasonable to adopt a solution that results in high costs every year and, in addition, is a heavy burden both on the environment and on working conditions in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here, SMEs and young people once again have pride of place. In fact, however, we note with great surprise that most of the Council’s cuts are to the commitment authorisations under Heading I. That is the most important heading if we are to achieve the 2020 objectives at all. Precisely at a time of severe structural crisis, people must be offered every chance of qualifying for a job.

<p class="contents">The political objective is to fund those commitments already made, and in particular to give positive follow-up to the growth pact which was adopted by the European Council in June. Last week, the European Council drew attention to the slowness of its implementation. From our point of view, its implementation presupposes a minimum budgetary amount, concentration on research and development programmes, university exchanges and innovation under Heading 1a.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have a methodological objective: to treat payment appropriations from the technical rather than the political point of view. The level of the payments has soured the budgetary debate for the past three years. It should never have become a political problem, and if it has become one, this is because the administrative machinery was badly designed. It is not working properly in the national capitals, between the national capitals and Brussels, and even in Brussels itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Parliament we are making a specific proposal: to ask each country to centralise its requests for payment within a single authority. That central authority would verify the level of need, would certify it, make it public and convey it officially to Brussels. The Commissioner would not have to do anything more than make additions. Then the political authorities, Ministers on the one hand and Members of Parliament on the other, would negotiate again regarding the real political dimension of the budget, in other words the commitment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">As we sit here talking, programmes as important as the Social Fund, rural development, innovation, the framework research programme and Erasmus are having their payments stopped. As Commissioner Lewandowski said, we cannot leave the Union in a situation which no government wanted and which no citizen can understand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The week before that, several hundred innovative enterprises took part in various conferences held at the European Parliament. A week and a half ago, I had occasion to welcome 250 young entrepreneurs who had participated in the ‘Erasmus for All’ programme to a gala dinner. Some 5 000 small-business owners have already taken part in that programme. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, our words and deeds must point in the same direction! We on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy therefore consider it unacceptable that the Council and Commission have tabled a motion to curtail the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme, the Research and Development Programme and the Digital Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not what we have promised, and this is not what our voters and entrepreneurs expect of us. We have promised to ensure growth and employment. I would therefore like to encourage you to adopt the motion by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on Budgets to restore these lines to their original state. Commissioner, for the past two years – so we are now in the third year – we have been fighting a serious battle together to find sources of ITER funding. We consider this programme to be important, but we have also always emphasised, and would like to emphasise now, the fact that this cannot be to the detriment of other research and development programmes. I sincerely hope that we are nearing the end of this nightmare – which has been going on here for years on this point – and that this matter will be resolved in the next seven-year budget. I encourage you to think about young people, to think about the future and to invest resources in them. Thank you for listening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This does not mean ignoring the need for budgetary restraint; cuts must be made, but they must be made in areas which do not harm our priorities. Mr Vaughan has done a great job in this direction.

The European Union budget serves not only Member States but, first and foremost, citizens. That is why we are calling in our report for an increase in funds – funds for measures to boost growth and competitiveness and for actions that will help create jobs (with a special focus on employment for young people). That is why we wish, in particular, to increase funding for programmes such as the Lifelong Learning Programme, which finances the Erasmus sub-programme among others. That is why we are also opposed to all cuts to cohesion policy proposed by the Council. The Structural Funds are an instrument that serves, above all, to stimulate growth and competitiveness. They are the main pillar of European solidarity, a pillar that, in this context, is unfortunately frequently forgotten. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that 2013 is the final year of the multiannual financial framework, a year in which the implementation of EU projects will be accelerated, which means a significant rise in the number of claims for the reimbursement of monies already spent by beneficiaries. The Member States should, therefore, take their cue from Parliament and agree to increase cohesion policy payments, in line with the rise proposed by the Commission. Ultimately, it is not the Member States themselves who will suffer as a result of their obstinacy, but their own citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The creation of new jobs, so necessary in the present economic circumstances, is possible only if an adequate level of funding is guaranteed. I welcome the Council’s decision in June to maintain its position on the promotion of employment and growth, and I hope that this will also be reflected in the 2013 budget.

On buildings policy: the only reason why Parliament can still afford the luxury of two seats is quite simply that the citizens do not know enough about this silly custom. Just imagine the French Parliament meeting once a month in Marseille and, of course, charging travel and accommodation costs to the taxpayer. That would cause a huge scandal and the whole business – the travelling circus – would soon be brought to an end. Personally I would, of course, prefer Strasbourg to be the only seat because I think this Chamber seems to be a bit more stable than the one in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens know nothing about the European Parliament’s television. The idea may be a good one, as is the transparency it promotes; however, without effective funding for marketing, it is simply a waste of money.

This is not our invention. To a large extent we are taking as a basis and verifying very critically what comes from 27 Member States, both net payers into and net beneficiaries of the budget. I think Jan Mulder has posed the right question: what if we take at face value what is coming from the Member States for next year? If we took at face value – without downward revision – what was coming from the 27 Member States for next year, we should submit a draft budget which was 15 % higher for next year and not 6, 7 or 8 % higher, because we have critically revised what is coming from the Member States. It would be more or less EUR 10 billion more in the draft proposal. Mr van Dalen – who is no longer here – was asking on what planet our proposal was born. The planet is populated by the governments in The Hague, in Stockholm, in Warsaw, in Sofia, everywhere, and we are critically revising what is coming from these governments as their request for decent financing for 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the payments – the most sensitive issue in negotiations for next year – you can compare these to your monthly credit card bills. When the bills come in, it is too late to discuss them: you have to pay the bills, it is your contractual obligation to pay. That is why, especially now – at a time of austerity – we need to supplement the consolidation of public finances with a realistic growth and jobs agenda, as we have the tools in the budget, which is by nature an investment budget. However – and here it differs from national budgets – it also has macro-financing facilities for small- and medium-sized companies. Therefore we should exploit all the possibilities of the European budget rather than cut it, in clear contradiction of the announcements by the Member States in June 2013. I still remain hopeful for a decent budget for next year which will resolve the tensions of this year’s budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All your comments, criticism and disagreements are welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to make a small clarification concerning the way the Council’s position on the 2013 budget was interpreted. The Council has indeed scaled back the Commission’s proposal, but it has accepted a 2.79 % increase on the current year. That is definitely not a decrease. The Council has not made horizontal cuts across the board. We have established priorities, as suggested by Mr Torvalds, and we have examined every heading, policy and institution carefully and individually. We do not intend to let the Union run out of money. For instance, we have kept the over 8 % increase for cohesion funding, as well as the full EUR 55 billion for the European Council’s Growth and Jobs Pact referred to by Mr Lamassoure.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate has certainly contributed to clarifying our respective positions. Let me assure you that the Council will do its utmost to find an agreement on the 2013 budget within the deadlines foreseen by the Treaty. Thank you very much for your attention.

<p class="contents">It seems to me that most of the speeches made by MEPs clearly show that this Parliament intends to defend the EU budget as put forward by the Commission, because we are firmly convinced that the way out of the crisis will be found in particular headings and policies of the European Union: the research policies, policies on innovation and small and medium-sized enterprises, policies on employment – these are the priorities for this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we have proposed selective increases to Heading 1a; and if Mr Mavroyiannis criticises our going beyond the ceiling, he should bear in mind that, within that heading, we have made cuts and found huge savings while, at the same time, having to provide – still under this heading – for EUR 360 million in additional funding for ITER, which the Council had awarded and allowed for in the current fiscal period, using all the means available – including, obviously, flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, where commitments are concerned, this Parliament has not deviated from the Commission’s proposals but has made only selective increases; and where payments are concerned, we have enough to meet our obligations. As Mr Lamassoure said, this is a technical fact, not a political one. We have to honour the commitments made in previous years – including those made by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that, during this conciliation, we will be able to reach agreement with the Council on a satisfactory level of resources that can guarantee that the European budget has the necessary sums to invest in growth, development and job creation, and a sum for payments that is sufficient to honour all the commitments that have been made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Another colleague mentioned the House of European History. People will be aware that many Members of this House are quite sceptical about that particular project. I wanted to say that for next year we are proposing a EUR 5.3 million cut in the budget line for that particular project. Another colleague mentioned the issue of the single seat. Again I would say that there will be a vote tomorrow, therefore colleagues will have the opportunity to express their views and opinions on the issue of the single seat.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wanted to emphasise to colleagues that the joint working group I mentioned in my first contribution is still meeting. It is still looking at some of the issues raised by Helga Trüpel, on Members’ travel for example. It is also looking at a comparative study of the administrative expenditure of this House and that of the US Congress and Member States’ parliaments. That work is ongoing, and we hope to have the final report on that at the end of the year. When we get that report, hopefully we can make some further recommendations in terms of savings for the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of that particular joint working group and of me myself has always been one thing, and I will say it again for colleagues: to find efficiency savings – because it is possible to find these in this Parliament – but also to protect the effectiveness of Members and of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">So, although I know many Members think we should go further and find more savings, I also know that many Members feel that we have already gone too far and made too many savings. Hopefully, at the end of the day, we will reach a compromise which tomorrow will be acceptable to most Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, to emerge from the crisis, we certainly need a policy of discipline, but equally we have to put the question of the nature of our expenses in the foreground as we make our choices; otherwise this will turn into indiscriminate cuts which can do nothing but stifle the already tentative signs of economic upturn in Europe. As the rapporteur has pointed out, 2013 is the last year of the current multiannual financial framework, and it is essential to respect the balance between the commitments that we have taken on up until now and the payments that these entail. Having said that, I am concerned about the data presented by the European Commissioner for the Budget, Janusz Lewandowski, on the shortfalls that are having an impact on every item in the European budget – in particular about the cuts to the Erasmus Programme. Although I am well aware that the general trend in politics in relation to the budget for 2013 largely reflects views on the negotiations for the next programming cycle of 2014-2020, I would point out the importance of continuity at a time when we are supporting investment in training programmes for our young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to give MEPs, the only members of parliament directly elected in the EU, the right to decide for themselves their working place arrangements. It seems to me even more logical to give them that right when any decision on a single seat would, according to the latest estimates, reduce the operating costs of the EP by EUR 200 million a year. In addition to this saving, doing away with the monthly shuttles between Brussels and Strasbourg would reduce Parliament’s carbon footprint by 20 000 tonnes of CO<span class="sub">2</span> a year. I am therefore delighted with today’s vote, whereby a large majority of Members are asking Member States to re-examine the issue of the EP’s seat and workplaces at the next revision of the Treaty, by amending Protocol No 6. Once again, today’s vote gives a clear signal that MEPs are willing to play a full part in the budgetary and environmental efforts of EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Simultaneously, 25 million unemployed people in Europe keep reminding us of the importance of restarting investment, boosting job creation and rebuilding confidence in our economy. In this respect the EU’s budget should be seen as an investment tool to support recovery and long-term development. The 2013 budget strikes a balance between austerity and growth by maintaining support to investments in programmes and initiatives for competitiveness and employment, while keeping the levels of increase for the institutions’ budgets below the forecast inflation rate of 1.9 %. In the light of this, I deplore the Council’s approach, which seeks to make horizontal cuts in payments, especially under Headings 1a and 1b, where most of the programmes and initiatives responsible for the Europe 2020 strategy are concentrated. Such an approach puts at risk the fulfilment of commitments previously undertaken, as well as the delivery of jointly-decided EU priorities. Instead I wish to remind the Council that real savings can be made elsewhere, for example by reducing the working places of the Parliament to one. Our budget must represent and address the need of our citizens to overcome the current crisis and restore growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The quality of our budget will allow for a better development of the policies, taking full advantage of the opportunities they provide in terms of European value added, in particular in times of heavy constraint on the national budgets. Today, growth in Europe has been stunted because of the severe austerity measures many countries are facing. For this reason the EU budget must, more than ever, work to increase growth and jobs through research, development and innovation, and the better governance of the policies including certain conditionalities, flexibility, positive incentives, concentration of funds on growth-enhancing measures, emphasis on results, and simplification in delivery. Further to this it should aim to support long-term development and strategic European cooperation, and give additional support to Member States that are currently struggling to overcome the crisis. For this reason, I agree that further negotiation on EU financing must be reasonable and give due importance to programmes such as Erasmus, research and cohesion policy, and strive to make the EU budget a fairer, more transparent and more accountable mechanism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The single market connects Europe: it connects companies, people, policy. However, its establishment has its own price, which we must take into account when passing budgets. An example is the Energy Agency, which in 2013 has too low a budget for financial as well as for human resources to be able to implement REMIT Regulations. By implementing this regulation we will prevent the misuse of information and manipulation in the electricity and gas market. Limited financial funds move its implementation into the future. Who will be responsible if irregularities occur on the markets in the meantime? Will it be an error of European policy because we did not insist on a larger budget, or an error of national policy because they were making savings where they should not have?

Even though intensive discussions are taking place regarding next year’s EU budget, we must not forget that despite our differences of opinion, our common goal is the welfare of the Member States and their citizens. For this reason, I would like to draw attention to those positions proposed by the European Parliament that are important, balanced and ensure implementation of the most important EU priorities. First of all, it is very important to ensure the continuation of projects currently financed by the EU. We cannot stop something that the European Union itself encourages based on its priorities. I am glad that next year’s budget focuses on economic growth, competitiveness and youth employment. It is very important that the EU supports long-term investments in research, development and innovation (RDI), and financing the Member States’ recovery is just as much a priority. I understand the Member States’ objections to cost cutting in order to reduce their respective budget deficits, but we should not forget that EU budget funds are targeted towards future investment in our own countries. Economic growth is based on the development of energy, innovation, scientific research and education. Therefore, not only does the continuation of current programmes have to be ensured, but new programmes that have been clearly defined in the European Union’s priorities must also be created and financed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
