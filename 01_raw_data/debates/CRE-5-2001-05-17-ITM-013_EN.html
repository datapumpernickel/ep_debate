The health and safety rules applicable to me are obviously not being applied today. I have hardly sat down.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent persistent wave of redundancies by numerous large companies as the result of closures or restructuring measures has reached worrying proportions. Restructuring is often used as a euphemism for redundancies. These redundancies do not only affect the employees themselves, they also affect their families and sometimes, where they depend on one or two main employers, whole regions.</p>
<p class="contents">As much of the recent restructuring announced has taken place at European level, there is urgent need for the Community to act. A comprehensive Community concept should possibly combine innovative measures with an examination of existing instruments. I intend at this point to confine myself to the legal aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">First a word on quickly adopting new and updating existing legislation. In relation to the framework directive on informing and hearing workers, may I say that the Commission will complete its amended proposal on a general framework for informing and hearing workers in the next few days, so as to ensure that it can be quickly adopted in the Council. The Commission will press for the Council to adopt the directive on 11 June. We hope that a consensus will be reached. However, if necessary, we shall endeavour to reach political agreement by a qualified majority. We cannot wait for ever, especially in the present climate of insecurity created by the restructuring plans of numerous companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like once again to emphasise a decisive aspect of the Commission proposal in this context, namely the question of sanctions. I know that Parliament emphatically supports this action and shares the Commission's satisfaction with the progress made recently in this sensitive area.</p>
<p class="contents">With Parliament's support and the Council's strong political will, we can wrap this process up by the end of the year, which will be a decisive step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the Statute for European Companies. We also achieved another important, long-awaited result at the end of last year: the Statute for European Companies with provisions for worker participation. One of the most excellent and positive aspects of the Statute is the fact that it contains joined up provisions on worker participation which reflect the progressive approach taken at national level in the proposal on informing and hearing workers. This will certainly help ensure that better account is taken of the social dimension when European companies are restructured.</p>
<p class="contents">I am positive that the European Parliament will do everything to ensure that this legal act is adopted immediately after the summer recess.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to the revision of the directive on European works councils. The Commission will revise the directive on European works councils in 2002 but will continue to examine the practical implementation of the directive in the run up to the revision.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation and industrial change bring social problems in their wake. However, they can also be a source of prosperity for people and regions, if the change is designed and controlled appropriately. The main concern for governments and the Community is to strike a balance between promoting corporate innovation and growth, on the one hand, and preparing people for change and, possibly, the necessary protective measures, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">This was why my colleague, Mrs Diamantopoulou, announced a check list for corporate restructuring last week. This check list includes political instruments already available, namely legislation, monitoring procedures, financial help and tried and tested procedures. governments and companies must make optimum use of these instruments or devise new instruments. Dialogue, transparency, suitable participation of workers, anticipation, risk prevention and developing employability are the key elements in a European response to this challenge. Let us do our very best to develop these legislative and other instruments which will help us to put our ideas into practice.</p>

However, I should like first and foremost to refer to the European works council project, which our group has fully supported. I think the Commission is right to criticise how companies are behaving at present. The Commission report on European works councils, which we are currently debating in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – we have held a hearing on the subject – is most interesting. It proves that works councils have, as a rule, fulfilled their duties. We found out, interestingly, that restructuring, which may be necessary on occasions, can be implemented more efficiently if employees are informed and involved. In countries with more codetermination, such as Germany, there are fewer disputes and hardly any strikes in connection with structural changes to the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The spirit of cooperation and partnership which Parliament brought to bear at numerous points of the directive is such that closures and relocations cannot take place in the form of commando attacks but must be preceded by timely and comprehensive information for and consultation with the workers. This is often not the case. Ensuring there is timely information and consultation, before company decisions are taken, is a very important aspect and must be taken into account when the directive is revised. I hope that the Commission will introduce an initiative this year which at least ensures that the social partners are informed and involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you, Commissioner, that the current rules must be tightened. It is not enough for sanctions to be imposed solely at national level; we also need measures at European level. As you rightly stressed, we need the framework directive, because in numerous cases restructuring takes place solely at national, rather than at transnational level.</p>
<p class="contents">The directives on mass redundancies and safeguarding employee rights during takeovers also belong here. I would like to ask you, Commissioner, if there are any plans to revise these two directives as well?</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Europe of the future is also a Europe of the workers. Information, consultation and codetermination rights are in keeping with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Désir (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, over the last few months, a growing number of sudden decisions has been taken to make mass redundancies or to close down companies’ sites. These decisions are usually taken without any consideration of alternative solutions for safeguarding jobs, and are sometimes taken by businesses making large profits, such as Danone, or they may even come about as a result of mergers, which have just been authorised by the Commission, as in the case of ABB Alstom Power. In several cases, employees learnt that they were to be made redundant on the radio, their representatives were only informed of the decision a few minutes before it was officially announced, and, in the case of Marks &amp; Spencer, the decision was announced ten minutes before the opening of the Stock Exchange. I would like to welcome the Marks &amp; Spencer employees’ representatives, who are seated in the public gallery.</p>
<p class="contents">These events, like those which happened at Renault-Vilvoorde, have again highlighted the shortcomings of Community legislation, when it exists, and the urgent need to adopt, at long last, a general framework to guarantee workers’ rights to information, consultation and collective negotiation, in order to safeguard their rights and to enable solutions to be found, other than those that put their jobs and future at risk. Employees faced with these decisions must be able to count upon the European Union, on its legislation and on its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union cannot remain a framework within which the only restrictive rules are those of the internal market, competition and budgetary discipline, whilst social rules remain woolly, can be avoided and have no facility for imposing penalties if the rules are breached. I shall let Mrs Ghilardotti speak about the general framework on behalf of my group, and I shall focus on the two other aspects, which are the revision of the 1994 Directive on a European Work Council and procedures for mergers and acquisitions. The definitions of information and consultation given in the Directive on works councils are so vague that they provide no guarantee. To define consultation as ‘the exchange of views and establishment of dialogue’ is far too imprecise. We therefore need another guarantee to ensure that consultation does indeed take place at the right time, in other words, before decisions are taken, during the working-out phase, to ensure that the works council may give an opinion, propose other solutions, and that negotiation can be based not only on the management’s plan, but also on counter-proposals from workers’ representatives. I believe that we must at last ensure the possibility of referral to a competent public authority on a national level, as already laid down in the 1998 directive on collective redundancies and, if required, on a European level, particularly in companies with a Europe-wide presence so that, if the procedure of information and prior consultation is disregarded, or if the decisions are blatantly unfounded and other solutions could be considered both on a social and an employment level, the competent public authority can declare the redundancy plan null and void. The 1994 Directive must therefore be revised – I share your view, Commissioner – otherwise this text, which was pioneering when it was adopted, will end up being obsolete in the light of the new drafts adopted by Council, on the European limited company, or by Parliament in 1999, at first reading, on the Directive on a general framework for informing and consulting employees. Genuine consultation obviously requires information to be readily available to workers’ representatives and to be of practical value, such as the opportunity to hold meetings, to have access to experts, or to request support from unions.</p>
<p class="contents">My second and final point relates to mergers. I do believe that we should really be able to take the dimension of employment into account, and that is possible without amending the Treaties, simply by adapting legislation, because the Treaties already set the Commission the task of monitoring the effects of these decisions on employment. I therefore believe that the proposed questionnaire is essential but also that workers’ representatives must be able to refer to the Commission if, in their view, the merger plan is putting jobs or industrial plants at risk. I also believe that it is not only the Commissioner for Competition, but also the Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs who must, if necessary, be able to question the conditions specified if they do not provide adequate guarantees for job security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One year on from Lisbon, the outlook is bleak. The dream of a Europe in which the words ‘new economy’ are synonymous with growth and full employment is fading. The suddenness and the increase in redundancy programmes have made employees think seriously about the delays in building a social Europe. All companies are affected: market leaders who are long established in their fields and which act as windows onto society, such as Ericsson, Danone and Philips; players that have appeared in the wake of the liberalisation of transport, such as AOM and Air Liberté, who are making their employees pay for their failed merger and companies who carry off all the prizes for showing contempt for their employees, such as Marks &amp; Spencer, whose employees are demonstrating today in London. We offer our support to these employees, and to those that are here in the House. According to the Commission, a total of over a quarter of a million redundancies have been announced across the world in the last few weeks. The Commission has just announced its plan to introduce a package to provide effective legal guarantees to workers regarding information and consultation. This is good news at a time when employees who are up in arms are joined by a public which disapproves of unilateral action by employers. We have the responsibility of setting this high-speed train in motion. At the same time, we must quickly adopt the directive on the information and consultation of workers, in order to put an end to the scandalous practices of companies that challenge the social legislation of the Member States. We must revise the 1994 Works Councils Directive, give them real rights to receive advance notice of plans and to receive expert advice, and make them compulsory for all transnational companies of more than 500 employees. We must adopt the directive on worker involvement in the European company and ensure that their representatives participate in supervisory committees and boards of directors where the decisions are taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we need to reform our legislation on mergers and acquisitions, which takes no account of their social and geographical impact. The objective we need to pursue is a European social law that is comprehensible, workable, progressive and on a par with competition law. Our objective is to have a Europe that works on two fronts: economic dynamism and genuine social democracy. The Commission has demonstrated its will to make progress on this issue. All we need to do now is persuade the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is particularly timely today because, following the recent mobilisation of employees from the Danone group in Calais, the employees of Marks &amp; Spencer are now holding a large European demonstration in London.</p>
<p class="contents">In the eyes of the public, Marks &amp; Spencer, following its decision to close 38 shops and to make thousands of employees redundant has, like Danone, come to represent one of the most abhorrent symbols of the strategy known as ‘shareholder value’, of shareholder law and of the social irresponsibility of major companies.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the eighth time since the Michelin affair in October 1999 that I have spoken in Parliament to warn the Council and the Commission of the urgent need to confirm the social responsibility of companies and to establish meaningful rights for employees. Until now, we have merely received evasive answers extending the due date and the long-awaited revised directive on informing and consulting workers has been our Loch Ness monster: everyone has been talking about it but no one has seen hide nor hair of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European public is now demanding practical and meaningful measures. I feel that as far as the workers who are affected and many other people are concerned, the Union has staked part of its credibility on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, I would like you to give clear answers to three questions.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, a draft, revised directive on informing and consulting workers has existed since 1998. You mentioned it yourself and it is cautious and to my mind, quite inadequate. Nevertheless, the Council, to this day, refuses to review it. If I have understood you properly, Commissioner, you are going to push for the Council of 11 June to override the veto exercised by the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark and even Germany, whose Chancellor has just tried to pass himself off as a European visionary. You also intend, if I have understood correctly, to introduce a system of penalties for companies who breach the directive’s provisions. Have I understood correctly?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is this: the directive on establishing a European works councils dates back to 1995. To this day, only a minority of companies concerned has implemented the directive. Incidentally, these bodies are basically talking shops without any real power. The Nice European Council stipulated that this directive should be revised, and I quote, ‘by 2002’, which would require setting the procedure in motion immediately. I feel that the Commission’s working programme for 2001 ignores this problem. Why is this the case, Commissioner, and what do you intend to do now? Do you plan to give this future works council real prerogatives, such as the right to suspend a restructuring plan and the time to examine an alternative project to the one laid down by the management?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, and with this point I shall conclude, the European Parliament has declared itself to be in favour of systematic verification that social and employment obligations are being met by every company that benefits from Community aid. Parliament has also requested that, each time the Commission makes a statement on a company merger plan, it makes its assent conditional on the employees’ rights being respected. What are your plans on this matter? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As several Members have already pointed out, it is now three years since Parliament gave it its first reading. In these three years we have several times in this House debated problems of redundancies, mergers and company relocations, but the Council has never assumed any responsibility, has never had the courage to face up to this subject and make a decision, adding something to the laws and other instruments that the Union has and can use to strengthen its own intervention regarding companies’ social responsibilities. Now it seems that some countries have dropped their reservations, and so the conditions are right for the next Council to take up a position.</p>
<p class="contents">The information and consultation problem is one that has something to do with the possibility of intervening in a preventive manner so that the consequences of unilateral company decisions are not such that they place jobs, working conditions or the living conditions of workers at risk. For this to happen, however, it is necessary to reach a precise agreement, and Parliament’s positions from this point of view were highly specific even at first reading on the methods, times and content of consultations and information. In addition – and I am pleased that the Commission has remembered this – there is a fundamental instrument which, paradoxically, is regarded as a fundamental element in all laws except those concerning workers, i.e. that of penalties. There is no law on any subject that does not lay down penalties for breach of the law. Only in the case of workers’ rights does this still not happen in Europe. The directive on the right to information and consultation does lay down sanctions, and I am pleased that the Commission is maintaining this position. Parliament not only upholds the Commission’s position but supports the Commission in its position and I believe this matter of penalties will not only be confirmed in the Council’s positions on the directive but will extend to other legislation as well – works councils, mass redundancies – otherwise without a penalty instrument all these laws too will be less effective than we would like them to be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gillig (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, this morning, the President of the European Parliament received employees from the Strasbourg branch of Marks &amp; Spencer. They are seated in the gallery and I should like to welcome them. My fellow Members and I thought this morning that we would be able to reassure them that the dossier of the works councils and the information of workers was finally back under discussion. I hope that this evening’s debate clearly demonstrates our will to produce a piece of work that is consistent and which will lead to the directives in this field being updated. As you pointed out, Commissioner, we can no longer wait a new crisis to be announced to reassure ourselves that the legal instruments from which employees should benefit are at last appropriate, effective and provide for penalties in the event that European-level regulations are not respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Marks &amp; Spencer employees, like those from the other companies mentioned by Harlem Désir, demand, as European citizens, that Europe establishes frameworks for protection and for organising collective action, which as we all know is the only guarantee of individual rights in the field of employment law. They are demanding that these frameworks be established, recognised and protected and they are placing great hope in your words, Commissioner. The Commission and Parliament should also, however, demonstrate their political will by making any further development of economic union and of any new regulations conditional on the implementation of social provisions that stipulate new forms of regulation such as those that we are expecting today with the revision of the directives that has been announced.</p>
<p class="contents">The workers of the European Union, Commissioner, must not suffer as a result of European integration. They must instead be the main beneficiaries of it. Respect for workers’ rights and the building of a social Europe are the pillars which, unless strengthened, could dash all our hopes for building democracy in our Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission sees this debate as important support for its initiatives. I have the feeling that a real political tail wind is blowing and that we are in full agreement on the objectives. For which I also thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment on the specific questions asked. First, Mr Menrad's question as to whether there are any plans to revise the directives on mass redundancies and takeovers as well. There are no plans to revise them, nor does the Commission consider it necessary, because the scope of the rules planned in the new directives on information and participation is such that the two directives which you mentioned will then be able to demonstrate their real worth. The requirements of the new directive relate to the subject of the two directives which you mentioned, and we therefore do not believe that these directives need to be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Mr Wurtz's question is concerned, the honourable Member understood me perfectly correctly. The Commission is firmly resolved to do everything in its power now to advance acceptance of the directive on information and participation and to meet the deadline which I mentioned. I did indeed say that, if a consensus cannot be achieved, we shall work on getting the directive adopted by a qualified majority. You also understood correctly that the Commission takes the view that this directive must contain sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">You then asked if the directive on European works councils was to be revised. Yes, this is planned for 2002 and we have already begun to organise the preparations. As far as your third question on mergers is concerned, we still have to examine if and to what extent account must be taken of social aspects during mergers. The results of this examination are not yet ready. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
