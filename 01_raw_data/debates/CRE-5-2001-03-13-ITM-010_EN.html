<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the initiative we have before us to create a European crime prevention network is intended as a response to the growing need to fight crime. The necessity for greater and more effective international cooperation in this area, especially at EU level, has been recognised. However, we know that such cooperation is weakened by differences in definitions, procedures, structures, and so forth. There is therefore a need for comparable data in terms of studies carried out, statistics, penal policy, structural factors and so on, and on crime, victims of crime and criminal justice in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objective is to evaluate the various activities, and to endeavour to identify the key measures that are both desirable and practicable in priority areas, thus improving the European Union's capacity for response and the effectiveness of crime prevention policies both at national and international level.</p>
<p class="contents">These were the policy guidelines that emerged from the Tampere European Council, which led to the High Level Conference held in the Algarve in Portugal in May 2000 agreeing on the need for a multidisciplinary joint approach to crime prevention. It is vital to guarantee the safety of Europe's citizens, who wish to live in peace, and this increasingly means not only effectively fighting crime but also adopting intelligent crime prevention policies which also involve the capacity to understand and react to psychological and sociological phenomena which make people feel unsafe, or increase such feelings.</p>
<p class="contents">Prevention of this kind, which is necessary to reduce crime and the causes of crime both quantitatively and qualitatively, should cover all forms of crime, including organised crime and not forgetting to pay special attention to the areas of urban, juvenile and drug-related crime. This is an important and ambitious project, because crime knows no borders. So this network is intended to promote cooperation and the exchange of information between Member States, and the collection and analysis of information on actions undertaken and best practice in the field of prevention, with the aim of assisting future decision-making in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It could be said that there were two different camps in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. One camp was of the view that this network should be limited to intervention in areas with a direct European and international dimension, and the other focused exclusively on small-scale crime. I believe that the compromise amendment approved was a good solution, as it did not exclude any aspect of crime prevention. We are well aware that organised crime and small-scale crime are two distinct phenomena requiring different answers. Organised crime is a priority area for the Union and its Member States, whereas small-scale crime is primarily a matter for local, regional and national institutions. The role of the EU in preventing small-scale crime should be limited to promoting exchanges of information between national authorities so as to encourage an exchange of best practice and research while respecting the principle of subsidiarity. The citizens of the European Union are justified in calling on the Union to efficiently tackle the problem of the growing threat to their freedom and rights caused by crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that it is only by acting in unison that we can make progress in the battle against crime. This report provides us with a basis for establishing an efficient network which will allow us to fight crime across Europe in a coordinated way, but without limiting our scope for action. This is not an attempt by the European Union to arrogate powers to itself, but rather to optimise the exchange of information between the relevant authorities in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above this objective, the report also deals with the involvement of civil society organisations, universities and European institutions such as Europol and Eurojust in the crime prevention network. This is something we would like to see because it saves reinventing the wheel in terms of crime prevention in each individual Member State, so that available resources are used better. We welcome this.</p>
<p class="contents">This crime prevention network is also important in other respects. The network will provide the Council and the Commission with the information they need to draw up appropriate crime prevention strategies. This is to be welcomed, because it will give the various national authorities a greater interest in exchanging information with the network, not least because they will be able to air their concerns at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">This will also significantly speed up the process of coordinating national strategies. When it comes to organised crime and modern forms of crime, this is particularly welcome, as the national authorities often complain that criminals have the upper hand, because these authorities cannot react quickly enough to evolving trends and types of criminality. This will enable us to create a network providing universal information, greatly improving reaction times in crime prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">The network is also very important as regards the candidate countries, as it can help to get a better handle on the problems that can result from transition periods. We will therefore be voting for the report with our own amendments, and we are very pleased that those responsible for implementation are finally getting the support they need from Parliament and the Council.</p>

Within the European Union a new institutional framework to fight against organised crime has been put in place following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam. It provides for the development of common actions in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters while preserving Member State responsibility for maintaining law and order and safeguarding internal securities.</p>
<p class="contents">Parallel to this endorsement, the European Council launched two action plans for combating organised crime, aimed at overcoming disparities with national procedures in establishing more efficient judicial cooperation. Most of these recommendations have been fully implemented. The enhanced role of Europol certainly represents a major step forward in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the Tampere Council meeting present a strong political message, reaffirming the Union's wish to overcome difficulties in prosecuting all forms of cross-border crime while protecting the freedoms and legal rights of individuals and economic operators. It is important that all EU institutions work together to ensure a coherent strategy against organised crime. The primary motive of much organised crime is financial crime. The EU policy in the fight against financial fraud is pursued simultaneously under the first and third pillars of the Treaties. I support the extension of the mandate of Europol to investigate money laundering matters. There must be a European-wide political agreement concerning the framework decision on the identification, seizure and confiscation of products of crime. Certainly from an Irish perspective, the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau in 1996 has proved to be very successful in tackling this area of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Establishing safety and confidence when we are faced with cyber-crime is another area which calls for a collective response on a global scale, given the world-wide dimension of the Internet. Computer-related crimes do not stop at conventional State borders. It is clear that activities that are unlawful off-line will not cease to be unlawful by going on-line. A considerable number of actions to fight cyber-crime are already under way in international fora. The Council of Europe is putting the finishing touches to the world's first international convention on cyber-crime. The European Commission has also presented a legislative proposal on child pornography on the Internet, in line with the provisions of the Council's European cyber-crime convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the framework programme being brought forward by the European Commission to combat the traffic in human beings by developing effective cooperation across the European Union in judicial procedures in this regard, and also by establishing closer links with the accession countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our concern is completely different from anything discussed thus far: our concern is whether or not to stage another bureaucratic monstrosity. We are against this. We are against it even though we know that there is no Member of this or any other parliament, or rather, there is no sensible person on earth, I feel, who would not be against crime and in favour of its prevention. However, whether we want a bureaucratic monstrosity is another matter. As we know, when the European Union is unable to find solutions at institutional level, it resorts to monitoring centres, networks and bodies: monitoring centres, networks and bodies which, in actual fact, infringe the democratic rights of the citizens, entrusting them to institutions which are not democratically controlled. The Lisbon Monitoring Centre has been mentioned. I do not want to go into the issue of a European Union which widely funds a United Nations crime-fighting body. The United Nations decided to carry out an internal inquiry into how these funds are spent: of course, the European Union does not feel the need to do this. It was said of bureaucratic monstrosities such as Europol, Eurodac and Eurojust that it is precisely they which now prevent us from regulating criminal policies.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another reason why we are going to vote against the motion. Without wanting to detract from the rapporteur's work, it is the very proposal of the French Republic and Sweden which fails to apply the principle of subsidiarity in this area. As yet, we fail to understand what the concept of crime prevention is, for it is not defined anywhere in the proposal or the report. This is why we are going to vote against the motion: primarily because it supports this European network. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This European strategy is based on the principle that EU intervention is bound to give added value to Member State policy. But today we are facing a tangled web of programmes and a mountain of incoherent measures. In the field of justice and home affairs alone, we are now being proposed a sixth programme, Hippocrates. We can rightly ask whether having more of these programmes is the way to fight crime more effectively, especially since the budgets for the programmes are so derisory. What will be done with the millions of euros allocated to this programme every year? Furthermore, Hippocrates is not easy to understand. On the question of financing, for example, the share financed from the Community is not to exceed 70% of the total cost. Given that the Commission's partners could be universities, administrations or NGOs, how is the remaining 30% to be financed?</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing very precise is said about the definition of the proposed forms of prevention or of organised crime either. Some of the measures are, in fact, rather anecdotal, such as the provision in Article 3 concerning the annual European Crime Prevention Awards.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures are therefore being created and introduced with no regard to their relevance or effectiveness. It is time to stand back and think, rather than rushing ahead, and to take the necessary steps to establish effective cooperation between the national prevention policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that this network should focus as a matter of priority on the prevention of small-scale crime, that is urban crime, juvenile crime and drug-related crime, and the proposed Commission communication on crime prevention suggests the creation of a European crime prevention forum which would give priority to the prevention of organised crime. We believe that there is a great deal to be done to establish the relationship between organised crime and small-scale urban crime, and for these reasons we are pleased that Parliament is supporting this initiative by the French Republic and the Kingdom of Sweden. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
