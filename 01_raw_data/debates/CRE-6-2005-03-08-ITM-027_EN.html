<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bowis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I shall start by expressing my thanks and paying tribute to colleagues across this House who regularly attend the ACP meetings and contribute so much to it. I also pay equal tribute to the parliamentarians of the ACP countries, without whom this partnership and dialogue would not be possible. In so doing, I would also like to pay tribute to the joint secretariats of our Parliament and the Assembly, the interpreters and staff who accompany us, and the Commissioners, officials and members of the presidency who attend. This is a team effort and it is a team effort that we need to endorse and encourage. However, this evening I would like to pay a particular tribute to the Co-President of the ACP, Glenys Kinnock, who has been away from our circle for some time. It is very good to see her back this evening I hope in good health and ready to face the fray of the next Parliamentary Assembly. Her contribution is fundamental to what we seek to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is a new parliament. Slowly but steadily we have been taking on powers and becoming, I hope, more effective. The same is true of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly. That too has been slowly becoming more effective and, if not taking on powers, at least becoming more influential. The Assembly started somewhat tentatively. In the early days the European Parliament was perhaps dominant, but reliant all too often on separate House votes; whereas the ACP was a bit more on the defensive, often represented by ambassadors or delegations of only government parties. Now we see change. We see few if any separate House votes. We see a parliament of parliamentarians. We see the ACP gaining in self-confidence and indeed, most recently at our bureau meeting, raising issues about human rights in Europe; and quite right too. The ACP was, for example, raising the issues of the British Government, its attitude to Guantanamo Bay and its proposals for the detention of suspects, or indeed people with mental health problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we look ahead. We look ahead to budgetisation. We hope that will come soon. That will enable us to give proper scrutiny and proper control of the budget. However, when we do that we will have to balance that scrutiny on behalf of our own taxpayers with acknowledgement of the ACP countries’ right to a say in how money is spent; we need to be listening, as well as scrutinising. We need to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals and the country strategy papers are adequate in themselves and adequately followed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Joint Parliamentary Assembly has now developed an effective system of standing committees, firing on all cylinders and getting members working together. Despite the fact that during 2004 we had our European election and so things were more difficult, we managed with electronic communication to bring forth some effective reports. My own with Mr Sanga of the Solomon Islands on food aid and food security was an example of that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pay tribute to the Dutch Government for the way in which it hosted the Assembly in The Hague. I think it learned a lot from our experience in Rome with their workshops and their visits. I should also like to thank the Ethiopian Government for its hospitality and effective administration in Addis Ababa.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of a mind that, in Europe, we should continue to have one of the two Council presidencies per year hosting the Assembly, and perhaps to swap around the winter and spring to give the ACP Members a little more warmth of welcome in weather as well as politics. But a lot has already been achieved. In our debates we have a better balance of speakers from the floor and fewer long speeches from the platform, and we are of a mind that we should do more to support the new pan-African Parliament, perhaps with exchange of personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">But now we move on to Mali in April, when we will be looking at serious issues of human rights; humanitarian aid; post-tsunami development aid; working together to defeat poverty, hunger and disease; and to create the opportunities for achievement and the blossoming of those rich countries which make up the ACP of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I shall give the quotation from Yehudi Menuhin that I used in my report: ‘Peace may sound simple – one beautiful word – but it requires everything we have, every quality, every strength, every dream, every high ideal’. That is why we seek to make the ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly effective. I believe we are doing so and I heartily endorse the work that all our colleagues put into this.</p>

Over the last few years, the influence of the Assembly has increased. Its role in political dialogue has strengthened and will be explicitly mentioned in the revised Cotonou Agreement. The Assembly has become a true parliamentary forum, with lively debates.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2003, the Assembly took a major step forward by setting up standing committees. It is because of those committees that cooperation between the European and ACP members has intensified and the emergence of a broad consensus within the Assembly has become possible. The committees strengthen the role of the Assembly in monitoring implementation of the Cotonou Agreement, which states that meetings between EU and ACP Members of Parliament may be arranged at regional or sub-regional level. That strengthens regional integration and fosters cooperation between national parliaments. The resolution calls on the Assembly to organise these meetings. The Commission is ready to make its contribution to the success of the new arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would stress that the Commission shares your view on the Joint Parliamentary Assembly’s role as a model of cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both were good meetings, but it was, of course, a particular delight for me, being Dutch, that the meeting in The Hague was so successful. My compliments to all those involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw your special attention to a few points. First of all, relations with Zimbabwe. In The Hague, we once again managed to prevent the blacklisted representatives of Zimbabwe from attending the meeting. In Zimbabwe, human rights are being flagrantly violated and freedom of expression, association and assembly are being increasingly curbed, something that the report reflects. In Europe, we have a list of people who are responsible for those abuses, and we have agreed that those people must be barred from meetings held in the EU. More than once, Zimbabwe has sent representatives who feature on this list all the same. It is a good thing that we once again managed to keep them away from the JPA. We must persevere in our stance in order to increase the pressure on Zimbabwe. I would also like to thank the ACP delegation for their support in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the resolution on Darfur. The situation in Sudan is awful. It is the longest-running conflict in Africa, and, if the information is correct, 2 million people have now been killed and 4 million people are on the run. <span class="italic">Médecins sans Frontières </span>have, over the past few days, issued a report on the occasion of International Women’s Day in order to bring the issue of rape and violence against women once again to our attention. It happens, and that is bad enough, in all war zones, but nowhere on the scale as is happening in Sudan. These and other abuses were emphatically condemned in the resolution. It is mainly thanks to Mrs Hybášková that we managed to adopt the resolution without any dissenting votes, and that is quite a feat, considering the large number of African countries who were involved in this. I should like to congratulate her on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The ACP is a special delegation in the European Parliament, because it is a joint assembly that aims to strengthen democracy, promote good governance and protect human rights. Moreover, its capacity to tackle difficult topics and enter into political dialogue in the right manner has grown in recent years. The value of this has once again been borne out. Congratulations to Mr Bowis for the report. I am looking forward to the forthcoming meeting in Mali. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to begin by thanking Mr Bowis for his report, which reflects his own very strong personal commitment not only to the JPA but also to development. His particular interest, knowledge and expertise in relation to health issues have been of great importance to our work in that Assembly. His report shows that the Assembly has grown in maturity over the last few years. Its work needs to flourish and be reinforced in the ways indicated in the report, because the Assembly forms the very democratic foundations of the ACP-EU partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cotonou Partnership Agreement emphasises very clearly the importance of the Assembly, but omits to award enough importance, if any at all, to the role of national parliaments in our cooperation. It is very important that the forms of cooperation we have continue beyond the meetings with our parliamentary colleagues so that we can support their efforts, as elected representatives, to conduct dialogue with their governments, to scrutinise the legislation and actions of their governments and to hold their governments to account. Sadly, an inability to do this is often a feature of the relationship between parliaments and governments in developing countries. As the rapporteur suggested, with reference to the Pan-African Parliament, there is often a lack of institutional capacity. Parliaments are short on staff and equipment and often lack the basic technical knowledge needed to make their work more effective. This is an important issue and one we shall pursue in Mali. In fact, just the other day a Member of the Malian Parliament with whom I am in contact told me that it is difficult for parliamentarians there to exercise legislative power, because the executive branch simply does not provide them with information. I agree with Mr Bowis that an important part of our work is to build up this critical democratic culture in the ACP parliaments with which we work.</p>
<p class="contents">Central to this are the links with these parliaments that transit through the EDF and financing. As Budget Commissioner, Mrs Grybauskaitė will have a particular interest in ensuring that parliamentarians are aware of how this money is spent in their countries and also in the Economic Partnership Agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bowis talked about the committee's bedding-down. That is happening and the fact that people are slightly dissatisfied about the amount of time they have is merely symptomatic of how successful the whole process is.</p>
<p class="contents">The JPA continues to grow and flourish, nurtured as it is by our determination to increase our effectiveness and to ensure that both our political voice and that of the parliamentarians from the ACP countries are heard. The JPA has a monitoring and supervisory role that is unique. There is nothing else like it in terms of North-South connections between parliamentarians. We must therefore continue to ensure that we can effect change in the 77 developing countries concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are a lot of positive things to say about ACP cooperation and Mr Bowis’s work on strengthening the ACP-EU Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the concern felt by our colleagues in the ACP countries about budgetisation, I think it important for the role of the ACP-EU Assembly to be strengthened in those countries. If it is acceptable to yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to propose a slight change to paragraph 11 in order further to strengthen the wording. The inclusion of the European Development Fund in the EU budget ‘should be accompanied by a reinforcement’ of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly’s role, instead of ‘should enable … to be reinforced’, the former being clearer. In that way, we shall be expressing a clear desire to ensure that our friends from the South also have influence.</p>
<p class="contents">The low turnout at the committee meetings in Brussels is a major problem. The last time, there were only a few of us from the EU, which was a disappointment to our guests. A representative from Africa summarised the reaction: in Africa, it is regarded as impolite to invite guests through the one door and, at the same time, leave through the other oneself. This situation damages our relations with other countries, for, as matters stand, we are forced to choose between <span class="italic">important</span> votes on legislation and <span class="italic">important </span>cooperation with other countries. I would therefore ask the Conference of Presidents to review its decision and allow us to hold ACP meetings some time during the weeks in which the political groups meet, since no votes on legislation are held then and we can decide, internally in the groups, on our agendas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also clear that the work in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has developed encouragingly in recent times. We have obtained significantly more focused discussions, which largely has to do with the fact that we have a system in which we work in committees and prepare the topics. It is also a change for the better that we have meetings in different EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, a number of problems that we need to remedy very soon. Just as Mr Schlyter stated, involvement on our part in the committee work is disastrously low. I completely agree with the demand to hold these meetings instead during the weeks in which the political groups meet so that there is a rather better presence on our part. Certain ACP countries still send diplomats instead of parliamentarians, which is not particularly good. Moreover, we need to be better at following up a number of the decisions we take.</p>
<p class="contents">A very large part of the work in the Joint ACP-EU Assembly is about human rights and attempting to solve and prevent armed conflicts. It is therefore striking that the International Criminal Court (ICC) is not mentioned even once in the entire report, in spite of its being one of the most important tools we have in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We have certainly worked with the ICC on a number of occasions, but we could develop that work significantly. It is one of the most important and most effective tools we have for holding those who commit genocide and war crimes accountable. Because they founded this court and now operate it, the EU and a number of ACP countries have a common interest. The first two cases taken up by the Court concern Uganda and Congo, which are ACP countries. The biggest current obstacle to developing the International Criminal Court is the United States’s tough resistance. We can see how the United States now actively punishes ACP countries in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific which dare to sign the agreement concerning the International Criminal Court. We should do more in our Assembly to defend these countries both politically and economically when the United States withdraws its aid as a punishment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, given my recent membership of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I propose to make only three very brief points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the very limited response by civil society to the work of the Assembly. I do not believe this is something we should consider as inevitable or normal. Virtually no attention is being paid to it by the European public, which seems mistaken to me, in view of the fact that this type of experiment is original – indeed unique –in the world. We should perhaps reflect on this fact and plan to achieve a genuine step change in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is related to the first and concerns the need to broaden the political dialogue, bringing it increasingly into the public domain. Bearing in mind the current world situation, there is a powerful need to re-establish an open and frank dialogue between the countries of the North and those of the South. The experience of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has been a positive one from this point of view, albeit not without its problems. We need to make progress decisively and patiently in the field of human rights and towards a strengthening of the International Criminal Court, in order to achieve greater mutual understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final point concerns the need to understand that greater political trust between the European Union and the ACP countries can also be achieved by the parallel creation of a firm base of economic relations, able to provide substance to the Cotonou partnership agreement. This aim should also be seen in the context of the reform of the sugar regime, achieving a fair balance between the interests of European and of ACP countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He refers to the Joint Parliamentary Assembly as a forum for political dialogue several times in his report, and also encourages this Joint Parliamentary Assembly to strengthen the political dialogue and its own political role. He demonstrates that we have improved in recent years and during recent sessions and, in section 6, welcomes the fact that we have achieved compromise amendments and compromise resolutions with our partners among the ACP states. I should like to add, however, that it was not always the ACP states that insisted on a split vote, it was sometimes our groups, when there had been no majority vote at the plenary sitting of this ACP Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said several times, the creation of the Standing Committees is a good basis for improving the political role of the Joint Assembly, and I concur with what Mr Schlyter said: that we must consider how to improve their working methods. They provide us with the opportunity of discussing our requirements in greater detail, and also of following up our political requirements as appropriate. Following up the requirements – what has become of them, what has been transposed – is at least as important as setting them.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must consider how to fix the dates for these committee sessions, for, as has also been said before, it is disgraceful how few of us are able to participate. This is not, of course, because we are unwilling to take part in them; in reality, though, when the committees of the European Parliament are meeting at the same time, we have to attend those, sometimes in order to take part in important votes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
