<p>I would begin by emphasising to the honourable Member that the Directive in question does not deal solely with aspects relating to genetically modified vine varieties, but that its prime purpose is to adapt to technical progress Community rules on material for the vegetative propagation of the vine which date back more than thirty years, and thus to ensure the freest possible movement of this type of product within the Community.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would point out that the marketing of a transgenic vine variety is already a possibility, subject to compliance with the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the deliberate release to the environment of genetically modified micro-organisms, which was amended just recently on the basis of a joint text agreed between our two institutions.</p>
<p>The future Directive does not, therefore, constitute any fundamental innovation in this area, and merely confirms the new approach that has been adopted at Community level to improve the control of GMOs, whereby they are regulated sector by sector, following a so-called vertical approach. In giving its opinion on this proposal, your institution moreover confirmed its support for such an approach.</p>
<p>Lastly, let me make it clear that the Agriculture Council in January did not reject the proposal, as stated in the oral question, but merely deferred adoption to one of its subsequent meetings in order to have more time to achieve the broadest possible consensus on the future Directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The first ever EU-India Summit, held in June 2000 in Portugal, was a milestone on the road towards a broader and deeper relationship, and has created a strong momentum that both the EU and India are building on. The Summit adopted a declaration on the EU-India partnership in the 21st century and agreed on an "Agenda for Action". Both documents set out an ambitious working program and identified key areas, in which both sides wish to enhance their cooperation, namely :</p>
<p>enhanced political dialogue, including further regular Summits ;</p>
<p>protection and promotion of human rights ;</p>
<p>prevention of and fight against terrorism, drug trafficking and drug abuse ;</p>
<p>eradication of chemical and biological weapons ;</p>
<p>closer coordination in international fora and organisations ;</p>
<p>creation of a Civil Society Round Table and of a Think Tank network ;</p>
<p>strengthening of the high level economic and commercial dialogue ;</p>
<p>support for Indian economic reforms ;</p>
<p>enhanced cooperation in the information technology, bio-technology and telecommunications ;</p>
<p>protection of the environment and promotion of sustainable development ;</p>
<p>development of infrastructure and removal of obstacles to trade and investment ;</p>
<p>trade liberalisation and strengthening of the WTO.</p>
<p>Since the Lisbon Summit, significant progress has been made in the implementation of several of the agreed initiatives. Political dialogue meetings have been held at Senior Officials level (Paris 06.11.2000) and at Ministerial level (Stockholm, 04.04.2001). Dates for the second Political and Business Summits, to be held in New Delhi on 23.11.2001, have been agreed upon. First contacts between the Council Working Group on Terrorism and Indian experts will take place in May 2001. The first meeting of the EU-India Round Table took place in New Delhi on 29.01.2001 and will be followed up by a second meeting later this Summer in Brussels (tentative dates 16/17.07.2001). Based on its findings, the Round Table intends to make recommendations to the next Summit. The first meeting between European and Indian think tanks is currently being prepared.</p>
<p>As far as Community activities are concerned, several of the agreed initiatives have been advancing well, too. High level meetings of the working groups on environment and the "information society" were held in Delhi earlier this year. The negotiations on a science and technology cooperation agreement are well advanced. The 11th session of the EC-India Joint Commission took place in New Delhi on 06.02.2001 and discussed a broad range of trade and development cooperation issues. Both sides welcomed the increased trade in the year 2000 and took stock of the progress made in their economic and development cooperation. India welcomed the EC's announcement of &#x80; 200 million Euro to be available for India's elementary education system. India and the Community underlined their determination to intensify cooperation in the social sector development and the fight against poverty, notably developing basic health services and the education system. In the context of the high level economic dialogue, and following up a first round of talks held in Brussels in October 2000, the Joint Commission launched a second round of high level consultations on WTO. Both sides further agreed to enter into discussions on a maritime transport agreement, to start negotiations on a customs cooperation agreement and to explore opportunities to further enhance market access for textiles. Finally, the Joint Commission discussed extensively the preparation of the next EU-India Summit, and in particular the European suggestion for a joint initiative to enhance trade and investment flows. Both sides agreed to invite the Indian and European business community to examine a limited number of strategic sectors and to draw up a pro-trade and pro-investment action plan in time for the Summit.</p>
<p>In the light of this positive evolution, the Council is content with the overall development of EU-India relations, even if some trade irritants and areas of disagreement on foreign policy issues like nuclear issues and the CTBT persist. The Council will maintain its efforts to further develop the relationship with the world's biggest democracy, while at the same time continue to stress certain foreign policy matters such as these mentioned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0304"></a>

<p>Furthermore, the EU has regular dialogue at various levels with a large number of countries. Through this dialogue, in particular with countries which are not yet engaged in international agreements on disarmament and non-proliferation, the EU has repeatedly expressed its concerns about certain regional developments it considers endanger global security.</p>
<p>The subject of missile defence has been raised on several occasions during discussions between the European Union and the United States. The EU representatives have expressed the EU's concern about the potential consequences of a possible deployment of the National Missile Defence System that might involve a violation of the ABM Treaty. The EU would like to see the ABM Treaty preserved and echoed the views expressed by a number of Member States on the importance of maintaining global stability through an agreed security framework and on the need for full and transparent consultations between the US and its European friends and allies and also with the Russian Federation and China on this issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0310"></a>

<p>The Council recalls to the honourable Member that human rights issues, including torture and prison conditions, figure prominently among the short-term priorities and intermediate objectives of the recently adopted Accession Partnership for Turkey (adopted on 8 March 2001; OJ L 85, 24.3.2001, p. 13). The Turkish National Programme for the Adoption of the Acquis (NPAA) is an important landmark in Turkey's preparation for EU membership and the first stage in a far-reaching programme of political reform. It is a starting point for the fundamental transformation of Turkey into a modern democracy.</p>
<p>With regard to the political criteria for EU membership, a preliminary analysis by the Commission suggests that further efforts will be required in a number of areas. The implementation of the Accession Partnership, in the light of the Turkish NPAA, will be closely monitored by the Council and the Commission. Human rights issues are also part of the enhanced political dialogue between the EU and Turkey.</p>
<p>The EU deeply regrets that the hunger strikes in various prisons in Turkey have led to the loss of life and has urged the Turkish authorities to take all appropriate measures to avoid further fatalities. It has also reminded them of recommendations of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture in this regard.</p>
<p>The Council welcomes the intention of the Turkish authorities to continue cooperation with the Council of Europe in the context of prison reform, in particular with its Committee for the Prevention of Torture, and their decision to make the preliminary observations of this Committee (following visits in December 2000 and January 2001) available to the public.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0313"></a>

<p>It emerged during a hearing at the European Parliament that a large amount of aid is paid out to subsidise the transport of animals for slaughter, without proper checks being carried out to verify compliance with the rules on the transport of animals, that only a fraction of EU-subsidised animal transport operations are checked and that infringements of EU rules are a regular occurrence.

<p>The Council would remind the honourable Member that Directive 91/628/EEC of 19 November 1991 on the protection of animals during transport, as amended by Directive 95/29/EC of 29 June 1995, introduces a set of rules designed to implement a welfare policy for animals during transport. In fact, the Community does not subsidise the transport of live cattle but it grants export refunds for export of cattle and beef.</p>
<p>The Council completed this set of provisions by adopting on 18 December 1997 the Regulation (EC) 2634/97 of 18 December 1997 amending Regulation (EEC) 805/68 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (OJ C 356, 31.12.1997) stipulating that, in the case of export of live animals, the payment of the export refund shall be subject to compliance with the provisions of Community legislation concerning animal welfare and, in particular, the protection of animals during transport. Council Regulation (EC) 1254/99 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal currently in force also stipulates the above-mentioned criteria.</p>
<p>The Council is not aware of the dysfunctions referred to in the question and underlines that it has not received any proposal from the Commission to modify current legislation.

Of course the Council condemns any recourse to the use of such documents and is seeking actively to address the problem of illegal immigration in a broad and comprehensive manner. I would remind the honourable Member of the measures taken over recent months to tackle illegal immigration and in particular to combat the networks involved in trafficking human beings, starting with the seminar organised in July last year under French Presidency on the fight against illegal immigration networks. Initiatives proposed by France with regard to penalties for persons abetting illegal immigration and on carriers transporting persons lacking the necessary documents into the EU are currently under examination.</p>

<p>The Council is well aware of the challenges and difficulties related to the Kaliningrad region of the Russian Federation. The Common Strategy of the European Union, adopted in 1999, already called for closer cooperation with Russia on this issue. Subsequently, an Action Plan for the Northern Dimension in the external and cross-border policies of the European Union was prepared by the Council and endorsed by the European Council in Feira. It invited the Commission to follow-up on Kaliningrad, among other issues.</p>
<p>As a response, the Commission adopted on 17 January 2001 a Communication to the Council on the ‘EU and Kaliningrad’. After a preliminary examination, the Council at its meeting on 26 February 2001 welcomed the Commission communication as providing a good basis for developing further EU cooperation with Russia and neighbouring countries. It should, in fact, ease the addressing of specific problems related to the Kaliningrad region, regarding the movement of goods and people, energy supplies, fisheries, economic development, governance, democracy and the rule of law, environment and health. Currently the communication is subject to a more detailed examination in the relevant Council bodies.</p>
<p>On the Russian side, both federal authorities in Moscow and local authorities in Kaliningrad have welcomed the communication as providing a good basis for future discussion. The same applies to Lithuania and Poland.</p>
<p>The EU and Russia have agreed that the question of Kaliningrad will be examined jointly in the relevant bodies of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Such discussions have already started, and will continue on a regular basis. Furthermore, to gather first-hand information, Anna Lindh, the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Presidency and Chris Patten on behalf of the Commission visited the region in February this year.</p>
<p>Discussions on Kaliningrad with the neighbouring countries, Lithuania and Poland, will continue in the context of the relevant bodies under the Association Agreements. Finally, the issue of Kaliningrad can also usefully be addressed in the context of the Northern Dimension initiative.</p>
<p>While it is premature to indicate what type of solutions can be identified to various problems related to the Kaliningrad region and what instruments could be used to address these problems, the issue remains a key priority in EU/Russia relations. The Council will therefore keep it under close scrutiny.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0295"></a>

<p>The recent events in the Middle East are well known to us all. The need for a renewed peace process, not only involves putting an end to the suffering of the peoples concerned or stabilising regional security, it also involves future European security, even international security. Every additional person killed or injured means one step further away from a peace agreement and mutual understanding between the belligerents. The excessive use of violence has to be stopped immediately.</p>

<p>As the Commission has indicated on previous occasions, it is seriously concerned about the loss of life on both sides. Too many people have fallen victim to an excessive use of force. The Commission has condemned the extra-judicial killings perpetrated by Israeli security forces as unacceptable behaviour and as a threat to the peace process. But it is also deeply concerned by the killing of innocent Israeli civilians by Palestinians and deeply deplores the acts of cruel, cold hearted and destructive terrorism which have been perpetrated over the past week.</p>
<p>The Commission has little reason to hope that the parties will resume discussions soon. There is a wide consensus however on the need to launch simultaneous discussions on economic security and political issues: it is far from clear how this complex process can be started. The Commission is ready to assist in any way to facilitate talks. It supports the principles and mutual understandings which have been reached thus far in negotiations and it has urged the parties to abide by their obligations under agreements reached so far.</p>
<p>The Commission is distressed by the deteriorating humanitarian and economic situation in the West Bank and Gaza, about the destabilising impact the Israeli closure is having on the economic and social fabric of the Palestinian community and on the institutional framework of the Palestinian Authority. The collapse of the Palestinian Authority will set the cause of peace back even further, threaten Israeli security, and jeopardise efforts to promote cooperation and stability in the Middle East. The Commission has urged the Israelis to resume the transfer of tax revenues owed to the Palestinian Authority and lift the economic blockade. This is clearly stated in the Stockholm European Council conclusions.</p>
<p>As discussed at the European Council in Stockholm, it is needed to assess now how the Union can contribute to a resumption of the peace process. It will continue the dialogue with both sides and will repeat its pleas for an end to violence and to the economic blockade.</p>
<p>The Commission is providing aid to the Palestinian Authority to help it meet its minimum obligations. To this end the Commission will provide &#x80;60 million in budgetary aid in order to sustain the Palestinian Authority over the next six months. It is working with other donors to ensure that they also contribute to this support.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0315"></a>

<p>The Colombian peace-process is, indeed, a major concern for the Commission. The member of the Commission in charge of External relations has just come from Colombia, where he met President Pastrana on 27 March. The best has to be done to make the peace process irreversible so that it becomes a state policy. The Union's political and financial commitment to the peace process is crucial to this end.</p>
<p>The Community support package for the peace process in Colombia will be oriented towards actions that underpin the peace process itself. 105 M&#x80; of programmable aid will be made available by the Commission over the period 2000-2006: it will be dedicated to modernising administration, strengthening democracy and the rule of law, respect for human rights, protecting the environment and developing alternative crops. In addition, it is hoped that Member States’ bilateral aid focuses in these areas so that a coherent and properly coordinated package of aid can be presented. The exact geographical location of these new, planned projects in support of the peace-process is not yet clearly defined. We have a technical mission in Colombia right now: the delegation for cooperation will naturally depend on the results of this mission. A proposal for a "peace-laboratory" in the Magdalena Medio area - where ELN acts - is currently being studied and we are also looking for possible projects in non ELN areas.</p>
<p>So much for the projects planned for the future. As to the ongoing Community projects, they are financed under different budget lines: financial and technical cooperation, ECHO (to assist displaced persons), NGO-cooperation, tropical forests and environment, human rights and others. These projects are carried out almost all over the country.</p>
<p>The intervention areas for the ECHO projects are selected by taking into account the number of displaced people and their vulnerability. Financial and technical cooperation projects are elaborated together with the beneficiary country, (which also provides significant counter-part funding). Projects carried out by NGOs follow a "demand-driven" logic. They are submitted by NGOs who work in the field. In all these cases, the local population is involved in the design of the project.</p>
<p>The Human rights violations committed by the paramilitaries. As it can be seen on one of the enclosed maps, the paramilitaries are present in many areas of Colombia (and are expanding even further). Human rights violations committed by the paramilitaries are increasing fast. The situation is a matter of extreme concern, both in terms of the human rights violations committed by the paramilitaries, but also with regard to the guerrilla groups.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to stress that in all projects the promotion of human rights and international humanitarian law is essential. Personnel are well trained and they of course monitor the human rights situation. But the honourable Member needs to be aware of the fact that the security conditions in the field are extremely difficult, which may complicate the implementation of the package.</p>
<p>A final word on "Plan Colombia". As repeatedly stated, the Commission does not intend, within the framework of its aid package, to take part in any initiative with a military dimension. Plan Colombia remains a Colombian domestic issue. The package aims to support the Colombian peace process and the efforts of the Colombian Government to this end.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 8 January 2001 and 4 February 2001 respectively, the government of the Autonomous Community of Navarre (Comunidad Foral de Navarra – Spain), adopted the Decreto Foral 372/2000 and three Agreements regulating and laying down action plans for the use of 'Basque or Euskara' (Linguae Navarrorum).</p>
<p>Thousands of Navarrese citizens believe these government provisions to be discriminatory on grounds of language, over and above being unjust and contrary to the 'Ley Foral del Vascuence' (Autonomous Community Law on Basque).

<p>Threats to the safety of commercial flights have been a constant concern in aviation circles for several decades now. A number of international agreements have been concluded with a view to preventing illegal acts or punishing those responsible for such acts. At the same time, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and, at European level, the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) have drawn up standards and recommended practices intended to help States in taking appropriate measures. These have had a relatively satisfactory impact in that, for example, while, in 1970, one hundred or so illegal acts were recorded around the world, no more than six were recorded in 1999.</p>
<p>Accordingly, there does not appear to be any justification for the Community intervening, on safety grounds, in an area which comes within the sphere of responsibility of the Member States. Nonetheless, the cost of the relevant measures and the barriers to freedom of movement within the internal market to which they give rise could justify action being taken to reduce them as far as is possible without undermining their effectiveness.

<p>The Commission considers that the Community rules applying to the supply of certificate of conformity are clear. Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers10 (as amended, notably, by Council Directive 92/53/EC of 18 June 199211) makes clear that it is incumbent on a vehicle manufacturer to ensure that a certificate of conformity accompanies a vehicle manufactured in conformity with the approved vehicle type (Article 6.1). The same Directive also makes clear that possession of a valid certificate of conformity is a fundamental condition for vehicle registration purposes (Article 7.1). It should be pointed out that, by definition, the type-approval rules apply only to new, and not used, motor vehicles.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that failure to supply certificates of conformity can also give rise to internal market difficulties, particularly in cases where a new vehicle, purchased in one Member State, is presented for registration in another Member State.</p>
<p>Following receipt of a number of complaints from vehicle purchasers resident in Germany, the Commission has launched the necessary inquiries with the Member State concerned - Denmark. Following an exchange of correspondence with the Danish authorities, it appears that they have introduced some procedures which appear to remove the compulsory requirement, contained in Directive 92/53/EC, that the certificate of conformity must accompany the vehicle.</p>
<p>However, the Commission has received no complaints concerning Ireland involving the failure, on the part of manufacturer(s), to provide a certificate of conformity to vehicle purchasers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0267"></a>

PSOs may be imposed according to the provisions of the Regulation on market access<a href="#defann_23_2" name="refann_23_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 2</span>, where for particular regions it is economically vital to ensure that sufficient scheduled air services are provided where otherwise none or unsatisfactory transport services would be operated.</p>
<p>In both cases it is the competence of Member States to examine the need for such services and reserve the appropriate slots.

<p>Furthermore, Member States are free to decide about the development of an airport as a “hub” airport or, indeed, whether there is a need to distribute traffic between the airports of one airport system.

<p>It has been estimated that two hundred million fish are macerated each day on the small-mesh intake screens of Sizewell B Power Station which is situated at the edge of the North Sea. The number of fish which pass through the mesh and die afterwards is estimated to be far greater still. Billions of growing marine organisms perish daily at this one power station, including many which are protected species. Yet some power stations in other places operate perfectly well using air cooling systems instead of seawater.</p>

<p>The estimate referred to by the honourable Member appeared in a recent edition of the UK Financial Times.</p>
<p>While it appears probable that fish are killed by the causes stated in the newspaper article it is difficult to have complete faith in some of the numerical extrapolations made therein. For example, if 200 million fish are “macerated” at the Sizewell B power station per day and if, to account for other causes of death (pressure, heat, chemicals), this number could be multiplied by 10-100, this would mean that 2-20 billion fish per day and hence at 730-7300 billion fish per year are killed at this power station alone. If, on average and as a very conservative estimate, each fish killed weighs 10 grams, this implies that Sizewell B alone disposes of between 73000 and 730000 tonnes of fish per year. This seems highly improbable.</p>
<p>Much more convincing, however, is that it is excessive fishing which has led to the decline of many of the most commercially important fish stocks in Community waters and, indeed, elsewhere. This decline, which has been of the order of 50% since the mid 1970’s appears to be much more closely related to the build-up in the size of fishing fleets than to the development of power stations. It is for this reason that legislation intended to reduce fishing pressure on these stocks by controlling the activities of fishermen is put forward.</p>
<p>At present, the Commission has no plans in relation to fish deaths caused by power stations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0270"></a>

Will only 535 Members of the European Parliament from the present Member States be elected in 2004 for Parliament’s next electoral term even if enlargement has not taken place in time for the elections?

<p>On the one hand, it is advisable to make the distinction between the Treaty of Nice and the Protocol on the enlargement of the European Union, which will be applied when the Treaty of Nice has been ratified, whatever the pace at which countries join, and on the other hand, Declaration Nos 20 and 21 (the Declaration on the enlargement of the European Union and the Declaration on the qualified majority threshold and the number of votes for a blocking minority in an enlarged Union) which constitute the basic components to which the common position to be adopted by the current Member States on this issue during accession negotiations shall conform. The components containing these declarations will only be applicable when, and to what extent, they have been taken up in the successive accession treaties.</p>
<p>The answers to the honourable Member’s questions, in the event that enlargement of the European Union does not take place between now and 2005, can be found in the Protocol on Enlargement:</p>
<p>1) with regard to the European Parliament: in the event that no accession treaty has been signed by 1 January 2004, the number of MEPs to be elected in 2004 in the fifteen Member States will remain the same as it is today (a total of 626). This is a result of the combined effect of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 2 of the Protocol on Enlargement.</p>
<p>2) with regard to decision-making within the Council: pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Protocol on Enlargement, the new process for determining the qualified majority will enter into force on 1 January 2005, whether or not enlargement of the European Union has taken place, and will include the option that a Member State may request verification that the Member States constituting the qualified majority represent at least 62% of the total population of the Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0282"></a>

<p>Does the Commission agree with Sir John Krebs, Chairman of the UK Food Standards Agency, that, in order to be effective and credible, the 'Precautionary Principle' must incorporate the 'Proportionate Principle', whereby any proposed action in response to a perceived or assessed risk must be proportionate to the likely scale and scope of the risk?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission’s Communication on the precautionary principle has initiated a lively debate both within the Community and internationally. The Commission has taken concrete action to ensure that this principle becomes better understood and correctly used. The proposal from the Commission for a Regulation on General Food Law and the establishment of the European Food Authority clarifies the role of the precautionary principle in the management of risks in the food and feed supply. In addition, the Commission is actively pursuing an international consensus in several fora including in Codex Alimentarius.</p>
<p>In the majority of risk management situations, a full set of scientific information is available on which to base a decision. However, this is not always the case. Essentially the precautionary principle is a risk management tool which comes into its own in those specific circumstances where, following an evaluation of all the available scientific information, a risk to health is identified but it is clear that further scientific information is needed.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding some lacunae in the scientific data, if adverse health or environmental effects have been identified, decision-makers have to act and cannot wait for every morsel of scientific data to be sought and evaluated. However, measures based on the precautionary principle must be kept under review while further scientific data is collected.</p>
<p>This principle should not be misunderstood. Risk management decisions based on the precautionary principle are not based on an uninformed perception of a problem but are based on an evaluation of all the available pertinent data, scientific and otherwise.</p>
<p>The principle of proportionality is a legal principle common to all decision making whether the precautionary principle has been invoked or not.</p>
<p>In the guidelines to the use of the precautionary principle, as incorporated in its Communication, the Commission explicitly states that the principle of proportionality must be respected.</p>
<p>The Nice European Council supported the Commission’s Communication and also referred to the need to ensure that the principle of proportionality is respected. Indeed the resolution calls upon the Commission to apply systematically its guidelines on the conditions for use of the precautionary principle which includes respect of the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p>In concrete terms, how this principle is expressed, the nature of the action that must be taken to protect health or the environment, will depend very much on the nature of the risk, and the level of protection needed.</p>
<p>This may fall anywhere in-between the removal of a product from the market to much milder action, which nevertheless, protects against adverse health or environmental effects. Any measure should not only be proportionate, but its application must be practical and feasible, and where relevant, the implementation of controls must be possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0283"></a>

<p>I welcome the proposed revision of the directive concerning the welfare of animals during transport. However, I consider that the long­distance transportation of animals should be restricted. Transporting live animals over longer and longer distances, added to the highly intensive production methods used in livestock farming, increases the risk of infection. Are such restrictions being considered now that we can really speak of an epidemic?</p>
<p>Given that foot-and-mouth disease does not pose a threat to public health, the question arises of whether vaccination can continue to be ruled out. Will a decision be taken by the EU itself that supplies of vaccine should be used in order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, in place of the destruction of potentially infected animals on a massive scale? Will such possible action be taken at European level or will it be left to the Member States? Is the status of meat derived from non­vaccinated animals obstinately to be preserved at the expense of slaughter on a massive scale? Will the EUR 41 million provided be sufficient to meet the costs involved?

<p>The current crisis is leading to further calls for a review of the current animal transport practices, as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus has spread due to contacts between groups of animals of different origin and destination in markets, collection centres and staging points. This must be taken into full consideration when the current rules on animal transport are reviewed. In the meantime, as an emergency measure, the Commission has adopted provisions to restrict the movements of FMD susceptible animals throughout the Community. In particular, the use of the staging points as provided by the Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport has been suspended.</p>
<p>The use of vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease is hampered by several limitations. These include:</p>
<p>- Over 300 million susceptible livestock (cattle, sheep, pigs, goats) in the Community would need to be vaccinated on average at least once per year to give total coverage. Therefore vaccination would imply very high costs.</p>
<p>- There are seven strains of FMD, each with several sub-strains. Vaccination is only effective against the targeted strain and for a limited period only.</p>
<p>- No test exists to easily distinguish vaccinated animals from infected animals which allows the disease to continue to persist in the animal population.</p>
<p>However, Community legislation provides for emergency vaccination against FMD under certain circumstances. Indeed, a few days ago, the Commission has adopted two Decisions laying down the conditions under which vaccination may be applied in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom. The two Decisions are quite different as the situation in the two countries is also different.</p>
<p>4) Despite vaccination, vaccinated animals and their meat may carry and spread foot-and-mouth disease virus if they are infected with this virus. This is the reason why, in accordance with Community legislation and international standards, the vaccinated animals and their meat cannot be traded freely. However, if certain precautionary measures are taken, including de-boning and maturation of meat, Community legislation does not exclude the meat from vaccinated animals being placed on the market.</p>
<p>5) The costs of the current outbreaks cannot be precisely calculated, at this stage. However, it will largely exceed EUR 41 million, which is the current amount of the Veterinary Emergency Fund. The Commission is in contact with the authorities of the Member States in order to have more precise figures in this regard and then it will take the necessary actions in relation to the preparation of a draft budget for next year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0308"></a>

<p>This Committee has met seven times in the last four weeks.

<p>Regarding Community action in the field of marine pollution, the Commission wishes to draw the attention of the honourable Member on the Decision of the Parliament and of the Council setting up a Community framework for cooperation in this domain. Such a framework will allow closer cooperation between national maritime authorities in order to improve the level of preparedness and response to pollution.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission will in particular give priority to the development of actions aiming at improving the identification and prosecution of ships making unlawful discharges.</p>
<p>Reference should also be made to the recent Directive 2000/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2000 on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues under which ships are subject to leave their waste in ports rather than discharge it at sea.</p>
<p>The Commission has also presented a number of proposals aimed at improving the safety of the sea-borne oil trade and prevent accidental oil spills. Notably to strengthen Port State Control and the control of Maritime administrations and classification societies and to accelerate the phasing-out of single-hull oil-tankers as proposed in the first “Erika” package of proposals. The second “Erika” package includes in particular a proposal to improve the monitoring and control of maritime traffic.

<p>The effect of the amended version of the second and third sentences of Section 20(1)(3) of the ITA in conjunction with Article XXIII(5) of the Structural Adjustment Act (Federal Gazette 297/1995) was to make only half the cost of business entertainment deductible. Regardless of proof that entertainment costs primarily serve business purposes, the Austrian Ministry of Finance is of the opinion that, for turnover tax purposes, this must be assessed as 50% non-business consumption, pursuant to Section 1(1)(2)(c) of the TTA, ultimately making only half of the cost of entertainment input-tax-deductible.</p>
<p>In the light of the Court of Justice rulings in the Ampafrance case (C-177/99 and C-181/99) and the Fillibeck case (C-258/95) (entertainment of business associates by employees of a firm), is this de facto input-tax restriction, after the event, in respect of expenses which clearly serve business purposes, covered by Article 17(6) of Directive 77/388/EEC<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Between 1 January 1995 (Austria’s accession to the EU) and 4 May 1995 the cost of business entertainment was a general deductible expense pursuant to Section 20(1)(3) of the 1988 Austria Income Tax Law (ITA) if the taxable person had proved that the entertainment clearly served business purposes. The turnover tax payable on this was deductible as an input tax pursuant to Section 12(2)(2)(a) of the 1994 Austrian Turnover Tax Act (TTA).</p>
<p>The question states that the effect of the amended version of the second and third sentences of Section 20(1)(3) of the ITA in conjunction with Article XXIII(5) of the Structural Adjustment Act (Federal Gazette 297/1995) was to make only half the cost of business entertainment deductible.

<p>The Commission is of the opinion that limiting the right to deduct VAT after the event, despite the evidence that the costs involved were incurred for strictly business purposes and as part of taxed operations, seems to run counter to the right to deduct VAT, which guarantees the neutral nature of this tax, as established by the Court of Justice in its rulings of 19 September 2000 in the Ampafrance (C-177/99) and Sanofi (C-181/99) cases.</p>

<p>The Commission fully acknowledges the importance of the question raised by the honourable Member. Treatment that can lead to lasting positive changes of the situation for drug addicts is a cornerstone in achieving a reduction of the demand for drugs in Europe. That said, the Commission has no immediate plan to draw up a report on the result of treatment in the Member States, taking into account that the mission of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is to provide the Community and its Member States with such information at European level on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The Agency already collects information through the national focal points about different forms of treatment available in the Member States. A summary is published in the annual report from the Agency.</p>
<p>More specifically, the Agency published in November 2000 a review on current practice in drug-substitution treatment in the European Union, presenting the national country profiles and strategies. Currently the Agency is working on an overview of treatment facilities in Europe to be available by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Information on the results of treatment is also available elsewhere. Studies are numerous, but the access to those could be made easier. The Commission will consider supporting initiatives to streamline different databases in this field.</p>
<p>In the European Union Drugs Strategy endorsed by the Helsinki European Council in December 1999 one of the six targets set is “to increase substantially the number of successfully treated addicts”.</p>
<p>This target has been followed-up in the Union - Action Plan on Drugs endorsed by the Feira European Council in June 2000. The Member States are invited “to define clear guidelines for the standards and goals of treatment services, and to ensure the evidence based evaluation of the treatment according to those guidelines”. Furthermore, “emphasis should be given to a scientific evaluation of different treatment strategies”.</p>
<p>Defining success in the field of treatment is, however, a very complex issue. The methods for estimating success rates vary, not only from country to country, but even inside countries. Comparability of results is often lacking at national level and between the institutions and services.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addictions is currently working with a selection of national focal points in order to examine how the complex target of success could be approached at Union level through manageable and measurable indicators.</p>
<p>The candidate countries should progressively be taken on board, even if this has to be in the longer term. The Commission has received a mandate to start negotiations on the direct participation of candidate countries in the Drugs Agency and this should accelerate progress towards their integration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0293"></a>

<p>The Commission shares the honourable Member's concerns. Statistics show that children and young teenagers are the fastest-growing group of Internet users. They are also the group most at risk from contacts with paedophiles.</p>
<p>It is important to inform parents, teachers and children about the dangers and to provide practical advice. Technical means can also be used to block access to chat rooms. Service providers can offer "walled gardens" or chat rooms which are monitored, offering safe access to children. Where children are approached by paedophiles, they and their parents should be able to report this to an appropriate body.</p>
<p>Under the Safer Internet Action Plan managed by the Commission, Community funding has been made available since 1999 for projects which cover these areas. 9 awareness projects covering 16 countries are under way. A call for proposals has been published which covers walled gardens and filtering of Internet services including chat (closes 31 May 2001). The Commission will give a further opportunity to submit proposals in the next call to be published at the end of 2001. Hotlines for reporting illegal content operate in 10 countries and others are being set up.</p>
<p>The Commission will encourage the European Internet industry to exchange information in order to ensure that it is doing its best to contribute to finding solutions and will request the existing hotlines to make proposals for reporting incidents in chat rooms. The recently adopted Report on the Recommendation on protection of minors and human dignity shows that Member States, industry and the Commission are successfully undertaking particular efforts in order to protect minors from illegal and harmful content on the Internet.</p>
<p>The Commission has also long been concerned about the diffusion of paedophile images on the Internet, in particular child pornography. With a view to ensuring that Members States have common definitions and incriminations and effective sanctions in place to combat this phenomenon, the Commission has recently introduced a proposal for a Council Framework Decision which will include provisions for the approximation of national laws and sanctions in the field of sexual exploitation of children, with particular reference to child pornography on the Internet.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0297"></a>

<p>The Commission is fully aware of the relevant provisions regarding the principle of non-discrimination, i.e. article 13 (ex Article 6A) of the EC Treaty and Council Directive 2000/78/CE of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation1, adopted by the Council on the basis of article 13 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The Directive only concerns the Member States and, according to article 18, they have until 2 December 2003 to implement it. However, the Commission had already adopted a policy which is consistent with the provisions of the Directive and assures equality of treatment for candidates with disabilities in recruitment competitions.</p>
<p>When organising the 1998 competitions, special arrangements were made for visually impaired candidates in close cooperation with the European Disability Forum, a non-governmental organisation with expertise in the area. Inter alia, the Forum agreed to the use of Braille texts. In order to ensure equality of treatment, visually-impaired candidates were allotted 3 hours for the first and third test (compared to 1 hour for the other candidates), 1 hour and 40 minutes for the contested second test (instead of 35 minutes for the other candidates) and 1 hour and 20 minutes for the fourth test (instead of 30 minutes for the other candidates).</p>
<p>In addition, these candidates were provided with a personal invigilator in a separate examination room for the whole duration of the tests.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that it has respected the principle of equality of treatment and taken suitable measures in accordance with article 5 of the above-mentioned Directive. It will continue to seek to follow best practice, and its proposals for equitable conditions for persons with disabilities – published in Autumn 2000 and now the subject of staff consultations – give evidence of that.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On the Commission’s side, education actions are coordinated by the Directorate General for Education and Culture. More precisely, the eLearning Action Plan sets the development of public access centres as a priority.

The Social Fund has currently several regional projects with this objective, which is also requested by the Employment Guidelines for 2001.

<p>Currently, all parties are intensively working to implement the agreement under Article V of the Melk Protocol for the Czech Republic to conduct a voluntary environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedure with regard to the Temelín nuclear power plant, to be guided by the EIA Directive. The Czech EIA Commission has met in Prague with international participants on 13 February and 1 March 2001. The next meeting will be held on 4/5 April. As part of its good offices of mediation, the Commission assists and monitors the implementation of Chapter V of the Melk Protocol. Consequently, it has actively and constructively participated in the consultations of the Czech EIA Commission. In this process, designated observers from Austria and Germany represent the interests of their respective countries.</p>
<p>With regard to the modalities of the work of the EIA Commission, Austria and the Czech Republic concluded a bilateral agreement documented in the Joint Statement of Ministers Kavan (Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Czech Republic) and Molterer (Minister of Agriculture and Environment, Austria) of 13 February 2001. Accordingly, the decisions of the steering body shall take the positions of the Austrian representatives into consideration.</p>
<p>The Czech EIA Commission heard the arguments presented by Austria and Germany in its sessions of 13 February and 1 March 2001 in order to take them into consideration in its autonomous decisions. As mentioned by the honourable Member, the Czech authorities consequently published, in a transparent manner, the “scoping list” finally established by the EIA Commission after intensive consultations. Effectively, this list, although comprehensive, does not comprise all suggestions made by Austria. The joint statement between Ministers Kavan and Molterer does not foresee a requirement for full agreement between the Czech authorities and the Austrian positions. The EIA Directive that is to guide the procedure under Chapter V of the Melk Protocol does not even foresee the inclusion of neighbouring countries into the steering body of the EIA procedure. This is a unilateral confidence building measure offered by the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Austria and the Czech Republic have agreed that so-called severe accidents should be dealt with in a separate forum. Modalities are still being discussed. This forum has been convened for 4 April 2001 in Prague.</p>
<p>The texts of the “scoping list” and the decision on the separate forum to deal with severe accidents are publicly available on the web site of the Czech Foreign Ministry.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0305"></a>

<p>The Greek religious world, the Academy of Athens, the Archaeological Society, the Greek section of ICOMOS (an international organisation), the PEA association (the Greek Union of Architects), the opposition parties, the Athens municipal council and a great many European environmental organisations and scientists are united in opposing the location of the rowing and canoeing centre and other facilities required for the 2004 Olympic Games in the Marathon-Schinias area for the following reasons:</p>
<p>- In 490 B.C. it was the site of the important battle of the Athenians against the Persians, whose successful outcome was of immense significance for the development of European culture.</p>
<p>- The planned facilities will destroy the ecological equilibrium of the unique wetlands of the Attic basin and more than 170 bird species will be displaced.</p>
<p>What steps will the Commission take to prevent the intended location of this enormous project, which is being pushed through in opposition to the consensus of the people, to protect and promote the site of the battle of Marathon - of such significance for the history of Europe - and to give a higher priority to the wetlands?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As regards the environmental matters raised by the honourable Member, a complaint has been lodged with the Commission dealing in particular with the implications of the planned rowing and canoeing centre on the conservation interests of the Schinias area.</p>
<p>The Schinias marshes have not been proposed by Greece under either the Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds (Birds Directive) or the Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (Habitats Directive) for inclusion in the Natura 2000 network. Considering however that the site has been included in relevant scientific reference lists, the Commission has contacted the Greek authorities in the context of the aforementioned complaint case, asking for specific information on this planned Olympic project.</p>
<p>In their reply the Greek authorities stress the overall beneficial effects of the planned development, associated with the establishment of a national park on the area. Further to this reply and in the light of additional information brought to Commission’s attention, the Commission carried out recently an appraisal of the situation on the spot. Information gathered is currently under evaluation in order for the Commission to decide on the follow up to be given to this affair. The honourable Member will be kept informed thereof.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0307"></a>

<p>During the evaluation of the third Community support framework (CSF), the difficulties and delays in the implementation of ‘Cadastre’, the 5th sub-programme under the second CSF came to light.</p>
<p>At this stage, the Commission can only confirm the answer provided on 15 March 2001. The Commission is currently continuing to look into the answers given by the Greek authorities and does not wish to prejudge the outcome of this assessment.</p>
<p>Obviously, the Commission does not wish to punish or penalise any Member State but the Commission has an obligation to apply existing regulations.</p>
<p>Community aid may only be cut or withdrawn if, at the end of this assessment, anomalies are detected.</p>
<p>These appropriations cannot be transferred to other Member States.</p>
<p>In the current circumstances, the Commission has agreed with the Greek authorities that this project will not be included in the new Environment 2000-2006 operational programme. It was also agreed that the same amount would be added to the national reserve, with the possibility of returning to the programme at the appropriate time in order to co-finance environmental projects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0309"></a>

<p>Article 24 (1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agriculture products lays down that on application by the exporter Member States shall advance all or part of the amount of the refund, once the export declaration has been accepted, subject to the lodging of a sufficient security to guarantee an eventual repayment of the amount advanced. The entitlement to the advance implies that at least the following elements are in the hands of the paying agency, namely when the application for the advance, the export declaration duly accepted and a sufficient security are available to the competent authority. Once these elements have been processed by the paying agency and if everything is in order, the claim should be settle at once.</p>
<p>There is no time-limit for the release of securities lodged for the export refunds claims. The rules governing securities and their release are given by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 19852 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products which in Article 21 states that : “Once the evidence laid down by the specific Regulation has been furnished … the security shall be released”.</p>
<p>The Commission has already expressed his opinion on these questions to the Danish authorities by his letter of 19 March 2001.</p>
<p>The question of a reasonable practice for the release of securities lies on the Member States which are responsible for the application of the Community legislation and for the day to day management of agricultural expenditure.</p>
<p>Some level of delay in the release of securities has been identified in several Member States. If there are problems of delay in the release of securities in Denmark then this is primarily a question for the Danish authorities. The Commission will, in 2001, carry out an audit where this question will also be followed up. The Commission can propose financial corrections in the event of inadequate management and control systems but, by doing so, it has to take into account whether the existence of a poor control system leads to a risk of loss of Community monies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>With regards to payments in export refunds for the cattle trade (slaughtering and breeding animals), the total amount paid in 2000 (10 months) was &#x80; 110.8 million. During the last year subsidies paid for cattle traded for slaughtering were reduced significantly from &#x80; 60.50 /100 kg to &#x80; 41.00 /100 kg, following the development of export refunds for meat.</p>
<p>Concerning the control of animal transport rules, Commission Regulation (EC) No 615/98 of 18 March 1998 laying down specific detailed rules of application for the export refund arrangements as regards the welfare of live bovine animals during transport stipulates that the payment of export refunds for live bovine animals is subject to compliance, during the transport of the animal up to the first place of unloading in the country of final destination, with the welfare provisions of Council Directive 91/628/EEC of 19 November 1991 on the protection of animals during transport amending Directives 90/425/EEC and 91/496/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 615/98. A recent report from the Commission has pointed out important deficiencies in implementing the Directive 91/628/EEC, which is a responsibility of the Member States.</p>
<p>Regulation (EC) n° 615/98 provides measures to ensure that an official veterinarian at the point of exit of the Community effects systematic checks on all consignments with regards to all aspects of the journey which can be possibly verified at this stage (in particular, fitness of the animals, means of transport complying with the provisions of the Directive 91/628/EEC and that provisions have been taken to feed and water the animals).</p>
<p>Moreover, specific checks are carried out in third countries under the provisions laid down in Articles 3 and 4 of this Regulation. As a result of the checks, the payment of export refunds was refused for 3150 animals during the period 01/09/1998 – 30/06/2000.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission is currently undertaking an inquiry in several Member States with regards to the implementation of the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 615/98. It results may lead to correction following the clearance of accounts procedure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
