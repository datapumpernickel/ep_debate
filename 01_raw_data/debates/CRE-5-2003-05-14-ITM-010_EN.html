<p class="contents">This proposal aims to provide greater flexibility to the Member States in their choice of the most appropriate control strategy under particular socio-economic conditions, thus conferring more responsibility for the measures applied, notably in relation to compliance with relevant public health and environmental requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fundamental position on prophylactic vaccination for FMD remains unchanged. This position reflects the current status of vaccine development, the divergent nature of the causative virus and the serious trade implications any turn towards prophylactic vaccination would provoke.</p>
<p class="contents">Stamping out of infected animals and those likely to promulgate the disease remains the principal method to effectively counteract any outbreak.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have learned, not least thanks to the excellent work of your Temporary Committee, that the massive killing of apparently healthy animals raises major public concern about the ethics and economics of today’s animal husbandry and disease control measures, and their repercussions on rural communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal, therefore, marks a shift of emphasis of the available control measures to promote emergency vaccination from an instrument of last resort to the forefront of the available control methods.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully aware that protecting the current animal health status is a very challenging objective, given globalisation of trade, frequent movement of persons, the nature of the virus and the fact that it is endemic in large parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal therefore includes also provisions on the Community antigen bank, diagnostic laboratories and contingency planning, in order to ensure a high level of disease preparedness.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the European Parliament for having carefully studied our proposal. I look forward now to your discussion of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In so doing, we are coming to the end of a very important chapter, and I would like to take this opportunity of again, and very warmly, thanking all Members, as well as the secretariat and, most especially, the Commission for their excellent cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our special report, and the report now before us, are the fruit of the best kind of cooperation. Many of Parliament’s demands have already been incorporated into the proposal that the Commission has now submitted, and so the various amendments we have tabled are about making the proposal more precise rather than giving it a new direction. As much for the avoidance of misunderstandings as for any other reason, I would like to re-emphasise the fact that we are not calling for any sort of general preventive vaccination of the sort that was customary prior to 1992, but for emergency vaccination, allowing the animals to live, to be the means of first resort when it comes to containing any outbreak of FMD. This is an important distinction, and it still needs to be maintained at certain points in the text. I would also like to emphasise that products derived from vaccinated animals are not in any way hazardous to human health, nor would they even have any effect on it. That much we know, and that is why it would be impossible to justify banning the marketing of products derived from animals vaccinated in the course of an outbreak. We know that there will be problems as regards trade with third states such as Japan and USA, but this can be dealt with by regionalisation, and the award of ‘FMD-free’ status six months after vaccination, rather than – as was the case a year ago – after twelve months, must be considered an essential contribution towards developing a new policy. It might be added, though, that we need to keep on working towards getting the OIE to lay down a three-month rule. This is the subject of an amendment tabled by Mr Böge and others, which I ask you to support. We must, however, vote against the Committee’s Amendment No 32, which I do not believe takes adequate account of the present position in international law. The Greens’ Amendment No 49 also needs to be rejected, as it would reduce the room for manoeuvre that we need.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to go into the individual proposals in detail right now, but the incidence of fowlpest or chicken flu is now showing us how important it is to find a new direction for the control of zoonoses and fundamentally re-evaluate it. In the Netherlands, twenty-five million animals have already been slaughtered, and the disease has now appeared in Germany as well. As we demand in very clear terms in our report, we must eventually find a completely different way of dealing with epizootics, so that it is not trading and economic interests alone that determine what is done. The strategy must involve ethics just as much as it does economics. The risk of diseases spreading is, in part, made greater by intensive livestock farming and by international trade relations, and so vaccination policy needs to be thought through anew. Some viruses are highly deadly and so, in future, another approach will be called for.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report, Parliament has very clearly outlined the economic and social consequences of a strategy failing to hit the mark. In the same way, we have to consider how, in future, we can recoup the costs, whether by way of national funds or in conjunction with a European Epizootic Fund, and who is to be compensated – only those immediately affected, whose animals were slaughtered, or all those who sustained financial losses. This point has not yet been satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the need for research, especially applied research, to be stepped up if we are to have improved vaccines, but, at the same time, prophylaxis must be maintained in businesses, in imports, and when transporting animals. This is more important than ever as a means of preventing pathogens or viruses from getting to the animals in the first place. It is our hope that the Council will, under the Greek Presidency, be able to come to an agreement that will do justice to the needs of the producers, that is, the farmers, the consumers, and also the animals. In these areas, the EU has competence and options available, which should be used to the full. We in this House have played our part, both in the committee and on the ground, by talking with the people affected in Great Britain and the Netherlands. I hope that the future will find us able to break through the vicious circle of killing and isolating.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maat (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like to begin by complimenting the rapporteur highly on the way in which he has cooperated with the various groups and also on the very commendable result. This demonstrates that he has understood the great unease felt at past outbreaks. He has produced a very good report in response to the Commissioner’s legislative proposals. I should also like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Byrne for his speedy reaction to the own-initiative report of Parliament based on investigations we had carried out. He has adopted at least some points from this parliamentary report. This augurs well for good cooperation between the Commission and Parliament, in achieving, now and in the future, an effective approach to combating animal disease epidemics.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, Mr President, I must say on behalf of my group that the parliamentary investigation has taught us just how shattering the outbreak of animal diseases can be. We conducted an investigation into the epidemics of foot and mouth disease. We saw the consequence for animals and humans alike but we also saw the secondary results. The health problems that are still occurring in places hit by foot and mouth, the huge economic loss but also people’s distress and all its attendant problems demonstrate that we can no longer view these animal diseases as a technical question but must emphatically also look at the social consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot be denied that the risks of infectious animal diseases are growing in a world where borders are becoming increasingly transparent and where there is ever more international trade. I need only make passing reference to the outbreak of SARS to indicate the degree of panic it can generate. We must be fully aware that, if we have opted for a non-vaccination policy, the risks of infectious animal diseases will increase. We want to keep animals outside, we want to see cows in the fields, and we want to see chickens and pigs ranging freely. That does mean, though, an increased risk. In addition there are also the international risks of more transport, more international trade. That means that we cannot leave the consequences solely at the door of the farmers but must as politicians reflect on how we can tackle these risks in future. In that respect, the Kreissl-Dörfler report is a good initial step. If there is a new outbreak we can then at least ensure that through a fundamental change of policy, perhaps also through vaccination, we can achieve a much more effective approach to and control of a number of epidemic animal diseases, in this case foot and mouth disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding that fundamental change of policy, namely the provision of more options for Member States, more options for the Commission and most definitely the use of vaccination to keep an outbreak in check, it is of the utmost importance to look at how we can subsequently control the secondary effects and their repercussions. There are a number of important questions. To begin with – and so far the Commission has not yet been totally clear about this – how are we to deal with those indirectly affected by future outbreaks? Secondly, how can we ensure that there is a maximum market for products from the moment that prophylactic vaccination is used and the animals survive? Naturally the legislation permits us to sell our products on the European market under certain conditions but as regards the supermarket chains we are left with question marks. How are we to deal with this? What is our role as politicians in the process, and what is the role of the Commission?</p>
<p class="contents">A third question is, how can we ensure that these kinds of outbreaks are translated internationally in trade relations? In that field I should point out that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has submitted an amendment – I tabled it on behalf of Mr Böge and a number of other members of our group, in which we call urgently on the Commission to look at what the rapporteur has said, namely that it is crucial that in the international field the length of export bans following an outbreak be reduced from six to three months. That is absolutely crucial to our approach in the European Union, and this approach can only be successful if, internationally too, we see the opportunity of reducing the period from six to three months. We urge the Commission to achieve this through negotiation. I should like to hear the Commissioner’s response to this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am glad that we have been able to take a step forward regarding the combating of foot and mouth disease. At the same time I say this with mixed feelings, now that in my own country, but also our neighbours, Germany and Belgium, the spectre of fowl pest has reared its head. Once again I appeal to the Commission to examine how we can take social responsibility for those major animal diseases, such as fowl pest, such as swine fever, and in this case foot and mouth, in order to arrive at a coherent policy. But, once again, the Group of the European People’s Party is glad that we have managed to take a first step in relation to this foot and mouth dossier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Meanwhile we are engaged in a legislative process. I believe that the proposal and the proposed amendments are all in all an acceptable response to the public outcry on the mass culling of livestock. I am in favour of the use of prophylactic emergency vaccinations, with animals being kept alive until slaughtered for consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress two important points in the form of questions to the Commission and would like you to respond in a moment. The first concerns political responsibility. The foot and mouth crisis of 2001 heralded the political landslide of 2002. We must at any rate teach politicians a lesson too. Confidence in politics suffered a severe dent. One important reason was that political responsibility proved anything but transparent. Who was responsible for the no-vaccination policy – the government, the EU or the International Bureau for Infectious Diseases? Ministers pointed to the national governments and to the Bureau in Paris. For the ordinary citizen it was a complex structure of responsibilities and that led to the image of politicians, who while they were prepared to take a public stand, subsequently preferred to hide behind others. Politicians who take no responsibility deprive politics of its credibility. This buck-passing game has backfired badly on Europe. The hundreds of angry letters and e-mails were signals of the human and institutional tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">A future outbreak of foot and mouth must not lead to the mass slaughter of healthy livestock. We must make a massive effort to ensure this in the period ahead. This requires a foot and mouth policy in which there is a clear apportionment of responsibilities, regional, national, European and international and with the parliaments also involved. Our aim must be a foot and mouth policy that is not anonymous. Responsibilities for choices and compliance must be clearly established. It is our task to communicate on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In an attempt to achieve such clarity, I should like to ask the Commissioner to make explicit once again here this evening where precisely the responsibility lies. Is it true that a Member State has the option of using prophylactic emergency vaccination and subsequently of keeping the vaccinated animals alive? Is it true that animal products from vaccinated livestock can be sold without any problem?</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the second point, namely the marketing of animal products from vaccinated livestock. At the moment that a Member State decides to use prophylactic emergency vaccination and to keep the animals alive, it must be possible to sell the products. This requires a minimum of two things; supermarkets to sell the products and consumers to buy them. How does the Commission plan to create the correct boundary conditions in collaboration with Member States? It cannot, of course, be the intention to keep vaccinated animals alive and then to discover that there is no market for them. That would surely ultimately lead to the culling of vaccinated animals. I should like to hear your answer to both these questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mulder (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, at the height of the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party formulated three principles: how can we prevent such outbreaks from recurring, what are we to do if there is another outbreak and how can we pay for such outbreaks in future?</p>
<p class="contents">On the first point: better border controls. We have heard that the Commission has issued new guidelines. I have paid particular attention when arriving back in Europe from time to time from another continent. To be honest, despite the newly announced measures I have not yet been able to detect much change. What exactly were the new measures?</p>
<p class="contents">What are we to do if there is another outbreak? We took the view that the mass culling of healthy stock is not acceptable in future, which is why we fully support the conclusions of the report that prophylactic vaccination must be used. We went even further. In 2001 we submitted an amendment to the budget to ensure that the Commission was able to carry out research into better vaccines, marker vaccines against foot and mouth disease. We did not limit ourselves to foot and mouth disease by the way. It could extend to all infectious animal diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">It is particularly disappointing to note that as of now, some two years after the amendment was submitted and carried, the Commission has still not begun this research. We are constantly given different explanations. It will happen. But it still has not happened. I should like to know why.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point: what is to be done with the products of vaccinated animals? That strikes me as a huge problem. This has already been said by Mrs Corbey and by Mr Maat. The probability is that it will be more difficult to sell the products of those vaccinated animals, and that it will be at a reduced price. Will that also be covered by future compensation schemes, yes or no? What is the Commission proposing to do in this respect?</p>
<p class="contents">Third point: how are we to pay for such outbreaks in future? In that respect we were lucky with the outbreak in 2001. There was sufficiency leeway in the agriculture budget. If calculations are correct there is considerably less slack in the agriculture budget. The euro is strong against the dollar and there will be very little leeway. If there were a new outbreak now, how would we pay for it? This was in fact why the Liberal Group submitted an amendment in 2001 calling for studies to be carried out in to insurance systems. In that respect the Commission <span class="italic">did </span>do its work. At the end of May we shall have a report on the subject. As rapporteur for the 2004 budget I myself made it one of my priorities. It is not acceptable that we should always leave the financing of such outbreaks to chance, according to whether there is money available or not. It must be put on a sound financial footing. I hope to be able to work that out in future in consultation with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The point about six months and three months is also essential for us and I therefore recommend that the plenary should accept the amendment of the Liberal and Christian Democrat groups on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fiebiger (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the history of foot and mouth disease in Europe can be traced back over many years, but the great catastrophe began in the South of England on 21 February 2001. Although it had been known for decades what damage could be caused by the uncontrolled outbreak of a disease, the opportunity for effective defence against the epidemic was not taken. The courses of action set in motion in the Member States affected were unable to prevent the spread of the virus. The state of emergency that was then announced in various regions of the EU left both the rural and urban public equally enraged. Rural areas began to resemble high-security blocks, and a sort of state of emergency was the order of the day on the farms that had been affected. At this time, there was no shortage of ideas as to who was to blame. The EU’s ban on vaccination, which adhered to the principle that, if even only one animal was vaccinated, the whole country was declared to be infected with FMD, met with little approval on the part of the public, and even well-informed officials demanded at the time the use of what are termed marker vaccines in order to prevent the disease from becoming more widespread. Many members of the public saw the containment of foot and mouth disease by means of the open burning of animal cadavers as demonstrating complete disregard for animals’ dignity, and nor did the bottom line add up in economic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">By doing justice to this principle, the report on the control of foot and mouth disease draws the right conclusions from the calamity of 2001, and has, moreover, been able to confirm the results produced by the work of the committee of investigation. This is an encouragement to the same course of action in other cases, such as that of fowlpest, a constantly-recurrent disease that spreads from one country to its neighbours, one of the main problems with which is the large number of contacts across frontiers. Then – if you go by what the press says – there is the great danger of fowlpest, like foot and mouth disease, becoming even worse than a worst-case scenario. The principle of ‘killing rather than vaccination’ or rather its opposite, should, in the EU, apply to all animal species. It would be worth Parliament’s time and effort to investigate that more closely, examining, for example, whether the German ordinance to prevent the spreading of classic fowlpest is in line with what is actually known and whether all species should be included in the text. It would also be possible to re-examine how cross-border cooperation is actually organised.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as FMD is concerned, all is quiet in the candidate countries, but I would like to take this opportunity to observe that this state of affairs can change rapidly. Any and every misjudgment in the area of controlling zoonoses and the early diagnosis of them has economic and social consequences. The report was quite right in stating what had to be done, and the work has been a support. I endorse the report and the proposals it makes; above all, I endorse those amendments that have to do with the protection of the fundamental right to property, and which lead the report to emphatically hold fast to some sort of compensation arrangement for those affected. I also endorse those amendments that seek to increase the freedom of action of veterinarians and the steering bodies in the Member States. In so far as the Member States’ responsibilities will change at all, they will increase, as the decision as to which epidemic strategy is to be applied, and when, is to become a matter for the country in question, and rightly so. This does not discharge those who keep animals from their obligation of cleanliness and good order. Criminal activity in border areas involving the trade in animals belongs in another law, but the report sets out the right approach to this, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, which I believe to be an extremely important piece of work. We really are now moving towards a situation where the terrible mass slaughters of the last foot and mouth epidemic really will be a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased to see that vaccination has been promoted to being a vital tool in the fight against foot and mouth - this shift in emphasis that Commissioner Byrne spoke about. But as far as our own Parliamentary report is concerned, I would like to make sure that we stick with the text agreed in committee, which talks very clearly about vaccination as a tool of first resort. That is the language we used in the report from the Temporary Committee. That is the language of the Royal Society report in the United Kingdom. It is right and appropriate to use that clear and unambiguous language here as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the amendment that supports a change in OIE rules so that there is no longer an automatic incentive to slaughter rather than to vaccinate. But we have recognised that in Britain over 10 million animals were slaughtered, many unnecessarily. Priority was given to narrow economic interests of regaining export status as quickly as possible, regardless of the devastating consequences to the wider rural economy and rural communities.</p>
<p class="contents">On mass slaughter, my group has an amendment to delete pre-emptive culling. We believe that the evidence we heard in the foot and mouth inquiry demonstrates that preventive slaughter is not necessary, it is not desirable, it is not economic and it is not efficient. It should not be permitted by this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It may seem a long time ago since we saw the pictures of the burning pyres on the front pages of newspapers in all those Member States affected. Some people have already forgotten that, but the farmers and communities that went through that terrible time have certainly not forgotten it and many are only now beginning to put their lives back together again.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this report and the Commission initiative will be another step in the process of ensuring that such devastation can never be allowed to happen again, either in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU’s animal disease policy requires re-evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">No one, in 1991, was aware of the possible consequences of instituting the policy of non-vaccination. Since then we have learned the hard way. Vaccination could have prevented the destruction of millions of healthy animals.</p>
<p class="contents">If economic interests are paramount, mankind loses its dignity and creation its protection. I am glad that the Committee on Agriculture has adopted our amendment, in which we make an urgent plea for the observance of ethical principles in combating animal disease.</p>
<p class="contents">In the new directive set out by the Commission, concern for creation still receives scant attention. I did not dare to count on preventive vaccination. I had, though, hoped that ‘emergency vaccination and retention of stock’ would be the first option in the event of an outbreak. The Commission continues to opt for culling and at the very most extends the possibilities to emergency vaccination. I there fore support the amendments making emergency vaccination the first option in combating the disease. Moreover, such emergency vaccination and keeping animals alive must be given a fair chance. Products of vaccinated animals are no less safe than those of non-vaccinated animals. Labelling these products, however, does create such an impression. And that in spite of the fact that, for years prior to 1991, these products were eaten by consumers in my country and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition we must prevent Member States having to opt for culling on the basis of the financial contribution made by Brussels to combating the disease. Emergency vaccination costs the European Union less money, while a Member State is subsequently forced to incur costs to market the products. The savings created by vaccination should be used to compensate for these incidental costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The existence of various serotypes of the FMD virus is an argument against preventive vaccination. At the same time it is an extra stimulus for research into the development of FMD vaccines. This makes preventive vaccination the option for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (NI).</span></span>   – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, the key element in this debate today on foot and mouth disease is the constraints imposed by the OIE with regard to the trade sanctions inflicted on countries that no longer enjoy ‘foot and mouth disease free’ status. It is these rules that make this disease so terrifying for breeders because of the huge economic losses they cause. We must remember that the foot and mouth that affects livestock is not dangerous to man. It is not a public health problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore endorse our rapporteur’s proposal in Amendment No 5 to recital 14 to the effect that the Member States should submit proposals to the OIE to modify trade sanctions in these situations. To be more precise, this change to the OIE rules must take two forms.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, consideration must be given to the progress made on vaccines – marker vaccines, which make it possible to distinguish a vaccinated animal from an infected animal, and more general vaccines – and we must remember that products from vaccinated animals – dairy or meat – pose no danger to human health nor any risk of contagion. Therefore, there is no longer any reason to discriminate against these products or the countries where they are available. This change to the rules will also make it possible to reconsider the problem of preventive vaccination, which should be authorised by the Member States in cases where, for their own reasons, the breeders so desire. I am thinking in particular of animals with a high genetic value, breeding animals and rare breeds that are important for biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Member States must be allowed to regionalise their breeding areas, thereby ensuring that a case of foot and mouth in Alsace – speaking hypothetically of course – does not prevent Brittany from exporting its excellent animal produce.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and I am sorry that this point that I raised during the work of our Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease was not taken up by the rapporteur, we must not lose sight of the fact that certain changes in European agriculture, which have been facilitated by shifts in a certain CAP, are in themselves risk factors for the spread of diseases. I am referring to the increase in the size of farms, excessive intensification, the spread of enclosed breeding, the specialisation of regions and the transporting of animals over long distances: all of these factors, which combine to create very high animal densities, increase the risk.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time, Mr President, when Parliament will have to state its position on the mid-term review of the CAP, we must endeavour to remedy these shifts rather than amplify them by giving priority to human-sized farms, extensive breeding in the least favoured regions, the local integration of activities and local abattoirs; in short, agriculture with a human face. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Parish (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, for his excellent report. This is the second report. First of all there was his report on behalf of the temporary committee and now there is the report on the Commission's legislation. I would also like to thank Members of Parliament for setting up the temporary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Byrne has listened to the temporary committee and has come forward with some good proposals. I would also thank him for banning personal imports of meat and dairy products into the EU. I just wish that Member States will now enforce that regulation better.</p>
<p class="contents">We must learn the lessons from this terrible blight to our countryside, farmers and the rural population. Let us not begin to rewrite history and change what we learnt the hard way, nor alter our views. The views of the European inquiry were clear about how a future outbreak should be handled. The EU committee did more to raise the profile of the EU and put a proactive and positive impression forward of what Brussels was attempting to do, than anything else I have witnessed while I have been a Member of this Parliament. We showed that we were listening and that we would take action over their concerns. We spoke to farmers, the tourism industry, people and rural businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear about what a future strategy must contain. We must have proper checks on the readiness and the value of our contingency plan. Contingency plans must be checked and re-checked, rehearsed and re-examined so that we are not in the unprepared state we were in at the last outbreak. We must have the resources, knowledge and personnel to react quickly. We <span class="italic">must</span> use vaccination as a first method of dealing with an outbreak, at the same time, in conjunction with and alongside slaughter. We must not rule out the use of slaughter.</p>
<p class="contents">There are rumours circulating that the Council is backing away from the use of vaccination, downgrading it on the scale of its importance. Vaccination is not the only tool in our armoury, but it must be fully and effectively used from the beginning of any outbreak. We also need to reassure the consumer about vaccinated meat products and develop and research more new vaccines. We must never again see the mass slaughter of ten million animals - our citizens will not accept it. Any future outbreak must allow vaccinated animals to remain in the food chain to prevent such a terrible waste of resources. We must never again allow political interference to dictate how we attack an outbreak. We must never see the funeral pyres which remain so vivid in the memories of all who witnessed them both in person and on our TV screens.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must not become complacent. There is no doubt that whilst the Commission has tightened up on personal imports, which I welcome, we are still wide open to the disease entering the EU. My own government is taking a reckless approach to it. After an outbreak that brought our rural communities to their knees, we only have four sniffer dogs to try and prevent contaminated meat entering the country. This is folly and, say what you will, it is simply unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We must have a concerted, organised and united approach to prevent illegal imports. We, as governments across the EU, must put in place the appropriate resources to do the job: manpower, money and, dare I say it, sniffer dogs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must fight the disease in conjunction with the farming communities, not in spite of them. We cannot ride roughshod over them as we did in 2001. We have to gain their trust, show our commitment, and then we will be able to keep the terrible disease out of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason alone I will not follow Mr Parish in his more provocative remarks. I advise him to look up the number of animals for which compensation was claimed before he uses his total figures for mass slaughter - as hideous as that undoubtedly was.</p>
<p class="contents">I simply want to say to the rapporteur that the way in which he did this job, both on the temporary committee and subsequently, is a template for the way in which this work should be done. He was considerate, courteous and thorough. I think the UK Government, which found itself in the eye of the storm, would also apply those words to him and appreciated this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has moved, in large measure, to implement what we in the temporary committee recommended. The arguments will always return to the exact relationship between stamping out through culling and vaccination - whether to live or die - in a society that both cherishes its FMD-free status, yet has proper moral scruples about the means <span class="italic">in extremis</span> employed to return to it. These arguments will move with the science. We are right to prioritise the research needed. I would like some kind of estimate from the Commissioner as to how that research is progressing.</p>
<p class="contents">The epidemic moved with terrifying speed. As has been said during the current SARS outbreak, the virus had its own rage to survive. It was awful to see that speed. Movement restrictions were not effective in the early stages. We had 50 000 sheep on the move, largely untraced, when the virus struck. I am sure we all agree that the mass culls that followed should never be seen again. They traumatised whole communities. Member States now have a wider discretion as to how they control the outbreak and the sequence to be followed in emergencies, from stamping out to vaccination.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise, as Mr Blokland did - and it came through in our report - that there is a moral dimension to this. Unless we have an ethical element in farming it is unlikely that we will have commendation in the future for measures that we might take the next time this happens.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as our own committee is concerned, we needed to emphasise three things to the Commission. One is faster updating of contingency plans subject to practicability. We need to look at the seamless nature of the world we live in, in terms of the buying and selling of foodstuffs. Perhaps the Commissioner could say a word on what the FVO is doing about looking at the movement of foodstuffs into the country, given some of the problems we have had in recent times.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be able to tell the public, as consumers, much more forcefully why it is that meat from vaccinated animals is safe to eat. We cannot have a pro-vaccination policy unless we have public acceptance of it, which goes with that greatly changed consumer standpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">While our own Food Standards Agency argued this case in Britain, it found itself confounded by the negativity of too many producers and too many retailers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should take special measures, as others have said, to preserve rare breeds, an indispensable part of the animal gene pool, so that they are not swept away by some new pandemic.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that the Commissioner can appreciate the need to be practical. He has shown that. The tenor of this debate will be set by the degree to which we can also preserve our humanity and life in all its infinite variety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Busk (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I wish firstly to say to the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, that I have rarely been involved in work on a report that has been handled as diligently and fairly as Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has handled this report. It is simply admirable, and I want to say thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I would draw attention to the fact that, by now abandoning the non-vaccination policy, we are creating changes that will be very significant for those countries that export extensively to third countries. I want at the same time to say that foot and mouth disease is so infectious that anyone who believes that all the problems are solved merely by opening the way for vaccination and who is also sure of being able in future to contain a future outbreak of the disease will have to think again, for that is not the way foot and mouth disease works.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore choose to go on believing that it is the non-vaccination policy that we shall continue to work towards, and I acknowledge that the situation will meanwhile be one in which we shall use vaccine, as we did for example in the Netherlands, under the very proficient administration of the Dutch. Ring vaccination did prove effective as a way of containing the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">In that connection, it is also important for me to support what was said by my colleague in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, Mr Mulder, namely that it is important for the vaccinated animals not to remain in the food chain but to be removed from it. That is not something for which there appears to be a majority right now, but it must be remembered in this regard that the vaccinated animals are of course disease carriers, and, given that fact, it would be a disaster if any of these animals were to pass on the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that there can be no question of imagining, as is done for example in Amendment No 11, that milk and meat from vaccinated animals can be sold freely throughout the EU. In this area, we must be very clear in demanding regionalisation so that, if such milk and meat is to be sold, it is within, and not across, national borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I am aware that this is not Commissioner Byrne’s area, I shall again draw attention to the fact that there is a need for export agreements, particularly with the Americans, so that we contain the losses there might be in connection with a future epidemic of foot and mouth disease and, especially, in connection with possible vaccination. It would not of course be of help to anyone if, instead of exporting fresh produce to third countries, we were to close the doors, with the result that these products were to end up on the European market at sharply falling prices. That is not of course what farmers need in this situation. There is also a real need for the Commission to undertake serious regionalisation and to conclude agreements with the Americans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also thank Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for working so tirelessly on the matter since day one.</p>
<p class="contents">To have reached this final stage is a positive advertisement for the European Parliament. When the temporary committee visited regions affected by this terrible disease, including my own country of Wales, we were told by people how grateful they were that the European Parliament had set up this inquiry as they had no other way of voicing their grievances within their own Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive makes several valuable recommendations relating to the tightening of import controls – which has already been mentioned – setting contingency plans, establishing expert groups and moving emergency vaccination to the forefront of disease control, in line with the welcome changes made to international trade rules. Central to the UK Government's mishandling of the 2001 crisis was its lack of a clear-cut policy on whether and when vaccination should have been used. This led to the unacceptable continuous culling, which was based on flawed scientific evidence, and the blinkered decision to reject vaccination. In the event of future outbreaks, slaughtering should be limited to infected premises, based on sound laboratory tests. We owe it to our rural communities everywhere to learn the lessons of 2001. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem arises due to the fact that the veterinary borders have been removed in connection with the introduction of the internal market. The EU has become a single veterinary zone. Denmark has lost its independent veterinary status. Understandably enough, the United States and Japan also regard the EU as a single country. They close the door to the import of pork from throughout the EU if there has been vaccination against foot and mouth disease in one location in the EU. Each year, the EU exports approximately 1.5 million tons of pork at a value of EUR 4 000 million. Of this, Denmark alone is responsible for 600 000 to 700 000 tons. If the exports were instead to be transferred to the EU’s internal market, this would mean an increase approaching 10% in the supply of pork. This would lead to a total collapse of the market throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should, from the beginning, have taken account of the risk of third countries’ introducing trade restrictions. The Commission has not remotely taken on board this loss of exports that occurs if no advance measures are taken regarding third countries’ acceptance of exports.</p>
<p class="contents">It must of course be possible to change the vaccination strategy, partly so that what are otherwise good intentions are not pursued at the expense of the EU’s absolutely vital export interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore call upon the Commission to ensure it takes account of all the factors – including those relating to trade – in evaluating what rules should apply in future. There is a lot to suggest that veterinary regionalisation should be introduced, involving a kind of ‘export pocket’ free from vaccinated animals, from which exports could be made even if there were foot and mouth disease outbreaks elsewhere in the EU, with corresponding vaccination against the disease.</p>

We have a right, in this Parliament, to demand that there ought to be real action right across the European Union to put into place a strategy to defeat this terrible disease, should it again break forth. In Northern Ireland there are no such structures in place. The veterinary experts have told me that they are quite appalled at the apathy of the government in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">How different this experience has been in the United States of America. There, they have periodical dry-run operations and the strategy nationwide is tested, weaknesses are discovered and the fine-tuning of the whole programme is updated. This, I believe, is necessary in the European Union. I trust that all governments will be urged to accept that necessity. We in the UK know the cost of the foot and mouth outbreak and how it brought both agriculture and tourism to their knees. We know the emotional pain and human tragedy that resulted, largely because of the controversy about vaccination.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this report's dedication to a policy to vaccinate to live. I believe that policy is much better than the one of 'don't vaccinate but rather burn'. The Commission's proposals have been sensible, following the lines of the European Parliament's temporary committee. I strongly believe that Parliament should endorse the opinion of the report before it.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur and the committee for bringing it forward. The report points to a real way forward, in the fields both of preparation and deterrence.</p>

<p class="contents">Fundamentally, I believe, both the Commission proposal for a directive and this report are to be welcomed. It is fortunate that the proposal submitted by the Commission takes on board most of the demands made by Parliament’s committee on foot and mouth disease, which, on 17 December 2002, adopted a resolution calling for the revision of the European Union’s existing policy on the control and prevention of foot and mouth disease. As the contributions to today’s debate make clear, the next epidemic is already rampant in Europe, and I believe that it really is five minutes to midnight when it comes to our changing the European Union’s policy, for we have to avoid in future any epidemic spreading and becoming the tragedy that we saw in Great Britain in 2001. We are not talking here only in terms of the grave financial losses sustained by farmers, especially in the upstream and downstream sectors, or about the damage to rural areas and the profound public disquiet; this is, rather, an image issue for European farmers such as ourselves and for the agricultural policy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">One important point that has been taken on board is the retention of the ban on prophylactic vaccination, which strikes me as pointless until such time as there is a vaccine that covers all seven serotypes and the 80 subtypes within them. There is a need for research into this to be extended and improved. A further, and decisive, point is that the importance of emergency vaccination is recognised, so that it is no longer seen as a last resort.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it has to be said that the disease, which spread to such an immense extent in Great Britain that we all still shudder to recall it, could have been prevented. All that was needed was for appropriate control measures to be taken and for the existing vaccination requirements to be adhered to in the Member State in question. The one thing that has become perfectly clear is that the Member States really do have to discharge the responsibilities placed on them by the Treaties. I trust that we have learned our lessons from the past in order to be able, next time, to act with more responsibility and coordination. Never again must there be a catastrophe – for a catastrophe is what it was – of these dimensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is one of the few areas in which I have noticed that all political groups in this House had very little difference at the end of the day, and certainly our mission was exactly the same. I thank him and colleagues who were on the temporary committee for the first year. I should like to thank Mr Sturdy, Mr Parish and my UK colleagues who were at the forefront in promoting the original establishment of the temporary committee, for reasons that will be obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not often that I agree fully with my Northern Ireland colleague, Mr Paisley. However, on this issue we would find very little to differ on, and I welcome his comments here this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">The outbreak of FMD in the European Union in 2001 was a disaster not only for agriculture but also for many related enterprises and organisations. The outbreak demonstrated without question that the European Union's FMD risk-management policy, and the risk assessment on which that was based, needed to be reviewed.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers, vets and politicians all shared the great concern of the general public over the death and destruction of millions of animals, of which many, if not most, were not infected with the disease. There was huge psychological damage, in particular to farmers and their families when they had to depopulate or destroy their animals. It is not just in the UK - the epicentre of the outbreak - but even in the Cooley Peninsula in Ireland, which had to be depopulated that to this day the psychological damage to the families concerned is absolutely immense.</p>
<p class="contents">While I do not support the return to routine or preventive vaccination, a review of vaccination policy is very appropriate, especially the use of emergency or fire-break vaccination to control the spread of an outbreak. Further discussion with the OIE, the World Organisation for Animal Health, is urgently necessary to ensure that an infected country can regain its FMD-free status as soon as possible. After the last case and after the slaughter of the last vaccinated animal it is necessary to regain FMD status.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast to a colleague, Mr Busk, who has just spoken, I do not have problems with vaccinated animals entering the food chain. However, as long as the OIE has concerns about exporting such animals for the food chain, we have to get in line. Therefore, we need our scientists to get their heads together on this and resolve it. FMD-vaccinated animals are not infectious when they get into the food chain. We already vaccinate our cattle for a whole array of diseases and consume them daily. Therefore we need to become rational in our approach to this particular issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Marker vaccines to distinguish vaccinated animals from animals carrying the virus will have a major role to play in this area in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a special plea to ensure that Member States' veterinary services are properly resourced. With serious financial losses now for many years in livestock enterprises, we cannot take for granted any longer the existence of rural large-animal veterinary practices, especially in our remote areas, let alone the development of urgently needed herd-health surveillance programmes involving routine visits by practising vets. The vet is in the front line of surveillance for indigenous and exotic diseases. The one thing we can be sure of is not whether there is another outbreak of an exotic disease in the EU, but when.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the Commission for acceding to my plea for a special protocol for non-susceptible animals, in particular equidae. I refer to Annex VI on the restrictions on the movement of equidae in this area. A few amendments were accepted at committee and I would urge the Commission to indicate that it would take them on board.</p>
<p class="contents">An emergency must be documented by a veterinary surgeon on call 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. For the equestrian and racing industries, Saturday, Sunday and bank holiday Mondays must be covered for the movement of animals for breeding or for emergency operations or for competition purposes - because the horse does not carry, it is not susceptible. The transport must be authorised by the competent authorities, but they must be contactable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. An on-call official veterinarian must be informed about the route prior to the departure of any horse transported in dedicated transport in an outbreak.</p>
<p class="contents">I declare an interest in the equestrian area. I thank the Commission and the authorities concerned for including for the first time a protocol in an FMD contingency plan for a non-susceptible species. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This prudent appointment ensured that the highly-valued expertise on FMD acquired by the temporary committee has been directly incorporated into your assessment of the proposed FMD directive.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, I should like to pay tribute to the officials in my own office <span class="bold">–</span> I do not normally do this <span class="bold">–</span> and point to the quick response of those, one of whom is here this evening, who, on that fateful night in February 2001, when informed by the competent authorities in the UK of this outbreak, at 9.30 p.m., were in a position to make sure that the competent authorities of all other Member States were aware of the outbreak by 10.30 p.m. Their quick reaction contributed considerably to the containment of this disease. This is true in circumstances where we deal with communicable diseases, whether animal or human diseases. A fast response is of critical importance. Containment saves the situation considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">Not surprisingly, the Commission’s FMD proposal has prompted vigorous debate amongst all interested parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal has been subject to in-depth analysis in the technical expert working groups chaired by the Greek Presidency in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall opinion emerging from various discussions has been positive. The Commission has received wide support for the general policy laid down in this proposal, not least because it is a carefully considered, pragmatic reform, rather than a revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission notes with satisfaction the general support of this House for the increased emphasis on emergency vaccination. This has also attracted the broad support of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I note, however, that some Members would have liked us to go even further in this regard, but to do so would have compromised the fundamental elements of choice and flexibility that we are aiming to promote.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree that disease preparedness must be enhanced and that contingency plans should be based on a worst-case scenario. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, contingency plans must be regularly reviewed and subject to critical analysis through carefully prepared and realistic exercises.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report of the Committee on Agriculture, 48 amendments are proposed. The Commission can, in fact, agree with 47 out of the 48 amendments tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot agree to Amendment No 32 which, although in line with the report of the Scientific Committee of 1999, is against the current rules of the OIE. I would however add that the Commission’s proposal provides for rapid adaptation, should the OIE recommendations be modified.</p>
<p class="contents">On the additional amendments tabled for this plenary session, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 51, 52 and 53 in part.</p>
<p class="contents">In the international framework, the Commission is committed to addressing, at every suitable opportunity, the issue of regionalisation policy and to contribute to adaptation of the OIE Animal Health Code to reflect scientific and technological progress. To proceed unilaterally would block international trade of EU animals and their products. In this regard we hope to make progress within the next week at the General Session of the OIE.</p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding let me address one issue of particular concern – that of veterinary funding. The proposal before us today does not address Community rules on the veterinary funds because the principles of our control policy have not changed. Furthermore, a study on a possible future animal health insurance scheme is well advanced but not yet completed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to address some of the questions raised by a number of Members such as Mrs Corbey, who asked who is responsible for FMD vaccination. That responsibility rests with the Member States. However, as a matter of prudence, the Member States are advised to inform and get clearance from the Commission before embarking on this for a number of reasons, not least funding for compensation and also to ensure that there is an agreement with other Member States in the event of cross-border trade. She asked me how we could ensure that supermarkets sell meat from vaccinated animals. It is true to say that there is no law requiring the labelling of meat from vaccinated animals, but there is a requirement in respect of the stamping of carcasses of fresh meat but not in respect of other products. This is an issue that needs to be addressed but I cannot see how this can be dealt with by regulation. It is a matter for the free market.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mr Mulder's question regarding insurance, this is being undertaken. Work has been done and a report is anticipated.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Whitehead asked me about research on vaccines. I can assure him that work has been undertaken under the DG Research programme. There will be a report on that issue in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Members for the speed with which they have delivered their opinion, thus paving the way for these new provisions on the control of FMD to come into force as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
