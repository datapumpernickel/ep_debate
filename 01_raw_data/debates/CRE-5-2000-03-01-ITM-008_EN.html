<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Katiforis (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – The report of the Commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the European economy which it finds promising, especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8% by the year 2001. This picture in the opinion of your rapporteur has to be set against a background of sluggishness, of growth of only 1.9% per year throughout the 1990s, despite instances of higher growth rates during that decade which we were, however, unable to consolidate.</p>
<p class="contents">It would follow that if we do not wish the same old failures of the past to reassert themselves, we must use the current window of opportunity of improved economic performance in order to launch a new policy of transition into self-sustained higher growth levels in our economy. This is the challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this challenge the Commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal fundamentals of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, in your rapporteur’s opinion, this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years, not just once but repeatedly. Such an attitude has downside risks which I understand the ECOFIN Council is currently discussing. These risks involve a correction in the US economy and the future trend in oil prices and in long-term EU interest rates. Should any of these risks materialise in a negative fashion, what will be our response – more <span class="italic">laissez faire</span> or shall we have prepared ourselves better than in the last downturn?</p>
<p class="contents">It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts. One is to adopt the Commission’s own excellent, outstanding econometric analysis, and ask the Council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected quantifiable targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible.</p>
<p class="contents">A central plank of such a programme should be the raising of the level of investment of capital formation from 19%, to which it has fallen over the decade, to at least 23-24% of GDP, both in the private and in the public sector. To allow the public sector to take the necessary significant lead in investment policy, the Council would indeed have to sacrifice some of its most sacred cows. It would need to revise its negative attitude towards the big infrastructure programmes of trans-European networks, which have been gathering dust in the drawers for rather too long, to allow them to be financed on an adequate scale by means of European Community bonds and to accept an interpretation of the concept of budget deficits which would allow governments to borrow for purposes of investment without falling foul of the restrictions of the stability pact. This was the first pillar of my recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second pillar consisted of embracing a large number of structural reforms, privatisation, de-regulation proposals, as well as suggestions facilitating the transition to a knowledge-based economy which, as we know, constitutes the backbone of the proposals of the presidency for the Lisbon Summit. It has been repeatedly stated by expert opinion that the programme of structural reforms combined with an expansionary programme of investment and growth is capable of pulling the European economy out of its state of inertia while one-sided policies are condemned to fail.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately my colleagues of the People’s Party aided and abetted by the Liberals in the Economic Affairs Committee found my approach unacceptable. I am glad that at least after five years of insistence they have found the target of full employment acceptable but I must say that simply referring to full employment without proposing a concrete programme towards achieving the targets smacks too much of lip service and is too unconvincing to serve as the political message of optimism that people expect from us, have been expecting from us rather too long. It is certainly not my task to judge other people’s alliances but if the People’s Party and the Liberals are so desperate to cement their alliance, let them at least propose something positive, something that has a chance of working, not repeat the same tired old platitudes, ideas that have so singularly failed us in the past, nor oppose other people’s concrete efforts just for the sake of opposing them.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the political message of this Parliament should consist of something more original than a mere rehash of the neo-classical economic mantra. Something more robust than a call to surrender to the fatalities of the market economy, something more decent than opposing dutiful aims but denying them the means of their realisation. The report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects. Unless it is restored in its original form by Parliament, accepting the amendments retabled by the Socialist Group, I must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my Socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that Parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would be more than pleased to accede to his request, but first and foremost, I would like to begin with the analysis.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Surely the first question we must ask ourselves is: how is the European Union’s economic policy proceeding at the moment, or rather, how is the economic policy of the eleven Member States proceeding at present, for that is what it all revolves around after all? We have asked experts about this and they gave very interesting answers. However, I believe that the most important judges as to whether a country is pursuing sound or poor economic policy are currently the international financial markets and developments that are then reflected in the exchange rates. In which connection, we know that the euro is weak against the dollar; in other words, the international markets have given a poor assessment of the economic policy currently being pursued by the eleven Member States of the European Union whose currency is the euro.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Why should this be so? Is it down to the European Central Bank? Definitely not. The European Union is in good financial shape. The European Central Bank has all the instruments at its disposal that a central bank could wish for. The European Central Bank is headed by convincing personalities. They have also fulfilled their task of monitoring price stability and the interest rate policies they have pursued have been completely in line with this task. So it cannot be down to the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Is it down to the forecasts concerning growth and employment in the coming years? The forecasts are absolutely excellent. It is forecast that economic growth will run at 3%, as compared with 1.9% in the 90s. Unemployment is expected to fall, albeit slowly. Price stability in the European Union is better in the eleven Member States than it is in the United States. We have price stability, inflation running at less than 2%. Long-term interest rates are also lower than they are in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The real reason why the European countries are not finding favour is the fact that we are too slow in tackling the structural reform Europe needs. First and foremost, there is the flexibility of labour markets. We are aware that unemployment has fallen more quickly in those countries, including EU Member States, which have made their labour markets more flexible, than it has in other countries. In some countries unemployment is now below 5%.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the major undertaking of reforming the social security systems and adapting them to the requirements of a European home market – here too, we in Europe are lagging far behind. There is also a need to improve conditions for research and development: firstly, there is technophobia within the European Union, which certainly hampers research and development in the EU. Coupled with this is the fact that the protection of intellectual property here in Europe, particularly for small and medium-sized firms – and they are especially creative – is too expensive and does not operate adequately.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that, as matters stand with regard to electronic money, we are about to miss out on opportunities that other countries are already exploiting as we speak, because we are taking too long to adapt the framework conditions. We are also failing to adapt our training systems in good time. For example, if there is currently demand in Germany for electronics experts to be brought into the European Union from other countries, then this only goes to show that our own training systems have failed and that they have not been equipped to deal with the requirements of the information society in good time. In other words, things are moving too slowly.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The adjustments that need to be made with regard to dismantling monopolies are proceeding too slowly as well. We have come a relatively long way as far as telecommunications is concerned. We still fall a long way short on the postal services front and there is also still a lot to be done in terms of dismantling monopolies in the energy sector. What is more, we have reason to fear that, in some sectors, private monopolies could replace the old public monopolies, which would mean that, in terms of competition, and in terms of what benefits the public most, we would be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">But now perhaps a few words on the fundamental difference between our opinion and that of the rapporteur. The rapporteur believes in growth and stimulating demand. He regards this as a panacea. Alongside the many issues where our opinions do not differ to anything like the same extent, this is what stood out from the rapporteur’s proposals. I believe it would not be totally wide of the mark to describe his stance on this issue as belonging to the old Keynesian school of thought.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">By contrast, we take the view that this kind of economic policy would be lop-sided, and that we should give attention not only to stimulating demand, but also to supply conditions and the structural reforms I have just mentioned. We must set to work on these now, for only then will we be able to hold our own in the face of global competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to re-emphasise the value of the extensive deliberations that we had in committee with the experts, who, fortunately for us, made themselves available to Parliament. These experts were most emphatic about how important it is to take investment-related measures and to employ demand-orientated instruments. By that, I do not think they mean what you have just termed the Keynesian school of thought of yesteryear, Mr von Wogau, for no one wants a lack of stability or solidity, rather we must at last find the right policy mix here in the European Union. This involves both supply- and demand-orientated measures. We see this in other countries of the world that have been pursuing this very strategy for many years now, and which are more successful than your homeland, for example.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I am certainly not overly pessimistic with regard to the prospects for the European Union. After all, we can see that after a year of economic and monetary union in the European Union, the economy has undergone a distinct recovery. The Commission’s annual report on the economy is right to anticipate positive trends. After all, the global economic and political conditions are favourable, they just have to be utilised. We must at long last resolve to coordinate things in such a way that we create real synergy of the kind that will actually facilitate a high level of sustainable growth for many years to come. </p>
<p class="contents">I must say that this business with the euro-dollar exchange rate does not worry me, not just because I see potential here for revaluation of the euro, no, because the euro-dollar exchange rate is giving the European export economy an additional boost, thereby underpinning its role as a driving force in the economy during an important phase of European economic development. As I said before, the European Union still lacks a common growth strategy, which would be instrumental in enabling us to actually use the interdependence of the EU national economies to best advantage, and in enabling the internal market to function to optimum effect</p>
<p class="contents">This does not just have to do with the fact that there is still a lack of structural reform. Of course, it is important for us to undertake structural reform. But has anyone ever calculated the economic impact of this structural reform, to enable us to see what it could actually contribute in the way of growth, investment and employment? Seen in this light, we cannot dispense with structured growth. </p>
<p class="contents">I think it is a shame that even now, not all participants in the macroeconomic dialogue see the need for coordination. We simply must be aware that we are still not free of external risks, and European growth, growth within the EU, is still subject to internal risks. At the end of the day, there are, for example, indicators here in the European Union that show that growth and its prospects are by no means as solid as they were in the 80s. This also has something to do with confidence. I do not believe that we should leave it to the financial markets to pass judgement, but we must ensure that both consumers and manufacturing gain in confidence where development in the European Union is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">There is also a need for a common European approach – I would not dispute this – in the development of wage policy, which, I believe, has already been brought into line in the EU, in exemplary fashion, with the productivity and inflation objectives of the ECB. It should not boil down to a renationalisation of the fight against inflation at Member State level, this fight being waged due to the pressure exerted by increased oil and raw materials prices.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">An independent evaluation of European economic policy will be of importance to the European Union and to structured growth. What we need is an annual report on the economic and social situation in the Union, so as to enable us to develop an EU policy with benchmarking and specific quantitative and qualitative figures and objectives for investment and growth. This must be incorporated into the cornerstones of economic policy. It is my belief that, at the end of the day, any violation of this policy must be followed up by a detailed analysis of causes with regard to the respective national economy.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the benefits arising from favourable economic growth should now be put to use in helping to alleviate structural shortfalls more intensely, and rightly so. However, the benefits of growth should also be used for investment in the information society, and in research and development, as well as in that expensive raw material ‘labour’. Measures including Internet access in every school or lifelong learning would constitute a sound approach in this respect – which even opponents of state expenditure programmes would have to agree to – so as to secure future prospects and full employment for the citizens of the Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee. We clearly have different views, one of which is that we believe the development of the European economy can be regarded with confidence. Yesterday, when speaking to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Commissioner Solbes specifically indicated that the prospects for this year and next for the European economy are excellent. Moreover, several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus. They are having to choose, for example, between reducing taxes or reducing the public deficit, but clearly avoiding any price rises, or – so there is no misunderstanding – creating a special reserve for future situations in which welfare may be needed, given the EU’s population growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the Union, now and in the coming years. It must be taken into account that we have an open, globalised and very competitive economy. In order to reach and even overtake the leading position of the United States of America, we must avoid interventionism, as proposed initially by Mr Katiforis, and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures. Furthermore, the Member States refused to contribute more funds when we discussed Agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws. There are still sectors such as air transport, energy and telecommunications in which, if we compare our unit cost with that of the USA or other countries which are equally competitive at international level, the cost supported by our companies is very high.</p>
<p class="contents">This report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the USA is EUR 500 and in the European Union, on average, it is EUR 1 600. We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention. It is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the objective, in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament: give hope to the people of Europe. There is indeed economic recovery, but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe. The votes of the PPE-DE and the Liberals have very considerably diminished, and even reversed, the meaning of his message. That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report? First of all, the affirmation that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, that particularly respects the commitments of the European Union at the conferences in Kyoto and Buenos Aires. There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year 2008, by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions. A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport, energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, even the growth rate of 3 or 4%, something we consider eminently feasible, will not be sufficient to reduce unemployment if we do not improve the job content of this growth. And we should say so very clearly, it will involve more savings on services, more third systems, more reductions in average working hours, whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in Europe, but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital. The lesson learned from the European experience is that where wages are lowest, where the salary ratio is the most flexible, unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest, where the social relations are the best regulated, the unemployment rate is the lowest.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the European Commission, ECOFIN and the Central Bank, but also the European Parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo-liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the European Union and to send the Commission and the Council the sort of message which the European Parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the European Union. Even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high-level experts, who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas, failed miserably to muster any support.</p>
<p class="contents">With this vote, the European Parliament has accepted serious liability towards the people who elected it, by supporting an extreme neo-liberal economic and social policy; a policy which promotes the privatisation of absolutely everything, categorically opposes any form of public sector, overturns workers’ employment, wage, social and insurance rights, imposes a policy of budgetary austerity which is acutely anti-social and unpopular and acts on behalf of employers by asking workers to become more attractive and employable if they want to find a job.</p>

Indeed, it is good to note that the forecast of 3% growth for the year 2000, which could have seemed rather bold when the Commission announced it in November 1999, now has a serious chance of being achieved, even in the context of continued inflation, since the peak of 2% for the euro zone in January, nevertheless remains quite minor compared with the past.</p>
<p class="contents">But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be remedied urgently – the structural inflexibility, the excessive mandatory levies. But let us not forget that there is another one, a new handicap, with the single currency. In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission’s report. But, in reality, we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation. If you add the strangeness of a single currency that is not built upon a State, itself based upon a people, you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the markets’ suspicion of the euro. Indeed, it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999, as it favoured growth in an unexpected way, but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is, in fact, symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the topic it covers, this is hardly surprising. It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment, but it is, in fact, a short-term policy. Even if he advocates sustainable growth, sustainability does not come into it. Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy. More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity. The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced</p>
<p class="contents">Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes. If Member States do not do anything about this, there will be even fewer means for care, education and other important public amenities in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd. It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which, at 2%, is now at its maximum permitted level. If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again. What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular. </p>
<p class="contents">High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting. Promoting employment, however, is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy. Member States, in particular, should adopt an effective policy. In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway. Rigidity by imposing social convergence criteria and other Community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs. However, shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is still a lack of optimism and also confidence in Europe, which we need if we are to think at all seriously in terms of positive economic development. The reasons for this, as far as I am concerned, are manifold. In Europe we have taxation systems that impede performance. The average level of income tax is over 50% in Europe. The very brave step taken by the Reagan administration in the 80s showed how a dramatic reduction in the level of taxation, from 70% to 28% that is, was able to stabilise the USA’s budget with lasting effect. And the tax revenue from top earners did not fall when this reduction took place, rather the reverse happened. In 1984, tax revenue from top earners actually rose from 17.6%, the level it was at in 1980, to 25.6%. We in Europe should also find the courage to introduce a low-level taxation system.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this reason, however, other significant reasons lie behind the fact that economic development in Europe is not proceeding apace. The barrage of legislation in Europe, coupled with over-complicated laws, has produced so much red tape that, in the end, it takes 11 weeks in effect to set up a company in Europe while it takes 10 days in the USA. Surveys carried out at European universities have shown that 60% of students intend to seek work in the public sector and only 40% in the private sector. We need more competition in Europe, particularly where the new technologies are concerned, so that objectives such as full employment and growth can be secured and sustained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More flexible labour markets, new technologies, and securing market niches and better framework conditions for the establishment of innovative and creative enterprises, are all crucial to the European economy. In terms of monetary policy, we are talking balanced budgets, low inflation and the development of a culture of stability. The interests of both employer and employee coincide here.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not workable, at present, to synchronise economic and monetary policy with social policy, and that includes common, quantitative goals. We PPE-DE Members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have made it clear on numerous occasions that the annual activity reports submitted by the Member States at least appear to be more topical, even though they continue to be produced on an individual basis. A first, yet crucial step, would be to bring about convergence in social policy. This would include a benchmarking procedure, with the exchange of comparable data and a shift of emphasis from action plans to the fight against exclusion and poverty. It would be equally appropriate to streamline the various procedures adopted at Cardiff, Luxembourg and Cologne. I only hope that we do not end up with a fourth, i.e. what is known as the Lisbon method. We have enough labels, but not enough content. Simplification, not complication, is what is called for. </p>
<p class="contents">If we are to improve social conditions then what we need are quality-orientated endeavours, such as more training and further education opportunities, so as to broaden the skills’ base, and ensure an appropriate level of social protection and worker participation in profit and capital distribution. There is a need to evaluate the annual progress, or lack of it, made by Member States in the fight against unemployment, and to take the necessary countermeasures. The European Parliament must have greater involvement in this process. We have made a start, with measures ranging from Employment Week in November, through to involving the two sides of industry and the NGOs, to our debates in plenary, which are completely open to public scrutiny.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not the report he presented to us here today, but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because politically speaking, these are two completely different reports. In very general terms, we could call the first report a left-wing one, as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones. The report we have before us now and which Mr Katiforis is reluctant to defend – and I think that he is right in this – is a hybrid report, from which the main conclusions have been removed, and is based on social concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report? He proposed an ambitious report, based on an optimistic Europe, which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve. And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets. Why, for example, was the proposal to increase Europe’s active population to 75% of the total population removed, when we currently have levels of around 60%? An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries’ levels of production with such a low rate of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive. As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training. We also need investment to grow at a faster rate.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce. I would like to counter this with the example of Portugal, where employment laws are not flexible, and where unemployment stands at less than 5% – and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years – because investment is increasing, with Community support of course, at a rate considerably higher than the Community average. What we want, therefore, is for Europe to enjoy economic growth, but also be prepared to address social issues.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is said that things are going better for Europe but, when people say this, we must nonetheless be clear about the fact that matters still look extremely different from one individual Member State to another. </p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s major problem is still unemployment. In my view, it is simply not on to say that things are going well for Europe when between 16 and 17 million Europeans are without work. Why is the European economy not growing sufficiently? Why is the euro so much weaker than the dollar? I do not think that we ought to derive all our inspiration, without exception, from the United States but I am convinced that we have things to learn from the States, for example, about having fewer rules in the labour market, lower social costs and lower taxes. We also have something to learn regarding the possibility of starting up new companies. There is a different commercial climate in the United States than in Europe. We have heard about the costs and the bureaucracy involved in starting up a new company, about the fact that it costs EUR </p>
<p class="contents">1 600 in Europe but only EUR 500 in the United States to do so and about the fact that it takes eleven weeks in the EU but only ten days in the United States. It cannot continue like that. I think Mr Katiforis also appreciates the fact. Europe must become more competitive. </p>
<p class="contents">In a very interesting annex to the present report, Mr Richard Layard cites a number of countries as models, namely Great Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark where welfare dependency and unemployment have declined. Mr Layard highlights the difficulties experienced by the long-term unemployed. That is what differentiates us from the United States. In Europe, we pay people for not doing anything. That does not happen in the United States. Europe therefore needs another type of policy, not an American-style policy in every respect but one which takes us away from welfare dependency, which gives people the opportunity of a good education suited to the new jobs in the market, which makes it easier to start up new companies, which improves the commercial climate and which ensures that new techniques and ideas are exploited to the full. As Europeans, we can achieve a lot if we are afforded the opportunity. That opportunity is what I think the present report is giving us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I read the report and see the picture of the EU’s economy that is described there, I think it is quite a worrying picture. Investment levels are too low, unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth. It is not, therefore, perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies, in spite of rumours to the effect that the European Central Bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it. </p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself, which is something I agree with. There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development. As far as I am concerned, EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy. My conclusions about this differ completely, however, from those of the previous speaker. I believe we have to place our confidence in human resources, partly through a macro-economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly – and perhaps above all – by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training, democratisation and good social conditions. In this context, I can, in fact, see the EMU project’s main weakness, for it is true that you cannot act like Superman and raise the European economies from above. Instead, you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It points to the problems experienced in 1999, when, notwithstanding the problems, there was currency and price stability, increased employment, the beginnings of a period of upturn, and it was possible to make a start on reducing unemployment. In terms of outlook, the document points to an upswing, to long-term prospects and the measures required to achieve this, which Karl von Wogau then proceeded to enlarge upon. </p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one, for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy. We want to continue along the successful European path to growth and employment and a functioning internal market, to hasten our progress and supplement this with the necessary measures. The left-wing of this House does not want to continue along this path, rather it makes dramatic statements such as: what we need is state intervention, not the extension and consolidation of the market economy. State intervention has always led to a high level of debt, and a higher level of debt has always damaged growth and employment, as well as social justice. </p>
<p class="contents">That is what the debate we are having is all about, on the subject of which I have this to say to you: we need more freedom and less state intervention. It is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Socialists in this House want the internal market too. We too are campaigning for and arguing in favour of the euro, but we want a social market economy and not a US-style market economy. In any case, hitherto this House was agreed, with a few exceptions, that we did not wish to model ourselves on America, but that we wanted Europe to pursue a different path, hence my disappointment at the fact that we are unlikely to reach a consensus of opinion. We have seen, Mr Mann, that it will not be enough to deliver fine appeals and issue demands, for what we need are quantifiable objectives. This method has proved its worth as regards the euro and is proving its worth at the moment as far as measures to combat youth unemployment are concerned. All 15 countries have instituted specific measures to this end and there will be a need for this across the board.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We are also expecting that in future there will be a more comprehensive debate on employment policy in the Member States, involving the two sides of industry, regional partners, those in charge at local level – for that is not yet the case – and of course we expect – and we are also agreed on this – that there will be socio-political convergence, in the light of modernisation of the social systems of course. But when Mr von Wogau says that we are way behind on the reform front in Europe then I am left wondering whom he is actually comparing us with. Surely not with Japan? And surely you do not seriously mean the American system? Take a look at the health care system there. Nowhere in Europe is it as expensive as it is in America, or as ghastly. And of course we want to afford women opportunities on the labour market. Insufficient consideration has been given to this aspect in the various employment policy options as well.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is one point which I will agree with you on, namely that concerning qualifications. It is indeed a shortcoming that Germany is having to bring in experts from Asia and India. We ought to have begun attending to the question of qualifications and training opportunities years ago. Unfortunately, however, Germany has rested on its laurels in this respect over the last 16 years.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has the cynicism to consider wage restraint as a positive factor, whereas in France alone, over three million workers receive a salary that is close to the poverty line and they barely survive any better than the other three million people kept unemployed by an insane economy. But you never speak of restraining the income of shareholders that is infinitely higher from the outset and which increases shockingly every year.</p>
<p class="contents">What you have as a result are all these major trusts that cut jobs while their profits are high, and which often make staff redundant simply to make their share price rise on the stock market. Eleven thousand job losses at Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, twenty two thousand at Unilever, ten thousand at ABB/Alsthom Power, not to mention all the others. The economic growth on which you pride yourself only benefits a fortunate minority, the owners and shareholders of the large industrial and banking groups. But beware of the backlash from the workers and the unemployed, who we keep telling that everything is getting better and better while they find that their lives are not improving but, on the contrary, are getting worse.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This debate, I think, has summed it up. The key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening, and it is no surprise that this issue has polarised the debate in a House which is known for its consensus and its carve-out politics, and I am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear, because this report is a radical one.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is a wake-up call to Europe. This report recommends radical measures, which in essence will make it easier to employ people. It is as simple as that. The reason why we have such crippling unemployment rates in Europe is that it is too difficult in many cases to employ people because of the red tape and the regulation and the inflexibility of the labour markets. This is the only way to go forward, because the real way to deliver social justice in Europe – and after all that is what we are all here to do – is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs. This report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that, because Europe has to wake up.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot create jobs just by government spending. It cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours, as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people. The real world simply does not work like that. And if Europe wants to be left behind, left behind to stagnation and to unemployment and to statism and to corporatism, than yes, vote against this report tomorrow. But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe, then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report, because it will deliver those jobs, and it will deliver those opportunities, and it is the only way to do so.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These recommendations concerned the need for effective coordination of the Union’s economic policies and the need to overcome the way that economic policy is managed separately from social policy, which has hitherto been a serious barrier to the definition of a coherent strategy for fighting unemployment and moving towards full employment. It is this absence of management of the European economy which is responsible, my dear Mr von Wogau, for the fall of the euro. </p>
<p class="contents">The report also contained recommendations concerning the creation of a European research area and the promotion in all countries of the Union of converging measures on research, lifelong learning and employability which would overcome any sort of unfair competition between the States in the field of taxation. Lastly, the recommendations also incorporated an updated version of the proposals in President Delors’ White Paper on the promotion of a European project for the development of a common network of infrastructures and services. </p>
<p class="contents">These recommendations, which, for the most part, are consistent with the guidelines in the Portuguese presidency’s work programme and which will therefore be discussed at the Lisbon Summit, have been rejected or distorted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament, by a majority which only managed to achieve a fragile unity in its rejection of the idea of a European Union which is founded on the convergence of national policies and not just on the grouping together of markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this Parliament, which has shown itself to be highly Europeanist so many times, must, on this occasion, show that it can express a majority vote for a political union of Europe which is capable of dealing with market weak spots and failures.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as I am concerned, practically all measures pertaining to proactive economic and employment policy have recently been dropped from the draft report by Mr Katiforis. It might still bear his name but it no longer bears his hallmark. I believe that in the face of such an unfortunate coalition in the Committee on Economic Affairs – allow me to use the term “aberration” – in the face of such an aberration, the facts, as presented by the Commission, speak for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We have an employment reserve in the European Union totalling not 15 but 30 million people, who would be more than happy to participate and get involved. According to the Commission, this employment shortfall costs the European Union between 12 and 20% of its GDP every year. Ideological questions of the ‘should there be more or less state intervention’ variety have no place in situations of this kind. In such situations, there is a need for joint efforts on everyone’s part to overcome this deplorable state of affairs and to translate proactive ideas into action. </p>
<p class="contents">There is sound evidence as to the accuracy of this theory. Ladies and gentlemen, those of you who voted against the Katiforis report in its original form in the Committee on Economic Affairs, please take a look at what the Commission put forward itself last Monday in the way of proposals for the Extraordinary Summit in Lisbon. What will you find in the Prodi paper? If you read these proposals – I have read them too, Mr Karas – if you follow them carefully, Mr von Wogau – unfortunately, Mr Gasoliba i Böhm has now left – then that is where you will find the things you voted against, namely concrete targets for increasing employment levels to 70% by 2010. This is precisely the logic that Katiforis used. You will find concrete targets for reducing the unemployment rate to 4%. That is exactly what Giorgos Katiforis wanted in the original wording of his report. You will find a clear statement to the effect that full employment is not one issue amongst many but the core issue of European economic policy. That is precisely the intention behind our proposed amendments. Hence, we would hope to receive the broad support of this House, for Parliament should not go back on something the Commission has already recognised with regard to Portugal.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its original form, it points the way towards a renewed economic policy which aims at something more than merely tightening up and balancing the economy. Now, finally, the EU’s position is, of course, such that we can achieve high growth and seriously take up the fight against unemployment without jeopardising objectives such as price stability and a balanced budget. It is therefore sad that, in committee, the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party should have voted down the proposals which take the fight against unemployment seriously. The debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this. </p>
<p class="contents">It is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals, namely that the Union’s economic policy ought to prioritise investments, partly in order to involve all the Union’s citizens in the information society, something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view. I am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant States’ links with trans-European networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and IT infrastructure. This is important for growth but also in order to avoid gulfs developing between people, both within the EU and between the EU and the applicant States. </p>
<p class="contents">The applicant States ought not merely to tag along behind but, instead, share the EU’s ambition of becoming a world leader in the communications field. Society needs, therefore, to take responsibility for the rapid and vigorous expansion of a modern IT infrastructure which also reaches small companies, poor regions and ordinary citizens. We have that opportunity right now. Let us grasp it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to say that I strongly disagree with Mrs Villiers’ view that this is such an interesting debate. I think that the European Parliament is doing itself absolutely no favours by thinking only in terms of old categories and churning out old political concepts and visions. It would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that, in this way, the European Parliament is excluding itself from the discussion at the very moment that an extremely interesting development is taking place in the European Union where a very wide, socio-economic agenda is being drawn up much more clearly. </p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in Lisbon. The Commission has done this in its five-year plan by listing one of the four priorities. The Commission document too, which is being drafted for the summit in Lisbon, takes precisely such a wide approach which covers different areas. I think that in adopting this wide socio-economic approach, the European Union is taking exactly the right line, not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted. </p>
<p class="contents">In this light, I think that the European Parliament’s role will be limited in Lisbon, but also in the forum in June for which we might have an invitation, but are unsure as to the input we can have. Are we going to have nothing more to report than the fact that we are still stuck in a mould of old political contradictions? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that the hearings of experts and the debates in committee have provided us with additional high-quality information. There is also no doubt that, throughout the debate this afternoon, we have heard differing opinions about the possible policies. However, I believe that there are also some elements of consensus. We all agree that the current economic conjuncture is good. We also agree about trying to further and benefit from this situation in order to improve conditions and about aiming for a definite improvement in employment. I will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which I regard as the essential issue in today’s debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, as some of you have noted, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in Europe. We currently believe that this improvement, which we highlighted in the perspectives in November, may lead to even better results than initially forecast. Employment is growing at a good rate. Despite yesterday’s figures, we certainly consider that the fact that inflation was around 2% in December shows that this is an issue which must be pursued. However, the rate of underlying inflation demonstrates that the inflationist tendencies are due to certain very specific elements such as the rise in oil prices and exchange rate developments.</p>
<p class="contents">When we submitted our report, we referred to the risks posed by growth. We basically highlighted the possibility of encountering difficulties in terms of growth in the USA, and therefore in other parts of the world, and of a sudden rise in inflation. This latter issue may be particularly significant if it causes cost-push inflation. This is why we are continuing to talk about the need for a wages policy compatible with the definitions of inflation which we want to establish.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s analysis has highlighted another issue which is the development of risk in the stock markets. The Commission regards this as significant although we do not believe that this is the basic problem. Anyway, we currently have some excellent opportunities to do more. We all agree that, after a decade of very weak growth and intolerable unemployment, certain action must be taken. We need public and private investment. Our levels of research and development are too low compared with our competitors and our low level of employment reflects, among other factors, the imbalances in our labour market. Our aim must therefore be to make this reactivation of the economy long-lasting with strong growth and job creation. The latter element continues to be the Commission’s fundamental objective, as we indicated in the Prodi document submitted for your debate at the Lisbon Summit, in that we are aiming for full employment in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">What policy should we use to achieve these objectives? In our opinion, the Union’s economy is reactivating but we still have idle production capacity, not only in terms of physical capital but also new sources of jobs. The policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully absorbed. We must define a macro-economic policy which aids growth. This is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth’s sake. It is simply a budgetary policy which can be coherent with price stability but which also allows us to have an appropriate monetary policy which contributes to growth. This policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will lead to growth. The EU’s potential for growth must pay particular attention to certain factors, on most of which I believe we agree with Parliament’s analysis. Firstly, private investment must be assisted. The Union must help to promote the spirit of enterprise and to generate employment in this way, but without forgetting public investment. This has been the major victim in recent years and any improvements in public finances must lead to improvements in public investment. However, this must be carried out with respect for our tax consolidation commitments. Our main support in the future must be for research and development and human capital. These are two of the principal challenges for the Lisbon Summit. It is essential that we tackle these challenges with quantified objectives and specific definitions. This will ultimately allow us to achieve our goal of clear improvements in productivity, thus enabling our society to grow, together with a rise in employment which will go some way towards making up the ground lost in recent years. This is the policy which the Commission has defended and will continue to defend in Lisbon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
