As was the case last spring in the Balkans, so today in East Timor democratic will is being trampled underfoot and this is causing great suffering and poses a serious risk to peace. Until we are able to put a stop to this situation, I think we should hang our heads in shame. In the last few days, I have done everything within my – still provisional – power to contact the Indonesian authorities. Today at 2 p.m., I will be having talks with President Habibie and I think we must pile on the pressure and make every effort to end what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the time to vote for the Commission has come. I have already explained to you several times why I believe that our programme is the right one and that this is the right team to lead the European Commission over the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">You have scrutinised the group of Commissioners both through their written responses to your questionnaires and through the hearings you have held with each Commissioner-designate. I should like to pay tribute today to the dignified and business-like way in which those difficult hearings were conducted. I also hope that your vote tomorrow will mark a new beginning in relations between our two institutions, because if there is a favourable vote, it means that after all these months, we can finally get down to work.</p>
<p class="contents">Together we must put Europe at the service of the people. We have to win back ordinary people’s confidence in Europe and in a European vision which puts their needs first.</p>
<p class="contents">I want our two institutions and the Council, which collectively form the triangle that underpins the European Union, to work together, genuinely and efficiently serving the people of Europe. I am determined to transform the Commission into a modern, efficient administration which has learnt the lessons of recent experience and finally put its house in order. </p>
<p class="contents">The reform process already underway within the Commission is just the beginning. In February 2000, Neil Kinnock, who is here beside me, will present a comprehensive Blueprint for Reform which will take careful account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts. And of course we will consult and inform the European Parliament on progress in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to become much more open. It is time for some glasnost here! I want to bring Europe out from behind closed doors and into the light of public scrutiny. I want people to be able to look over my shoulder and check that the Commission is really dealing with the issues that most concern them.</p>
<p class="contents">We have started as we mean to go on. Wherever possible, the new Commission will aim to match the best European practice. We have many examples to follow, and we will try to follow the best. For example, I am considering making a register of my correspondence available for public inspection in line with what is done in the most open countries in Europe. And the new Commission will be putting much more effort into communicating properly with the citizens of Europe, giving them open access to information. Transparency is vital for the democratic health and accountability of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Having talked about the method, I should now like to turn to what this new Commission will do, if endorsed of course, by referring to the programmes already explained in the other interventions and which are still entirely valid.</p>
<p class="contents">In January, as agreed, the Commission will present the policy perspectives for the next five years, to be closely followed by the presentation of the working programme for the year 2000. It is also important and essential that we hold a major overall political debate at the beginning of each year. I know you share my views on this. In future, therefore, I intend to present an Annual Political and Economic Report on the State of the Union. This report will consolidate material currently contained in a whole range of Commission reports that are not always well co-ordinated. This should provide a unifying element in the policy formulation process. It is my hope that together we will be able to organise the political discussion and consultation process much more coherently than before.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I would like to give you a brief overview of three fundamental challenges facing us: enlargement of the European Union and how this affects our relations with neighbouring countries; reform of the institutions of the European Union and the preparation of the next Intergovernmental Conference; and securing economic growth, creating jobs and the pursuit of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">We have inherited from our founders an adventurous, visionary project, and as we plan the future, it is important to recall what we have already achieved. We have created a customs union and a single market based on the free movement of goods, persons, services, and capital. We have built an economic and monetary union with a single currency. We have laid the foundations of a political union with shared institutions and a strong European Parliament elected by universal suffrage.</p>
<p class="contents">What we now need to build is a union of hearts and minds, underpinned by a strong shared sentiment of a common destiny – a sense of common European citizenship. We come from different countries. We speak different languages. We have different historical and cultural traditions. And we must preserve these differences. But today, we are seeking a shared identity – a new European soul.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the vision of the founding fathers fifty years ago to create a European Community based on peace, stability and prosperity. And that European ideal is as relevant to our citizens now as it was then. As I stand before you today, peace, stability and prosperity are still our common goal.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why enlarging the EU is such a tremendous challenge. Our political convictions will be reflected in our attitude to enlargement, as if in a mirror. Can we really think of achieving peace, stability and prosperity, while only reserving it for ourselves, the 15 Member States? I think not, and the Balkan crisis shows that this is not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The question therefore is, do we have the courage, the vision and the ambition to offer a genuine prospect of peace, stability and prosperity to an enlarged Union and beyond, to the wider Europe? Terrible conflicts have divided our continent this century. We in the European Union have put them behind us for good and we must help our neighbours to walk the same path. </p>
<p class="contents">I do not pretend that the task is easy. It requires a comprehensive strategy setting out how, over the next 25 years we are going to enlarge the European Union to 15, 20, 25 or even 30 Member States. This process will require a lot of sacrifices and changes within ourselves and in our relations with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy must take account of three things: first, the fact that, inevitably, enlargement will happen in stages: some countries will join before others; second, the specific needs of those countries who face a longer wait for membership; and third, the way in which this process of enlargement affects our other neighbours, for whom membership itself is not an issue but with whom we want close and constructive relations, which are required for peace and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first point, be sure that we need a political vision, not a technocratic one. We need to set a genuine enlargement strategy looking beyond accession to our life together in the enlarged family of European nations. This means, first of all, that we need to give serious consideration in Helsinki to setting a firm date for the accession of those countries which are best prepared, even if this means granting lengthy transition periods to deal with their political, social and economic problems. There are also implications for the next Intergovernmental Conference, to which I will return in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">And there is the fundamental question of how enlargement will affect our common policies. The more we enlarge, the harder it will be to say what effectively needs to be dealt with at a European level and what needs to be dealt with at a lower level.</p>
<p class="contents">We really must organise the subsidiarity that Europe is based on. I do not pretend to have the answers on this, but we must have the courage to address the question seriously and honestly.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that we have to think creatively and intelligently about meeting the needs of countries for whom Membership is a more distant prospect. I am thinking of closer co-operation with those countries, perhaps granting them ‘virtual Membership’ – please excuse the phrase, but it is difficult to find something better, and it is instructive – in certain areas as a prelude to full Membership. They could, for example, be offered the fullest possible participation in economic and monetary union, new forms of security co-operation adapted to their needs, and new forms of consultative and observer relationships with the European institutions on a case by case basis based on facts.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the situation in the Balkans deserves special mention, because although the prospect of EU Membership for those countries is not imminent, we must nonetheless use it to spur them towards peaceful co-existence and greater inter-regional partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear. The people of the Balkans have to resolve their conflicts themselves before they can enter the European Union. They should not think they can import them into the EU so we can resolve them for them. </p>
<p class="contents">However, they certainly need our assistance, and I want to underline the European Commission’s special responsibility for the large and essential reconstruction effort. Our citizens expect the European Union to take a moral and political lead, particularly in a region which is on our doorstep. I do not want to disappoint them. I am also concerned because in the space of a few weeks, discussions on the Balkans have lost vitality and dramatic force, almost as if in some way we consider them to be of secondary importance. </p>
<p class="contents">The third element of the strategy must be a clear and comprehensive approach towards our near neighbours whose contribution to the peace and stability of the wider Europe is vital. Such a strategy will succeed only if it is inclusive. All of us – the European Union, the applicant countries and our neighbours in the wider Europe – must work together towards our common destiny: a wider European area offering peace, stability and prosperity to all. A ‘new European order’. This should include ‘Strategic Partnerships’ with Russia and Ukraine, adapted to the geo-political dimensions of these countries. And it should include a ‘Partnership of Cultures’ – the term I am tempted to suggest for a new and much more ambitious commitment towards the Mediterranean, where we Europeans are dedicated to promoting a new, exemplary harmony between peoples of the three religions of Jerusalem. A resounding ‘No’ to the need for conflict between civilisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must say a word about the importance of our strategic relationship with the United States. We need to build a reinforced transatlantic partnership capable of showing real joint leadership. Our first opportunity to do this will be the launch of an ambitious and comprehensive Millennium Round in Seattle offering further progress to all WTO Members: let us seize this opportunity with farsightedness and intelligence, and begin a new chapter on world trade relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the second immediate challenge facing us: the imminent Intergovernmental Conference. We have always known that enlargement would raise the difficult question of how the institutions function. But the recent crisis in the Commission and the poor turnout in the 1999 European elections have shown that a genuinely ambitious reform of the European institutions is now imperative. And the Treaty of Amsterdam – positive on some issues – has fallen short of what was required on directly institutional matters.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, to proceed by stages, with an endless series of Intergovernmental Conferences, is particularly unappealing. It would plunge Europe into a state of perpetual constitutional reform. This would be incomprehensible to our citizens and our neighbours. And it would be a huge waste of energy much needed elsewhere to initiate new policies. </p>
<p class="contents">So we cannot afford to settle for a minimal reform that fails to equip us with an effective and efficient decision-making apparatus. As you know, I have asked Mr De Haene, Mr von Weiszäcker and Lord Simon to prepare a report which the Commission will draw upon in forming its own position on the issues which the Intergovernmental Conference must tackle. This report will be made available to you, and I look forward to a constructive debate in the run-up to the Helsinki Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to express our views clearly and loudly, because the coming months will be crucial in determining whether we enter a new era strong and well-equipped or weak and inward-looking.</p>
<p class="contents">But Europe is not about institutions: it is about people. Prosperity in Europe depends on European people having jobs, and we need to get Europe back to work. Jobs depend on a healthy economy, so the third key challenge facing us is how to achieve environmentally and economically sustainable growth that creates new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">After a difficult period, the European economy is now recovering. Growth is back, even if it is not yet uniformly spread, but the signs are good. The sometimes painful process of convergence towards economic and monetary union – combined with the responsible attitude of the economic and social forces towards wages – has finally created the macroeconomic conditions for healthy growth. The introduction of the euro has consolidated this achievement. The Member States’ stability programmes will deepen it.</p>
<p class="contents">This is good news. But it also places upon us a huge responsibility. The economic upturn provides us with a golden opportunity to make structural adjustments at lower costs. Modernising Europe’s economy today means more European jobs tomorrow. We cannot afford to miss this opportunity, as we have too often done in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore use the more favourable years ahead to ensure that growth remains strong for as long as possible, that it generates the jobs we need, and that we combine it with a renewed and meaningful commitment to sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also tackle the long-term problems resulting from demographic trends, which constitute one of Europe’s main problems that we must still work on, and their impact on the fabric of our societies. Ultimately, this means increasing both productivity and the number of people actively participating in the labour force. If we can do this, we have a real opportunity to build an equitable and sustainable society for present and future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">The single market has given a new vitality to our economics and is contributing to the present recovery. But we must continue restructuring the single market and promoting liberalisation to bring even more competition in the goods and, especially, the services sector. This will help us to maximise the job-creating potential of growth and, in the longer term, will support a higher growth in our productive capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the place to list the structural reforms needed: they have already been outlined in many Commission reports. We must now start to put them into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to mention one specific challenge facing us, which we can add to the list begun in other discussions on health, sport and so on. Information technology is transforming the way in which we live and work and the way in which firms operate. It enables individuals and firms to do things unthinkable only a few years ago. The current stunning performance of the American economy owes much to the gusto with which the United States has embraced information technology. I am concerned that European countries seem reluctant to fully exploit the potential of this technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Modern economies are increasingly knowledge-based, and this is an area where we have a competitive advantage at world level. Encouraging the use and development of information technologies will therefore be a priority for the new Commission. I propose to launch an initiative in this area for the Helsinki Summit, and it will be ambitious, aiming to involve all the European youth.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must take advantage of economic recovery and stronger growth to adapt our welfare systems to current demographic trends. We can no longer ignore the problems or postpone the decisions: the pensioners of 2050 are already among us! A highly developed welfare system is one of the distinctive features of our European societies and we must preserve it. However, we owe it to our children to adapt it so that it will offer them credible promises as close as possible to those it held out to our generation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recently proposed an ambitious strategy for further EU co-operation in this area, and this is something to which I will be attaching particular importance. In all these difficult tasks, the European Union has a crucial role to play. First, because it is more effective to address long-term issues through concerted European strategies – such as those aimed at European employment – than at purely national or local level, even though this level is necessary too. Second, because action at European level often makes it easier to avoid the more immediate pressures of the national electoral cycle. So, we can distance ourselves a bit more from the problems, and we must therefore see the wider picture. We have the tools to do the job. For example, following the Luxembourg Summit, solid progress has been made in building a genuine European employment strategy in which the combination of guidelines and recommendations is providing a powerful European stimulus to change.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to continue driving this process forward, deepening co-operation at European level so as to focus people’s minds and actions on the major structural reforms needed to revitalise our economies. This is now possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you are the democratically elected representatives of the European citizens. You represent the different European political families in all their diversity and complexity. I hope that in your vote tomorrow you will give the new Commission your strong support. For my part, I stand by the political commitments I gave to the Conference of Presidents last week, which now have to be integrated into a new framework that will govern our future work. Let us therefore turn the page. Let us foster a new spirit of co-operation between our institutions. A new balance, based on mutual respect and firm co-operation. A new partnership, working for the people of Europe. A new Commission. A new European Parliament. A new start.</p>

A lasting order of peace in South-East Europe, the accession of central European states to the European Union, dialogue and partnership between the cultures in the Mediterranean area situated between the European Union and Arabic and Islamic states are just a few of the challenges which demand a strong Europe. That is why we need a Commission which is in a position to act. </p>
<p class="contents">At the July part-session of Parliament, Romano Prodi spoke of the Commission as a kind of government. If this expression is adopted – and I personally am sympathetic to its being so – then this government (that is to say, the Commission) is answerable to the European Parliament. This means that the period of ignoring the European Parliament must now finally be over. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We support a new culture of relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission. On 2 September, I made five demands of the Commission-designate. The Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats welcomes the fact that, on 7 September, at the Conference of Presidents, the President-designate of the Commission provided a satisfactory response to these demands, and he has just now referred to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the timetable of the Parliament and of its Committees and, therefore, the presence of the Commission in the Parliament, are to take precedence over all other obligations of the European Commission. Secondly, requests by Parliament to the Commission to set out legislative proposals are to be complied with as far as possible. Thirdly, a vote of no-confidence against a Member of the Commission is to be reason enough for the President of the Commission to seriously consider dismissing him. Fourthly, constructive dialogue and regular consultation are to take place with the European Parliament about reform of the Commission. Fifthly, Parliament and the Commission are to support comprehensive institutional reform in anticipation of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats will take care to ensure that these obligations entered into by the Commission are adhered to word for word. We trust Romano Prodi to keep his word. However, we also expect every future Member of the European Commission to accept as his own duty the obligation entered into by the President-designate of the Commission and, if he does not, then there will be repercussions.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is called to office tomorrow, the Commission-designate takes up its tasks with a number of deficits. We ought not even today to conceal this fact. In appointing the Members of the Commission, the President-designate was not always granted the room for manoeuvre specified by treaty. There remains a structural, democratic deficit in the fact that the result of the elections to the European Parliament has still not been taken into account in the political composition of the Commission. In the interests of democracy in the European Union, this ought not to be repeated. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our group does not place party political interests above the interests of the European Union. But there are still questions, even serious doubts, about a number of Members-designate of the Commission, especially about the Member of the Commission assigned to research policy. Partly in view of the discussion in which we are still now engaged, we would ask you, Professor Prodi, to let us have a satisfactory answer, both in your résumé and also tomorrow. We are not uncritical with regard to ourselves or to the European Parliament. The hearings, which have been an important contribution to more transparency and openness, were, all in all, a success. Critics should consider that there is nothing comparable at a national level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, improvements are necessary. The Parliament should already now be discussing in its standing committee whether it might not be sensible to include a procedural process in its Rules of Procedure so as to avoid, in the next hearings, the difficulties and problems which have cropped up in the present ones. </p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few months, the impression has arisen that the European Union is characterised by maladministration, fraud, nepotism and scandals. This impression is unjustified overall. The large majority of European officials produce good, first-class work, and these officials are entitled to be supported, thanked and acknowledged by ourselves in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">But where there are undesirable developments, in fact even criminal acts, we must confront these thoroughly and decisively. The Commission and the European Parliament have the same task of promoting and reinforcing confidence in the European institutions. Madam President, Mr President-designate of the Commission and Commission-designate, the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats will make their decision this evening, partly in the light of the answers which we are still awaiting from the President-designate of the Commission. Our group will make this decision with a very great sense of responsibility for establishing a Europe which is capable of acting; that is to say, a European Union which is capable of acting and which is bound by the principles of transparency, democracy and parliamentarianism, a European Union to which people can give their consent. All this in the light of the present century’s experiences on the threshold of the year 2000 and in the light of what is being experienced right now in former Yugoslavia. We must continue building the European Union and strengthening it so that people can accept it as a community of law, a community of freedom, a community of peace in the 21st century.</p>

I would like to ask him whether he proposes any common European action in relation to East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">We are arriving at the decisive moment in this long gestation period of the Millennium Commission: its investiture, with the democratic legitimacy which the recent elections to the European Parliament have given us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists has behaved coherently throughout the process, and this can be summed up in the affirmation of the need to positively overcome the institutional and political crisis which has paralysed the Union since December of last year. We need construction rather than destruction, so that we can set to work with the aim of resolving the problems and responding to the aspirations of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the House took a first step in May by voting en masse for Romano Prodi as President of the Commission. Today, I can restate the support of our group which has felt free to vote, into such an important post, a politician with such a long pro-European record, whose party history we do not share, although we appreciate his journey between the cross, the olive tree and the donkey. We have never asked to see Mr Prodi’s party membership card in order to vote him into such a high post.</p>
<p class="contents">With the same criteria we have examined, in writing and orally, the team which President Prodi, after negotiations with the governments of the Member States, has presented to us as his government. For the purposes of getting to know the personalities and suitability of the candidates for the fulfilment of their duties, we believe that the public hearings have been a positive exercise in democracy and transparency, and those who have tried to turn them into a witch-hunt have failed.</p>
<p class="contents">As a conclusion to the process, we have decided to support the investiture of the new Commission despite the reservations which we have in relation to Mrs Palacio, whose innocence we accept, but whose idea of political responsibility in a matter which concerns the Community budget we do not share. Let us hope that, as Vice-President, she offers more trustworthy information than she gave on her exoneration by the Congress of Deputies. This debate will be carried out in plenary session next Thursday in Madrid.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Bolkestein, the conditions which President Prodi himself imposed on his team, as we understand it, oblige him to renounce the Presidency of the Liberal International, because of incompatibility, and not because we want him to renounce his ideas, especially those which he demonstrated during his hearing.</p>
<p class="contents">Our vote is not a blank cheque. By offering him our trust, we are establishing an umbilical cord which completes the legitimacy of the Commission as the responsible executive in democratic terms. We are doing this in the hope that they work hard and effectively during the legislature. And our relations must be based on how we obtain and maintain the trust between ourselves and our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the only way of preventing new crises and overcoming the present one. To this end, we propose the following specific commitments, which we believe may serve as the basis for a new contract with our peoples. The Commission must present that political programme for the legislature which you, Mr Prodi, on the proposal of my group, committed yourself to in January, with annual debates and programmes. May I point out that this proposal has been accepted by the Conference of Presidents and requires a de facto amendment of our Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this debate, I tell you in advance that my group will require the acceptance of further specific commitments in terms of policies on employment, social and economic cohesion and the modernisation of our economies, taking into account people, enlargement, the Mediterranean and the defence of human rights throughout the world, as cornerstones of our foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, we have to negotiate a framework agreement which forms a solid basis for the improvement of our institutional relationships, with measures relating to transparency and information, such as obtaining the working documents of the Council, the Minutes of the meetings of the College of Commissioners, except when confidentiality has been agreed, or an information system on the work of OLAF which would take into account the necessary discretion.</p>
<p class="contents">With a good framework agreement, the question of individual condemnation of Commissioners will be put on the correct footing: that of the public political commitment of President Prodi and all the candidates to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event that a Commissioner clearly loses the trust of Parliament, it will be up to you and the person concerned to take responsibility. Let us hope that there is no repeat of what happened to that spiritual leader of the West, Mr Stoiber, President of the Government of Bavaria, who did not manage to turn his Minister Sauter into a scapegoat and get him to resign and consequently, has had to appeal to his own Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking here in political terms and amongst responsible people. No regulation can replace honesty in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">There are two areas in which a close relationship between our institutions can create trust between our citizens. The first is the reform of the institutions. We await the Commission’s proposal for reform which you have announced and which Vice-President Kinnock is due to present in February. For our part, and I say this solemnly, we can contribute, using this time to approve the statutes of the Members of the European Parliament and the assistants, by means of which we, ladies and gentlemen, can teach by example.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area is the Intergovernmental Conference. We cannot wait for the programme. I take your word, Mr Prodi, and I hope that we can debate the report of the three experts before the Helsinki Summit in order to establish a common approach for the Commission and the European Parliament for the purposes of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">We will vote for the investiture of the Commission for the legislature without condition or reserve, and also without renouncing our rights and responsibilities so that it can set to work as of tomorrow to do what it has to do, what our peoples want it to do, and to do it well.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, let me begin by saying on behalf of my group that we fully share the perspective of Mr Prodi that certainly from tomorrow we stand on the threshold of a new beginning; a new beginning in particular between our two institutions, Parliament and the Commission, and a new beginning for Europe itself.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issues which the President-designate has raised of reform, which should be brought forward by Commissioner Kinnock next February with due consultation, the policy programme of next January, the moral and political imperative of addressing the enlargement challenge and preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference, I pledge my group to a positive and constructive engagement with the Commission in this regard. Indeed we look forward to getting down to serious and immediate work on questions such as East Timor, south-eastern Europe and the Balkans in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">But today is an opportunity for this House to review the investiture process and to place on record some of the questions or observations that arise from that. In due course, within the House and in the appropriate fora, my own group intends to contribute to a debate which we hope will be initiated on lessons which we ourselves, as Parliament, must learn from the hearings process. We certainly would hope for the future that we might be able to develop procedures to allow for what might be described as more questioning in depth of nominees. That said, however, we believe that the exercise just completed has been a positive and valuable exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Some in this House – I believe from the outset that they have been a minority, though perhaps rather vocal in terms of the media – have talked of targeting individual nominees. This has not been the approach nor the view of my group. We believe that ab initio this kind of process, which, as I said, was a minority pursuit, to be a sign of weakness and not of strength.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, when we vote on the college, the ELDR group will vote for a college and we will not seek at this point to differentiate, to pick or to choose between nominees. We respect in the act of voting tomorrow the essential collegiality of the European Commission and regard that as an essential value for its working method. But we have some questions that arise from the hearings and some observations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the procedures to date, many of the nominee Commissioners were kind enough to, in effect, promise in advance a charter of reform for their own areas and have alluded to specific policy commitments. We have taken note of those commitments and we expect to see them reflected in the work programme in January. We shall check that programme against those commitments which were given in the course of the hearings.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious from the hearings – indeed without them it is obvious – that there are major areas of overlap and therefore potential conflict in operational responsibilities within the college. Here again we hope that, in working through the programme for January, where these overlaps arise they will be explicitly identified and addressed in order that potential conflicts in spheres of responsibility should not slow down the reform process.</p>
<p class="contents">I recall in particular questions about the overlaps between food law and food safety, the various overlaps that one can imagine with the World Trade Organisation and a host of other responsibilities, not least those of the Environment Commissioner. The President mentioned the importance of electronic commerce and information technology. These issues must clearly be addressed as to responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Many colleagues have also raised questions about the desirability of separating the ex ante responsibility for budget control from the ex post responsibility for budget implementation or formulation within the Commission. Many in my own group have raised this question with me. I raise it today but hasten to add that this is in no way a reflection on the qualities or capacity of the nominee Commissioner charged to deal with both of these issues in the current sphere of responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a certain diversity of views, Mr Prodi, among your nominee Commissioners about their personal political accountability in the future. They all accepted in the hearings that they will be responsible for themselves and their cabinets. Some did not quite accept what I believe is also a necessary requirement, that in the matter of policy formulation and implementation they carry a general responsibility for their departments, answerable to the college but accountable to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, my group, has for many months now raised the question of individual responsibility. Again I return to that point today. I have already said we support as necessary the collegiate nature of the Commission. However we reassert, as we have done consistently, that an effective college requires the assumption of individual political responsibility. The buck must stop somewhere. Where everyone is responsible it can result in a system where no one is responsible. We do not contest, President Prodi, your prerogative to act in this regard. But we insist that, whatever the current state of law, the law needs changing and that if a Commissioner fails to enjoy the confidence of this House you must act accordingly. We urge you to do that. It is your prerogative but it is our right to insist that the confidence of this House be respected and its absence be respected also. Indeed, here I hope you will not adopt the Stoiber formulation referred to by Mr Barón Crespo.</p>
<p class="contents">I should add, arising from matters raised in the hearings but not concluded, in respect of some of the individual nominee Commissioners that should any legal or criminal proceedings arise – which I do not anticipate would necessarily be the case but which would pose problems for the integrity of the Commission - we would expect the President of the Commission to act in such circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">We intend to negotiate later today and tomorrow a political resolution. That will formulate and specify a number of requests, not just on the area of individual responsibility but also specifically to do with areas of transparency and access to documents. When we vote on those my group will expect to hear from you a specific detailed and positive response before our final vote.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we share the vision expressed here today. It is high time that we had this new beginning. It is the time for us to return to serious work. It is time that we recognise and rebuild as institutions – Commission and Parliament – our common European vocation. The ELDR group pledges itself to that task.</p>

You have spoken of an enduring development, you have spoken of peace and of stability. Mr Prodi, you may not belong to the great Expressionist painters, but I have faith that your gentle leadership can produce good results. You have also mentioned East Timor, and we all expect that Europe will bear full responsibility in this matter. What we have heard from the Commission in Parliament has not been a useless act and a worthless spectacle at all, they have been particularly necessary and you yourself have been completely right to demonstrate to us in the last week that elsewhere in Parliament the Executive has not got around to issuing any detailed clarifications. Perhaps in this there would be a model also in relation to other Parliaments and executive bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">This Commission cannot ally itself with the Council unilaterally, just as its predecessor frequently did, unfortunately. My group will not unite with those who would like the Commission to be some kind of secretariat to the Council. No. The Commission is a political organ and, as has now become clear, it also has political responsibility to, of all things, the European Parliament. So that we can have confidence in your Commission at least until the year 2005, it must first be confirmed what this new spirit in the relations between the Council and the Commission will come to mean in practice. We are still waiting for clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">My group emphasises the political responsibility of each Member of the Commission, and we accept your promise that you will carefully study the well-founded dissatisfaction with each Member of the Commission. The President of the Commission must also commit himself to using his power if there is any Member of the Commission suspected of, or being investigated concerning, misconduct or criminal behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, one thing must be stressed: there are far too few women in the composition of your Commission, and this must be stated now so that we learn something from this for future occasions. In future, the equal representation of men and women in the Commission or in other named bodies of the Union cannot be an optional principle of others in the group. Concrete measures are needed. When the new agreement between Parliament and the Commission is negotiated, action must be taken so that in future the candidates for the Commission will also be discussed with Parliament. The procedure now followed has clearly proved to be too limited. My group also calls for the amendments to the legislative process proposed by a large majority in Parliament to be taken in accordance with the proposals of the Commission in future. We also appreciate that you have promised to take a serious view of Parliament’s suggestions for legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call for Parliament to be included in the coming reform of Union bodies and also in the negotiation process with a completely different emphasis than has previously been the case. We will also be responsible for including the whole commonwealth of European nations in this process because the upcoming reform of European institutions will guarantee greater rights to the citizens of Europe. We have not been satisfied with the way in which Parliament has been allowed to participate in international agreements. We also call for Parliament to be consulted at every stage in future in negotiations such as those involving the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, everyone is talking about glasnost, and transparency, and I believe that you are talking about it sincerely, but the hearings have not convinced me that the individual candidates or even you yourself, as the future President of the Commission would understand what glasnost or transparency really mean in practice. It must not remain a mere catchphrase. Your first task is to create the background for the transparency required by the Amsterdam Treaty. This is not only necessary so that Parliament is kept informed, but also so that the citizens and all the nations can influence the development of the European Union with an emphasis which is completely fresh.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And we have received it. You and the Commissioners have found the words to express it: change, reforms, questioning, new culture, glasnost.</p>
<p class="contents">Although often suspected of arrogance, the Commission has managed to come down off its pedestal. Although it has a reputation for opacity, it has committed itself to promoting transparency. Although severely criticised by the Committee of Wise Men, it has adopted the recommendations of the Independent Experts. During the hearings, the Commissioners proved to be so open to the consensus of the majority of Members that even the groups which, for reasons outside European politics, had promised to maintain an antagonistic attitude were quick to bury the hatchet. In short, you set yourself the task of regaining the confidence of Parliament, and you managed to achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">It must, however, be noted that you have not tackled the other challenge which you just mentioned, Mr President, a far more ambitious one, it is true, with the same strong will – that of regaining the confidence of the citizens of Europe. And there’s the rub. You, like us, will note that a real phenomenon of rejection of Neo-liberalism, bearing with it a great desire for justice, solidarity and change, is on the increase in our societies. What new solutions do you offer in response to the increasing rejection of the galloping ever-growing threat to job security and even to life itself? What new solutions do you offer in response to this thirst for resistance to the frantic rush for profits which is being expressed throughout Europe, for example, at this very moment, in my own country, in the form of the immense movement of sympathy towards the workers of the Michelin group which has just announced 7 500 layoffs in Europe despite seeing its profits climb by 20%. What new solutions do you offer the men and women who expect Europe to give the impetus for a real dynamic of alternatives to the globalisation of exclusion that is today at work, whether it is a matter of employees, rural workers, or cultured people opposing the regulations of world trade, or two young men from Guinea, victims of the flight from poverty, in default of an international order recognising the right of each and every human being to life, employment and dignity?</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with this, I note, Mr President, that in your inaugural speech I heard no mention of the relationship between Europe and the South, that is to say the majority of the human race. Generally, the responses of the Commission to all these ethical questions are far too conventional: they do not have the ambition which generates major projects.</p>
<p class="contents">At the start of my speech, I highlighted the efforts you have made towards fulfilling the expectations of Parliament. The comments I have just made do not deny the progress made, but put them into perspective. Still less does my group ignore the slight shift in the centre of gravity of the Commission towards Parliament which has just taken place, as this proves, in the eyes of the world, that it is possible to shift the position of seats of power, even those reputed to be untouchable, and this is very important. I would add that the working areas which have been opened up are of interest to us. In this respect, we shall be demanding but constructive partners. For all that, we cannot let ourselves be satisfied with administrative reform whilst our fellow citizens are asking us questions on the very meaning of Europe today. At this stage, therefore, we cannot, to our great regret, affirm our confidence in this Commission.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Madam President, at the outset we must view this week as a new beginning for all the key institutions within the European Union as to how they intend to interact and work together on various policy programmes over the next five years. In particular the relationship between the European Parliament and the European Commission must be hardworking and harmonious, so as to ensure that key elements of our EU legislative requirements are enacted in as an effective a manner as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The 350 million people who make up the membership of the European Union will not thank either the European Parliament or the European Commission if we are seen in the public eye as having a fractious relationship in any shape or form. This would only help to erode public confidence in the institutions of the Union, which would be a very regressive step for all interested parties, particularly in the light of the key challenges that lie ahead for the Union as a political and economic entity.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-elect of the Commission, Mr Prodi, has certainly made it clear that he intends to guarantee that the European Commission and the European Parliament will work extremely closely together on the implementation of a comprehensive work programme within the Union over the next five years. Included within this process must be the efficient working of the codecision procedure, which covers the enactment of EU legislation across 38 different economic and social sectors of our society. Since the Amsterdam Treaty came into force on 1 May, the codecision procedure, which involves a very close relationship between Parliament, the Commission and the Council, now covers a wide range of policies including those in the transport sector, regional affairs, social matters, employment initiatives, structural funding, consumer protection, public health and environmental concerns. The relationship between the European Commission and the European Parliament must not be based on strict contractual terms. We must set common policy objectives together and face the key challenges which lie ahead for the European Union within a united and unified framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union works at its best when Parliament, the Commission and the Council are working closely together on the implementation of various EU regulations and directives. The body of the European Union treaties and, in particular, the Single European Act, the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty are all to be reevaluated in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. This IGC will examine what key amendments must be made to the body of EU legislation to take account of the impending enlargement of the European Union. Preparing for enlargement is not going to be a particularly easy task and it will not be made any easier if Parliament and the Commission are not working closely together to guarantee that tough decisions must be taken on these issues or worked through in an atmosphere of understanding and equal purpose. Enlargement of the European Union will itself not succeed unless the internal decision-making procedures within the Union are streamlined and simplified.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with the accession of six new Member States between the years 2004 to 2006, we all collectively have a lot of work to do to ensure that this process is a success. The forthcoming IGC is the biggest challenge facing the European Union as a political and economic body since the decisions were taken when negotiating the Maastricht Treaty to set in train the process of Economic and Monetary Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Next time, they must be prepared better and concentrate on fewer questions, which can then be pursued until the Commissioners give clear and unambiguous answers. We still do not know these 15 men and 5 women. We have heard about which of them is interested in jazz but we also want information about the economic interests they have represented over the last twenty years so that they are protected against unnecessary pressure. We shall also insist upon clear answers on the subject of openness. Some questions, then: will the ombudsman receive all the documents he asks for? Will the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control receive all the documents concerning fraud that she requests? Will we be able to obtain a complete overview of all the committees and their members so that we might see who is involved in making laws and taking decisions? Will Mr Prodi, here in the Chamber, solemnly promise that there will no longer be documents in the Commission which can be read at COPA, within the national delegations, in the lobbying firms and by journalists but not by ourselves, who have merely been elected by the people? Dear Professor Prodi, at the meeting with my group you promised that there would always be a place in Parliament where full information could be obtained from the Commission. Will you repeat that promise here today in the Chamber, where it is binding? I shall then, in return, promise critical and constructive opposition on behalf of my group.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But let us take a look at what he has done in the past. I do not mean in a professional sense, because he has amassed considerable personal wealth – he has used his abilities well – but let us look at when he was Chairman of IRI, Italy’s largest economic public body, and the thousands of billions of lira much of this from the pockets of taxpayers in the Po area – that he managed to squander by implementing a policy which led to bankruptcy. Just think of the steelworks in Southern Italy that are now closed. And I recall that as Italy’s Prime Minister, a vote of no confidence was brought against him by Parliament and also by those political groups which – and I do not know how they have the nerve, the cheek – have become turncoats and have willingly voted for him here after having voted against him in Rome.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And as the coda to these hearings, in my judgement, Mr Prodi has shown signs of political good sense and courage in the speech which he has just made. The offers which he has made us, which are broadly accepted by this group, form a clear commitment to European integration and are a clear declaration of intentions with regard to the representation of citizens which this Parliament demonstrates.</p>
<p class="contents">Where is the problem then? In my frank opinion, it lies in some people’s attempts to transfer their domestic debates to the Community institutions, in those governments which juggle European postings in order to satisfy the demands of pacts in their countries, and also in some opposition parties who wish to achieve on a higher level what they cannot achieve at home, like Mr Barón, in Spain, who has been ordered to prolong the internal domestic debate by attacking the Vice-President-designate of the European Commission in, as he well knows, an unjust and dishonest way.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón, please display more independence, more prudence and, above all, more responsibility. Ask the advice of your sympathisers, Mr Solbes and Mr Solana, because we know how these things begin but not how they end and, sometimes, the schemes backfire. You have some experience in this respect. And above all, do not try to distort the facts. State here that the Committee of Inquiry on flax of the Congress of Deputies has already approved its conclusions. State clearly that this Committee has cleared Mrs de Palacio of any responsibility, pointing out that the responsibility for the management, control and granting of subsidies falls to the Spanish Autonomous Communities, and famously the one governed by one of your cohorts in Castilla La Mancha.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Madam President, by saying that I want to forget about this squalor because it is not our style. We still have an enormous task to perform during the next five years, in which dialogue and the existence of a consensus between us and between the institutions is essential if we are to continue to make progress. We offer you our co-operation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE)</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, I am assuming that you will be receiving a vote of confidence from this Chamber tomorrow. I should therefore like to speak to you directly, but I must first make just one comment to Mr Galeote who is also now being so kind as to put his headphones on.</p>
<p class="contents">You started out by saying that we ought not to be discussing any internal political matters here. You then went on to spend at least half of your speech dealing with just such internal political matters. If you have seen how reticently Enrique Barón has addressed the subject, then you will see how reticently we too are dealing with it, because we do not want to deal with any internal political matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, I can agree one hundred per cent with the programme you have put forward today. I should not like, therefore, to comment upon it in more detail but, rather, to mention a few more points in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we are engaged in a process – and here I should like to take up a concept which Michel Barnier used during the hearings – a process of developing a constitution. This is not something which we can do overnight, but it is something which we really must set in progress over the next few years. For this, there needs to be a big European debate. You yourself have said – and I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission – that a succession of Intergovernmental Conferences is not particularly appealing. I would imagine that you are making proposals from your own point of view too about how you see this process of developing a constitution. For the Commission must in fact have a leading role to play. In this connection, Mr President, I must mention that a number of the Members of your Commission have still not perhaps made the relevant approach to the European Commissioner in the course of these hearings. A number of them were still too caught up in the business of the governments to which they belonged or in the roles set by their individual nations. Here, the European consciousness must certainly be strengthened, above all because we are unfortunately also seeing increasing nationalism, which we must combat.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, reform of the institutions. In yesterday’s debate here, we were in complete agreement with what Commissioner Kinnock stated. It was a clear and unambiguous creed of reform and could not have been clearer. I should like, however, to repeat exactly what he said: “deeds speak louder than words”. That is the basis on which we shall judge you. I am convinced that deeds will in fact follow, but it is they that will be the yardstick for our further ratification of the Commission in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is the question of openness and transparency. Yes, it is also a measure of the relationship of the Commission to this Parliament that we demand complete openness, the full truth and not half-truths or statements which mislead. That, for us, is the deciding factor. It is also quite clear – and this too we have always said unambiguously – that if it should prove that a Member of the Commission has lied to this Parliament, then our confidence in that particular Commissioner has certainly been destroyed. We are therefore absolutely in favour of there being in addition to – I emphasise, in addition to – the principle of collegiality, the principles of individual trust and individual responsibility. Only, we do not want a situation in which a multi-party policy plays any role here. We do not want Commissioners from small political groups from small countries being to some degree open to blackmail by majorities in this Chamber. So we have to take this with a pinch of salt. We need sensible regulations which do not undermine and interfere with the principle of collegiality.</p>
<p class="contents">A last word about the hearings. They were positive. Not everyone shone all the time, but it is easier being the examiner than the examinee. On the whole, though, we find that this Commission is in a position to be a strong Commission but, Mr Prodi, a strong Commission because you can be certain that we shall be a strong and alert Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">The two together can nicely set about the necessary reform of the European institutions. We wish you good luck with your work.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Costa, Paolo (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Mr President-designate, ladies and gentlemen, this new chapter in our history requires us to be here today for this discussion on the crisis in transparency and the crisis in the functioning of the Commission. Mr President-designate, you have agreed to lead us out of that crisis, which is why you are here today to propose, and we are here to demand, institutional reform and the strengthening of European politics. Leaving aside the albeit serious crisis which initiated everything, this was the only possible outcome because, there is now a demand, for apparently opposing reasons, for greater attention to be paid both to the need for institutional reform and for more policies. I said for apparently opposing reasons because one of the subjects we are dealing with is the apparent bewilderment – I hope it is not lack of confidence – of the European citizens, as shown by the poor turnout in the June elections but, on the other hand, there is undoubtedly more being asked of Europe. The Kosovo crisis has certainly highlighted the original reasons for the creation of a united Europe. Europe as an instrument of strengthened European institutions, as an instrument to ensure peace even before ensuring prosperity, across the entire continent.</p>
<p class="contents">This demand calls for commitments on enlargement and on strengthening the institutions which on the one hand, we must honour. However, on the other hand, for the Europe already in existence, for those countries of Europe which are already part of the Union, there is more being asked of Europe. The euro is a tool, an intermediate stage. It is a condition, a tool for bringing prosperity to everyone, so that we can move on to those policies which form the fundamental chapter we are about to open, the final goal, that is, more growth, more development, more employment. We must deal with the need for new transparency, new institutions and new politics. As for transparency – we have already said, Mr President – our group puts all its confidence in you, confidence which obviously depends on the results you and your Commission will achieve. This confidence obviously depends on each individual Commissioner’s ability to sustain high moral and professional standards. We shall keep a close watch on the Commissioners in many different ways, which includes the improved methods of transparency that you have promised us.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in my view, we need to make greater progress on the institutional problem, because that is what the institutions’ image hinges on as far as the European citizens are concerned. I think that the points of that triangle you mentioned – Commission, Parliament and Council – must evolve, are evolving and will evolve along an upwards course towards the progressive, inevitable transfer of powers from the governments – that is, from the Council – to the citizens, and therefore to Parliament. This is the basic process that we can either speed up or slow down. We are asking you – and this is why we are happy to put our confidence in a strong Commission – to do all you can, which means a lot, and maybe even more than you imagine doing at the moment. We are asking you to be ambitious in this area, to make sure that as you already said in a meeting with the leaders of the parliamentary groups, the relationship between Parliament and the Commission is a positive one.</p>
<p class="contents">This is possible, but it depends on you. It also depends on us. We will do all we can to create the conditions necessary for success. However, we are doing all this as a means to implement European policies. We accept the commitments that enlargement brings, but even if the focus is now essentially shifting towards Central and Eastern Europe, we must not lose sight of the Mediterranean policies that Europe has a duty to adopt.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that there is a great deal of work to do. I know that the difficulties may seem impossible to overcome. But I also know that you have the right qualities, the will and the ability to succeed. Aim high, Mr President! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You announced your intention to set your house in order, fight against corruption, demonstrate efficiency and strictness, and you announced the implementation of ambitious reforms. We are delighted to hear it. You even went beyond this debate, mentioning a number of challenges facing the Commission and the European Union: expansion, consolidation of growth, sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I do not see any hierarchical ordering in this list, and I do not believe we can get away from what seems to me a crucial challenge for the future: overcoming the possible lack of coherence between the policies run by the European Union. Let me take one example: you declare yourself in favour of greater liberalisation, yet it will be difficult, in this context, to achieve real sustainable development. You will recall the commitments on biodiversity made by the European Union, whether at Kyoto or at Rio: the convention on the subject is still at the draft stage. Do I also have to remind you of the Copenhagen Declaration on social development with its very ambitious handling of the North-South divide and the divisions within the North between rich and poor: the European Union made a number of commitments in this regard, none of which has to date been upheld. I therefore believe we must look into the tools which are available to us and not be content to use the tools which have already existed for many years. I am thinking, for example, of our relationship with the WTO. It goes without saying that the regulations of the World Trade Organisation are, to a great extent, incompatible with the objective of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention a second and final point: you wish to reconcile the European citizen with the European institutions. Very well. You also speak of transparency. Certainly, it is an effective tool, but it must not be limited to routine mechanisms and usual administrative procedures. There must also be transparency on the major stakes involved, particularly those which, justifiably, are of concern to citizens, as is the case right now with food safety. In this connection, I observe increasingly, hence my disquiet, that important decisions on the subject are both discussed and digested in advance in the inner sanctums of diplomats, thus escaping the control of both Members of Parliament and citizens. I am thinking in particular of a statement made a few days ago by the United States Ambassador to the European Union, in which he declared his delight that the biotechnological working party resulting from Transatlantic economic partnership had arrived at a draft agreement on procedures for the approval of new transgenic varieties.</p>
<p class="contents">You know, Mr President, that transgenic varieties are not well thought of within the European Union and that we are therefore on the verge of a probably very heated conflict between expert opinion and public opinion on the subject. I would like to see more clarity from the Commission regarding the role it intends to play with regard to Parliament and the citizenry. Are you on the side of the experts and big industry or are you on the side of the citizens and Parliament?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a newly elected Member of this Parliament, I had been rather looking forward to taking part in the democratic process which was planned before we were finally to adopt a position on the Commission. However, I was quickly disabused of any prior illusions I may have had, because the committee I served on had in fact already prepared the written questions before we held our first meeting. They had been prepared by officials and by the outgoing Parliament. We newly elected Members did not have any chance to pose written questions to the Commission. This can scarcely be called particularly democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the round of oral questions, this has been a major piece of work requiring a major effort by the Members of Parliament, the proposed Commissioners and the employees in both the Commission and Parliament. And yet it now looks as if it was not an open democratic process that decided the matter. The decisions were taken in a completely different place and against a completely different background. What was decisive was the conversation which you, Mr Prodi, had with Mr Poettering from the Group of the European People’s Party and, after you had twisted the arms of Parliament’s largest group, Mr Poettering obviously did not think he had any choice. Is it a sign of European democracy in the future, not to have any choice?</p>
<p class="contents">I will not be in a position to support this form of democracy. Certainly not when all the warnings have been taken no account of, when Commissioners are proposed whom the first Wise Men’s report has cast considerable suspicion upon and when, following the conversation I mentioned, no critical questions are asked of Mr Lamy in the course of the committee’s oral hearing. It is being said that we are getting a strong Commission, stronger than the one which is now bowing out. And Mr Prodi talked about our having an open, modern and efficient administration. There are a lot of positive things to say about this. But the introductory round of questioning does not augur well for how the Commission is to use the power it has. Twisting the arms of the European Parliament’s politicians, steamrollering through ideas such as common defence, common taxation and a common policy on social benefits (which, into the bargain, it is recommended be reduced); bulldozing policies like these through, irrespective of how the populations in Europe see things. A Commission which has the power and working methods of a bulldozer will make sensible co-operation and the development of democracy difficult, if in fact democracy is to be taken even slightly seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous speakers did not think that all this was symptomatic of what future co-operation would be like. Now, I believe that problems should be nipped in the bud. Promises were given at the Conference of Presidents. One of these was that a Commissioner who did not have the confidence of Parliament would be asked to resign. This sits ill with the requirement that the Commission be endorsed in the one go: either every single member or no-one at all.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Prodi in fact thinks himself the head of government of a European super-state, and sees no solution to problems other than promoting ever greater integration, ever greater unification, ever greater limitation of national authority.</p>
<p class="contents">During last week’s hearings, the Commissioners-designate competed to show their zeal on the subject in order to demonstrate their Federalist ambitions to their questioners. Mr Barnier tried to outdo them by proposing heading towards a “European sovereignty,” I quote “replacing national sovereignties.” Let me say, in passing, that these hearings, in this form, which incite the candidate Commissioners to undertake commitments which are not approved by their peoples, seem to me to introduce a certain distortion in fidelity to the procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi furthermore described his extreme vision of the bonus of competition according to which public service would be acceptable only if did not present an obstacle to the market. The presidential candidate champions the continued liberalisation of international trade according to the reductionist route taken by the Uruguay Round. This assessment was somewhat tempered subsequently by Pascal Lamy, but it was still not very clear what means he would use in order to control globalisation without demanding radical change in the rules of the game, particularly by means of the introduction of the idea of social or environmental cost into international negotiations. Finally, Mr Prodi was insistent that the Commission, in his words, should establish itself as the main driving force behind an accelerated campaign for a review of the Treaties in many areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, this idea leads in a direct line to a future expanded Intergovernmental Conference, where the nations would be deprived of their prerogatives and would no longer have any control. The initiative has already been given by Mr Prodi who himself appointed a Committee of Wise Men to produce a preliminary report on behalf of the Commission even though the Council of Cologne had expressly rejected this idea of the Committee of Wise Men. Indeed, although we never quite know how these Wise Men are selected, we do, however, know in advance that their conclusions are going to be in favour of going ever further in the direction of a super-state.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell you today, Mr Prodi, that you will not fight against fraud, as you would like, or re-establish democracy in Europe by constructing a super-state which would be artificial and which, by its very nature, would entail a Commission and a European civil service which are cut off from the people. What is necessary, on the other hand, is to make them more open and to re-establish their links with the nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, you spoke of glasnost in order to describe your future policy. This word, which was applied to Soviet institutions, seems to me particularly well chosen to apply to the Commission today. I hope that, like the other glasnost, your version will create a shock wave in these anti-democratic institutions likely to lead to reforms which you cannot today anticipate.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You said, President Prodi, that we must get past the crisis of last year and that we should turn the page. Yet you have not, in our opinion, learnt the lessons of the crisis. For, in spite of the recommendations of the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts backed up by the second report which has just been published, no serious action has been undertaken to modify the methods and modes of operation of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the new Commission includes four Commissioners who were part of the former, recently disowned team. Although they were not individually implicated, they did give their support to the incompetence of the entire Santer Commission and its lack of collective responsibility. In addition, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities deplores the fact that the essential reform of the Commission has been entrusted to a member of the former team. At the time of the hearings of the future Commissioners, the EDD Group, of course, noted the quality of the majority of these Commissioners while criticising some centralist tendencies.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to see a change in culture and democratisation of the existing system, as well as greater consideration for Parliament. At present, for instance, it is not possible to request the resignation or non-renewal of one individual Commissioner without implicating the Commission as a whole or without causing an overt crisis. The cultural revolution which you announced, Mr President, is not in sight. Bad practice is allowed without sanction, dysfunction in the system is allowed to continue. The work of Parliament is, furthermore, flouted by dubious practices. The second report of the Committee of Independent Experts discussed in the plenary part-session on Monday has still not been delivered, or has only just been delivered, to the majority of Members of Parliament, thus preventing us making a serious study of it.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, the six CPNT Members, and the whole of the EDD Group, will be voting against the appointment of the Prodi Commission in order to denounce a system which is deeply undemocratic.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A new beginning of this kind is in fact necessary. Mistrust on the part of Parliament arose as soon as documents concerning cases of fraud landed on the desks of newspaper editors but not on those of the Committee. It was unacceptable for amendments proposed by this Chamber simply to be ignored by the Commission and for any officials who referred to mismanagement also still to be punished for this. All this, in fact, makes a new beginning necessary. However, I still have some reservations even after the long preparatory phase this new Commission has been through.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to quote three reasons for this. Firstly, political responsibility must also be accepted by each individual. Each Member of the Commission is responsible and answerable for his department. Not all candidates see it like this. Secondly, there are still doubts about the Commissioner-designate responsible for research. I expect you, Mr Prodi, to produce a further statement of your position regarding this matter. Thirdly, because the former Commissioners are again standing as candidates, there is still in the end the question of the terms in which they understand their political responsibility as part of a collegiate body. </p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s citizens are entitled to expect transparency and proper supervision and a policy which accepts, undivided, that responsibility which has been transferred to it. We have our justified doubts as to whether this has in fact been guaranteed for the future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In an overall judgement, we have to decide whether or not, tomorrow, we can affirm our confidence in this Commission. In so doing, Parliament accepts responsibility for the Commission, as well as for individual proposals, and that does not make our decision any the easier. I should like first of all to say to you, Professor Prodi, that as President of the Commission you can count upon the broad assent of the CDU/CSU Members of Parliament. The fact that we have formed different judgements about individual members of the collegiate body is no surprise. A number of people have used the opportunity of the hearings brilliantly, for example Chris Patten and also Mr Vitorino. However, you have on board a candidate who has been implicated in a matter regarding a donation in his home country and about whom we must, since yesterday, ask whether he has made an appropriate statement in the hearings before this Parliament. This particular candidate could become a burden on the Commission. I allow myself to issue this warning because the restoration of trust which you yourself, Professor Prodi, have quite rightly demanded naturally depends too upon your heading a Commission which can go to work unimpeded by reproaches of this kind. It is precisely this which must distinguish it from its predecessor. </p>
<p class="contents">There has been talk of the political balance of the Commission. It is not a condition of any treaty that there should be balance of this kind but a sign of political wisdom and, in fact, of consideration for this Parliament. Our critical comment on this subject still stands, although we do not want to emphasise it again right now. We therefore have high expectations, Professor Prodi, in connection with our comprehensive affirmation of yourself and of your task as President of the Commission. You are the first Commission President to whom the Treaty grants the ability to reach agreements, and not only with the Commission as a whole but also with each individual candidate. We can only encourage you to make energetic use of this role. No government of any Member State should, in future, be able to disregard the President of the Commission. In this connection, we demand that the budget and the supervision of the budget be very clearly separated. We shall judge the Commission on the basis of whether you succeed, when legislating, in being more true to the spirit of subsidiarity than Commissions in the past have been. A new culture of subsidiarity must enter the Commission over which you preside.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">After listening to the speeches that the President-designate has made to Parliament, after voting for his appointment in May, and after taking part in the hearings with the 19 Commissioners-designate with a professional and open-minded approach, our group believes that the long crisis involving the Commission must end with a clear and strong appointment: you, Mr President, and your proposed Commission, in accordance with the powers that the Treaty confers on you. We have no hesitation in endorsing you so that the Union can once more have a strong executive, where there are new people, new programme perspectives and a new way of handling important internal and international policies which call for efficient, transparent and democratic institutions that respect each other’s autonomy yet co-operate effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this framework will bring about a return to the strategic partnership between Parliament and the Commission, albeit respecting their different functions. I say this because, as well as the political balances within the various institutions, the Council’s role is to represent the national governments, and the federal and Community leaning of the Commission and Parliament means that they are the driving force behind integration.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the subject which recent events threatened to overshadow and that we must now discuss. It goes without saying that we must fight abuse of power, dishonesty and inefficiency in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The second report of the Committee of Independent Experts highlights the areas we need to deal with, many of which were already among Parliament’s suggestions and which you yourself have already given clear undertakings on. For example, the new criteria for the establishment of private offices and more transparency in relations with the European Parliament and public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to mention that I am particularly concerned about something in the report, although I do not intend to dwell on it longer than necessary. Nonetheless, it is almost as dangerous as corruption. I refer to pursuing national interests to the detriment of common interests, and that goes for the Commission, and also Parliament, although in a different way. In fact, if Parliament becomes the forum where national political conflicts are replayed, how can we credibly rebuild an open, objective, robust and sometimes severe relationship with the Commission? How can we restore credibility to European politics? We are faced with economic and social challenges in the wake of the single currency and must carry out a far-reaching reform of the institutions. We need to specify the rights of European citizens. Looking beyond our borders, we must tackle the strategic vacuum that has been around for at least ten years and that has been exposed by the dramatic Balkans crisis. We must continue with a policy on the Mediterranean which is supported by the revitalised peace process. Then there is the dramatic crisis in Russia, and matters concerning human rights and the rights of the world’s minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, if the European citizens do not receive convincing replies at a supranational level, it will be difficult to curb their feelings of detachment and alienation from the institutions, which will seem distant, incomprehensible and also costly. This is why, Mr Prodi, I wish you and your Commission every success in your work.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, as has been said before by many speakers, we must understand the way in which the interinstitutional crisis of the last few months has altered in some fundamental way the relationship between our two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fair to say that in the past there was a traditional view that the European Parliament and the European Commission should operate in an almost permanent state of collusion to take on the vested interests of Member States and so promote European integration. This is now an outdated view which has been bypassed by recent events.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on we should perhaps both accept and welcome a permanent creative tension between our two institutions – that, after all, is the heart of a mature parliamentary democracy. This requires changes not only in the European Commission with which we are all familiar, but also changes in the European Parliament itself. Indeed, I hope that Parliament will take this opportunity to reform our own outdated procedures and practices including the financial provisions for MEPs.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless we, as parliamentarians, examine ourselves with the same forensic attention with which we examine other institutions we will find it difficult to reverse the shocking voter apathy which was seen in so many parts of Europe in the elections in June. Indeed, it is not an exaggeration to say that voter indifference remains the greatest long-term threat to the European Union as a whole and perhaps to this Parliament in particular. Thus our overwhelming priority should be to re-engage the disenchanted voter: a reformed European Commission, a reformed European Parliament, interacting in a robust but mature manner, is the only way in which we have any real hope of doing so.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are a Europe in the making. We want to be a strong Parliament and that is why we also want a strong Commission. The hearings have shown that some of your Commissioners are strong and others are weaker. Parliament does not have as much confidence in their readiness to reform things and does not have as much faith in the way in which they will treat Parliament. But all in all, our wish for you is that you will be the strong Commission we need, although it is possible that not all members of our group will vote for you. You were right to regard the word “responsibility” as a key word, not just in the Wise Men’s first report, but also in terms of solving future problems – collective responsibility, but also the individual responsibility held by the members of your Commission, and to my mind, the responsibility held by your officials. I am thinking of the fate of Mr Van Buitenen here, and of the fact that his case should be brought to a conclusion in an honourable manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, our institutions are not equal to the challenges you have outlined as regards the enlargement of Europe for we must bring about the enlargement of Europe and make it more democratic at the same time, which is difficult. You spoke of reorganising subsidiarity and that is a statement that finds favour with us as it holds promise for the future. The parliaments of the Member States, as well as our own, must become involved. But we want to go further. We want you to consider that if the right of nations to self-determination is to be taken seriously, then that will also mean the constitutional parliaments of federal states, regions and of cultural communities being taken seriously and being given a place in the subsidiarity-based Europe of the future, for the right of nations to self-determination is a sacred principle for all the nations of the world and that does not always mean for the states alone, for those concepts do not always coincide. </p>
<p class="contents">I also want to remind you that we inhabit a world that has become very small. I found your speech to be rather heavily eurocentric. For when we look down our own streets we find that the poor of Africa are there as well. To a large extent, the world is one of poverty and AIDS, and one in which the Europe that you outlined as being an island of prosperity and peace is, as we know from experience, one which remains a distant dream for many people. Indeed, we have not yet been able to realise this distant dream within our own Europe. I have in mind the peace processes that are dragging on in Northern Ireland and the Basque country.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you can inspire confidence but at the end of the day, you have to earn it too. I hope that this Commission will achieve this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have listened carefully and with an open mind to the President’s repeated statements and the Commission hearings, and this has allowed us to welcome the commitment which springs from a new relationship between the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the collapse of the previous Commission, a significant change is being proposed, which includes the undertaking to produce an Annual Report on the State of the Union. This is a change that we welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, on the subject of the programme, our dissent could not be clearer. Indeed, the Commission appears to be continuing along the same path as the previous Commission. We disapproved before, and disapprove even more today, because to continue along that path now, in the light of two important new events – first, the terrible war in the Balkans, whose effects are still being felt, and second, the creation of the euro, something which has the potential for development. We would then need a new political plan to deal with the economic and social issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy in East Timor testifies to the falsity of the thinking behind the war in the Balkans. The UN Charter was torn up and international aid and the supremacy of the United States was the only reason behind the war. America’s geopolitical vision worried even its old friends like Helmut Schmidt.</p>
<p class="contents">You are proposing an ambiguous response on the UN, which is dominated by the United States from a military point of view, and you are totally uncritical with regard to the process of globalisation of the world economy which greatly reduces Europe’s autonomy. Basically, there are no original ideas for a new social and political European model, so it might end up simply as a watered-down copy of the North American model.</p>
<p class="contents">I am struck by the Commission’s lack of useful and original discussions on culture, mass communication and artistic and cultural production, with regard to which Europe is showing a distrust and a stubborn resistance to the influence of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is mainly your proposals on economic and social matters that do not convince us. The Stability Pact has been confirmed, and you propose a neoliberal approach to the World Trade Organisation’s important meeting. This is basically another monetarist orthodoxy which goes against any proposed attempts to leave it behind, such as the proposals made by the French Government or by a Minister such as Lafontaine.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen the creation of the euro and, as the President says, we are in an economic upturn, although mass unemployment undermines this orthodox policy. You propose maintaining this policy so that in reality, you can pursue the goal of increased productivity by means of increased flexibility in work. However, this will lead to an increase not a reduction in the social crisis. Mr President, I fear that this will accentuate Europe’s political crisis and widen the gap between the European citizens and these institutions.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It marks the end of a turbulent time in the life of the Union, from an institutional point of view, a time which Parliament has used to express all its capabilities and resolutely reaffirm its democratic vocation.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a strong, responsible Commission, able to propose suitable choices and ensure that the aspirations of the European citizens will be honoured, which will work alongside a Council that expresses the will of the national governments, and a Parliament which represents the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will be strong if it can carry out its work in harmony with Parliament, which would like more involvement in drawing up legislative proposals and an enduring institutional relationship with the Commission. This continuous transparent relationship with Parliament will prevent the Commission from acting as the Council’s secretariat and from harming Parliament and its democratic function. </p>
<p class="contents">Making proposals is not the same as implementing them, but means drawing up initiatives based on the guidelines discussed with Parliament. The statement by President-designate Prodi seems to express this intention. We invite him to pursue this avenue, thereby taking the path to reducing bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The events that led the previous Commission to step down must never happen again. Internal reforms and reorganisation must be carried out according to the rules of transparency. The principle of collegiate responsibility has been reconfirmed, but it is up to the President to exert control over individual responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade talks will soon begin within the framework of the Millennium Round, and we ask the Commission to take a firm and determined stance so that within the World Trade Organisation, it can defend the supreme importance of social rights, safeguard the environment and protect the European agricultural model and the consumer with regard to world trade. It must also find the courage to propose again a triangular nature for aid for developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Preserving and spreading the culture of the European peoples is a main common priority. If the Commission performs this task with conviction, it will have Parliament’s support. One of the more delicate and immediate tasks is to regain people’s confidence, as you, Mr President, said in your report, to bridge the gap made apparent by the poor turnout at the elections. It is not only a political problem, but also a social one, with the citizens’ increasing feeling of alienation from politics, and this is something we find in all our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A structure as complex as the European Union cannot do without a stable relationship with its inhabitants, those on the receiving end of all its decisions and policies, but the unification process cannot proceed without the conscious support of citizens, without combating unemployment and creating new economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Without deepening the Union, which is the basis for a new institutional order to give Europe a role on the world stage, we will neither be effective promoters of peace and justice nor capable of reconciling the needs, sometimes opposing needs, of North-East Europe with South-West Europe. So we must have new and thorough discussions on the enlargement process in our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Good luck, Mr President, to you, the Commission and Parliament! And good luck with the Europe which we must finally build!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have major objections to the political vision being broadcast by this nominated Commission. Mr Prodi’s first policy priority is not enlargement of the European Union with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe but political integration of the current Union. We fundamentally disagree with this. We want to see the old ideological gulf between Eastern and Western Europe eliminated as soon as possible. You also take it for granted that opting for political integration will have a centralising effect, which will work against the decentralisation of policy that we need. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are very disappointed in President Prodi’s attitude as regards the Van Buitenen affair. At least 6,000 Dutch voters have shown their support by signing a petition for this whistle-blower’s reputation to be restored, which we initiated and which has the support of all the Dutch delegations. So far, Mr Prodi, you have shown no sign of making out a case for rehabilitation. You are even reluctant to find the time to take receipt of the signatures That is a very negative signal to send out to citizens and officials because the idea will take root that your intentions as regards the fight against fraud and nepotism are nothing more than paper tigers.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, there are individuals amongst the candidates who have against them the appearance of having been involved in some way in fraudulent practices. Certainly after the goings-on of this Spring, the Council should have the sense not to nominate candidates whose incorruptibility and integrity are debatable. It is incomprehensible that Mr Prodi should have protected these candidates with strong and assertive words, even before Parliament heard the candidates and made its findings known.</p>

The first thing your gifted Commission will have to deal with will be the major Seattle Conference. You are, together with Mr Lamy, the negotiator for the Fifteen. But are you going to work in transparency, or are you going to work as you did at Blair House in 1992, where we had to wait a year, until October 1993, before receiving the Blair House text? In other words, are you taking the democracy of Athens or the oligarchy of Venice as your model? And this is the real question of the Intergovernmental Conference. The problem is not the vote by qualified majority or the reduction in the number of Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is how to work with realism, with compromise, perhaps even with such a compromise as there was in Luxembourg in 1965. After all, the World Trade Organisation has over 137 members and operates by consensus. We can therefore expand to twenty members while still respecting the identity of each one. In other words, expansion is not an institutional problem. It is perhaps a fiscal problem, to know who will pay: will there be a tax on revenue? It is perhaps a geographical problem: how far should we expand? You mentioned Ukraine. In the South, should we extend as far as Turkey? And then, at a certain point, we will be faced with an issue of civilisation, not between the civilisation of Maimonides, Averros or Saint Augustine, but between that of the Islamists, who carry out bombing in Moscow or massacres in East Timor, and the sophisticated civilisation which you represent.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, Mr Prodi, when one seeks to create a synthesis of East and West, the result is Byzantium, and you know how that ended. That is why we shall be voting against the Byzantine route, while admiring the “emperor” you could have been.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Conservatives are opposed to the return of any of the former Commission and we have been denied votes on individual Commissioners. Secondly, the left-wing composition of the proposed Commission is wholly contrary to the views of Europe’s voters as shown in June. Thirdly, important questions on probity have still not been answered in respect of some of the Commissioners-designate. Fourthly, we are concerned that some are simply not up to the job.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past two weeks Conservative MEPs, as others, have cross-examined the nominated European Commissioners. Our criteria were competence, policy and background. Right from the outset we demanded an open vote in every parliamentary committee in order to allow MEPs to register their opinion on individual EU Commissioners. Time and again this request was blocked. Finding ourselves unable to hold individual Commissioners to account, Conservative MEPs are left with no choice but to oppose, on the grounds of democratic principle, the incoming team of European Commissioners. We insist on responsibility and accountability. Even Professor Prodi declined to face an open hearing.</p>
<p class="contents">In most of our countries, perhaps all, a minister who misleads parliament or who fails to take action to deal with grave mismanagement would step down. In the Wise Men’s report into the last Commission, it was noted that it is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility. It is even less reassuring to note that during their time as commissioners not once were the EU accounts effectively signed off. It is hardly an advertisement for responsible financial governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The outgoing Commission stood on collegiate responsibility. Four governments reappointed their Commissioners. For these reasons, Conservative MEPs oppose the four returnees. This is not personal. It is not political. It is a point of principle. The only way to deliver on this is to vote against the Commission as a whole. We want the European Parliament to be given the power to dismiss individual Commissioners for maladministration or fraud. By failing to allow votes on individual Commissioners, MEPs have been denied an important democratic right.</p>
<p class="contents">We want a European Union that is efficient and accountable and where Europe’s institutions are kept under close scrutiny. We are not anti-European Commission. We are against fraud and corruption, mismanagement and inefficiency. We want a Commission which works, which really does less better. Wednesday’s vote is an important opportunity to signal to the new Commission that business as usual cannot be the guiding principle in Brussels.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Prodi in his address to this Parliament some time ago gave a strong commitment to combating fraud and the misuse of public money. That is why during Mrs De Palacio’s hearing I and my colleagues insisted on questioning her very closely on the flax subsidy scandal in which her department was involved in Spain. The response of Mrs De Palacio was not to our satisfaction and indeed her contention that the Spanish Parliament had cleared her of any responsibility and that the issue is now closed is clearly not true.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I appreciate that the OLAF and Spanish investigation is ongoing and that Mrs De Palacio may be totally exonerated of any involvement, the fact remains that she was a little economical with the truth when answering my questions on 30 August.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mrs De Palacio’s outburst at the press conference following the hearing does not bode well for someone whose remit includes relationships with the European Parliament and, whilst I accept that Mrs De Palacio did apologise later for her remarks, it nevertheless raises another doubt about her ability to carry out this specific role in the new Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, Mr President, even though Mrs De Palacio answered our questions on transport to our satisfaction, and as a group we will no doubt endorse the Commission tomorrow, we must enter a reservation on the candidature of Mrs De Palacio pending the findings of the OLAF and the Spanish authorities’ investigations and because of the way she responded to questioning on this issue at her hearing.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have spoken of a new order as a co-operation between cultures. You have even spoken of religions. I believe that, so that it may be politically effective, this desire demands the recognition of the plural reality of Europe and plural reality of many States. The United Kingdom, Belgium, Spain, Italy and many States which will join the Union in the future are plural realities. For their political recognition to be effective we have to promote it and we believe that the appropriate body for this purpose is the Committee on the Regions, the institution which will lead this process within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, a group of MEPs will begin work on the creation of an Intergroup to work in this area, with the intention of creating a spirit of co-operation with the Commission and the institutions of the Union so that collective rights and their recognition should become an extension of the recognition of individual rights. This process of recognition will be based on dialogue, negotiation and political agreement, so that the supreme values of co-existence and peace should be paramount.</p>
<p class="contents">If this new culture is recognised as having value, it will be to the good of the European Union. There is no doubt that if over the past decade, our position on the former Yugoslavia had shown more sensitivity to the different realities of peoples, instead of becoming obsessed with the idea of the State, things would have been different and, no doubt, less disastrous.</p>

However, I shall be taking some aspirin beforehand, and I shall probably need a double dose after the end of the hearings and in view of the results of these. We had been told that the sun shone out of this Commission. In fact, the Commission did come through the test, but hardly shone. A number of Commissioners are suspected of having mislead Parliament, and there is the risk of the past catching up with a number of them. A number of Commissioners were hardly filled with ambition, ability and the desire to continue working in the Commission, and the fact that this applies to candidates who are to be concerned with relations between the Commission and Parliament and with preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference is something I find very regrettable indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, I believe you have a bigger job in front of you than your Commission is aware. I am voting for you with the sober insight that work has to begin and I am voting for you in the light of your very trustworthy promise to enter into an alliance with this European Parliament. I am voting for you not because of the visions which, for the most part, you still owe us and for the ways leading to the fulfilment of these. I believe that it is either in this Chamber or nowhere at all that the vision of European integration will arise. However, we need the alliance you propose for the vision of a European democracy. We need it for the vision of a peaceful order in Europe, and we need it for the vision of Europe as a single social and ecological area.</p>
<p class="contents">However, more is needed in order to achieve these things than you have so far set out. For a European democracy, a constitutional process is needed; for a peaceful order in Europe, courage is needed to accept responsibility for our own security; and for the vision of Europe as a single social and ecological area it will be necessary for politics to be emancipated from an ever more aggressive neo-liberal ideology. This may be a punishable offence for a parliamentarian of 20 years’ standing, but I am voting for you out of hope and not yet out of conviction.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, in our view, the most important thing is not the individual personalities and abilities of the Commissioners, nor the changes in administration. Our judgement and evaluation of the new Commission is based on the policies it is called upon to implement. We must admit that the Commissioners under scrutiny, both as individuals and as a whole, have all the skills and determination, as was evident not only in the hearings but also in Mr Prodi’s statements today, to meet both faithfully and unswervingly the objectives of the European Union at the cost of the interests of the working people and of the European people more generally.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, it is certain that the new Commission will not just continue the disastrous work of the outgoing Commission, but will reinforce it. Today, Mr Prodi again presented his credentials to the forum affirming not only that both he and his team are ready to serve it but also that they can, with their alluring words, deliberately mislead the citizens. However, the people of Europe must not succumb to this seduction. It is simply the old hiding under the cloak of the new. They can, however, rest assured that even with the new Commission, today’s bleak situation will still persist as it is precisely that Commission which is the brainchild behind NATO and European Union policy. We will see fresh tensions and wars like the ones witnessed in the Balkans; a continuance of the double standards policy as regards respect for human rights and independence; we will also witness increased levels of unemployment, greater privatisation, the liquidation of all small and medium-sized agricultural and industrial enterprises, the gradual petering out of social rights, and the curtailment of democratic freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, against this dangerous backdrop not only are we refusing to remain blasé, not only are we rejecting and voting against the new Commission, but we are also calling on all working people and the people of Europe, to step up their fight, to thwart those plans which are disastrous for their future and to revolt against the current situation, for the sake of another Europe, a Europe of the People, of peace and solidarity, of mutual and beneficial co-operation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Prodi and a number of the Commissioners-designate have put forward strongly federalist plans which the majority of people in my country are opponents of, and which, I have noted, a growing number of people in other Member States are also opposing. The aversion to a federalist Europe is, of course, due to the fact that EU countries are generally much better at solving their own problems in accordance with their people’s wishes than an overpaid officialdom out to lord it over the continent. This attitude has been reinforced by the maladministration, deceit and lack of accountability which led to the downfall of the previous Commission. We all know that it will, at best, be a very big task to bring the Commission’s ponderous and high-handed bureaucracy up to the standard we require of public administration in our home countries. It has therefore been a source of shock to see that the new Commission contains a number of members who, in one area of responsibility or another, have such a share in the mistakes of the past that they definitely ought not to be sitting on the Commission. It has been disgraceful to hear a number of Commissioners dismissing the need for quite elementary changes which in fact are a prior condition of stamping out the scandalous states of affairs which characterised the previous Commission and a number of earlier Commissions, and which have turned the EU’s administration into a caricature of an accountable democratic administration. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kinnock’s hearing showed, then, that there is no will in the Commission to use its powers to instruct, and assume full responsibility for, the directors-general and their employees. If the Commission does not take full responsibility and exercise complete authority in connection with the whole administration, then any talk about proper administration is just empty words, and I am certain that Mr Kinnock, like most of us, is used to better things at home. I must say, therefore, that I regard it as my duty to my electors and to my conscience to vote against endorsing this Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What can one say in 90 seconds or even in 90 minutes, Mr Prodi, that would justify to the people of Europe your appointment and that of your Commissioners? The answer is “nothing” because there is nothing that can justify your agenda to control the political life of the nations of Europe by stealth, aided and abetted by the Heads of Government of Member States, not least the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom Independence Party supports the EDD and rejects the dangerous and unworkable scheme to create a new nation called Europe. We campaign for a Europe that once again respects the political, economic and cultural diversities of all the individual nations and their right to democratic self government. That is why the UK Independence Party campaigns for the withdrawal of our country from membership of the European Union by repealing the European Communities Act so misguidedly signed by Prime Minister Heath in 1972. Already almost 50% of the British electorate are in favour of withdrawal. Our campaign has placed this question firmly on our nation’s political agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the three nations allowed a vote on the Maastricht Treaty seven years ago only Ireland, with a population of 3.6 million, showed any enthusiasm. What about the other twelve Member States? So much for European democracy. The appointment of Mr Kinnock and Mr Patten clearly underlines the impression that appointment to the Commission is in effect a consolation prize to compensate for political rejection in one’s own country. Clearly this is yet another reason why a large section of the British electorate reject membership of the EU and backed our campaign for withdrawal.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow we shall vote against the appointment of your Commission.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sadly enough, I believe that the answer to that question has to be no, notwithstanding the respect it is possible to feel for the competence of some Commissioners-designate as individuals. After all, the Belgian Government has, in appointing Mr Busquin, chosen a Commissioner-designate who was the President of that den of thieves, the Walloon Socialist Party, a party truly epitomising bribery scandals, financing by arms dealers, fraud, political appointments, squandering of the authorities’ money and European subsidies. Mr Busquin himself enjoys massive protection, which is reported quite openly in my country’s press, but he was certainly personally responsible, and he has recognised and admitted this himself, for submitting party accounts which he knew had been falsified and which led to the party being financed by unlawful means. What is more, he refuses to speak Dutch, the language spoken by the majority of people in his country, and has made this a kind of trademark of his.</p>
<p class="contents">Esteemed President, in my country, Flanders, people roar with laughter whenever this question of trust is raised in relation to a Commission containing such politically suspect individuals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We do indeed need the WTO in order to organise the opening of markets and not to suffer from them. This is particularly true for agriculture. Everyone knows that our form of agriculture, our rural environment, is not comparable to that in Australia, Argentina and the USA. Confronted with this, Europe therefore has a duty to defend its own model of agriculture and has the right to an appropriate common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect specifically that multinational agreements integrate the concerns of our farmers and of our consumers. We expect the forthcoming negotiations to expressly take into account the fact that, in Europe, we have structures of production, and environmental and social conditions, which entail costs which must be compensated by public subsidy. I also wish to point out that competitiveness in agriculture is measured not only on the world market but also in terms of balance of the land, maintenance of the fabric of rural life and conservation of our natural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the concept of multifunctionality in agriculture must also be recognised in the WTO. That is why, Commissioner, we intend to continue the debate on all these matters with the Commissioners concerned and we intend to monitor developments in negotiations very closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You will not be having any honeymoon period because we are all waiting impatiently for you to begin work on the task in hand and for us, together, to begin working for Europe. So I do not think you’re going to be getting any honeymoon period, as new colleagues and new bodies usually do.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, I take a positive view of your programme and of what you have put forward already and today. There are, however, three things I should like to ask you to consider.</p>
<p class="contents">I perceive that there is something of the “emperor’s new clothes” about the Codes of Conduct you have adopted for the new Commission. The question I am asking is what distinguishes them from the rules which applied to the old Commission. This is not robust legislation we have here. The rules do not take account of citizens or of citizens’ rights. Where are the hard and fast rules and the citizen’s perspective upon things?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Prodi used the word glasnost<span class="italic"> </span>today. Coming from Finland, I am familiar with a number of Russian jokes. There’s a Russian joke about a number of Presidents and Soviet leaders travelling by train, and the punchline includes the very words glasnost<span class="italic"> </span>and Gorbachev. One sign of glasnost<span class="italic"> </span>is that nothing happens. There is openness but nothing else. I do not think we shall be talking in the future about any spirit of glasnost<span class="italic"> </span>in Europe because it is synonymous with nothing happening. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would draw your attention to the fact that you must look again at your staff of advisers. If you have the same staff of advisers in the new Commission as in the old, there is in fact a risk of precisely the same errors being committed as, for example, by the previous Commission in its relations with Parliament. You should have a shake-up of the advisers who are closest to your colleagues in the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say a few words to Mr Swoboda. I agreed entirely with him when he said that we must be careful about how we judge the individual Commissioners in future. We did not get it right with the previous Commission. In fact, it was in particular the Commissioners-designate from smaller countries who were questioned the hardest. This is not an honourable way of looking into just how responsible individual Commissioners-designate are.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Regarding the subject of growth which you dealt with in your introductory presentation, our commitments to the people who elected us are those of sustainable and less inegalitarian growth, going in the opposite direction to the structural tendencies which we observe today. In this respect, new European policies are indispensable and in the course of their hearings the Commissioners were given the opportunity to indicate their priorities in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding fiscal policy specifically, we were particularly disappointed by the lack of conviction expressed by the Commissioner questioned on the subject of developing the co-ordination of fiscal regimes and the need to move towards qualified majority rule at the forthcoming IGC.</p>

<p class="contents">The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, was designed to serve the interests of the main European financial and industrial groups in international competition. Resulting from undercover bargains between governments, its role is to contribute towards creating the most favourable conditions for the multinationals in their constant efforts to increase their profits on the back of their own employees, the most recent example being that of Michelin, and, more than this, to the detriment of the majority of the population of the European Union and the peoples of poor countries. Its method of appointment, its operation and its composition reflect this basic reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The essential interests of the working classes are not taken into consideration. In order to justify catastrophic unemployment and layoffs, the European Union takes refuge behind national governments. As for the harmonisation measures which it is responsible for, they do not improve the situation even in countries where the legislation is most unfavourable for the working classes and underprivileged sectors of the population or those discriminated against, women and immigrants in particular, as harmonisation, when it is implemented, is to the lowest common denominator.

This positive opinion is not, however, either a rubber cheque, or a blank cheque.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a worthless rubber cheque, Mr President, as we are aware of the developments in relation to the previous Commission. Mr Prodi has undertaken, at the request of groups, our own in particular, some very clear commitments as regards the transparency of the actions of the Commission, consultation with Parliament, and the responsibility of Members of the Commission towards this House. On the major issues coming up – negotiations on the World Trade Organisation, the Intergovernmental Conference, debates on the case of the Mediterranean – the President of the Commission also indicated his wish to include all the Members of this Parliament as parties involved, as decision makers. This is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">But still we cannot give you a blank cheque. Firstly, because, even though the hearings of the Commissioners went well on the whole, they did not give rise to unanimous enthusiasm. In July already, without implicating the individuals, we denounced the political imbalance of this Commission which hardly corresponds to the distribution of power within this Chamber. In September, some of the Commissioners did not necessarily seem to us to be up to the ambitious plans which you defined yourself.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, Mr President, you stated that you wanted an integrated and efficient administration, competent Commissioners above all suspicion, a political programme for the next five years, in full collaboration with Parliament. How could we possibly not approve?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the great challenges which await us – expansion, deepening of a European reality while respecting national identities by the new approach of subsidiarity, the safekeeping of our agricultural systems, the construction of a more humane Europe in the field of employment, a more generous Europe – are such that we must accept them together. But while we can not give you a rubber cheque or a blank cheque, we can announce our wish to work together in order to give all the peoples of Europe, in spite of difficulties and conflicts, good reasons to believe in their own destiny and to have faith in their shared future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reform of the common fisheries policy, envisaged for 2002, will be a great challenge and a great test which this new Commission will have to face since the fishing industry expects this reform to turn the fishing policy into a genuine common European policy and the Commission to endow it with the necessary additional Community status.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fishing industry, employment should also be our political priority, Mr Prodi. The Commission which you preside over must commit itself to maintaining employment in the fishing industry, both in the Community fleet and in the processing industry. The fishing policy, Mr Prodi, is also an effective tool with regard to the organisation of European territory and the correction of the disparities which still exist in Europe today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the peripheral regions with a degree of development which is lower, much lower, than the Community average which suffer most from unemployment and which have the least effective infrastructures. These are the regions, Mr Prodi, which depend most on the fishing industry.</p>

Our view is that a great deal of the disrepute of the European Union is related to its inability to fight effectively against the ravages of all-pervading neo-liberalism. The Members here present who have all conducted campaigns in which the debate focussed on the urgency of the social situation and the fight for greater employment, have been elected to ensure real progress towards a Europe of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The work programme which you presented today, as you have reported it to us and as it has been implemented for several years now, does not live up to expectations. The Greens are proposing a number of measures on the active, global and massive reduction of working hours, and on support for sustainable economic activities, which are creating employment, in sectors such as the construction of accommodation, public transport, renewable energy. We also think there is an urgent case for measurement and harmonisation of minimum social values on the European scale.</p>
<p class="contents">We are obviously not unaware of the fact that there is no consensus within the European Union, and within this Parliament indeed, on this work programme and programme to combat job insecurity and unemployment. However, we think it a matter of urgency, and it is a matter of responsibility, to permit public debate on these matters. That is why we are totally aggrieved at the exclusion of the European Parliament from the employment process resulting from Cologne and we formally request, Mr Prodi, that you do all that you can to ensure that Parliament can regain its proper place in this employment process.</p>

In other words, we naturally have reservations about Mr Busquin in particular. When scandal is never far behind a person, experience dictates that sooner or later it catches up on him.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I well understand that you have limited room for manoeuvre, there really has to be a change in personnel when serious criticisms like this are being made. Barón Crespo said this morning that one particular refractory minister in Bavaria would not have resigned. Well, I have news for him. The minister resigned yesterday before the vote in Parliament. I fear however that, unfortunately, it will probably be another century before the European Commission achieves the efficiency of the Bavarian state administration.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, with all due respect for yourself and the estimable ladies and gentlemen of your team, if you do not arrange for Mr Busquin in particular to be replaced, then a number of my colleagues will unfortunately feel compelled to not yet be able to affirm their confidence in this Commission. The chance to embark upon a genuinely new era in Europe must now be seized courageously and energetically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And what do these include, Mr Prodi? They incorporate areas of life which are among the most significant for human beings and which are of importance every day for us and our children. Examples include clean air and drinkable water, safe food which does not poison people, the safeguarding of their personal economic interests and the development of a basic standard of health within the European Union. In the course of the hearings before the relevant committees, Margot Wallström and David Byrne have shown brilliantly and convincingly, as well as to the satisfaction of the committees, that these priorities have been recognised and that full commitment will be given to this policy and to its fulfilment.</p>
<p class="contents">How, though, do such policy areas become political realities and priorities? That can only happen with the support of the whole Commission around the Commission table and with the support of the President of the Commission, that is to say of yourself, Mr Prodi. So, can we be hopeful? I have been asking myself that question for a number of days now and, Mr Prodi, I have been asking it whenever I hear a speech by you. That is four or five in all now. I will also tell you the answer. I am not hopeful. My impression is that, in the past, you have merely been paying lip service. And because it was too much trouble, you do not do it at all now. In your speech today, you did not say a word, not a single word, about environmental policy. You mentioned sustainable development once. This is a compulsory exercise which everyone engages in. You did not say a word, not a single word, about consumer protection and safe food. And that is after BSE and dioxin! You used the word “health” in connection with the economy and sport. You betray your ignorance here, Mr Prodi, not that of your Commission, merely your own.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Wallström and Mr Byrne have quite clearly come through their examinations before the European Parliament with flying colours. But they will probably often feel themselves to be alone around the Commission table, for you, Mr Prodi, have no idea about the interests of people inside the European Union despite the fact that you are always spouting about the “European soul”. You say you have learned lessons. So what lessons have you learned, Mr Prodi, other than that enterprise is important? You have shown in the past that you do not seriously mean what you say, and so you no longer say anything at all. I am telling you quite clearly, Mr Prodi, you have not passed the examination as far as I am concerned. So far, you have clearly failed it. So if I vote “yes” tomorrow, it is because of your esteemed colleagues, Mr Prodi, and not because of you. If, when voting, I was able to differentiate between yourself and your colleagues, you would get a clear “no” and all the others a clear “yes”. In football, a good team with a bad coach would never reach the top of the league. I only hope that the future Commission will overturn this rule.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
