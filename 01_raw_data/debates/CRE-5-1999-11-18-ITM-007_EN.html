It would therefore request the Council to support this proposal in order to smooth the way so that by restructuring and reducing expenditure this year EUR 670 million can be made available for urgently needed foreign policy programmes.</p>

A proposal for an amendment was then agreed in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, where “socially-balanced” was added. The opinions differ as to which adjectives should be added. I feel in any case that it should be "free and fair world trade”. Everyone agreed to that. The question of “is socially tolerable” or “socially acceptable” was disputed. We should therefore vote on the original text saying “free and fair world trade” and then vote separately on “socially-balanced”. Then we would have a result on the third point.</p>

They also condemn fraud or the misappropriation of public monies, the money stolen from European taxpayers. It is a matter that we know something about, we French, who have to contend daily with the repercussions of the cases involving <span class="italic">the Mutuelle nationale des étudiants de France</span>, the Paris Mayor’s office, Elf or Gifco. This list is, alas, far from complete.</p>
<p class="contents">They will, however, be voting against the Napolitano report. Because they are sick to death of the self-flagellation that this Parliament indulges in, alternating with lessons in morality and a haughtiness that is just as hard to bear. Because they think that OLAF is an excuse to recruit yet another team of officials, costing more than the cost of the fraud itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Because, above all, they consider that there already is a structure capable of taking on the role which OLAF is expected to fulfil. The solution, obviously, is to give the Court of Auditors jurisdictional power and adequate human and material resources to take on this role. This is the case of many national audit authorities, not only in France, but in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Court of Auditors does not get a good press in this House since the President refused it a press conference room, even though he happily gives one to the most eccentric associations, to individuals whose representative nature is highly dubious, or to any old watchdog in favour of the philosophy of the Single Europe on condition that he barks loud enough. In this matter, as in many others, Parliament has made itself look foolish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this in mind, OLAF should finally be able to commence its work. We are so concerned about the monitoring of the institutions by OLAF and so little can we identify with the “informing provisions” proposed in the inter-institutional agreement between the Commission, the Council and Parliament and moreover attacking the independent mandate of the individual Members of Parliament. If it says in Article 2, that "any official or servant of the European Parliament who becomes aware of evidence which gives rise to a presumption of the existence of <span class="italic">possible </span>cases of fraud,…shall…inform without delay…” then this compels them to inform.</p>
<p class="contents">The planned form of monitoring by OLAF can only be a transitional solution and our agreement will only serve to set the necessary monitoring in motion.

The names of the cases tell the whole story: Agusta in Belgium, Urba in France, Palermo in Italy, fictitious jobs in the Parisian public transport network – RPR, the <span class="italic">Mutuelle nationale des étudiants de France</span> or Dominique Strauss-Kahn.</p>
<p class="contents">But, because we in the <span class="italic">Front National</span> do not suffer the anxiety affecting the potential accused in the other parties, we are rejecting the extension of police powers to that tool of the Brussels Commission that goes by the name of OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">- Firstly, because OLAF contravenes the idea of the separation of authority, which is the bedrock of Western democracy, with officials who have no legitimacy supervising the representatives of the sovereign states.</p>
<p class="contents">- Secondly, because OLAF is the thief set to catch the policeman, since the European Commission, at the centre of the suspicions of corruption, is in fact, by means of OLAF, going to be supervising the Parliament, whereas it is Parliament which should be doing the supervising rather than being its target.</p>
<p class="contents">- Finally, OLAF does not attack the causes of corruption, which lie in the removal of national borders allowing freedom of movement for drugs money, fraud and financial crime.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really wish to fight the simple symptoms of corruption, while respecting the foundations of legitimate societies, then there are just two ways:</p>
<p class="contents">- either the technical route, by transforming the European Court of Auditors into a court of law and a court of budgetary discipline;</p>
<p class="contents">- or the democratic route, by creating a body at the heart of the European Union, as in Great Britain and the United States, which is the equivalent of the British “National Accounting Office” (NAO) or the American “General Accounting Office” (GAO).</p>
<p class="contents">The latter are powerful autonomous supervisory bodies, but are located at the heart of the parliaments, and have a staff of up to 5,000.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, we can see the European Union weakening its own position, according to the familiar process, by means of its internal discussions, even before the start of negotiations. For example, the final mandate granted by the Council on 22 October, makes no mention of defending the principle of Community preference, a principle which had however been adopted by the Agriculture Council of the 27 September, which was itself only partly satisfactory since it omitted the principle of Europe’s autonomy in terms of foodstuffs. We come down a notch at every stage. There are many more possible examples. Thus, regarding our preference system for importing bananas from overseas, the Commission has just made proposals which meet with American demands even before the opening of the Seattle Conference. In every field, one might say that the internal concessions made in order to arrive at a unified European position, declared beforehand to be desirable, are leading us to reduce our claims even before starting discussions with our competitors.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission was given a comprehensive negotiation mandate on a whole series of issues, some of which come under Community jurisdiction, but others, such as services or investment, which are clearly in the remit of national authorities. Admittedly, it is a mandate for the framing of negotiations and not for the consequences of these negotiations. Nonetheless, the Council, without explicitly saying so, has just set in train a process which may lead it, if it is not stopped, to an absolute negotiating mandate being granted to the Commission and thus, in application of the new Article 133(5) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to the ultimate power of ratification being taken away from the national parliaments, but still without clearly declaring this, obviously. We are currently drifting off our course in the fog, without knowing exactly at what point we are going to go over the edge. Then we will be told that it is too late. Such methods are perfectly reprehensible.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, despite our requests, we note that the Seattle negotiations are going to be undertaken before a clear, specific and comprehensive report has been made of the consequences of the Uruguay Round. There too we shall be advancing in the dark. The Commission did, admittedly, give in on one point, since it is going to proceed to the evaluation of the impact on sustainability, as I was saying, i.e. on the environmental consequences of liberalisation. That is all very well. But this study should have been carried out on many other points, such as the impact of liberalisation, in its current form, on the preservation of cultural and social models.</p>
<p class="contents">For these three reasons, in these circumstances, we are unable to approve the opening of the Seattle negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as we were concerned, the objective of this report was to give Commissioner Lamy a specific negotiating mandate for the Round due to open in Seattle. Well, such a specific mandate has not been adequately asserted. That being the case, we would have liked Parliament to propose a very political specification to the Commission, instead of drawing up a more diplomatic report which deplores, stresses and considers but does not give any sort of mandate. The tone of the report is still too liberal, then, for us to find any reflection of our own views, especially since none of our amendments is included in it.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, thus amended, has significant weaknesses regarding TRIPS. We can find nothing acceptable to us in it on the subject of intellectual property rights relating to trade. As regards the MAI, which was rejected by the OECD and which is coming back again, a reinforced code of conduct must be drawn up for investment and strict regulations must be drawn up in this field, and this is equally applicable to the settlement of disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">The report does, however, include some fundamental principles which we consider essential such as the precautionary principle, regulations on production methods and procedures. It stresses in particular the labelling of foodstuffs in order to ensure the implementation of food safety, and the necessity of adopting a stance that is more favourable to developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">At any event, we shall follow with great interest the way in which the Commission conducts the negotiations, and even though we still find this amended report too liberal in tone, you will find that we Greens will defend this text most fiercely if Commissioner Lamy should step below the recommendations made here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, large numbers of the poor in the developing countries have still not benefited from free world trade. We therefore share the view expressed in section B that the developing countries’ interests and problems must have priority in any extended system of free world trade. The free trade system is urgently required if we are to reduce poverty and create a more just world. We therefore consider that the overarching strategies and objectives, as described in the report, for the forthcoming round of World Trade Organisation negotiations are a step in the right direction in relation to the Commission’s communication. </p>
<p class="contents">If, however, the objectives are to become a reality, we should particularly like to emphasise section I, to the effect that agriculture must be one of the areas in the multilateral trade negotiations where new possibilities are opened up in Seattle. We think that what is prescribed in this section must become a reality in relation also to sections 5, 6 and 7. If this agreement is really to become the development agreement which helps reduce the gulf between the world’s rich and poor States, it is not acceptable to reject, in advance, demands from the other Member States in the World Trade Organisation for a change in our agricultural policy at the Millennium Round </p>
<p class="contents">To help achieve this objective of reducing the gap between rich and poor States, frontier defences must be lowered and export subsidies phased out. The overarching objective in section 37 ought therefore to be that of completely phasing out customs duties on non-agricultural products. A development like that would be of greater help to the developing countries than the marginal preferences they at present have.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Trade Organisation should support the work being done in terms of the global environment by, for example, incorporating basic principles of environmental policy, such as the precautionary principle, into its practice. It is therefore important that weight be given to section 10 in the negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In mentioning the “workers’ fundamental rights” and “protection” of these, particularly in poor countries, the Schwaiger report introduces a touch of cynicism to all the rest. But what of the protection of workers, particularly against the tragedy of unemployment, even in the richest countries of the European Union, precisely those which would easily have adequate means to eradicate unemployment if their governments were not concerned primarily by the profits of big business and by making owners and shareholders wealthy? </p>
<p class="contents">As for the claim of being interested in the working conditions and inhuman wages in underdeveloped countries, this is pure hypocrisy. Any number of multinationals who employ a workforce with a practically zero wage, without the advantage of any form of social protection, in Africa or Asia, have their headquarters in France, Germany or the United Kingdom.

<p class="contents">While, however, the Fifteen have recently adopted a joint negotiation policy in the context of the new round, which promises to be an ambitious one, it must be acknowledged that this basis which looks like the lowest common denominator shared by the Member States, will of necessity suffer a decline in the course of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, there is no doubt but that this compromise text, whose birth was so painful, will be subject to many pressures from the American side in the negotiations, even though the homogeneity of the Union is only a façade, and the Union has no legal arsenal available to it comparable with that in the hands of the United States, one that is likely, if necessary, to deter the American side.</p>
<p class="contents">While the organisation of free and fairer world trade must be encouraged and reinforced within the framework of a multilateral commercial system, it must also ensure that all nations, rich and poor, and I am thinking in particular of the countries of Africa, are guaranteed the possibility of making the most of the advantages which this round of negotiations is supposed to be bringing.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, although we must wait for the round of negotiations to be completed before passing judgement on the content as far as the results achieved are concerned, the fact remains that, as far as this context is concerned, the overall result could not be deemed completely negative if the nations of Europe were to manage to obtain stricter control of the international regulations regarding competition. The establishment of universally recognised common minimum standards intended to oppose any action to restrict competition would already represent significant progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s starting negotiating position, which is ambitious in its objectives, is bound not to emerge stronger from a round of negotiations which is in danger of dragging on and on and getting bogged down, particularly given the foreseeable attitude of the United States, which will not rest from attempting to progressively undermine the mandate which has been given to Mr Lamy and which merely constitutes a unified façade that does not successfully conceal the differences in the interests of the Fifteen. Furthermore, the content of the final resolution adopted by the European Parliament today includes many points that are not acceptable to France. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Similarly for the countries of the third world, the question is knowing whether they will still be able to escape the clutches of the mega-multinationals produced by the mega-mergers and stay in control of their own development.</p>
<p class="contents">For the problem is not knowing whether rules are necessary in world trade. Everyone is agreed on that. The question is knowing whether the rules promoted by the WTO ever since its creation permit fair and sustainable development for all the regions of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall make two observations:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the liberalisation promoted in the previous rounds and the increase in the volume of trade have been associated with an intensification of inequalities in development on a world scale. In theory, the leaps forward achieved by some should drag others along behind, but in fact the opposite has occurred. The African continent’s share in world trade is less than 3%. Liberal globalisation has proved incapable of providing a solution to the problem of development and still less of promoting fair and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reason why an assessment of the social and environmental impact of the previous rounds was essential before engaging in a new wave of all-out liberalisation. If it has been rejected so consistently, it is because the outcome would have been negative. However, for the European Union, the establishment of an analysis shared with the countries of the third world could have been the foundation for the alliance which we are seeking to build with them on the occasion of these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the DSB (Dispute Settlement Body), created within the WTO, has demanded that the European Union give up its own standards in fields as fundamental as health and food safety or even its policy of cooperation in the case of the bananas from ACP countries and the outermost regions. The question from now on is knowing if it is possible to accept a situation where, if one thing leads to another, decision after decision, ruling on everything on the pretext of settling commercial differences, the DSB may end up establishing itself as a sort of world-wide Supreme Court, imposing its views in all areas on elected governments and parliaments. We would then be witnesses to a real seizure of democratic power.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, in the Millennium Round, Europe must champion another vision of the organisation of commerce and world trade. To do so it must assert three main principles:</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that the objective of this round must be the reduction of inequalities in development between north and south. In order to achieve this, the rules of the multilateral trade system must take into account the differences between countries in situations and resources. Free trade without taking anything else into consideration means that the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker. This is why we cannot accept challenges to the Lomé Agreements and our policy of cooperation in the form in which we have constructed it in the Lomé Agreements with ACP countries, including 39 of the poorest countries in the world. On the contrary, we must reassert the commitment undertaken towards them during the recent ACP-EU Joint Assembly. Europe must go to Seattle with a vision of globalisation which is opposed to that of a unilateral world dominated by a single power. It must promote a vision based on a multipolar world and encourage the formation of regional associations integrated both economically and politically, as we have been doing ourselves for 40 years. How could we refuse others what we granted ourselves, after the war, in order to rebuild our industry, our agriculture and our economy?</p>
<p class="contents">The second principle should be that the WTO must be “confined” to a strictly defined role, and sectors which should only come under the remit of the sovereignty of states and the institutions established by citizens, because they concern the very identity of each society, should be kept out of its area of competence. Public and social services such as education or health, but also those where consumer safety and collective interests are involved, such as public transport or air traffic control, culture and artistic creation, may not be taken into account as part of trade negotiations. We must resist the onward rush towards treating everything in society as saleable commodities. In the agreements on intellectual property, Europe must resist the patenting of living organisms, it must guarantee that derogations to the general trade regulations for medicinal products used to fight AIDS and other serious diseases indicated by the WHO are maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally we must defend the principle of the hierarchy of standards. Fundamental human rights and the Universal Declaration of 1948, the conventions of the ILO (International Labour Organisation) or conventions on the environment, are in essence superior to the standards governing trade. It must not be possible to condemn a state for applying the precautionary principle, for protecting its environment, or for rejecting imports proved to be produced by child labour. On the contrary, it must be possible to take an appeal against a WTO decision to the ILO or to the competent bodies of the United Nations. We must reverse the unbalanced situation arising from the fact that having multilateral commercial agreements alone has led to the creation of a legal-style body, whereas this was not the case either for the conventions on the environment or the ILO conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of these concerns were taken into account by the rapporteur at the end of the debates within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. Unfortunately, in the course of the plenary sitting, the rapporteur and the PPE and ELDR groups introduced a number of amendments into the text which tone down the social and environmental requirements. Considering, furthermore, the unfavourable outcome reserved for the amendments proposed by myself and my fellow members of the French Socialist delegation and the GUE/NGL and Greens/ALE Groups, I abstained, Madam President, in the vote on Mr Schwaiger’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">But I believe that one of the most significant elements, on the eve of this new round, one which distinguishes it from the previous rounds, is the intrusion of society, of NGOs and international public opinion into the debate. I believe that we should be pleased at this, since it provides the best guarantee that it will not be possible to omit these issues in the course of these negotiations. For their entire duration, they will remain at the centre of the debates of the European Parliament, I am sure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I doubt that this will be the case. The doubt concerns our capacity, and our real determination, to make the WTO an instrument of regulation in order to make the transition from globalisation sought by the few and inflicted on all to truly regulated world trade which is of benefit to the whole planet.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed it is this doubt which gives rise to my concern that if we do not succeed on this point, then we shall be forced to renege on longstanding commitments to developing countries, particularly towards ACP countries, to which we have been linked for 20 years by the Lomé Conventions. At the risk of denting our clear conscience, I would at this point like to mention the example of the banana dispute, or the multinationals (Del Monte, Dole and Chiquita) which, with the support of the United States, are flooding the European market with bananas which are the product of slavery, produced, what is more, in conditions of the most dubious food safety and have managed to force us to our knees; a matter in which we are on the verge of unconditional surrender, abandoning hundreds of thousands of growers, not only in ACP countries, but also the farmers of our own Community in Guadeloupe and Martinique, to bankruptcy!</p>
<p class="contents">And recent statements by the Commission are not such as to allay this concern, saying, for example, that it is necessary to put an end to the banana conflict since it is poisoning transatlantic relations and because the Union would be sending an unfavourable message to the world as the new trade negotiations are dawning. Who could possibly be against putting an end to the conflict? No one, of course, but not at just any price, not by surrendering unconditionally. The same applies to rum, since we have signed a unilateral agreement with the United States on the import of colourless spirits, and that includes rum, which will inevitably lead in the short term to the economic destabilisation of the entire Caribbean! What will happen tomorrow, unless we are particularly vigilant, in the case of sugar, which is a crucial element in the economic balance of ACP countries such as Mauritius or a European region, such as Réunion, which I know well?</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is, I am afraid, that whatever our fine statements, often with a touch of paternalism, we are on the verge of writing off our policy with regard to the poorest countries and to ACP countries, in particular, abandoning the farmers in our own outermost regions in the process. And yet we have historic links with these countries. Let me tell you, it is not just a matter of generosity. For many of our countries, which are in fact former colonising powers, it is a very powerful moral commitment which we are honour-bound to respect!</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, even though the resolution put to the vote this morning is a text which is perfectly acceptable in terms of the general objective which we have set ourselves, particularly thanks to the many amendments proposed by the members of my group, I did not vote in favour of this text, so as to fulfil the commitments which I have undertaken with regard to the voters in the French Overseas Departments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission and Council should heed our clear intentions in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">On the extension of the WTO too include investment, I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has reiterated it strongly held position that the mistakes of the MAI must not be repeated, that investor responsibilities according to ILO and OECD guidelines must be dealt with alongside investor rights, and – by a clear majority – a European Code of Conduct for multinationals (amendment 15) be established.</p>
<p class="contents">I condemn the Conservative group in this Parliament who sought to remove development considerations from the proposed Standing Forum with the ILO, and incredibly sought to remove from our objectives, achieving "fair and socially balanced" as well as free trade. I am glad they were defeated.</p>
<p class="contents">But the fact that they were prepared to vote for protection of "strict legal requirements" met by European farmers, but against the destructive dumping of agricultural goods by us in Europe against peasant farmers in developing countries is scandalous. I call on European negotiators to respect our resolution in favour of the principle of food security and for no adverse effect for developing countries in the agricultural negotiations.</p>

<p class="contents">Some issues are particularly important – and they become particularly serious – because the guidelines which it is being sought to impose on them are obvious, such as liberalisation and the total control of world trade, the systematic privatisation of the public sectors and services which still claim to be public, deregulation and free access to public markets. </p>
<p class="contents">What this means is that we are facing an obviously neo-liberal perspective, which we are not only trying to uphold but also trying to consolidate and strengthen. This type of objective is cropping up in such topical matters as food safety, public services and “intellectual property”, always in favour of a blind liberalisation of capital and in disregard of ILO working standards and of environmental rules that have been accepted throughout the world. This objective has dangerous implications for people’s cultural identity and for the actual development of dozens of countries, particularly the poorest. These facts, of course, are causing growing movements of public opinion which are expressing reasonable concerns and seeking new directions. </p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, no question as to the need for international economic regulation. It is, nevertheless, obvious that there other ways of achieving this, ways that are quite different from those currently in force and to those being planned, and this places the need for a moratorium on negotiations on international trade relations on the agenda. </p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this, this regulation will always need to be guided by principles of cooperation and development; it will need to include respect for social and environmental standards adhered to throughout the world; it will need to respect the wishes, interests, specific differences and different degrees of development of the States concerned; it will need to respect and promote preferential agreements such as the Lomé Convention, and it will need to reject the treatment of some human activities such as education and culture as mere goods. As it is so vital, it must be made completely transparent. New MAIs must be stopped and some laws must be definitively revoked, such as the Helms-Burton law blocking Cuba, as they are illegal from the perspective of international law. </p>
<p class="contents">Now this is quite obviously not the guideline that is currently being proposed to us. </p>

<p class="contents">As our chairman, Mr Pasqua, specified in the course of the general debate which took place during the part-session at the beginning of October, and as my colleague, Mr Berthu, has just mentioned, it is essential, before undertaking a new round of negotiations, to make a clear and specific assessment, one that is objective, and thus independent and takes into account the views of both sides, in order to determine the economic, social, environmental and food safety-related consequences of the previous agreements of the Uruguay Round. But we observe that, unfortunately, the Council has just given the Commission its negotiating mandate to go to Seattle, and this makes no mention of any such assessment. When pushed, they are prepared to undertake a study, only a very limited one, on sustainability, but nothing to do with the preservation of our economic and social identities.</p>
<p class="contents">The failure to carry out an assessment may be analysed as the wish to hide the very mixed reality of the effects of the deregulation of world trade from the peoples of WTO member countries. In the course of the years of the Uruguay Round, European agriculture has undergone the most significant reduction in workforce that it has ever known, thus causing the virtual breakdown of rural society. A number of developing countries are starting to suffer from the head-on competition to which agricultural products of the Latin America zone and of the Africa zone are subject. In the industrial sector, the concentration of some operators brings about situations of dominance over some markets, and small and medium-sized businesses (most particularly those which form the rural fabric of our country), bear the brunt of the unfair competition produced by the relocation of some multinational, or even transnational, enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">While the need to defend a given European farm model is being asserted, we are avoiding giving it a precise definition by means of Community preference, autonomy in terms of foodstuffs and public health protection. It is essential to define very quickly a European farm model based on diversified, traditional and healthy food, produced from essentially European agricultural products. The principle of Community preference must be defended and, by the same token, the system of export refunds including for products described as “outside annex 1”, i.e. food products produced from European agricultural products whose market price is higher than the world rate.</p>
<p class="contents">The provision of healthy foodstuffs means that the primacy of the precautionary principle should be clearly established in the context of these negotiations. This aspect of fair trade based on the absence of dumping for quality, environmental, social and fiscal reasons, if it is mentioned at all among the principles, is not asserted, with all the consequences of this, as a priority objective for European negotiators to attain. The prime objective for the Europeans, if you listen to the Commission, would be to get ready to make concessions. And indeed that is what the Commission is already doing, even before the negotiations have started, to the detriment of vital European interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely worried about the European Commission’s attitude. Indeed, following the Uruguay Round negotiations, we have had a few conflicts with the American authorities. The three main conflicts concerning the banana sector, the production and the incorporation of genetically modified organisms, and the importation of American beef, have all been negotiated by the Commission itself, against the interests of European and ACP banana growers, against the interests of European consumers and, of course, against the interests of our farmers and producers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has acted and is continuing to act in these three case as if it wishes to ensure that there will be no outstanding disputes between the European Union and the United States when the negotiations are due to begin. This is playing into the Americans’ hands. Instead of proclaiming the need for European concessions from the rooftops, the Commission would do better to forcefully assert the need to set right the errors and omissions of the Marrakech Agreement with regard to fundamental social rights, the environment, public health, in the general interest, indeed. But this would mean acknowledging that the Commission handled the latest GATT agreements badly, and obviously that is just unthinkable. The Commission therefore prefers, whether its representative is called Mr Brittan or Mr Lamy, to undermine our positions in advance regarding the precautionary principle, health safety and environmental protection, as well as economic interests in rural areas and, in the case of bananas, to make light of the special historic relations which our countries maintain in the form of international agreements with the ACP countries. Special, do not even think about it. The adjective is one that will make Mr Lamy jump with fright! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And my group has not subsequently managed to have it reintegrated.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel this anecdote is significant since is clearly shows the spirit in which this report was drawn up. There is a refusal to see that the more federal Europe is becoming, the more distant it is becoming from the peoples of Europe, and the more disaffected they are becoming from it. Sweeping aside this niggling detail, and many others too, the Commission feels more comfortable in proposing yet more federalism, extending majority voting to the Council, and constitutionalisation of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the same attitude of deliberately closing ones eyes to the facts which prevailed when it came to discussing enlargement. People are acting as if extending qualified majority voting, i.e. extending the powers of coercion over minority countries, was going to solve all our problems. This is serious self-delusion. Standardisation has already gone as far as it can within the Europe of the Fifteen. This can be clearly seen with the embargo on British beef and it is unrealistic to believe that it is possible to go further, with yet more constraints, within a Europe of thirty members.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years ago, the Amsterdam Council already came up against this problem and did not manage to solve it. The forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will be no more successful in solving it if it continues to work on the same bases.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, we need a Europe which is more flexible and accords greater respect to its nations. I gave the principles of this in a minority opinion appended to the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report, and the Union for a Europe of Nations Group developed the consequences of this by proposing twenty-one amendments, all rejected, alas, by the majority in Parliament. But the day will have to come when this House acknowledges the impasse in which it is trapping itself by championing a monolithic Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Swedish Christian Democrats in the European Parliament’s Committee on Constitutional Affairs have therefore, in the form of Amendment No 5, pressed for the inclusion of the following sentence at the end of section 17: “The application of the subsidiarity principle, as formulated in the Treaty of Maastricht, must be evaluated.”</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that the time is ripe for such an evaluation and that the European Parliament ought to have written this into its resolution and in that way shown its desire to provide the principle of subsidiarity with more explicit content for citizens in the EU’s Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish Christian Democrats view the enlargement of the EU towards the East as being absolutely the most important question for the European Union and will devote themselves to ensuring that the institutional questions are handled by means of a rapid and flexible process, founded upon participation by the applicant States.</p>
<p class="contents">What with the Swedish translations of the amendments only being fully ready on the same day that the vote takes place, we find the handling, including the political handling, of this important report to have been quite extraordinary, as well as unsatisfactory from a democratic point of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Who stands to gain from further integration of the European Union? The people of Europe who, with every day that passes, watch their democratic and social rights eroded and their democratic victories corrupted in the name of competitiveness and by pressure to support a more and more autocratic structure? I think not.</p>
<p class="contents">With the threat of deferred enlargement or even the withdrawal of the Union behind its original borders and in a bid to win new markets and share the plunder, provided that this can be done without rules, the capitalist system of the monopolies is trying to reconcile its internal differences, which were and which still are significant, in order to serve the common interest: i.e. overexploiting workers and achieving maximum profits.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the proposals of the so-called Wise Men and the Commission’s proposals lead in the same direction. Even greater inequality between the peoples of Europe, between the Member States of the European Union and between the candidate countries. What other purpose can there be to all these proposals which we hear and which, generally speaking, are incorporated into the report, on voting changes in the Council, on changes to the number or responsibilities of Commissioners, on reduced grass roots representation in the EC following the increase in the number of Member States, other than to strengthen the position of the rich countries of the EU, to strengthen the position of monopoly undertakings, the majority of which are established in those countries and to play down grass roots or national opposition to EU decisions which adversely affect the grass roots and which might even affect national interests?</p>
<p class="contents">What purpose can there be to the attempt to generalise the voting rule and the substantive, perhaps even formal repeal of the veto, despite deceptive grievances deliberately expounded to the contrary, other than to restrict the potential for grass roots intervention, at least where it opposes the choices made by the forces of capitalism in “smaller” countries?</p>
<p class="contents">How can the people of Europe call for the international role of the EU to be reinforced in the form of a new political and monetary union and a common defence and security policy when the EU is responsible, together with NATO, for the first act of war since the Second World War, i.e. the attack on Yugoslavia, in violation of every concept of international law? Everyone understands that a currency, in the capitalist world, needs an army to defend and impose it. This is the purpose behind the proposals for a common foreign and defence policy and an armed wing in the Union. So that arms can be used to support the interests of the monopolies against the people of Europe itself and of non-EU countries. This was proven by the campaign against Yugoslavia which, in addition to being illegal, was also unnecessary, at least for the reasons quoted, because it was made glaringly clear by the UNO itself, that all the government and mass media claims were shamefaced lies.</p>
<p class="contents">The clearest proof of the type of security being promoted is provided by the Amsterdam Treaty itself, the incorporation of the Schengen acquis, the creation of a Community prosecution service and the keeping of records on citizens’ political convictions, ideological stance, trade union activity and love life.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opposed to this EU, this lackey of imperialism and big business, and we are opposed to the reversal which this autocracy means for democracy. The EU cannot change with Intergovernmental Conferences, nor do the proposed negative institutional changes represent a change for the better for the people of Europe. The people themselves will oppose, intervene and change the power ratios in order to bring down this anti-grass roots, anti-democratic, autocratic structure which exists to serve big business and create a Europe of peace and collaboration, friendship and equality between peoples, real democracy and freedom and economic prosperity for the benefit of the workers.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The requirements in the report extend beyond what the European Council considers ought to be on the agenda for the next Intergovernmental Conference. We also consider that it is far-reaching on a number of points.</p>
<p class="contents">Section 13 (on providing the EU with a constitution and dividing the texts of the Treaties into two parts): We want to point out and clarify the fact that the only acceptable procedure when it comes to the constitutional part is unanimity. </p>
<p class="contents">Section 14 (on the revision of the Treaties): We consider that unanimity shall prevail when the Treaties are revised in accordance with section 13 a.</p>
<p class="contents">Section 17 (last part): We consider that unanimity shall apply not only in the constitutional part but also, for example, in the case of foreign and security policy. </p>
<p class="contents">Section 26, last part, may be interpreted in terms of the provision of reciprocal military guarantees. We consider this to be unacceptable. The EU has neutral and non-aligned States among its Member States. For these, it would be inconceivable that resources should be created for reciprocal military guarantees within the context of the European Union’s security and defence policy. Moreover, we do not consider that a precise and binding timetable for the common foreign and security policy is required over and above what was stated in the Cologne document. </p>
<p class="contents">Where section 27 is concerned, we view as considerable progress the fact that the so-called Petersberg Tasks in the Cologne document (humanitarian and rescue tasks, peace-keeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace-making) are to be incorporated into the EU’s range of tasks. This demonstrates that the EU is, in the first place, a political, social and economic project, including when it comes to conflict and crisis management. The Petersberg Tasks mean that non-aligned and neutral States have an opportunity to participate in conflict and crisis management and, for that reason, there is no basis for integrating the WEU fully into the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The enlargement of the EU is an historic opportunity to create a peaceful, stable and cooperative Europe. At the same time, it is the EU’s greatest challenge to date. A change to the Treaties is a prerequisite for preparing the EU to admit the new Eastern and Central European countries. It is now 10 years since the Berlin Wall came down. We agree to the timetable which has been proposed so that the Intergovernmental Conference might be concluded by the end of the year 2000. It must not be formalities such as changing the Treaties which postpone admission of the new countries. That is why we must also be careful not to place obstacles or stumbling blocks in the way of the Intergovernmental Conference's ending on time and of its results being approved in the individual countries in accordance with the regulations in the respective countries’ constitutions. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dimitrakopoulos’s and Mr Leinen’s report paves the way for a very thorough overhaul which we do not think it will be possible to implement within the established time frame. We have therefore voted against it. The many amendments and the many different opinions which have been expressed in connection with the vote today illustrate as clearly as one could wish the problems which a very comprehensive agenda would entail. </p>
<p class="contents">As members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we have voted, together with our fellow party members, for and against a range of amendments. We have done so because we want European development to move in a characteristically social democratic direction. This does not however alter our general view of the report. There are however a number of points which we must clearly reject, including initiatives which remove the basic principle that it is the Member States which, in accordance with their respective constitutions, should enter into and amend the Treaty concerned. We must also clearly repudiate the idea of the EU’s being made into a defensive alliance. This is not a task for the EU but for NATO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">1 – It makes requirements for revision beyond those that are laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in such broad and general terms that it is not clear what a new “full” agenda is. Particularly because it omits points for revision that I consider to be essential and that were agreed on in the opinions of other Parliamentary Committees, such as a revision of own resources, a revision of social cohesion, reform of the CAP, the extension of first Pillar competences in terms of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, reform of the legal system etc…</p>
<p class="contents">2 – The revision centres on an agenda that essentially only concerns issues of decision-making power and a corresponding new balance between Member States, which will reduce, in the name of fairness, the weight of economically less developed States in favour of the more economically powerful ones, to which it is being attempted to give the mechanisms for strengthening their influence. </p>
<p class="contents">3 – Consequently, it accepts, by giving the Commission <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> to propose it, a redistribution of the weighting that each State holds in the wake of what can already be seen in the administrative and operational organisation of the Community executive, which threatens the historical and constituent principle of the European project which has always successfully stood firm on there not being proportionality between population and the weighting of votes. </p>
<p class="contents">4 – Consistent with the positions that I have always maintained in Parliament, regarding a revision of Maastricht and Amsterdam, with the aim of keeping sacrosanct the founding historical balance between large and small countries, I cannot approve this resolution which will open up a “Pandora’s box” for a Treaty that accepts as fair the supremacy of some States over others in breach of the principle of the equality of all European citizens. </p>

Not so much because the issues are new – some of them were included in the last IGC and not resolved – but certainly because of the complexity and sensitive nature of the issues that constitute the <span class="italic">raison d’être</span> of the forthcoming conference. </p>
<p class="contents">With the argument for enlargement, the realisation of which does not present us with any fundamental problems, but which we do not envisage being achieved without consequences at various levels – and in the name of efficiency and democratic behaviour, an amendment to the Treaties, particularly in the institutional domain, is being aimed for. This means giving up unanimity and extending decision making by qualified majority to new areas; it means a new weighting of votes in Council decision making by qualified majority; and it means changing the composition and functioning of the institutions in terms of the number of Commissioners, the Council Presidency, the composition of the EP or even the choice of working languages. These are, in fact, changes that essentially target issues of power and influence within the EU and, where possible, aim to make viable or consolidate political boards of management around the largest and richest Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">The marginal role that, in this context, it is sought to give to smaller, less developed countries causes us, naturally, to take a very reserved position, one of concern and even outright opposition to the solutions that are being recommended. Our position is further reinforced by the solutions sought by some people in the area of security and defence and which aim for a militarisation of the EU, which would thus be consolidated as a European pillar of NATO, a position that we also reject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No exception is to be made for Article 5 which prescribes a mutual responsibility for intervening militarily if another Member State is attacked.

I did not vote for it because I do not find the procedure and a number of regulations acceptable. Of course I regret that people have not seized the opportunity of acquiring a wider consensus on this important issue. Because it is necessary for us to be able to take action against those who cross the borders of the European Union with criminal intentions and fingerprints may well offer a solution in this respect. This is why I have abstained in a number of crucial amendments, although I agree with the fundamental attitude of my group, who are unhappy about the fact that everyone is being tarred with the same brush. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to achieve an asylum policy of this kind, other measures and far-reaching efforts are required to further agreement between the Member States on the need for a generous and humane asylum policy. We consider however that the establishment of Eurodac should be seen in the light of the opportunity to achieve such a humane and generous asylum policy within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the changes to the Commission’s proposal, which find expression in the report, we see reasons for backing the report.

We have noted with great satisfaction that, at the meeting in the Council (legal and home affairs) on 29 October 1999, the Danish government announced that it would participate fully in the Eurodac partnership on an intergovernmental basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council’s endeavour to address fundamental rights by including children aged 14 and above is therefore blind. </p>
<p class="contents">But even with the minor amendments that have been approved by the European Parliament, including a minimum age limit of 18 years and a limit on the number of comparisons made of fingerprints to prevent more opportunities for error, this proposal that aims to create a Fortress Europe, closed to other citizens is unacceptable. </p>
<p class="contents">As the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market states, in normal circumstances, fingerprints will only be allowed to be taken from criminals or from individuals suspected of having committed crimes and not from asylum seekers, refugees or citizens of third countries who are illegally present within the territory or on a Member State’s border. </p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the protection of the fundamental rights of the individuals concerned requires that we do not proceed with the creation of a central control system for personal data because, in principle, none of those people may be treated as a criminal or be suspected of being one.</p>
<p class="contents">To make the situation worse, no measures for monitoring and protecting data are being proposed, which leaves open the question of how we can guarantee the implementation of effective sanctions which will serve as a deterrent against actions which are not authorised by the central unit. </p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, because the amendments to the proposal for a regulation are far too liberal. Next, because, at the insistence of the Socialist/ecologist/Communist government of my country, to my great shame, the regulation itself scandalously omits the filing of the fingerprints of illegal immigrants monitored on the territory of the Union. Finally, because the text entrusts the management of Eurodac to a handful of Commission officials.</p>
<p class="contents">You have done away with internal borders. In building the Europe of Brussels, Maastricht and Amsterdam, you have created an area of high insecurity where illegal immigrants, drugs, trafficking of many different kinds, and crime may circulate freely, any old how. The steps you are proposing today not only through the Pirker report, but also through the reports on drugs or on the counterfeiting of travel documents are pathetic, given the real extent of the dangers to which you are exposing the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The only solution is to re-establish checks at the internal frontiers of the Community; to give the Member State police services adequate human, financial and material resources to fulfil their role of protecting honest citizens, and to cease giving the irresponsible parties of Brussels any sort of jurisdiction over matters of the police, justice, immigration and residence of aliens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
