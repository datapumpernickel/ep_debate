<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pérez Royo </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive we have before us deals with a difficult issue. Any matters involving taxation are always difficult within the Union and, as you are well aware, they require unanimity within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to summarise the historical background to this proposal for a directive. It has been anticipated for more than 10 years. The present proposal arises, in fact, from the directive liberalising the movement of capital, approved in 1988 as part of the programme to set up the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on liberalising the movement of capital created legal conditions which, in fact, expedited the operation of the internal market as far as placing capital was concerned. Yet this same directive also opened the door for fiscal competition amongst Member States which, in turn, tended to create the appropriate conditions to attract capital from other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This very directive liberalising the movement of capital therefore set out a clear timetable for the harmonisation of taxation of savings income to prevent such harmful competition. As you know, the proposal for a directive presented by Mrs Scrivener in 1989‐10 years ago – was never even discussed seriously and was eventually withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the Member States approved rules that discriminated between residents and non‐residents with regard to taxation of savings income. Residents were subject to the relevant tax, but payments to non‐residents were considered tax‐free.</p>
<p class="contents">This gave rise to a number of dangerous situations. Firstly, a situation arose that was harmful to the operation of the internal market. Capital was not placed in the interest of profitability but according to fiscal considerations. Secondly, fiscal fraud – tax evasion – increased. Thirdly, as a result of all this, the tax burden gradually shifted to the detriment of employment prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years on, we have been presented with the new proposal which, it has to be said, represents a definite improvement on the previous one from a technical point of view. Crucially too, and this is the significant factor, the political context is much more favourable. The general feeling is more positive and, we hope, it will therefore be possible to overcome any obstacles that would prevent it being approved.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is presented as part of a flexible strategy included in a broader package and in a context in which it has been possible to include the notion of ‘damaging" fiscal competition, harmful fiscal competition, into our common language. What we are dealing with here is a clear example of such damaging fiscal competition, which the directive aims to eliminate. This is nevertheless a minimalist directive with relatively modest objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive is based on a coexistence model, that is to say, it offers the Member States two options. They may either operate a withholding tax on payment of interest within their territory, making no distinction between residents and non‐residents, or choose instead to provide other Member States with information on savings income paid to non‐residents in their territory.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a flexible proposal enabling the interests of the various Member States to be coordinated or harmonised. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has given it majority support, and this rapporteur strongly supports it. There have only been a few isolated amendments opposed to this approach and these were subsequently rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, certain issues are open for debate, particularly the problem of third countries. For a directive of this nature to maintain the competitiveness of the European financial sector, similar measures ought to be applied in neighbouring areas. I am referring, of course, to our trading partners and to countries where European capital might be placed.</p>
<p class="contents">There appear to be two ways of approaching this issue, two lines of thought. The first is to introduce an element of conditionality, for the approval or implementation of this directive to be dependent on us reaching an agreement with these third countries. Another way forward, outlined by the Commission and supported by your rapporteur, would be for the Commission to put forward its own legislation, thus gaining moral credibility and even achieving a consensus, in the hope of imposing or carrying through negotiations in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee has come out in favour of this proposal. Only one fairly significant amendment was approved in committee. It involves lowering the minimum rate of tax from 20 % to 15 %. I appreciate that this matter has to be debated in the Council, but as far as Parliament is concerned, Madam President, I can inform you now, on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we shall be voting for 20 %.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Randzio‐Plath </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">chairman of the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs. – (DE)</span> Madam President, my group supports the rapporteur"s position. Like the rapporteur, whom I congratulate, I too should like to say once again how glad I am that – ten years after the last proposal foundered – there is at last a possibility of making progress in this field. I think that there is a need for fair taxation in the European Union. Fair taxation is also a principle which should be observed in the internal market, which means that interest on savings cannot simply be exempted from tax. Both the proposal for a directive and the rapporteur"s report make it very clear that according preferential treatment to non‐residents – a concept which is not actually compatible with the concept of the internal market either – is now a thing of the past, because the directive will not permit any further discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, a major difficulty with the proposal was that, here too, the unanimity rule applied and continues to do so. At this juncture, I must emphasise once again that it is absolutely essential for further discussions to be held in the Council on the issue of majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal contains a coexistence model, and rightly so, because I think that this was the only basis on which there was any chance of its being adopted, although I do believe that a uniform regime is inevitable in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important is that this proposal is part of the tax package, because in this way unfair tax competition can be consigned to the past. That is also why we could not allow any exceptions, because if we had, we would in fact have been authorising a kind of tax haven in a particular sector. In this respect, I must support the Commission proposal, which also includes Eurobonds in the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, I should just like to say a brief word on the problems associated with only taxing the interest on savings accounts. Even though this particular proposal does not cover interest payments to legal entities and companies, in the interests of fairer taxation and also bearing in mind the opportunities open to all the Member States in the European Union to secure revenue, further thought needs to be given to how the scope of this directive can be extended.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that I fully support the rapporteur"s call for us to keep to the rate of withholding tax proposed by the Commission, namely 20 %.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Thyssen </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, the fact that quite a lot of Member States give more favourable fiscal treatment to the savings income of non‐residents than the savings income of their own residents leads to problems on the single market. People go tax shopping with their savings and for obvious reasons omit to declare the savings income received in other Member States to their own tax authorities, thus avoiding paying tax. The Member State of residence fails to collect its tax on savings and the single market becomes distorted. It seems the Member States" reaction is to try and keep the tax burden on volatile capital at a low level or to reduce it, often at the expense of upward pressure on labour taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we have entered the euro era with the disappearance of the exchange risk and soon also transaction costs, there is a great fear that the temptation to engage in this form of tax evasion will increase further. The Belgian tax authorities have been familiar with this for some time. The exchange risk between Belgium and Luxembourg disappeared a long time ago, and the so‐called coupon trains to Luxembourg are always very full.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the proposed directive consists of just 15 articles, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy tabled no fewer than 89 amendments. Fortunately, in the opinion of the PPE, only 10 were approved. Each of these 10 was approved by our group.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Commissioner, the PPE wants to keep as close to the Commission"s proposal as possible, but we would like to see the withholding tax reduced to 15 %. We hope that this amendment, which has also been adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, will be accepted here in the plenary. The PPE also continues to oppose extending the field of application to include legal persons and the exclusion of Eurobonds, for reasons which were discussed at length in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the PPE also does not support the amendments which want to see an agreement at OECD level first and which seek to make the directive"s entry into force dependent on this. We believe there are sound arguments for adopting a different approach to intra‐Community and international capital movements, including those to do with the free movement of capital and exchange risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, this directive does not provide the ultimate, comprehensive solution, but it is a major step in the right direction. We want to encourage this and will therefore be voting for the Commission"s proposal. But I would have liked to have heard from the Commissioner, and this is my final point, when he thinks the Council will grant its approval.</p>

I believe it is a good solution and a step forward in ensuring that existing differences, and in particular unfair differences, are removed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group supports the main thrust of the proposal as it stands and is pleased that the original proposal to extend it to include undertakings has now been dropped, so that it is now purely concerned with the interest earned by physical persons. This being so, as was pointed out in connection with the previous proposal, we have to consider whether there is scope to reduce labour costs. This is why we have retabled our amendments in order to ensure we have a kind of fiscal neutrality by which the resources in question are channelled back to the individual. At the end of the day, the fact that a number of people – and these were very large groups – were able to pay less than no tax had a knock‐on effect for everyone else, because the money has to come from somewhere. If we now introduce taxation, and can do so on a common basis, then I believe we must ensure that the others who have had to pay more get this back in the form of lower taxation on incomes.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one last comment regarding the article and amendment, as approved by Mr Pérez Royo"s committee, concerning the sale before maturity of the relevant securities. I myself added a technical amendment on this, that in the case of purchase after the original issue, you must be careful to ensure that – especially now that it is increasingly common for the portfolio to be reclassified in line with developments on the capital market – a provision is also in place for private individuals.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gallagher </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Madam President, at the outset I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pérez Royo, for his report on the proposal for a Council directive on the taxation of savings income.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulty of trying to find a system aimed at a minimum of taxation on savings income within the European Union has been more keenly appreciated as progress has been made in liberalising the movement of capital. This liberalisation goes back some 12 years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to recall that the Commission directive which aimed at introducing a single Community‐wide scheme for withholding interest at source did not obtain the unanimous consent of the Council. It was withdrawn and replaced by the proposal which is under discussion today.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997 the Council agreed that the Commission should preserve the idea of a coexistence model of taxation, meaning that each Member State will have different options: either to operate a withholding tax or to provide the other Member States with information on savings income paid to residents or indeed, a combination of both. The Commission proposed a withholding tax to be levied at a minimum of 20 % by the paying agent. Our committee has opted, albeit narrowly, for a lower rate of 15 %.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the Member States were able to agree that the Union should promote the establishment of equivalent measures in third countries in parallel with the discussions on the proposed directive. The Commission is due to report back to ECOFIN next month on consultation with third countries. Contact with third countries and associated territories must cover the same ground: in other words, minimum taxation on the equivalent co‐existence model and adoption of the paying agent method. I fully support the need for contacts with third countries. At this stage it is obviously necessary to limit initial contacts to nearby third countries, for example, Switzerland and Monaco.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group can support the principle of the draft directive.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wolf </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no need for me to comment in detail here on the general problem of tax competition, where there is of course a basic conflict between the democratic principle of equal voting rights and the economic principle of purchasing power. On this we agree: there is harmful tax competition within the EU. This is precisely the source of the mechanism – and this is always portrayed as the pressure of globalisation – which causes destructive competition between the Member States in the internal market, triggering a downward spiral and undermining the tax base, tax equity and the use of taxes to promote employment. We can do something about this. We can intervene in this mechanism and do something for ourselves, without simply waiting for a lead from the OECD or worldwide negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three points. Firstly, we should not tread more carefully than the Commission here. What we should actually do is apply the US model and demand 25 %. Secondly, we should not allow this to be postponed indefinitely, and we should not introduce provisions restricted to physical persons. If we achieve all that, then I believe that not only will it be a step in the right direction, Mrs Thyssen and Mr Goedbloed, but that it really will be the first step on the way to reform and a political union. I should especially like to thank Commissioner Monti for his patience, accuracy and perseverance, because in actual fact the only way in which we will overcome the principle of unanimity is by making progress on taxation and the internal market in tandem.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Castagnède </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, as you know, the issue of a minimum taxation of savings income in the Union does not quite have the unanimous support of all Member States, and these differences of opinion are reflected within my group. As a result, I will speak here only in a personal capacity and on behalf of the majority of the ARE Group. I should like to say that we are in favour of the Commission"s proposal for a directive on a minimum taxation of interest at the rate of 20 %, along with the option of declaring interest paid to the fiscal authorities in the country of residence.</p>
<p class="contents">We support this position for two main reasons, but I will not go into the details here. On the one hand, Commissioner Monti reminded us earlier of the need to redress the balance in the Union"s tax system, a system that places too heavy a burden on labour. On the other hand, there is a need to bring direct tax systems closer into line, which would be consistent with healthy tax competition, without going as far as harmonising such tax systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Our support for the Commission"s position is accompanied simply by a few recommendations. We should like to thank the Commission in advance for doing everything possible to extend this minimum taxation beyond the Union and, in particular, to OECD countries. Perhaps we should also make additional efforts to reach a consensus on minimum taxation between all Member States, possibly by agreeing on an appropriate timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think that it is important to establish a sound link between the provisions of the tax agreements and this minimum taxation project. In our opinion, this is the aim of the amendment we tabled, namely to establish sound links between minimum taxation and the provisions of the tax agreements, and this amendment was adopted by the Commission. It is rather a shame that, in this respect, our measures for eliminating double taxation within the Union are currently based on bilateral agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to come back to Mr Pérez Royo"s excellent report, we should like to point out simply and succinctly that we do not support the idea of extending taxation to include interest payments to companies. Instead, we are in favour of taxing interest received through undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (Ucits).</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jensen, Lis </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, at the end of the report, the rapporteur describes the intention of the proposal as ‘a major step on the way to tackling fiscal evasion and the distortions to the functioning of financial markets at Community level'. That is a laudable intention, I must say, but is it enough? In other words, is it enough to take measures against tax evasion on interest income at EU level? As far as I can see, the answer to this is a clear ‘no'. The problem is more a global than an EU one. It is necessary to take measures on a worldwide scale in this area. I do not think there is any need in this House to remind you that there are tax havens in other parts of the world, outside the EU. The possibilities are there.</p>
<p class="contents">Recital 8 of the Commission proposal says: ‘in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality set out in Article 3b of the Treaty, the objective of this Directive, which is that of the effective taxation of savings income within the Community, cannot be sufficiently realised by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved by the Community'. But is not the real issue something different? I think it is. Surely what this is really about is that, after the introduction of the single currency, the euro, on 1 January 1999, some people cannot wait to bring about further harmonisation of the whole area of taxes and duties. That is understandable enough, of course, when we remember what the purpose of monetary union actually is: further political integration. The former President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, said that EMU was a launching pad for political union, and you cannot say it more clearly than that. But that is not the language used in everyday encounters with the bemused populations of the EU countries. Why not say quite openly that, if monetary union is to function satisfactorily, it means that there must inevitably be a common policy on finance, taxation and redistribution? Then people would at least have a fair chance of grasping the real issue. Perhaps the reticence is due to fear of the reaction which would come from the people if the unvarnished truth were told.</p>

Both parties have developed the nasty habit of stashing their spoils with welcoming bankers in Luxembourg who, in spite of themselves, accept the plentiful bribes generously handed out by Dassault and Agusta.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I cannot help feeling rather sad when I think about the small‐time Belgian investor who, having had an excessive amount of direct tax deducted from the fruits of his labour, will see his honestly earned but small savings being heavily penalised yet again. This person will never enjoy the astronomical incomes that elicit such kindness from His Serene Highness the Prince of Monaco, whose status as a tax haven is confirmed by the European Union without any hesitation or crises of conscience. In the most illegal and immoral manner possible, it is a tax haven reserved for the rich only, no matter how they may have obtained their fortune.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Berès </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after the birth of the euro, we are well aware that the fight against fiscal dumping is one of our main tasks. In view of this, Commissioner Monti"s initiative has come at just the right time. The text we are considering today, in the form of the excellent report from my colleague Mr Pérez Royo, is one of the strands of this initiative. The other strand relates to interests and charges. We should not confuse the two strands. I understand the concern expressed by those who did not want us to deal with the issue of the rights of companies or legal entities under this text, as they clearly come under the other draft directive. As for the two proposed options, I believe their merit lies in the fact that they should make it easier to obtain unanimity within the Council. We must use this device if it allows us to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there are grounds for negotiating the rate. Some suggested 15 %. This would be wholly unacceptable to us. In its proposal, the Commission retains a rate of 20 %. In my country, the rate currently in force is 25 %. There is room for negotiation here and I believe that the proposal from the Commission is a useful one.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the scope of the directive, the issue of Eurobonds was raised. I am delighted that the Commission"s proposal includes these Eurobonds in the directive. What sense would it make to have a directive on this subject that did not cover these Eurobonds even though, as we well know, they are the main form of activity for some of our Member States? This directive will only make a difference if it can be applied to all actors and operators in all Member States. It is with this in mind, Commissioner, that you drew it up. It is, I hope, with this in mind that the Council will accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst debating this report, I believe that we should perhaps begin to draw a lesson from the method to be used for tax harmonisation. Two approaches are becoming clear, one of which is a pragmatic approach. The directive being put forward today is clearly along these lines. We are delighted by this and will seize any opportunity to use it. On the other hand, there is a more long‐term approach. I will outline three aspects of this approach. The first is clearly the issue of tax havens that we will have to resolve one day as we in the EU cannot impose drastic measures on ourselves and yet see tax havens flourish on our doorstep, or even within the Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect relates to the issue of qualified majority voting. Some people feel that changing over to qualified majority voting comes up against problems with the transfer of sovereignty. Unfortunately, the issue is more complicated than that. Undoubtedly, in some of our Member States, there are questions being asked about the fact that changing over to qualified majority voting will lead to a transfer of sovereignty. Yet there are also conflicts of interests between states inside the area and states outside the area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and I will conclude here, Mr President, the third aspect relates to external issues. In this respect, our rapporteur"s proposal that multilateral agreements could be reached with our main partners, the United States or Switzerland, without introducing a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> condition on this issue, seems to be perfectly credible and realistic in the longer term.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Secchi </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I too take the floor to speak on behalf of the PPE Group on this extremely important Commission proposal which, as has already been said, is part of a broader package of measures designed to set in train a process of fiscal coordination among the Member States in all those areas in which excessive fiscal competition is very clearly having negative effects that must be countered. But I must tell you that my group is firmly convinced that it is important not only to move in this direction, but also to restrict our activity to those situations in which the damage is evident. In that way, we avoid losing the benefits of healthy fiscal competition which may bring about convergence of taxation systems, particularly in the direction of lower levels of fiscal pressure that would certainly have a positive effect on the competitiveness of the European system.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the directive and the proposal for a directive that we are debating today, I agree with what Mrs Thyssen said, and also join with all those who have complimented the rapporteur, Mr Pérez Royo, on his work, even though we cannot agree with some of his proposals. We consider the Commission proposal to be largely acceptable, subject to a few technical improvements that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has sought to introduce: we believe, in particular, that this should be limited to non‐resident physical persons, excluding therefore companies already taxed on the basis of their results. We are in agreement with the model of coexistence and take the view that, as far as the proposed rate is concerned, and subject, of course, to the Council's prerogatives, the idea of lowering rates in an initial stage from 20 to 15 % could also help prevent the risk of capital flight from the Union. In fact, we have pressed the Commission to embark on negotiations as soon as possible, particularly with those countries closest to the European Union, to persuade them to incorporate the main principles of the directive into their own taxation systems in this area. This, we realise, will be no easy process, and we certainly do not want to see any kind of conditions attached to what we are asking the Commission to do, as we have no wish to see the entry into force of the directive postponed indefinitely; we actually want the Council to give its consent as soon as possible. It is important that the whole package should be implemented as swiftly as possible, since that will also enable us to acquire the knowledge we need to set to work in other areas: to quote just a couple of examples, the taxation of company profits and transfrontier working would appear to be good candidates for this.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with Amendments Nos 1 to 10 by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but reject all the others, although we have some sympathy with Amendments Nos 23 and 24 from the Liberal Group and Amendment No 25 from the Socialist Group which we shall therefore be supporting.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Weber </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I am speaking both as an environmentalist and a Luxembourger. Allow me to link the Pérez Royo report to the Cox report, which we have just debated.</p>
<p class="contents">If a tax reform is to be worthy of that name within the European Union, it must, by necessity, involve a redistribution of the tax burden in favour of the environment and of labour. I do not believe that introducing a tax at source on savings would favour labour or the environment. I agree with introducing energy taxes to promote energy efficiency and, while on this subject, I must point out that I am also speaking as a representative of a country that, under the Kyoto Protocol, is committed to cutting its emissions by 28 %. It is clear that Luxembourg will have to do something about energy taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, I do not believe that introducing a uniform tax of 20 % on savings for residents and non‐residents alike is a good idea. This is simply because the middle classes will have to foot the bill yet, for them, saving is a way of supplementing their pensions. These savers, who often do not have lucrative pension schemes, do not deserve to be punished by the widespread introduction of a tax on savings income. You can also rest assured that the major companies and multinationals will be able to arrange to have their capital hidden outside the Union. I believe that by allowing such behaviour we will be doing a disservice to financial markets within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, to sum up, I should like to say that I support a tax reform that involves a redistribution in favour of the environment and of labour, and that I am against a tax on savings income.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fayot </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with the basic approach of the majority of Parliament in saying that a single economic and monetary area also requires a certain degree of tax coordination; if we do not have this coordination, we will be heading closer towards fiscal and social dumping. I also agree with those who wish to redistribute the tax burden on labour, capital and natural resources in order to contribute to the fight against unemployment, and I think the majority of Members of Parliament support this. I should also like to stress the fact that the fiscal package put together under the Luxembourg Presidency must be implemented in its entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">To turn to the directive that Parliament is today being consulted on, it will undoubtedly be the subject of lengthy haggling in the Council, where unanimity is required. It must be said that the fiscal instrument, together with a whole range of legislative provisions and regulations, is of considerable importance for the development of financial services in Europe. We cannot manage such an instrument without dealing with immediate competitors and neighbours, as there is a danger of weakening this important service sector in the European Union. I therefore welcome the amendments on this subject that were adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to ask the Commissioner what stage negotiations with third countries have reached, countries that, in the financial services sector, are immediate competitors for European Union markets. Have negotiations really begun? How will they develop? When can we expect to see some results? I believe that the answers to these questions are vital for the events that will follow, particularly for negotiations in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I am of the opinion that a European tax system on savings will only materialise in the European Union as a result of binding agreements on a code of conduct on tax. I am told that we must first start with the European Union and that other countries will then follow. I do not really believe this. I rather believe that there will be a certain amount of upheaval, that capital will be re‐invested elsewhere under better tax conditions, and that the financial services sector will suffer as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we can see that professional groups have reservations concerning the dual system proposed in the directive. The European Banking Federation accepts a minimum rate of a 10 % withholding tax, but rejects the regime of information. It is true to say that this regime of information is technically cumbersome and in danger of becoming bureaucratic. However, it does have the advantage of making it easier to coordinate taxation of savings and it could, as Mrs Berčs has just said, help obtain a unanimous vote within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, a tax of 10 %, which is deducted at source, would allow the internal capital market – and I stress that it is the internal market – to function smoothly and the services sector to flourish. If I am stressing these aspects, Mr President, it is for the simple reason that I consider the development of a services sector with high employment potential, in my own country as in all the countries of the European Union, to be important above all.</p>

The debate must have something to do with Luxembourg. I well remember the Luxembourg Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Jean‐Claude Juncker, stating on more than one occasion that where this important issue was concerned, he saw the coexistence system as providing a definite opportunity to achieve an acceptable degree of harmonisation in terms of taxing interest. You see, Mrs Randzio‐Plath, this is not just about savings income, but about income of any kind received by physical persons. That is why the committee also proposed including Eurobonds, so that the United Kingdom and the City of London would not be virtually exempted from the provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key point in Parliament and in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy was deciding what tax rate to opt for in the coexistence model. The Commission has proposed 20 % and Mr Fayot 10 %. However, there do not seem to be any amendments calling for 10 %. I have not seen any, despite reading them all. We have proposed 15 %, and I believe that this is a reasonable approach. Curiously, Mr Pérez Royo, speaking in his capacity as rapporteur, has just mentioned 20 % – it is not for him to do so. We adopted the report with 15 %, and it is the rapporteur"s duty to convey that here too. I should like to recommend that we give our full backing to the compromise reached in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy: a minimum rate of 15 %, with an invitation to work towards greater harmonisation in negotiations with third countries at OECD level, and in the knowledge, Commissioner Monti, that your commendable work on tax harmonisation finally needs a worthwhile result. We hope that this will be the case, for our own and for your sakes. I hope that it will be possible, despite unanimity, to find a sensible solution.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Metten </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the proposal for a minimum level of effective taxation on interest earnings is really very modest. Most Member States tax the interest their own residents receive but not that received by residents of other countries. That is of course an invitation to tax evasion, which occurs on a major scale. When tax on movable sources of income is so easy to evade, we should not be surprised to find that the tax burden on labour, which is not so easy to evade, increases. If we want to break this trend – and we certainly do – we must ensure that movable sources of income can also be effectively taxed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s proposal for a coexistence model does no more than that. Member States can either exchange information on interest receipts with the tax authorities in a saver"s country of residence so that it can tax them, or they themselves can levy a withholding tax without exchanging information on the saver. This proposal, although better than nothing, is of course very imperfect, because although the withholding tax does not in principle provide discharge, and thus should be declared for income tax purposes in the country of residence, in practice it can easily provide discharge as the information on the withholding tax paid is not exchanged. A compulsory exchange of information would therefore have been better. Because of this loophole it is important that the withholding tax should be as high as possible so that there will be a maximum incentive to declare such income in the country of residence.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal to reduce withholding tax to 15 %, adopted by a narrow majority by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, is therefore astounding, and seems more of an encouragement to lower taxes on interest earnings throughout Europe than to increase them. I am not convinced by the argument that otherwise savers will turn to Switzerland or eastern Europe. The Union is in such a strong negotiating position with all these countries that any tax flight to them can be avoided if the Union itself has a credible system. In addition, the exchange rate risk is likely to scare off most investors.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the UK‐Luxembourg proposal to exempt Eurobonds is unacceptable. Any residents using them do so purely in order to evade tax. Members of this House who are so strongly in favour of exempting Eurobonds should reflect for a moment on this. Despite all its limitations, this proposal must therefore be supported, but with a higher level of withholding tax than 15 %.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cassidy </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, let me begin by saying, and this will come as no surprise to the Commissioner, that I do not see the need for this particular directive, because I believe the concept of harmful tax competition is absolute nonsense. We, in the European Parliament, believe in competition as being good for the consumer in goods and services. What is wrong therefore with tax competition? My conclusion is that some Member States are doing themselves harm by having excessively high rates of tax, whereas they really ought to be reducing the tax burden on their citizens. However, due to time constraints here, I am unable to elaborate on the mechanisms of doing that, but you are welcome to talk to me afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one respect however in which I very much support the excellent work done by the rapporteur. Unfortunately neither I, nor the rest of my group, was able to agree with him when he proposed that the directive should be extended to companies: this would have done enormous harm to the citizens of Europe, as it would have had an negative effect, for example, on undertakings responsible for trading in transferable securities as well as harming the potential of crossborder pension funds. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy did well in rejecting the rapporteur's amendment and indeed, from that point of view, I am happier with what the Commission is proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that some Member States have reservations about the detail. Could the Commissioner tell us a little bit about those Member States and their technical reservations? Secondly, I understand that the presidency, the Commission and the past presidency, have opened exploratory contacts with third countries about the possibility of extending it. Thirdly, a question addressed to the Socialist Group – is it Socialist Group policy to support Amendment 25 by Mr Hendrick which is calling for the harmonisation of capital gains tax in Europe?</p>

It is to Commissioner Monti"s credit, and I bear witness to this, that we again have some movement on this matter. The code of conduct on company tax is operational. Today we have two directives before us, including this one on capital income.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be quite clear about this, this is a fundamental debate from three different points of view: the single market, about which Mrs Thyssen has already spoken; making sufficient budgetary resources available to the Community; and finally, breaking the disastrous spiral of constantly increasing taxes on labour and constantly decreasing taxes on capital income and other movable tax bases.</p>
<p class="contents">Coexistence is not exactly the best system, but in the short term it was the only possibility for a compromise. I still hope and believe that in the course of the decision‐making in the ECOFIN Council we will perhaps be able to move towards a single system, maybe based on the withholding tax.</p>
<p class="contents">Opponents of coexistence are clearly right on one point, which is that the system must not end up subsidising the Member States with the greatest banking secrecy, in other words those Member States with the most non‐residents who will collect the withholding tax. It must be possible for this to be declared for tax purposes in the country of residence. This is why I want this discussion to be included in the debate on the European Union"s own resources. It is the view which Belgium is currently putting forward in the own resources debate, and I believe it is a view which must be given serious consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is my belief that it is not for us to deal with rate levels. The rate level must be determined, for example, according to whether or not it grants discharge. I believe this is a job for the final compromise round of Europe"s finance ministers. This is again a test for the tenability of the unanimity rule. I hope and am counting on the fact that no country will dare to use the right of veto to block something which the vast majority of Europe"s citizens want to see, namely a shift from taxes on labour to taxes on savings.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lulling </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, may I first point out that it was under the Luxembourg Presidency that a historic breakthrough on harmonising direct taxation was made on 1 December 1997. On that occasion, four elements were adopted that could form a basis for a proposal for a directive on taxation of savings. One of the elements was the coexistence of the system of a withholding tax and the regime of information.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, if we want this to work, the system provided for in the proposal for a directive is too complicated and too expensive for the paying agents. The certificates procedure provided for under the framework of the withholding system is extraordinarily complex and makes the coexistence of both systems practically impossible to manage, and even distorts it. Leaving aside such administrative atrocities, the proposal for a minimum of 20 % for the withholding tax would destabilise the Union"s financial markets. 15 % is also unacceptable and, in my opinion, a deduction of 10 % at source is a maximum. What is more, the broad definition of interest, which differs from the definitions adopted in the conventions against double taxation, will lead to conflict and even discrimination between financial products that are all much of a muchness.</p>
<p class="contents">By including in the scope of the directive collective investment undertakings in the sense of the 1985 directive, we will be chasing them out of the European Union once and for all. They will flee Europe, unless they have already ‘got the hell out" – if you will excuse the expression – due to administrative burdens that would put them at a competitive disadvantage in terms of their internal management costs. Therefore, the end of European collective investment undertakings is on the cards, as is the early redemption of Eurobonds, as the market for such bonds will be established outside Europe. It is of little consolation that few natural persons hold Eurobonds and that major capitalists will therefore be able to continue with their plans outside the Community. This would mean accepting that taxation at source will only apply to small savers" deposits.</p>
<p class="contents">With things the way they are, to adopt this worthless text that only advocates agreements with third countries offering a particularly attractive environment to non‐residents, is to completely ignore the fact that Switzerland, for example – which is already rubbing its hands with glee – does not discriminate between residents and non‐residents as regards taxation of savings. Agreements simultaneously establishing measures similar to those adopted in a directive are needed with all third countries that are likely to attract the Union"s capital. If the directive comes into being there cannot be any question of not applying it to dependent territories or territories linked to Member States. Mr President, I must tell you that there will no fool"s bargain struck with us.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ettl </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, time and again I am filled with admiration for Commissioner Monti and the patience with which he is trying to disengage the brakes on coordinating tax policy in Europe. He really deserves the utmost respect for this. Where coordinating tax policy is concerned, the main objective is to limit manoeuvring and distortions on the capital markets. It is a question of reducing harmful tax competition between the Member States, and part of creating equal economic opportunities is to make sure that investors are subject, at least in terms of approach, to a similar tax burden. Seen in this light, the Commission proposal is definitely a step in the right direction, and this is accordingly supported for the most part by our rapporteur, Mr Pérez Royo.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is precisely because we agree on the principles in this Parliament – at least in what we say out loud – that some of the amendments adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy are more than just ideas to curb the development of European tax policy or precautionary measures. However, seeking to reduce the rate of withholding tax from that proposed by the Commission to 15 % or 10 % falls into the ‘back to square one" category. In this context, we should not forget that there are some countries in the European Union with a 25 % tax rate. My country is one of them. Ultimately, it is also necessary to reduce the imbalance between the taxation of wages and salaries on the one hand and capital on the other. That is the goal we have set ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover – and this is also worth mentioning – exempting Eurobonds from the tax arrangements, as intended or desired by several financial centres in Europe, would give the securities market a considerable advantage over other savings instruments and would substantially limit the scope of the directive. With ‘a little less, please" as our motto, we will not be able to make any progress on coordinating tax policy. You will need to be patient, Commissioner!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Caudron </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a Socialist and a Frenchman, I am particularly pleased today to approve a proposal for a directive that will finally let us put an end to a situation where a whole section of savings income was completely avoiding taxation, and this within the European Union. I should like to thank Commissioner Monti and his team for this. Of course, I should also like to warmly thank our colleague and rapporteur Mr Pérez Royo for the important and serious work he has done on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the single currency will promote the cross‐border movement of capital, this text was long overdue. It is quite simply vital for the Union"s cohesion. Of course, like many others, I approve of the fact that the idea of excluding Eurobonds from the scope of the directive was rejected. If we were to exclude them, there would be a danger of serious tax evasion and of distortion of competition. Lastly, of course, I am also against establishing a conditionality link between adoption of the directive and its simultaneous application in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to discuss an extremely important point that has been debated at length this morning, namely the rate of the withholding tax. Although I personally would have preferred a rate of 25 %, I am prepared, together with the rapporteur and the Socialist Group, to accept the 20 % rate put forward by the Commission. I will do so in the spirit of compromise and negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I now hope that this case will be closed, as we expected, at Helsinki in December 1999 at the latest and that, after this, tax harmonisation will finally gain pace.</p>

I believe that it is a question of establishing common definitions and creating an environment which makes fair competition possible.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is as follows: is there already a study or a simulation model of the impact of the proposals or ideas put forward? How will competition develop within the European Union on the basis of the amended provisions, and how will the European Union be able to prove itself when competing at international level?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is also important to highlight again and again the difference between the fiscal regime applied to companies – and its consequences – and that applied to consumers. Ultimately, of course, we believe that it is important to reduce the tax burden as a whole, so as to become more competitive and to guarantee a higher personal income for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">My final question is this: when will these proposals be agreed with the OECD countries, and are discussions under way with Switzerland and Liechtenstein?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, I must congratulate Mr Pérez Royo on his excellent report, which reflects his own considerable talents, and for supporting the rapid adoption of the directive. My thanks also go to the other members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and all honourable Members for their contributions to the debate and for the kind words they have had for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is part of a package which, as everyone has reminded us, was adopted during the Luxembourg Presidency, and the first element – the code of conduct – was swiftly put in place by the United Kingdom Presidency. I therefore have to make it quite clear that, although they may have reservations on some points, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom are participating fully in this process to counter harmful tax competition, the aim of which, as mentioned by Mr Secchi and other speakers, is not general harmonisation but a concerted effort to counter the harmful effects of tax competition. The aim is not to increase fiscal pressure in Europe, but to allow it to be reduced gradually and in an orderly way. The further aim is, of course, to shift the balance of the tax burden which is currently having an excessive impact on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the amendment tabled by the rapporteur which is designed to improve the current text of Article 5© and tighten up the criteria for identifying collective investment funds. I think I can safely say that, subject to possible technical drafting improvements, the Commission"s services are optimistic about the possibility of including, in an amended proposal for a directive, that amendment and, similarly, the amendment relating to tax competition, that is to say the new recital 7a. While I understand the spirit of the other amendments tabled concerning the scope of the directive, I think that, as matters stand, they should be considered useful contributions to the debate rather than a direct contribution to the legislative text. I am referring here in particular to the problems of the zero coupon bonds which are being discussed in detail in the Council. We are able to accept the spirit, if not the wording, of Amendment No 24 from Mr Goedbloed and will try to ensure that it is accepted by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the issue of Eurobonds is concerned, the Commission"s position is that we are opposed to general exemptions; we are very much willing to consider solutions designed to contain the administrative burdens on intermediaries and take a balanced approach to the problems relating to those bonds already in circulation. On rates, the Commission still believes a 20 % rate to be a sufficient compromise which could, from the point of view of all the Member States, meet the need to secure a minimum of actual taxation of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted that a great deal of attention – and I am entirely in favour of this – has been paid to the issue of contacts with third countries. Though no questions were put on this, I can say that, as instructed by the ECOFIN Council, the German Presidency along with its Austrian predecessor and Finnish successor, as well as the Commission, is establishing both technical and political contacts with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and Andorra, and we have been asked to report back on this to the ECOFIN Council meeting of 15 March. A report on the whole subject‐matter of the directive will be presented to the May meeting of ECOFIN and, Mrs Thyssen, as regards the timetable for reaching agreement on this matter, the Vienna European Council set the target date of the Helsinki Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Two points finally: this is not a new tax; that would be a great mistake. This is not a proposal for a new tax, it is a way of enabling the Member States to cooperate to ensure that the taxes already in existence are not systematically evaded as a result of the creation of a fifth freedom alongside the four freedoms of the internal market, that is to say the freedom not to pay taxes because of transfrontier movements.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of financial services, my response to Mr Fayot and other Members is that the Commission is very much aware of the need to boost the financial services industry in Europe and that, in that context, in the recent framework action on financial services, it has shown how a degree of sensible coordination of taxation can benefit rather than penalise the financial services sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Cassidy, I appreciated what you had to say today, as I always appreciate your comments, even when critical. I have said that we do not favour combating all forms of tax competition, but only those that are harmful and unfair. However, were we to accept the idea that any form of competition between the Member States is good, given that competition is a positive thing, then we should also, for the sake of consistency, have to allow them to compete fully with each other using state aids. That is not, I think, a generally accepted view.</p>
