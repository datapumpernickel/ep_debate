It tabled resolutions on the human rights situation in Iran, Iraq, in the Israeli settlements, in Burma/Myanmar, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Sudan, and negotiated statements to be issued on behalf of the chairman on Colombia and on East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, the European Union tabled a resolution on the death penalty, which was enormously successful, and led work on a resolution concerning children’s rights, which was a joint initiative with the Latin American group of countries. The Union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission to be held in Geneva in March and April. In particular, as agreed at the Human Rights Council Group on 9 February 2000, the European Union intends to table draft resolutions on the Israeli settlements, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burma/Myanmar, a draft chairman’s statement on Colombia, and, possibly, on East Timor, together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March. In particular, there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty. To date, the group has not reached agreement on the strategy to be adopted in this respect, and in particular with regard to formulating a compromise to be tabled in the last resort in case of any amendments to the contrary, including Article 2(7) of the Charter of the United Nations, which refers to sovereignty. We have tried to reach agreement in advance on a compromise text, in view of the difficulties that arose at the 1999 session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, at which the Member States failed to agree on an amendment introducing a reference to Article 2(7) into the draft resolution sponsored by the European Union on the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year, the United States decided, at a very late stage, to table a draft resolution on China. This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no-action motion. The European Union voted against that motion. The European Union’s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China, but an EU vote against the no-action motion. It is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution. This initiative has provoked a strong reaction on China’s part: the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union, in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States’ initiative. This initiative is being discussed within the Union, but with no hope of a decision in the near future. It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible, and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000. In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission, we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important this year, too, that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution. In this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. The European Union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party, the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground, and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission, potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing. The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues, and whether or not it agrees with this initiative, this is in any case legitimate from this point of view. </p>
<p class="contents">The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon, and will include seminars on legal issues and on women’s rights, and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part. The next human rights seminar will be organised by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000, and, during the last round of the dialogue in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the European Union’s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the United Nations International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the United Nations’ International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, both of which have been signed by the Chinese Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is discussing issues on which it hopes that China will take concrete measures, and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union hopes China will announce positive measures at the session on 25 February. The presidency will also present to the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern. The meeting held in Beijing in October 1999 confirmed that, on the one hand, the Chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues relating to the dialogue itself, with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal forms of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention. On the other hand, they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue, while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage. On various occasions the European Union has reiterated to the Chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue, and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas. It was decided that the dialogue should continue, but in a more targeted and effective way, given that China has agreed with the European Union’s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, during the next Human Rights Commission there will also be a debate on rationalising the work of the Commission itself. A working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission’s mechanisms. This working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous, especially in the financial field. The European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission’s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for Geneva on subjects like racism, civil and political rights and the right to development. As the presidency said, much remains to be done, despite the understandable request by Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should set out its position well in advance of the Geneva session. That is easier said than done – we are still discussing some of the toughest issues. For example, discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament’s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult. That does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference. However, let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues: the death penalty, Cuba and China. I am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission. This has always been a subject about which I personally have felt extremely strongly, I have always voted against the death penalty. Spurred on by Amnesty International and others, one of the first decisions I took as Governor of Hong Kong was to abolish the death penalty. We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly. We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid.</p>
<p class="contents">The New York stage is different from Geneva. Last year’s debate in New York on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues. It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty. The debate in Geneva, however, is more focused on human rights issues. We may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Cuba. I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously. We are extremely concerned about moves by the Cuban Government over the last year that have further curtailed public freedom, moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty. We are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions. We are monitoring the human rights situation through the reports of NGOs and the work of our human rights working group based in the EU embassies in Havana. We have regularly put our criticisms to the Cuban authorities, and this Parliament has done the same. But I do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate Cuba. We want a fair and open society in Cuba, a Cuba which respects the principles of the market, the sanctity of contract and the rule of law. We want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">My views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which I wish to deal, namely China. Quite simply, I want us to be engaged with China. It would be self-indulgent and self-defeating, as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity, to want anything else. I also want to see a China transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy activists or religious believers.</p>
<p class="contents">So what should we do? Naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms. It is a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which does not include China – or Russia, for that matter. But I do not believe today, nor have I ever believed, that our burgeoning economic relationship with China – manifested, for example, by China’s EUR 25 billion surplus with the European Union – should silence us when it comes to China’s human rights record. For me the question is not whether we should address the question of human rights in China – we have a duty to do so and a legitimate interest in doing so – but rather what is the most effective way of doing this?</p>
<p class="contents">So what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year? As the presidency has noted, the Union as a whole is considering its position. But I strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the Member States ought to take proper account. First, while some people question whether tabling a Geneva resolution makes any difference, several of the most distinguished Chinese advocates of democracy strongly believe that it is a valuable move, not least because of the message it sends to people in China itself. That is a point that deserves serious consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will all want to take proper account of what has actually been happening in China in recent months, for instance, the heavy sentences imposed on democracy campaigners, the detention and recent punishments meted out to members of Christian churches and the arrests and sentences of the members of Falun Gong. Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet. We have made our views very clear to them. While we all know that for many people in China there has been a real long-term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties, there is a dark side to the picture as well. Critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with China. That is true and potentially valuable, although I have to say – and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency – that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked. Of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres. That is very welcome and I also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level. Naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long-term process, but I wish I could point to more real gains.</p>
<p class="contents">The next dialogue in Lisbon on 25 February will be an important test. It will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not. What, finally, do we want to see as the first steps? Well, for example, we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them. I wish we were closer to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Where does all that leave us this year? I repeat that Member States will have to make up their minds. What I hope is, first, that we in Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it, that we will not allow some to be picked off, that our position will not be based on self-delusion or pretence, that it will be a common position and a sensible position.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions. But if that is true, then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward. If we are to rest our position on the human rights dialogue, then we need to be able to convince you, the NGO community and the public at large that it is actually getting somewhere. That, in my judgement, is the challenge for the next few weeks. I am grateful to the House for its concern about human rights around the world, and particularly in China.</p>
