If, at every stage along the way, there are people who rose up and said, “Never again”, it is quite simply because they are convinced that there is nothing worse than physical harm inflicted on individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">This founding principle of Europe is today being challenged, indeed, by the application of the death penalty in a considerable number of places throughout the world. China, the self-styled democratic Republic of the Congo, the United States and Iran have the sad record of coming at the top of the list of the countries which apply the death sentence. According to Amnesty International, there are 3,500 prisoners waiting for execution in the United States, where 68 prisoners were executed last year. In these countries, the right of life or death over prisoners is all the more intolerable in the light of the ridiculously limited budgets allocated to crime prevention policies and social matters. I prefer to think that, as Victor Hugo said, to close one prison, it is enough to open one more school. There is absolutely no doubt that the seventeen years that Mumia Abu-Jamal has just spent rotting on death row following a travesty of justice are linked to the fact that he is black, to his fight against institutional racism, to the freedom of thought which this journalist practised by having the courage to denounce the corruption prevailing in the ranks of the Philadelphia police. In the same way, Iran, which executed 66 people last year, would have us believe that the dozens of students arrested and the 13 Jews, were spies.</p>
<p class="contents">The mobilisation of international opinion, as we have seen, prevented the execution of Mumia Abu-Jamal, scheduled for 2 December. But, for the time being, there has only been a stay of execution. We must now seek to have the order of execution revoked definitively. We must widen and intensify our pressure on these countries and hit them where it hurts. It is important that European businesses should refuse to invest in the states of the United States or anywhere else in the world where the death penalty continues to be applied. The Member States of the European Union must refuse to extradite any person to a country where it is known that their death sentence is automatically programmed as soon as they set foot there. Demanding the immediate and unconditional abolition of capital punishment throughout the entire world today does not just mean promoting human dignity but also validating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>

<p class="contents">I am afraid that the reasons behind the withdrawal of this resolution are, at the very least, suspect, and have more to do with a kind of boycott than the defence of principles. I truly hope that Parliament will be attentive to this subject, because it is clear that the attitude of some of the Member States has been ambiguous, to say the least, and it is therefore logical that Parliament – which from this point of view has always been quite consistent – must continue to be vigilant.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Group of the Greens, we have taken note of these events, as well as the somewhat half-hearted wording of this resolution, which, however, we consider it important to adopt, at least in order to indicate that there is a problem that we must continue to be active on. Nevertheless, I would stress once again that, from this point of view, the European Union’s ambiguity is apparent to everyone, and I therefore think that we should express ourselves in a much clearer way than we have in the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite what our colleague has just said, I think that on this occasion there is more than sufficient reason to congratulate ourselves on the fact that the European Union has unanimously presented a resolution to the United Nations requesting a moratorium on the death penalty. It is sad that this initiative has not come to fruition and we hope that it will do so during this legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to say, Mr President, is that we have done this because we are convinced that everybody has the unalienable right to the respect for life and this right cannot go unrecognised or be violated. We have all seen the horrendous pictures of the last death sentence passed by the Florida Court and it will therefore not surprise any of you that the first person to appear in the text of the joint resolution should be the Spanish – and hence European Union – citizen, Joaquín José Martínez, whose sentence we ask to be reviewed and whose death sentence we ask to be suspended.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case there has been a series of coincidences which have inspired an enthusiastic solidarity movement in our country in which the Government, all the political parties and the rest of society have taken part. I would like to say that there have been a whole series of irregularities in the trial and it appears that the defence lawyer has not fulfilled his commitments. However, Mr President, what is serious – and his case is serious enough as it is – are not the conditions of this trial, nor the fact that the United States holds the tragic and regrettable record for executing people who are later proved to be innocent. What is most tragic and regrettable is the fact that the death penalty exists at all. I therefore believe, Mr President, that as a European Parliament we have to show, in this and all other similar cases, a firm and resolute commitment to the right to life, as we have done in this joint resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is founded upon an Old Testament “eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth” mindset which is not worthy of humanity now that we are approaching a new millennium. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has played a forceful role in the fight against the death penalty. In one after another of the applicant States, it is either in the process of being, or already has been, abolished, which is a very positive development. In spite of that, the death penalty is still applied in all too many States. Only last year, 1,625 prisoners in 37 different countries were executed, and there are thousands on death row. In the United States alone, several thousand people are waiting to be executed. </p>
<p class="contents">Some of the prisoners condemned to death throughout the world have committed odious crimes, but that does not justify their being executed. All too often, the death penalty is used for political purposes, and there can be legal confusion and innocent people can be executed. That alone is an argument against this barbaric form of punishment. Nor does the death penalty have any proven deterrent effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution we are debating is really quite remarkable. It names three citizens who, over the next few days, are to be executed in the United States. Obviously, we are urging the American government not to carry out these death sentences. But what the resolution really ought to be concerned with – a subject which my colleagues too have taken up – is the memorandum concerning the death penalty throughout the world. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party wholeheartedly supports this memorandum, which the UN has initiated. We would encourage the Commission and the Council to pursue this issue vigorously and to unite the European Union in unanimously condemning the death penalty in every forum so as to give rise to a worldwide moratorium on its use. The abolition of the death penalty would be a fantastic step forward in the fight for human rights and also a big step forward for the recognition of human dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1998 it was noted that there were at least 1,625 executions in 37 countries and almost 4,000 death sentences in another 78 countries. These figures refer exclusively to the information which Amnesty International has been able to collect. The true figure is, without doubt, much higher. Every year an unknown number of people are declared innocent after being executed. According to a report released recently, since 1973 and in the United States alone, 75 prisoners condemned to death were released when it was discovered that they had been wrongly convicted. We will never know how many innocent people there were amongst the approximately 7000 prisoners executed in the United States of America during this century. According to Amnesty International, for every six prisoners executed since the restoration of the death penalty in the United States, one innocent person was condemned to death and later pardoned.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it seems to me that the Council’s proposal to the United Nations, however important and positive the initiative may be, is very timid because calls on those States which retain the death penalty – and I quote – “to progressively restrict the number of crimes for which it is imposed”.</p>
<p class="contents">Does that seem to us to be sufficient? Do we want to be a diplomatic Assembly or a political Parliament? That is why we ask the Council, in section 9 of this resolution, in the negotiations with third countries, to examine the possibility of incorporating the abolition of the death penalty into the clause on human rights. Perhaps the Council is not in a position to do any more, but what about us? Should we not be more demanding? Should we not be more ambitious? The answer is yes. This is why we are sending this message to the Council and all the nations of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of the Spanish citizen, José Joaquín Martínez, is a clear example of justice with no guarantees. That is why he is calling for real justice, and that is why we support him today. He wants a new form of justice so that he can demonstrate his innocence, and he has the right to it. But I declare, we all declare together, that no death sentence is a just sentence. None is.</p>
<p class="contents">I will also end with a biblical quote which is more positive than the one quoted by my colleague. It is a quote from Genesis. Cain killed Abel and nobody disputed his guilt in this horrendous crime. He spilled the blood of his brother and the Lord cursed him and expelled him from his house and condemned him to live as a fugitive and a vagabond: “And Cain said to the Lord: ‘every one that findeth me shall slay me’. And the Lord said unto him: ‘Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold’. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him”. May nobody touch Cain, that was the message. May nobody touch Cain.</p>
<p class="contents">That should be our ambition: that nobody can execute any human being ever, in any part of the world, for any reason. Nobody. Not even the United States of America. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, once again, this Parliament is going to speak to the rest of the world against the death penalty. I therefore feel proud to be here this afternoon and to be able to vote, unanimously, for a condemnation of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">The death penalty is barbarous. As other Members have said, it is a terrifying fact that many innocent people have been executed. And I do not understand how anybody can live with that on their conscience.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality today’s resolution talks about three specific cases: firstly, the case of José Joaquín Martínez, a Spaniard, in whose trial enormous irregularities have occurred. I have here a copy of a letter which one of the witnesses sent. He is in prison, it is true, but he sent a letter to the court saying that he had heard somebody claiming responsibility for the murder which José Joaquín Martínez is convicted of. With this simple source of doubt, it is impossible to condemn a defendant to death. Therefore we ask in the resolution for a new trial and that under no circumstances the death sentence be passed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second case is that of Abu Jamal. There are many reasons to believe that the trial and death sentence on Abu Jamal were motivated by political factors, above all, because he was a leader. For the moment he has been spared. His execution was set for 2 December. We also demand that this death sentence not be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">And we also take up the case of a person who is mentally ill, who was about to be executed and who has been spared. It seems to us an enormous and terrifying cruelty that anybody should consider executing ill people of this type and that people should be kept in prison for 21 years, as is the case with a Canadian who was due to be executed and, half an hour before his execution, had his appeal accepted in court. </p>
<p class="contents">This is tremendously cruel and the world cannot accept it. This Parliament must champion the demand for a universal moratorium, if this is not approved now. And to this end we must display our moral authority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, no doubt, it would also be necessary to seek to convince the members of the Socialist Group that they should be firm on this point. This has not been the case to date, and I therefore wish Mrs Díez González good luck.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I think that the heart of the matter was raised by Mrs Frassoni and Mr Salafranca. What we are talking about here is not the issue of capital punishment. This House has shown on many occasions that it was convinced of the need to establish a universal moratorium. What we are talking about here is foreign policy and, more exactly, once again, the matter of the European Union’s lack of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would go further than Mrs Frassoni. There is no ambiguity. On Monday, the Council decided to withdraw the motion it had proposed on the pretext that it reiterated a fundamental article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On Tuesday, it voted in the texts with the same reference to the fundamental articles of this declaration. The problem clearly, therefore, lies in the lack of political will, and we can imagine the reasons for this: pressure from some major countries, such as the People’s Republic of China, the United States and Japan, who succeeded in ensuring that this policy, upon which the Union had already decided, was literally betrayed at the last moment. The central problem before us, then, as a Parliament, is the problem of a necessary joint European policy on security and foreign affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the first things to ask for is that this dossier is handed over to Mr Solana. It is no longer possible for this dossier to be placed in the hands of presidencies which, as we know, change over every six months; we need a permanent spokesman who can, on his own authority, organise the work of the various Member State delegations in New York so that, next year, we have a position which is consistent from beginning to end, thus avoiding this truly tragic situation, one that has made things difficult for a number of third countries friendly to the European Union, starting with Mexico, which had made a very firm commitment to defending our perfectly acceptable compromise position. We must therefore amend today’s motion for a resolution in order to firmly condemn the Council and ask it, as firmly, to entrust this dossier to Mr Solana, and to him alone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, even underage children are executed in the USA and, according to statistics, the criminal justice system operates selectively at the expense of the weakest economic and social groups, especially if they are dark-skinned. We are horrified by the frequency with which the innocence of citizens condemned to death is subsequently proven. And while all this is going on, the 54th General Assembly of the UN has rejected the motion by the Finnish Presidency of the Council of the European Union for no more death penalties to be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying, Mr President, that the death penalty has no place in a democratic society. No-one has the power of life or death over anyone for any reason whatsoever. On the contrary, the death penalty is the preferred weapon of totalitarian regimes because it is a symbol of the power of the state and of the humility of the individual in the face of the power of the state and, as we know, it is often used to annihilate opponents.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, on the basis of our European values and in the name of respect for human rights, we call on the governments of all the countries in which death sentences are pending to suspend them immediately and to repeal the death penalty. We also call on the USA to allow a retrial of the journalist Abu Jamal in Pennsylvania, of Martínez in Florida and of Robinson so that they may have a chance to defend themselves properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union and the Council need to impose the repeal of the death penalty in the form of a special clause in economic and political agreements with third countries, as called for by other Members. In addition, an immediate worldwide campaign is needed and a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment pending the final repeal of the death penalty throughout the whole world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Among the many cases of death sentences where the sentence is so unfair that carrying out the sentence would be a heinous act, I wish to draw attention to the case of the Iranian students condemned to death for taking part in the demonstrations last July. These sentences come in addition to the equally ignominious sentences of 13 Iranian Jews, not to mention here the thousands of victims of repression in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">All those under threat of capital punishment for political reasons should be released immediately, as should the great numbers of students sentenced to imprisonment. And if these sentences show the worth of the regime of oppression and terror which is that of Iran, they are just as indicative of the essence and worth of trusts such as Shell, for example, which has just signed a USD 800 million contract with the Iranian Government. It also shows the worth of the pronouncements on human rights by Europe’s Heads of State and Government who received the President of Iran with great pomp and ceremony, so that other trusts could sign other just as fat contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, while I am delighted to see that Mumia Abu-Jamal, the victim of the schemes of a corrupt and racist police force, was not executed, I consider that the fight is not yet over, and it is his release that we have to achieve.</p>

On many occasions, we have condemned from this Chamber the outrages perpetrated upon the Kosovan Albanian people. Their suffering is inconceivable, and none of us can ever understand the scale of what they have experienced. We in the European Union are also guilty of not having succeeded in time in preventing Milosevic’s insane excursions so close to our own territory. The EU also has an important role to play in the reconstruction process. All democratic forces must be supported in order to facilitate the reconstruction and create a functioning and democratic civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">The collective rape which has been committed against the Kosovan Albanian people cannot however justify the actions which have been reported on against civilians belonging to, among other groups, the Serbian minority, but also other minorities. If any kind of normality is to be achieved, all affected parties must feel secure in returning or in staying where they are. This applies to both the majority and the minority. The persecutions, and in certain cases murders, of Serbs which have occurred are therefore entirely to be condemned and must cease. They do not carry the peace process forward. The outrages committed against KFOR personnel are also unacceptable and, on behalf of my Group (the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party), I should like strongly to condemn these. I should also like to appeal to all parties to cease committing such outrages and to lay down their weapons and together embark upon the long and difficult road to peace. I plead for all parties and organisations to work together for a better and brighter future in Kosovo, a future where all can hopefully live together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Have the murders, expulsions, looting and pillaging in Kosovo stopped? Unfortunately not. Unfortunately the crimes are continuing, with two differences. First: the victims of the crimes are no longer the Kosovo Albanians, but Serbs, Roma and even Bosnians. Secondly, it is no longer the Yugoslavian army in Kosovo, but our armies, which on the one hand are completing a fantastic undertaking in reconstruction, in protecting people, bringing law and order, in every respect and on the other hand are despairing because they are not able to really protect the people that they should protect and that they would have wanted to protect. Who is to blame? Unfortunately those for whom the international community waged a war, the first war on humanitarian grounds. The former KLA – I say “former” because it supposedly no longer exists, because it was supposedly disarmed – believes that it has won a war and that it therefore has the right to commit exactly the same crimes as those who led to this war. And that is the disgrace!</p>

We would assure the UN representative, Mr Kouchner, and his former colleagues, of our full support, if he would finally begin to set up an administration in Kosovo and not leave that to the bogus and illegitimate government of the KLA, even if the local authorities and the city and local councils were not formed by the KLA, but actually – if not other Kosovans – other UN officials could complete this work and the various different tasks that need to be performed in Kosovo.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was there in October. I can confirm that the military power could not resolve the problems on the spot. On the contrary, the old principle is being borne out: violence breeds violence. The international community in fact has no solution to the Kosovo conflict that exists just as it did before. The conflict is there as it was previously. The international community does say that Kosovo is part of the rest of Yugoslavia and we are creating a multi-ethnic society. But the reality in Kosovo is completely different. Everyone who is there and everyone who works there knows that, and that includes the EU officials.</p>
<p class="contents">The former KLA, Mr Sakellariou, I can stress, feels that it is the victor and, through the mainly economic international aid, feels that this victory is confirmed. All the parties theoretically declare that the Serbs, Roma and Albanians can live together but in practice the situation in Pristina is different. You can no longer see the Cyrillic alphabet. It has all been destroyed, because the Slav language may no longer be spoken. For all Serbs who live in Pristina this means that they can really no longer take part in public life. This is Pristina, a city full of international organisations! In Mítrovica the situation is much worse. The city is completely divided and is becoming more markedly so day by day. </p>
<p class="contents">Why is that? The reason is simply that we only concentrate on economic aid and forget the crucial things, that is to say, the practise of tolerance, the practise of democracy and aid in the social field. There is no money available for these things on the spot. Mr Kouchner knows that reconstruction in Kosovo will fail on the very matter of the protection of the minorities. He is not receiving any help from the EU in that regard.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In many cases in which I have tried to help since 1989, I have felt myself to be personally compromised. Why did we intervene as an international community? We decided to help the Albanians because their basic and human rights were being infringed. For that reason we went in and I still believe that it was the right thing to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Over eight years of an apartheid regime in Kosovo the Albanians did not do anything to anyone, neither to the Serbs nor to the Roma, nor to the Croats, nor to the Bosnians. But they have suffered dreadfully and we must not forget that. The mass graves, more of which are found every day, are proof of this. I therefore believe that it will be very difficult for them to live together. Wounds heal extremely slowly. We in Central and Northern Europe know that too. I therefore believe that we must demand something, that they can contribute and that is, coexistence on the ground. And we must help them. These criminal acts must also be denounced by the Albanian leaders. We must help with the means at our disposal to find the perpetrators and convict them.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to prevent injustice and now some of those we have helped are turning out to be liars and are themselves driving out minorities. The Roma, Serbs, Croats and Bosnians, anyone in fact who might not speak this language, belongs to this group. I should not like the oppressed people to become oppressors themselves. We must therefore ensure that in the communities where there is persecution, even the reconstruction be suspended, so that every single citizen in this country takes responsibility himself and ensures that such criminal acts do not occur again. KFOR cannot be everywhere, it cannot stand behind everyone and so every decent Albanian – and there are more of them than we think – really must feel that they themselves are taking responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is also that the Albanian leaders or those people who think they are, are not really in a position jointly to build the future for this land, for their homeland, and so we must also appeal to them. I believe that we need an interim government – and more quickly than Mr Kouchner is able to establish one.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, at local level, we need really responsible people and if these people cannot be Albanians or Serbs where they are in the majority, then it must be someone from the international community so that we have a contact to talk to. Everywhere, where things are going well in the communities, we must react positively and say that we are helping you more than we help those who do nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Now – this is of course a difficult task which must be carried out by UNMIG – the problem is that this is something that is easier to solve on paper than in reality. But I am not of the opinion that we can do all of that merely by installing democracy. We must do that, but the first need is to create jobs, we must create infrastructure, so that the young people who are now going around with Kalashnikovs, can finally hold tools in their hands and do something for their country. Then we shall be on the right path and Mr Kouchner must also be a little more effective than he is at the moment, whoever may be hampering him in carrying out his task.</p>

We have for years ignored the oppression that went on for 10 years in Kosovo. Doris Pack and others did not do so, but a large majority did. We are ourselves to blame, at least those who held this attitude, for the fact that Rugova was frozen out, because he was left alone for 10 years with his non-violence. It is quite clear that in a desperate situation, in which hundreds of thousands of people were driven out by systematic state violence – and that is the big difference with the current isolated acts of revenge that are of course despicable – Rugova lost control of the forces.</p>
<p class="contents">We should for a start see clearly that condemning others can be a good thing, but it would also be a good thing to exercise some self-criticism: We have above all failed in this way. Of course we must send out a strong signal against any expulsions. I myself come from a family who – collectively innocent – on the basis of state decrees 50 years ago, were expelled. Any expulsion is an expulsion too many and this 20th century is likely to go down in history as the century of genocide and expulsions. We therefore have a duty to stop every expulsion, including those in Kosovo, and we have a duty to speak up so that the ban on expulsions and the right to a homeland become the foundations of international law, so that such dreadful events are not repeated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Posselt, you are right in your criticism. In this very House, Mrs Pack and many others including myself have for years pointed out what could happen in Kosovo if we continue to look on and thereby contribute to Rugova being frozen out.</p>
<p class="contents">When we were in Kosovo a short while ago – the President of this House and Mrs Pack -, we saw that where “ethnic cleansing” occurred, the situation is going fairly well. But where the ethnic groups meet, the conflicts are very acute and they have become more acute. It is unacceptable that if Serbs or Albanians need to go to hospital, they actually run a risk of being more injured once they get there than they would have been before they got to hospital. The language of the international community must be clear here. It is unacceptable that every Albanian who has a liberal, open attitude, like the former speaker of the delegation at Rambouillet, is threatened because he speaks out in favour of the Serbs, the Roma, the Sinti and other ethnic groups being accepted in his country.</p>
<p class="contents">As was already mentioned, it also has to do with the fact that we unfortunately have Albanian politicians in Kosovo who do not conduct policy that is geared to the future structure, but are working in a one-sided way according to which side they are on. It was the speaker of the delegation in Rambouillet who made a great impression on us when he said: “Ask an Albanian politician any minor date, any minor event in history and he will tell you a lot about it. If you ask him how the social security system of the future will be extended, you will not find anyone who can give you an answer”. So it is all the more important – and I should like to stress this – that UNMIK and Bernard Kouchner make rapid progress in setting up a government. The government must of course have contact with the population. It must work together with the population. But it must also examine very carefully who it is and then it must become clear and unambiguous that it is the UN that is also at stake along with its mandate and its authority and of course the European Union as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We must help the Albanian population to build a multi-ethnic society. That is the great task before us. The battle for freedom in Kosovo has not yet been won. There is still a lot to do!</p>

With great sadness, I say, since all we are doing today is observing the results of our on-going hypocrisy in the case of Kosovo, not to say our blindness and even cowardice. Hypocrisy, since we were well aware that in opting for warfare last spring, that is to say, turning our backs on balance, the only condition for peace between the parties involved in the conflict, we would inevitably be provoking the endless outbursts of violence which we are witnessing today. </p>
<p class="contents">By stirring up the entire planet in support of a gang of terrorists, the KLA, which was, unfortunately, supported for a long time by one of our Member States, since they had their headquarters in Frankfurt for years, we endorsed the reign of terror. We were well aware that our activism had nothing, indeed, to do with human rights, since it promoted chain reactions of terror, to the point where henceforth, we are not just the more or less compassionate witnesses to a new bout of ethnic cleansing. We Europeans, and the Kouchner mission in particular, are accomplices, not to mention, in the final analysis, the instigators.</p>
<p class="contents">Hypocrisy is compounded by blindness, for we have effectively confused the concepts of nationhood and ethnicity, the national principle and the ethnic principle. A nation, need one remind you, is the opposite of an ethnic grouping. We are sorry to have to be reminding you of these obvious facts, but Europe has lost sight of the national principle to the extent that it is necessary to keep repeating it. A nation goes beyond ethnic groupings, forming a pluralist body which erases the primary membership of a racial or family group, or at least relegates this to the private domain, in favour of a political structure, which for two centuries, and perhaps even for much more than two centuries, we in France have called the Republic. Let us destroy nations, and what the Yugoslav association may have become in time, especially if Europe had opened its arms to it earlier, let us destroy nations, and we will end up with nothing but the eruption of ethnic groups everywhere, not to say, gangs, with accounts being settled and, ultimately, war in Europe. Thus, by destroying nations, its own foundation, its own basic principle, its essential strength, Europe today is in the process of destroying itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Blindness, in turn, is compounded by cowardice. Because Europeans went into this war, as we well know, only out of weakness in its attitude to the United States, that is to say, to an empire which does not suffer any competition anywhere on the planet and which has undertaken to divide Europe in order to rule as master everywhere. This is one of the goals of the United States in this matter, and we have gone along with it out of weakness and cowardice.</p>
<p class="contents">So we can no longer do anything but look upon, Mrs Pack, the ruins which are only the initial results, alas, of a federal vision of the Europe which, starting with the proud foundation of Serbia, a country that so often distinguished itself valiantly in history, is slowly leading the peoples of Europe to disorder, discord and, I say again, war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People who support my government are welcome in Kosovo. Anyone who creates hassle should leave.” </p>
<p class="contents">This misplaced display of power, deserving of condemnation to say the least, follows in the footsteps of the execrable oppression regime adopted by Slobodan Milosevic. This political line is just as diametrically opposed to pacification, let alone a social renewal process, within the legendary battlefield of Kosovo Polje and its surrounding areas. In fact, Thaçi’s words are inviting the remaining members of the Serbian minority to leave if they have not done so already. Words which have been reinforced in the past couple of months by downright acts of terror, committed by the victims of yesterday, by Albanian Kosovars. </p>
<p class="contents">Significantly, Albanian journalist Veton Surroi sharply condemned this reprehensible attitude as being “organised and systematic terror which can only be described as fascist”. The minority Roma group too suffered badly under a pogrom-like Albanian attitude. I would like to make a special appeal for the Kosovar Roma, one of the oldest communities there. Today, it is collectively paying the price for being a so-called accomplice in the Milosevic regime. After all, Belgrade gave Kosovar Roma the jobs which it no longer gave to the Kosovar Albanians between 1989-1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, thorough, unbiased historical investigation should show to what extent the Albanian allegations of atrocities carried out by Kosovar Roma in respect of their Albanian fellow citizens are true. One thing is for sure, from both a Christian and general, moral perspective: crimes do not under any circumstance justify new crimes! </p>
<p class="contents">Well now, those have definitely taken place since the arrival of the UN and KFOR in Kosovo on 12 June. What is more, they were already occurring in the Macedonian refugee camps. The outcome was obvious: an estimated 20,000 Roma fled from Kosovo, most of whom ended up in refugee camps in neighbouring Montenegro and Macedonia. However, according to my sources, these camps will be closing by the end of the year. If this information is correct, what does the EU intend to do to help these displaced Kosovar Roma? </p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would also like to raise another pressing question. In Montenegro, large numbers of Kosovar Roma are falling into the hands of unscrupulous people smuggling refugees into Italy. What can the European Union, in close cooperation with the Montenegro authorities, do to stop this? </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it was recently stated in a report in the Chechen weekly “Tyden” on “the covert Roma exodus” from Kosovo that Roma do not give much thought to their future. Why should they? After all, they do not have one, not a dignified one that is, “wedged between Albanian terror in Kosovo, dislike and discrimination within other countries and dwindling humanitarian aid within the central Balkans”. All the more reason why the international community should now join forces to protect the Roma who are still in Kosovo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He still has to face trial on an old case of “spying”. It became clear a long time ago that he has the information in the Bellona report from sources that are accessible to the general public. However, his expert knowledge made it possible for us to be made aware of an enormous hazard that is heading for us and is slumbering in the Arctic Ocean. He acted with a great sense of humanity. The EU has a special responsibility here because until now it has used the material that Alexander Nikitin compiled. One of the essential components of the Northern dimension that was decided on in Helsinki is the issue of cleaning the Arctic Ocean and averting the danger that could affect us all. We must therefore intervene more forcefully here so that Alexander Nikitin can finally be released and so that the accusations are dropped, because we all know that these proceedings are purely political and therefore the laws in Russia will also be infringed by these proceedings, because the old nomenclature will win again.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Alexander Nikitin has acted with enormous consideration for others and with remarkable responsibility in making this material available to us. It is therefore necessary for the EU Mission in Moscow at least to observe this case, but also to intervene in the political dialogue, so that it is declared a political case and Alexander Nikitin can finally be released.

It would be a disgrace if we gave way, because – as Mrs Schroedter put it so well – Mr Nikitin also acted in our interests. We have often dealt with it here in the Parliament.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Chichester (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I rise on behalf of my group but also on behalf of my colleague Lord Bethell, who takes a particular concern and interest in this matter. The fate of Alexander Nikitin is particularly relevant to a topical and urgent debate. Next Tuesday he is due to appear in court in Russia. I believe this is the sixth time that he will appear in court. He is indicted on a charge of high treason, which is a very strong and extreme charge and for what? For addressing a matter of public interest, of environmental interest to the whole of Europe. Under this charge he faces a possible death sentence. This is an extreme sanction and this House and the European institutions should send a very powerful message to Russia that it should re-think this issue, the charges should be dropped and it should respect our call for his immediate release.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the earlier debate on ending the death penalty, it is very relevant that we should call upon the Russian authorities to respect our views, the views of Europe, as to whether he should be indicted and what the sanction should be. So I very much support the calls for Mr Nikitin to be immediately released and found not guilty of the charges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> I shall answer briefly the three points which have been raised: capital punishment, the minorities in Kosovo and the Nikitin case.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards the matter of capital punishment, I would like to devote a few words not to the substance of the question, which you deal with in your draft resolution and which, plainly, meets with the approval of the Commission as far as the position adopted on capital punishment is concerned. This does not, I feel, merit extensive comment, as we are in agreement on this point. What I wish to bring up is a specific point which was mentioned in the course of the discussion, i.e. the matter of the draft resolution on capital punishment which the Union proposed to the Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, in fact, a matter of foreign policy. By means of this resolution, the European Union was proposing to the international community that it undertake to establish a moratorium on capital punishment. Indeed, as far as we are concerned, the abolition of capital punishment is an intrinsic part of our human rights policy, whereas for many countries this is exclusively a matter of criminal law, or so they claim, at least.</p>
<p class="contents">We did indeed withdraw this draft resolution, on mature reflection, and this decision is presented for your evaluation. We withdrew it because the debates in this Third Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations were, in our opinion, going badly. In fact, we felt that some of the many amendments submitted by the countries for whom our position is a problem are, in our view, unacceptable, particularly the amendment to introduce into the resolution a reference to article 2, paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter, in the terms of which, “Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorise the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.” This amendment was indeed inconvenient, insofar as it shifted the debate into another sphere, that of the national jurisdiction of a state. As far as we were concerned, the inclusion in the resolution of a reference specific to the principle of sovereignty of states would have entailed a risk of challenging the body of legislation in the system of the United Nations, and, in particular, of the World Conference of 1993, which said that the promotion and protection of human rights was a “legitimate concern” of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, accepting an amendment of this kind could have had a very negative impact on the work of the United Nations in the human rights field. It was not therefore, as I have heard, in order to yield to some sort of pressure that we preferred to close the debate in this way, at least for the time being, but rather in order to maintain a position of principle. You must not, therefore, see this decision as indicative of a lack of a foreign policy, or that we caved under pressure, but of the Union’s assessment of the risk, considering the proposed amendments, of finding ourselves, for the sake of the legitimate campaign we share, some way behind the positions we have gained earlier. This is the explanation I wished to give you.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now come to the second subject, Mr President, regarding the rights of the Serbs and other minorities in Kosovo. I believe that the Commission and, with it, the entire European Union has made it clear, from the start, that we condemn any sort of ethnic violence, regardless of who is inflicting and who is suffering it. Such violence is just as unacceptable today against the Serbian and Gypsy minorities as it was when it was inflicted upon the Kosovars several months before. Thanks to programmes of assistance in democratisation and human rights, the Commission continues to provide support for measures intended to re-establish confidence and to promote dialogue between the different communities. We were already active in this way, without much success, unfortunately, even before the conflict, and I share, from this point of view, the suggestions that some of you made that we must all meticulously take stock of the situation. From now on, in the new circumstances, we are nonetheless trying pragmatically to continue to act according to these objectives, particular in selecting aid and assistance projects.</p>
<p class="contents">We support fully and absolutely the action undertaken by KFOR to maintain law and order in Kosovo and to protect all the citizens. In addition, we support fully and absolutely the action undertaken by MINUK in order to set up an operational civil administration, capable of taking on the police functions which are currently handled by KFOR, and to create a peaceful multi-ethnic society, capable of taking on both the reconstruction of Kosovo and the restoration of its society. MINUK approached the Commission with regard to the financing of the Kosovo protection force and the Member States shall take a decision, in the weeks to come, regarding the programme we suggested in response to this request. We are also offering our support, in the form of twinning, to the actions agreed by MINUK at local administration level. In this context, we are asking all people of goodwill in Kosovo and outside, to also work towards these objectives in order to help us to ensure that MINUK and KFOR achieve them themselves. I may remind you, if you need reminding, that we are opposed to Kosovo being partitioned. It must become a multi-ethnic society, without distinctions or discrimination for ethnic or other reasons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">And if I may switch to English for convenience without breaching the rules of this House, I will answer that the European Commission has been following very closely and with a great degree of concern Alexander Nikitin's trial. Representatives of EU Member States attended the court session in St Petersburg in October 1998 and were present when the Supreme Court delivered its latest decision in February 1999 to send back the case to the lower court for further investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with previous statements, the European Commission has made it clear that any further judicial proceedings regarding the contribution made by Mr Nikitin to the Bellona report should be in full conformity with internationally agreed principles and standards of justice and human rights. I am aware that Mr Nikitin's lawyers have lodged an application to the European Court of Human Rights and I am certain the Council of Europe's institutions will pursue this application accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">While respecting the judicial procedures of a sovereign country, the European Commission will remain vigilant to ensure that Mr Nikitin is granted an impartial and public trial based on the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Russian Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
