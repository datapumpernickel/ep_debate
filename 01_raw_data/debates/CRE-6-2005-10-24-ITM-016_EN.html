<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ján Figeľ, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. </span> Mr President, I should like to express my gratitude to the author of this report on Culture 2007, Mr Graça Moura, for his excellent work and for the sound cooperation between our two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that the general line proposed by the Commission has been welcomed by Parliament and that the draft report agrees with the main objectives of our proposal. This focus on objectives will enable the programme to deliver more European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Although support for the projects is clearly a key component of the programme, the draft report also approves the Commission’s proposal to go beyond the mere ‘project approach’ and support organisations, studies and the collection and dissemination of information in the field of cultural cooperation. As you know, the Commission proposal does not mention any sector specifically. Our intention is to cover all fields of artistic and cultural life without any prejudice and to promote cross-sectoral activities.</p>
<p class="contents">On the budget, I am very grateful that this programme has received a great deal of political support in the House, from both committees and groups, and I am glad to see that you propose even stronger financial backing for this cooperation. I agree that the increase to EUR 600 million proposed by Parliament would make it easier for the programme to attain its objectives and to reach a critical mass, but the Commission cannot amend its original proposal; we are waiting for the agreement on the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to say that the Commission is able to accept either word-for-word or in substance some of the other amendments contained in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can agree with the transfer the memorial action from the culture programme to the citizenship programme and will confirm that in a specific declaration. It is important to continue to support this action. I also agree with the proposal to extend this action to the victims of Stalinist regimes.</p>
<p class="contents">On translation, as I said in my introduction, no sector is specifically mentioned. However, we understand Parliament’s request to include a reference to literary translation in the annex to the decision in order to take into account the specific conditions in this field of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you very rightly stressed the importance of our European cultural heritage. That heritage needs to be understood in a broader sense so as to include the values and the ways of life that have defined our identities. We fully understand that concern. Indeed the preservation of cultural heritage is one of the aims of Article 151 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this article, we succeeded last week in promoting cultural diversity in UNESCO through a special convention on this matter. That could be achieved in this programme by including appropriate references in the recitals to the decision. However, we cannot accept cultural heritage being mentioned as a specific objective of the programme, as this would clearly run counter to the non-sectoral, ‘open to all sectors’ approach of the original proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other amendments that the Commission is not prepared to accept. I will mention just a few of them, because they concern the question of access for small operators or small projects. For the Commission, it is essential to strike the right balance between small and large projects and between long-term and short- or medium-term projects. Therefore, the Commission cannot agree with the proposed lowering of the minimum level of grants for cooperation measures for shorter projects from EUR 60 000 to EUR 30 000, because this would lead to an avalanche of project proposals, which could not be co-funded owing to a lack of resources. Already the refusal rate is 70% to 75%. If such an amendment were adopted, it would be even higher. The Commission also disagrees with the proposal to increase the maximum level of Community cofinancing to 70%. We must not forget that our cultural policy is governed by the principles of complementarity and subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission cannot accept the proposal to decrease the minimum number of partners from four to three for shorter duration projects and to decrease the number of countries from six to four for longer duration projects. Should the number of partners or countries be lowered, it would diminish the visibility of the programme in an enlarged Europe. In spite of that, I hope that the excellent climate of cooperation that has characterised relations between our institutions up to now will continue to help find a mutually satisfying compromise. That is all the more necessary because the new programme should be adopted in time to allow for a timely and smooth implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I very much hope that the next meeting of the Ministers for Culture in November will be in a position to reach a political agreement, leaving aside all budget-related matters. I would like to stress once more the benefits expected from this new culture programme. The programme will actively contribute to the promotion of inter-cultural dialogue, raising awareness of a common European heritage, celebrating the richness and diversity of our cultures, and increasing openness to other cultures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vasco Graça Moura (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> We see ourselves as Europeans, in spite of all our differences. This is down to European culture, which encompasses the shared, dynamic heritage formed by our specific characteristics and our linguistic diversity, elements that come together to form a complex tapestry in which the Greco-Latin, Judeo-Christian and Mediterranean-Muslim traditions are all brought to the fore, whilst ensuring that none of those traditions is able to dominate.</p>
<p class="contents">Culture should be high on the agenda of promoting the European project, with a view to reviving our common heritage, while encouraging diversity, in such a way that a balance can be struck between the centralising and decentralising tendencies. In order words, we must take measures that acknowledge the value of our common heritage and must enable the 400 million-plus citizens of the Union to find out more about each other within their specific cultural and linguistic identities.</p>
<p class="contents">It would clearly be wrong to speak of European cultural integration. One of the most fascinating aspects of our civilisation lies precisely in the idea of Europe accepting itself both as a common entity and as an entity formed and characterised by an openness to its fellow human beings and to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Culture 2007-2013 should, first and foremost, be a framework programme, not for integration, but for increased cultural communication between the citizens of Europe, and should be effected on a Europe-wide scale and built on the foundations of its values. Accordingly, European culture policy must always concentrate on providing a European added value. Otherwise, it will cease to have any meaning and will become indistinguishable from national policy on culture. What is more, cooperation is crucial between the European institutions, the Member States, the cultural players and participants from all Member States, as well as their transnational networks. The purpose of this is to make common cultural policy a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2007-2013 ‘Culture’ programme is a third generation programme. It takes on board the experience of the previous ones and seeks to adopt the most appropriate solutions on the basis of that experience.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that, personally, I would have preferred it to have been formed along the lines of the first generation – Raphael, Ariane and Kaleidoscope – with the areas of art, literature, the performing arts and cultural heritage properly marked out. Resources are scarce, yet the number of applications for aid continues to grow. In order for policy to be effective, it must be focused on a small number of clear, well-defined objectives, even if that means some projects falling by the wayside. In any event, let us hope that the new system leads to a more proactive contribution to culture.</p>
<p class="contents">We have sought to improve upon the Commission’s proposal, by making a number of changes to it, so as to adapt it more effectively to the proposed aims, to frame the cultural dimension more clearly and to place the accent on the importance of our common cultural heritage, without undermining contemporary creativity.</p>
<p class="contents">With the greatest respect, Mr Figel, I must say that it does not look good for the Commission to reject explicit reference to an aspect relating to cultural heritage, which is an enormous, living, breathing phenomenon, is manifested both tangibly and intangibly, has been accumulated over the centuries and has helped so much to define us as Europeans. This aspect does not simply boil down to sectoral concerns; what we are talking about is a shared matrix, a common dimension across all sectors, and this is of central importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we feel that the provisions on preserving European memorials to the terrible memories of totalitarian violence, both Nazi and Stalinist, would be better placed under the heading of ‘Education for Citizenship’. This idea was formally set down in the minutes of the Committee, as was its acceptance by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I must refer to a most worrying point, namely the budget. The figures in the Böge report are merely indicative, yet they were taken into consideration. Whereas in his report the amount earmarked for this programme was EUR 566 million, we have earmarked EUR 600 million, because the Böge report itself provided for a reserve fund enabling us to do this. This is a paltry amount! All those working for the European institutions – the Members of the Commission, including its President and Commissioner for Culture, the Members of Parliament, including the chairmen of the parliamentary groups, and countless other Members, and Members of the Council, including practically every Culture Minister – have long been calling for substantially increased funding in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union now has 25 Member States, rather than 15, hence the need for the European unit to be increasingly proactive in the area of culture. The Lisbon agenda will be no more than empty words if European cultural policy collapses without achieving its objectives on common cultural heritage and linguistic and cultural diversity within the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There cannot be a Lisbon agenda unless we find out more about one another, in terms of our range of historical, cultural and linguistic identities. Failure to do this will render us incapable of cooperating properly with one another on our common goals. Such cooperation will only be possible if we pursue cultural policy that is focused on providing a European added value and is equipped with the necessary resources for that to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call for this report, which I had the honour of drafting, to be adopted. I also propose that we adopt all of the useful contributions made by Members of all political hues in the Committee on Culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am certain that he had invested a considerable amount of time in it.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation is an irreversible fact. As a result, cultural supply and the system of relationships between people and other nations have expanded to an incredible extent. National particularities are relaxed in some areas, and as a result of the interaction between cultures, national identity has acquired a new significance. The new circumstances cast a different light on national and common European identity. In this context I would like to stress that in a globalised world culture is one of the most important means of strengthening, deepening and promoting common European identity, while preserving the multicultural diversity of nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The evaluation conducted by the Committee, based on extensive consultation, pointed out that rationalisation and strengthening are a requirement in this area of community activities, as well. It is important to stress that in order to achieve effective results and avoid unnecessary duplication, community activities must be closely interconnected in the areas of culture and education, youth, sport, research and discrimination. Community activities must supplement one another and must be harmonised. In order to achieve higher efficiency, the extent of cooperation between Member States and regional programmes should be increased as much as possible. I trust that the proposed programme may contribute to a better coordination of community activities, focusing on the benefits provided by added European value.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasise that the role of cultural foreign policy has acquired a new significance, and its objective is to facilitate the creation of nation states with higher levels of culture, standards, education and democracy. This would result in a community of European states that is fully able to renew itself, with a strong sense of self-knowledge and self-esteem.

One of the most important steps we could take towards this goal would be to identify the protection of cultural heritage of European significance as one of the fundamental goals of the Culture 2007 programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s draft fails to offer clear support for projects relating to the European tradition or to the common roots that are an integral part of the identity of contemporary Europe. After all, it was the culture of our continent, that was centuries in the making, which shaped European identity, and continues to do so today. This culture also encourages the recognition of our common heritage and civilisation, as noted by John Paul II during a speech before the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Association of European Capitals of Culture, I have had first-hand experience of the enthusiasm generated by the European Capital of Culture initiatives among the people of our continent. Such initiatives allow millions of citizens to participate in artistic, informative and instructive projects of enormous educational merit. This effort on the part of artists and cultural operators gives us good reason to be proud of the wealth of talent and the diversity of artistic inspiration founded on the achievements of our European tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget that Europe was divided for 50 years. The aim of this programme should be to raise awareness of the culture of the nations of Central and Eastern Europe across Western Europe. This culture, including those aspects of it inspired by Christian values, was stifled by Communist totalitarianism. In my opinion, the proposal to change the minimum budget for projects eligible for support is therefore very much to be welcomed, and this is a point upon which I disagree with the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Reducing the minimum project budget from EUR 60 000 to EUR 30 000 per year would increase the number of cultural operators able to participate in the programme. This would be a significant change, particularly in the new Member States, where such operators face much greater problems in financial terms than operators in the old Member States. There is every justification for allowing a larger number of entities to benefit from the proposed funding, provided that they meet the programme’s substantive objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such a European cultural policy could well help to bring together the needs of the cultural world and those of the public, thereby addressing the soul of Europe as nothing else can, and with it, people’s hearts, for it is with their hearts, more than with their minds, that people will be prepared to vote ‘yes’ in a referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">We take the view – although I note that the Commission does not – that the cultural actions should be biased towards the starting-up of small and medium-sized projects, for it is these that can help to make visible the cultural riches of the European Union’s individual regions and promote real public awareness of them. I hope that I will, for a change, find more sympathy for this idea from the Council than from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">While ministers of culture, and even the President of the Commission, are wont to make pious utterances stressing the significance of culture, and to sing its praises as an agent of integration, cohesion and citizenship, they should also ensure that sufficient funding is available for it. Even with what we propose to add to it, the programme really is not adequately fitted out. I very much hope that pious sentiments will be backed up by actions! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like quickly to go back over four points, which seem to me to be important and which I defended within the Committee on Culture and Education on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards the horizontal aspect of the programme, it must be noted that the Commission’s proposal reflects good intentions, which are along the right lines. No one need oppose strengthening the coherence of the programme in order to put a stop to the fragmentation, which for so long has characterised the EU’s action with regard to culture.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are the intentions, on the one hand, and the resources proposed, on the other. I therefore come to my second point: the matter of the budget. It is no use the European Union setting ambitious objectives, such as promoting cultural diversity and cultural cooperation, if the budget available is not adjusted. We have therefore called for a logical increase in the budget allocated to this programme so that it can fulfil the task assigned to culture, namely that of contributing to the development of a European culture and a European identity, both of which will enable countries to put a stop to their excessive national self-interest and, consequently, to come out of the crisis that the EU is currently going through.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the commemoration sites. We have called for a clear distinction to be made between cultural organisations and the sites, not because we believed that these sites are not important, quite the opposite. As such, we would hope that the Commission will guarantee that the budget for the ‘citizenship’ programme, in which we have asked for the sites to be included, is increased accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and this will be my final point – I was keen that the cultural industries, which provide so many jobs, should be mentioned in the recitals for this programme. This was particularly the case for Amendments 7, 11 and 13, adopted by the Committee on Culture and Education. A recent study by Eurostat showed that the cultural industry contributed significantly to the European economy. With this in mind, it would be desirable to carry out a study highlighting the importance of these industries for the European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is balanced, consistent and demanding. It attaches great importance to the content of the proposals, it prioritises cultural diversity and it is committed to the development of European citizenship. I thank Mr Graça Moura for his listening skills and for the quality of the dialogue that we have been able to establish.</p>
<p class="contents">I too am particularly delighted that it was possible for the cultural industries to be recognised in a recital of this report. I personally took a tough stand in calling for them to be included in this programme, and even if this result still falls far short of the mark, the progress made is by no means insignificant and deserves to be pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">I will continue to defend the position whereby the cultural industries contribute to promoting European culture: they generate employment and give economic added value to the cultural sector. There is even less reason to neglect the cultural industries inasmuch as they are the ideal vehicle for developing European culture and for underpinning its diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, unfortunately, a fly in this particular ointment. None of my colleagues in the Committee on Culture and Education will dispute the fact, because if there is, in truth, one point on which we are unanimously in agreement, it is that of the budget. I deplore the fact that culture should still be considered by the Commission as a luxury, secondary to the most crucial requirements. Is it really the case that culture is nothing but a luxury and that it is only secondary to the most crucial requirements? Violence exists; it is aimed at destroying culture. One form of violence is to argue that culture is pointless. I am therefore profoundly shocked by the meagre sum in the budget package allocated to culture. However, there remains a glimmer of hope in my opinion, Commissioner. The Unesco Convention, which has just been approved by a huge majority a few days ago, is a great victory for Europe and demonstrates once again that, when Europe is united, it is strong. It is also a great victory for European culture. With its diversity finally recognised, it now remains for Europe to assert itself on the international stage. However, it will only be able to pursue its role of ambassador if you give it the financial resources to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by simply saying to you, Commissioner, that it is up to you to act in order to obtain a decent and respectable budget for culture, one that does not remain below 1% of the overall budget.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, we allocate EUR 35 million to the overall European cultural budget, and that, being equivalent to the amount received by a major theatre in Germany, is a shameful figure.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the Wall has come down and we have 25 Member States, we really want Europeans to encounter each other anew; we really want cultural exchange and more information; we want Western and Eastern Europe to have a real opportunity to establish contact with each other, but the present budget makes that impossible. The reason why my group has raised the figures that the Commission proposed or that have now emerged from the Committee was that we need 10 times as much as we have at present. We now get no more than 7 cents, but we need 70 cents. With them, we would have a real chance of getting a cultural offensive for Europe moving.</p>
<p class="contents">I can go along with the Commission’s basic approach, and its three great goals of transnational mobility, transnational exchange of cultural values and inter-cultural dialogue, for all of these tie in very well, not only with the fostering of contemporary culture, but also with the management of cultural heritage. I cannot agree to Mr Graça Moura’s proposal, in his additional amendment, for a fourth objective, for an exclusive emphasis on heritage upsets the good balance that we have worked to achieve between contemporary art and heritage management. It is for that reason that we shall not be supporting that additional amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to see that the narrowly sectoral approach has been done away with, and that there is a real desire for real interdisciplinary cooperation with our cultural projects. I, too, take the view that smaller projects should be given more opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first plus point of the Graça Moura report is that it distances itself from this view that cultural creations can be used for the purposes of political promotion.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the only plus point, in fact. The Commission and the Council want maximum visibility with minimum resources, and therefore channel aid into a few actions, bodies and initiatives. This is a bad move. In the name of visibility, there has been a shortfall in Europe of so many projects that rely on it. This is a further trend that the report seeks to rectify, on its own terms. It supports projects up to two years, simplifies procedures for obtaining financial support, makes a commitment to transparency in application processes and places value on heritage and linguistic diversity in the programme’s objectives. These are more than enough reasons to vote in favour of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The British Presidency continues to block the financial perspective. As we know, Mr Blair has his priorities elsewhere, but I feel that everyone present is agreed on one point; the proposal of EUR 600 million is the rock-bottom minimum if the Union wishes to present itself to cultural creators and producers as an institution that still gives some value to the words it says. I would like to think that the men and women of the Committee on Culture and Education will be up to the task of assessing the final proposal from the perspective of that value.

My criticisms are not, of course, directed at his report, but instead concern the mindset with which the matter of culture is addressed by the Council and by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Constitution would have given us the foundation for tackling a common cultural policy, based on the diversity of cultures and on mutual acceptance of the principles of freedom and of human rights. However, the Constitution did not go so far as to grant culture the status of a real Community policy, which was an argument for not voting in favour of it. The objective that should be achieved by increasing our knowledge of others is precisely the objective sought by all of our countries. Doing away with the fear of others is a prerequisite for attaining a life led in peace in a society of genuine cultural pluralism. Learning about differences: that is the objective of a common cultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the Commission’s objectives, the mobility of persons leads me once again, Commissioner – and I am well aware that you yourself are not the person with responsibility – to ask the following question: where, in all of this, is the work of the Council on problems related to social security, taxation and status, which prevent people from being truly mobile, not to mention its work on the lack of financial resources to support real exchanges between the new Member States and the old ones?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has held on to intercultural dialogue as an objective. It was high time this problem was highlighted. Greater synergy between education and culture was the subject of one of the amendments tabled by our Parliamentary committee. Greater synergy is necessary, and all the more so given that, since 1998, and under the UK Presidency, employability – a terrible term – has been part of European texts as a principle for education.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a mistake to think that greater emphasis on culture in school curricula would be a waste of time. Creativity and a lively mind are qualities that are acquired through an appreciation of the arts, just as a culture of tolerance and the prevention of violence are founded on respect for artistic feeling and on the cultivation of the senses. As from now, the budget for 2006 has been revised downwards, to EUR 36 million instead of EUR 38 million. I note that, despite the fine speeches made by Mr Barroso and by all the group leaders in front of a small number of active contributors to the cultural sector, their words are not about to be followed up by actions.

It sets a series of important objectives, such as the cross-border mobility of cultural agencies in Europe, the transnational movement of artists and cultural works and cultural dialogue, objectives which cannot be implemented satisfactorily by the Member States due to their transnational character. However, we must not forget that the programme is also the means for financing these objectives. We cannot therefore set objectives for culture without at the same time proposing what the financial resources will be with which we shall achieve them. Consequently we, as the European Parliament, must propose a specific amount in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when we talk about the objectives of the programme, we must emphasise that the maintenance and knowledge of cultural heritage must be expressly included in the objectives of this programme. Among these plans, prime position must continue to be given to actions which aim to rescue the architectural heritage of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point which we must also keep an eye on is facilitating the participation of small agencies in the programme, which is often difficult.</p>

Therefore, it is very important to promote creativity and more attention must be devoted to this in the cultural programme. I disagree with the European Commission's opinion that the more participants in the cultural programme, the more visible it is. This is a grandiose view, whereas we must look towards cultural originality. This originality is certainly not achieved through the number of operators, and this should not be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect, which is relevant to the promotion of culture and creativity, is namely the multilateral exchange process.

<p class="contents">I would like to refer specifically to the budget problems for the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages, whose main goal is to maintain real language diversity in the European Union. According to the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, each linguistic community has the right to maintain and develop its own language and pass it on to future generations. In the European Union we have official languages, minority languages and languages like Catalan that, being majority languages in their own country, are not in the first or second groups. The EU has to provide support for all these languages and for linguistic diversity in Europe. That means a budget is needed for minority languages and for the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages. I know that is against the Jacobinist language policy that is practised in some European states, but the EU will work to promote diversity, democracy and freedom and to maintain real equality between languages in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The ‘Culture 2007’ report that is presently before Parliament, after being accepted at the cultural commission, has lost all the amendments referring to the preservation of the memory of the crimes of Stalinism.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of total number of deaths, Stalinism was no less tragic than Nazism. Mass deportation and concentration camps were part of the arsenal of both regimes. In my homeland, Estonia, nearly 10% of the population was deported and killed under the leadership of Stalin. Elderly people and children represented more than half of the number of those deported. Even pregnant women were shown no mercy.</p>
<p class="contents">Stalinism and Nazism are two sides of the same ideology. They were conceived together. They divided Europe through the Hitler-Stalin pact. After the expansion of the European Union, we cannot avoid passing judgment on the crimes of Stalinism, which were mainly committed in Eastern Europe. That judgment alone symbolises that we are members of one European family.</p>
<p class="contents">The bearers of a misanthropic ideology remain a threat to us. Their face changes as necessary, but inside, Neo-Nazis, national Bolsheviks, neo-Stalinists and so on are nevertheless brothers in arms. In the name of Europe, we must not let the crimes of Nazism or Stalinism be forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cultural Commission agreed to transfer the preservation of the memory of Nazism and Stalinism to the ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme. It is no secret that the ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme received even less funding than ‘Culture 2007’. Therefore, I would like to receive public and clear confirmation from Commissioner Figel’ that transferring the commemoration of the victims of terror to the ‘Citizens for Europe’ programme will result in the additional funding and attention that it deserves.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It demonstrates the importance that the European Union attaches to the citizens, adopting a programme aimed at improving the dissemination of the culture and history of all of the peoples of Europe, at conserving and protecting the cultural heritage of the Union and promoting artistic, literary and audiovisual creativity.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme, furthermore, is essential for facing the challenge of enlargement and also in terms of developing an awareness of European citizenship, because only through the dissemination of our common cultural values can we illustrate the different foundations of our European identity. But this programme will also be open to many countries that are not Members of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Given, therefore, the programme’s very ambitious objectives, we must have a budget to match. In this regard, I believe that the needs defined by the European Cultural Foundation in July 2004, calling for an annual budget of EUR 315 million, quite reasonably pointed to the need for a more generous budget. I therefore support the rapporteur’s call for a budget greater than the EUR 408 million proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by expressing my satisfaction at the adoption of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions; my satisfaction at its approval, but above all at the fact that the European Union has spoken with one voice and has demonstrated, once again, that when it acts together it achieves results.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me, Mr President, to call on the Member States to ratify this instrument, and the sooner the better, since it represents significant progress in the recognition of cultural and linguistic diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was clear to all how important this was in telling us all the things we could do with 70 cents and how much we ended up being left with.</p>
<p class="contents">I must now join the ranks of those who keep coming back to money, but it is a fact that we cannot implement the demanding cultural programme with the budget that is available to us. The cultural programme as set out in the report ranges from the preservation of the cultural heritage to contemporary cultural events; it makes reference to linguistic diversity and to minority languages, and I believe that this is where there is a need for realistic thinking, for the allocation of realistic sums of money and for priorities to be set or, in the budget, to allow realism to take a back seat to vision and to be realistic about implementing the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">While I agree with the honourable Member who said that it was essential to defend our cultural heritage, I do think we are very attached to contemporary art and must therefore attempt to find common ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ján Figeľ, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(SK)</span> Thank you very much for your numerous expressions of encouragement and for your statements advocating European cultural cooperation. Let me remind you that only a few years ago, and certainly before Maastricht, many would have said that this is not an agenda for Parliament, the Union or the Commission. More, much more is needed today. There is also greater political will for this kind of cooperation, and I am confident that it will bear fruit, because it is necessary. The first reason for this is globalisation, and the risk it brings of losing our identity. The second is European integration itself, which does not mean the integration or harmonisation of cultures, but the shaping of a community of cultures, where diversity is an asset and where unity is based on common values.</p>
<p class="contents">Never before have themes and phenomena like identity, citizenship and culture been so intensively discussed and elaborated on in European institutions. I see this as a sign of the times, a signal that we are moving from the very basic post-war, coal-and-steel agenda to more demanding themes that call for greater maturity.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding some of the suggestions concerning culture, for example those of Mr Bono and others, I think that the new reasoning within the proposal defines the space for the culture industry very well. As for little and large, we already have a high rate of rejection: 70-75%. This means that further fragmentation will not result in a higher success rate, but we do want to achieve higher rates in the case of bilateral and trilateral dimensions and projects. My preference would be to give very strong support to Member States, to help them generate so-called matching funds, or financing that is complementary to European funds, which would help small or medium-sized operators in the cultural space. And, I repeat, the main responsibility for cultural policy lies with the Member States. We are willing and able to support and complement this, but not to replace it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges’ remarks about using taxation and social insurance to promote the mobility of artists belong to the culture ministers’ agenda. Their next meeting is scheduled for November. I am convinced that it is in the wider interests of everyone, not just ministers, but also all players in the field of culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Joan i Marí, I recently met with the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages (EBLUL). The EBLUL has enlarged its membership to 19 states, and I believe has a chance to develop its relationship with the European Union. May I remind you of the integrated lifelong learning programme that we discussed a few moments ago, which represents a new chance for the development of minority and regional languages. Today, we have many more official languages, and there is naturally more room for linguistic diversity. This is a value that calls for further investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Mikko, Stalinist gulags will be included among our commemorative events. History is the teacher of life, but it is important that individual Member States also take steps to promote historical awareness. We should not expect the Union to take over a basic responsibility of the Member States – to remember their history and to promote an understanding of it in cooperation with their neighbours and with the entire European Union. I want to assure you that adequate attention and financing will be provided to this end, despite or perhaps because of the shift to the citizenship programme, since this is more a matter of civic maturity than of culture alone. In this context we have also financed special events such as the anniversary of Solidarity in Poland. There will also be other reasons. I am convinced that this can provide an impetus for such commemorations.</p>
<p class="contents">These were the main points I deemed it necessary to comment on. I am also very grateful to you for supporting 70 instead of 7. On the one hand, the Commission welcomes it, and on the other hand, it is necessary that the Member States come to perceive culture as an integral component of European cooperation, because culture enables a better understanding of the present and future of a united Europe. A united Europe is much more about culture than about trade or geography. It is about the values that culture embodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
