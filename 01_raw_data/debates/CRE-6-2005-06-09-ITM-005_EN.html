<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joe Borg,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, let me express the Commission's any my personal satisfaction with the method and the quality of the work done to tackle the challenge of developing adequate management measures for our Mediterranean fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">It could not be taken for granted that the deadlock on this matter during the term of the previous European Parliament could be overcome. The proactive attitude of this Parliament, along with a general awareness of the state of fisheries resources and marine ecosystems in the Mediterranean, has contributed to the achievement of a sound compromise. Members of the European Parliament have shown their ability to listen to the spectrum of views that have been voiced on this important question. Parliament's opinion, which I hope will be adopted today, is a good starting point for the work to be carried out in the Council and I hope that the European institutions will be able to deliver the new regulation shortly, in the interests of our fishermen and of fisheries and the marine environment of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very pleased with the close cooperation of the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, and the members of the Committee on Fisheries during our work on this important proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to be able to inform you that we can accept 22 of the 34 amendments tabled by the Committee on Fisheries and other Members. Nine amendments of the 22 accepted, and in particular Amendments 2, 10, 11, 13, 20, 21, 22, 25 and 26 were part of a compromise package agreed with the rapporteur and approved by the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise is not perfect in all details. Nonetheless a delicate balance of quite different views has been achieved without compromising the effectiveness of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the other amendments tabled to the report before us. The Commission can also accept Amendments 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23 and 24, which introduce new elements that either reinforce our proposal or make the timing of the introduction of certain measures more gradual. The Commission cannot, however, accept Amendments 1, 3, 4, 19, and 27 to 34.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the concept of responsibility of nationals of Member States is already enshrined in the basic regulation for the common fisheries policy and should be maintained here. Amendments 1, 3 and 4 cannot therefore be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to Amendments 19 and 33, which ask for the insertion of provisions for financial support for temporary fishing bans and for fishermen affected by the prohibition of certain fishing gear, the Commission believes that these proposals are not appropriate here, either because there are already rules on these matters under Community legislation and/or because these issues are to be dealt with in the framework of the European fisheries fund proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment 27, which could dilute the significance of setting a minimum landing size for the species covered by the proposed regulation. In the absence of a minimum size, there would not be any incentive for fishermen to avoid the areas of aggregation of juveniles or undersized organisms or to improve selectivity as regards fishing gear and practices. Moreover, the common market for fisheries products calls for a harmonised minimum size.</p>
<p class="contents">A strict correspondence between minimum size and selectivity of prescribed equipment is rarely possible, particularly in multi-species, multi-gear fisheries, as is the case in the Mediterranean. Moreover, some minimum landing sizes are set for species caught, mainly with fishing gear and practices that are not regulated in this proposal and where selectivity is essentially left to the fishermen themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Amendment 28 is concerned, the same is not clear. The deletion of paragraph 3 would mean that whitebait fisheries would be completely forbidden. The Commission's aim is instead to keep them within a clear regulatory framework of national management plans. The Commission cannot therefore accept this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment 29, because a 30% increase in the height of the nets would increase fishing effort for small pelagic species, against scientific advice that calls for no increase in the fishing effort targeting this resource. Moreover, since purse seines may be used to catch demersal species in coastal areas, we should avoid authorising large purse seines that could touch the bottom in coastal areas where protected habitats, such as Posidonia beds, occur.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is however open to regulating this type of fishing gear by differentiating between purse seine fisheries for small pelagic species, demersal species and tuna. Each category should follow different rules. I hope that further refinement will be possible within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendments 30 and 31. It is widely recognised that management of fishing effort should be one of the main management tools in the Mediterranean. Establishing the maximum overall dimensions for certain small-scale fishing gear is a way to address this.</p>
<p class="contents">The huge number of fishermen using this gear makes it indispensable to set maximum dimensions to avoid further increases in size which would result in insuperable walls of nets that impede free movement and migration for several species. Small-scale fishermen should also contribute to conservation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendments 32 and 34 for different reasons. The list of species in Annex VIII to Council Regulation 1039/98 requested by Amendment 32 contains species which are either not present in the Mediterranean or which can be caught by bottom-set nets and anchored floating nets in coastal areas. It is therefore undesirable to include the full list of species here. In fact the rationale of Article 7(2) as mentioned in Amendment 10 is to list a group of species which are caught offshore in midwater, or close to the surface of very deep waters and which, when they occur in the catch of a bottom-set gillnet or entangling net, are clear signals that such a net is a drift net rather than a bottom-set net. This provision is the only way to enforce the large pelagic drift net ban. Nonetheless, the Commission is open to a large list of species if there is evidence that certain species cannot be caught by real bottom-set nets but only by drift nets.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 34 suggesting a derogation for vessels smaller than 18 metres would gravely weaken the enforcement of the large pelagic drift nets ban. This amendment is based on the assumption that Article 7(2) addresses a type of surface gillnet targeting tuna. This assumption is not correct, since such nets cannot be classified as an anchored floating net or bottom-set net as defined in Article 2(9) and (12) respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, may I express the confidence that, with the help of the European Parliament, we can put before the Council an improved Commission proposal, which should facilitate its position vis-à-vis the Council. All Mediterranean fishermen and the marine ecosystems that they exploit need urgent and effective fisheries management. The adoption of a new, more effective and specially tailored European Union conservation policy for Mediterranean fisheries will also foster more ambitious steps within the multilateral framework of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are well aware, fishing effort has been increasing in many areas and the exploitation pattern is still not satisfactory. In order to guide Mediterranean fisheries towards sustainable exploitation of the Mediterranean marine ecosystem, the European Union, which is the biggest fishing power in the region, needs to set a good and credible example.</p>
<p class="contents">A more effective Community management framework is needed to recover the full production and productivity potential of the Mediterranean in the interests first of all of our fishermen and also of other European citizens that want to benefit from the richness of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">In concluding my speech, may I once again thank the rapporteur, as well as the chairman and members of the Committee on Fisheries, for their excellent cooperation on this matter. Their proactive cooperation has indeed provided us with a substantial input that will help ensure sustainability for fisheries in the Mediterranean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carmen Fraga Estévez (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, through this report, for which it has been my pleasure to be rapporteur, we finally have the opportunity to produce a fisheries management system for the Mediterranean, eleven years after the first attempt to impose order by means of the technical measures regulation, Regulation No 1696/94.</p>
<p class="contents">This is therefore a crucial moment for the fisheries sector in the area, and for having made it possible for us to reach this moment, I must fully acknowledge the work of Commissioner Joe Borg and Director-General Jörgen Holmquist — who have been personally involved in moving this dossier forward — their services, with whom I have worked on a daily basis, and of course my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, who have been wise and generous enough to give up many of their local sectors’ demands, sometimes despite strong pressure, in order not to deprive the whole Mediterranean sector of common management rules.</p>
<p class="contents">With everybody’s involvement, we have been able to unblock the Commission’s initial proposal which, perhaps because it was drawn up too quickly, had opened up apparently insoluble conflicts with the national administrations, with the sector and with this Parliament, which, as you will remember, rejected the proposal by means of the report by Mr Lisi.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to get out of this <span class="italic">impasse</span>, I proposed to the Commission that we work in unison on a common text on the points on which there was the greatest controversy, with a view to achieving a joint compromise acceptable to Parliament and the Commission which we would then present once again to the Council of Ministers. The Commission accepted this method and, following a very hard negotiation and almost a year’s work, this is what we are presenting to the House today for its approval.</p>
<p class="contents">It may not be as ambitious a text as many of us would have liked; perhaps no one got everything they wanted. But we have all lost a little so that we may all emerge winners, because, if there was one thing we all agreed upon, it was that the situation of fishing in the Mediterranean could not remain at the mercy of a minimal regulation, which complicated more than it resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">If politics is a question of sacrificing individual interests for the sake of the common good, I believe that we can feel satisfied with our work on approving this report, which demonstrates that, when we work together, it is easier to make progress, and also that when a text that is balanced, and agreed amongst everybody, is presented to the governments, it is more easily accepted and therefore easier to apply.</p>
<p class="contents">This working method has also allowed us to avoid leaps into the dark with no scientific or logical basis, and certain contradictions in the initial text which led to the outright rejection of the proposal. For example, we introduce rationality and consistency into the regulation of the depths and distances from the coast within which it is possible to fish in such a biologically-, economically- and socially-sensitive sea.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, dredges are regulated, the way is opened for the use of more selective meshes — such as square mesh for towed nets — and considerable progress is made on bringing mesh size into line with the minimum sizes of species.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with regard to the Commission’s maximal initiative on bans, minimum sizes and hooks for the fishing of highly migratory species, it has been agreed firstly to attempt to get the regional fisheries organisations, such as the GFCM and the ICCAT, to produce these regulations, since this fishing is also carried out in the Mediterranean by third-country fleets and it does not make sense to impose restrictions solely on Community vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, if within a period of one year, these international bodies do not achieve a common rule, the Commission will be empowered to present a new proposal, since we do not want to ignore our responsibilities, stemming from our strong presence in the fishing grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the content of the report, I would finally like to stress the effort to provide greater protection for species by means of minimum sizes, with the only temporary exception of hake, where we worked on the basis of a Commission proposal to lower the size to 15 cm — which we have maintained until 2007, when the traditional size of 20 cm will return, coinciding with the proposed increase in mesh.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, for the first time, the size of sardine is regulated, sizes that had disappeared from the Commission’s proposal are recovered, such as the size of clam or striped venus, and reasonable increases in size are introduced for other species, since the ultimate objective is to move closer to the scientific recommendations in the Mediterranean as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, having once again called upon this House to approve this report and, in particular, the compromise reached with the Commission, I shall end by expressing my hope that the Council will fully accept this new proposal, which is the result of this compromise between the European Commission and the European Parliament.</p>

Such a specific character means that, although the objectives of the Community’s management of fisheries must be the same throughout the EU, the means for achieving them must be adapted to the specific features of fishing in the Mediterranean. Doing so would take account both of the various biological, geographical and legal circumstances of the region, and of the aim of utilising the experience and skills of fishermen’s organisations operating in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">One specific feature is small-scale coastal fishing. The majority of fishing vessels in the Italian fleet is less than 12 metres long and therefore we cannot disregard the difficulties that will be faced in converting them for other kinds of fishing – something that is greatly desired by the Community. Small-scale coastal fishing must not only be defined but also safeguarded, and, in the case of reconversion, higher levels of compensation and incentives must be dedicated to it, in order to avoid creating serious socioeconomic problems for the sector as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also specifies the role of the Regional Advisory Council, a body expressly created to promote the direct involvement of fishermen, and the vehicle for bringing first-hand experiences to the decision-making process, in order that Community legislation is increasingly in line with reality and the problems of the fisheries sector. We greatly welcome the role of the regulation for the Mediterranean in introducing common rules, but for this very reason all the non-European countries bordering the Mediterranean need to adapt their legislation to the stock conservation policy. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the position of the European Community at the heart of the large organisations regulating fishing, in order to make the main international forums such as GFCM and<span class="bold"> </span>ICCAT<span class="bold"> </span>more aware of Europe’s fishing tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would also like to draw attention to the centrality of research, inasmuch as the basis of any good policy consists of the quality and depth of knowledge of the factors in play. From this perspective, the specific character of the Mediterranean has always been a problem: over and above the quantity of research, the problem lies in the discrepancy between research and the specific knowledge requirements of an effective management policy. That is why we need to insist in future on the coordination of scientific research and its applicability to the action plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Respect and a degree of humility on both sides have enabled a compromise to be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been possible to reopen a debate with the fishing organisations. We have succeeded in preventing the Mediterranean from becoming marginalised in comparison with other seas, subject to a host of obligations and bans, amounting merely to a policy designed to penalise. Whilst appreciating the fact that the regulation represents a step forward and useful mediation, however, we believe that, even now, it retains an approach that is still linked – albeit to a lesser degree - to a model of fishing suited to the northern seas.</p>
<p class="contents">The northern seas are characterised by highly industrialised and single-species fishing, and they have a completely different marine biology to that of the Mediterranean. That is the reason for the long-standing debate – in committee and with you, Commissioner – on various minimum sizes, which we would have liked to fix more decisively: sardines and cod caught in the northern seas do not have the same rate of biological growth as the fish fauna of the Mediterranean. Equally, it is difficult to dictate overly specific limits on fishing gear, since an artisanal activity, carried out by small fleets, varies from country to country partly according to the kinds and variety of traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">With the implementation of this regulation, we would like to aim at an objective that is rarely achieved: a basin-wide policy, that is, a global approach. That of course involves paying attention to the management and conservation of fishery resources, to anti-pollution efforts and also to the safeguarding of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out, Commissioner, that 80% of the fishing carried out in the Mediterranean is small scale and takes place in regions that are mainly located within the area of the former Objective 1: areas experiencing extreme social hardship, high rates of unemployment, and, in many cases, deprived of social support. I believe that particular sensitivity towards maintaining employment levels is a joint mission for the Commission and Parliament. We call on the Council to accept this proposal and to take into due consideration the quantity and quality of the work that it has made possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to make some general comments. Fish, as everybody knows, is an important source of healthy human nutrition and is, quite rightly, much sought after by the consumer. It is also a major source of income for thousands of fishermen and other people involved in the fishing trade, including many small, medium and large businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The seas provide this fish, but uncontrolled fishing practices will eventually diminish supply and kill off the fishing industry. It is thus imperative that measures to manage the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources are legislated for and implemented as soon as possible. This is especially so with respect to the Mediterranean Sea, where stocks of many fish species appear in many instances to be at threshold levels. That is why this legislation is so urgently needed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, legislation becomes significant not when it is approved on paper, but when it is implemented in practice. This is a major weakness, especially with respect to fishing. Observation, surveillance and action to ensure application of the rules is unfortunately inadequate in many, if not in most, cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Out there on the high seas, things are not as they should be. Gross violations are committed daily by those who bend the rules or just disregard them altogether. So the first point to be made is that much needs to be done to verify implementation of the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the scientific data available to us. This information is essential if we are to understand and properly assess, for example, fishing stocks, breeding grounds, migration patterns and catchment methods. Are our present scientific data reliable? Unfortunately, it would appear not. It is thus of the utmost importance to direct efforts at getting accurate fishing data, free not only from scientific error but also from external manipulation aimed at boosting personal profits rather than fish conservation.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I refer to the diminishing species of the small- and medium-sized fishing enterprises of the smaller Mediterranean Member States like my country, Cyprus. Already disadvantaged by being a small island at the periphery of the EU, half occupied by Turkish and British troops, Cyprus is now facing the very real threat of having its fishing industry completely destroyed. A few hundred fishermen who have been carrying on the centuries-old family tradition of fishing around their island are now facing annihilation by the bureaucratic and, it seems, heartless dragon of Brussels, acting in conjunction with faceless international commissions whose main concern is to satisfy the interests of the big multinational companies and powerful governments.</p>
<p class="contents">So vessels from all over the world fish freely around Cyprus, but the Cypriot fishermen cannot do so because they are being strangulated by ridiculously low quotas. Take tuna, for example. The EU has a quota allocation of about 18 000 tonnes per year and the Commission in its wisdom has, for some years, considered giving Cyprus a quota of just 5 to 10 tonnes, instead of the 500 to 1 000 tonnes needed. The Commission blames many factors, such as previous years undeclared or erroneous catchment statistics by the Cyprus authorities, but these are just excuses. The fishermen of Cyprus …</p>

I wished to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez, who has accomplished a difficult and delicate, but nonetheless urgent, task in order to regulate and make provision for sustainable fishing in the Mediterranean, a sea that is itself threatened by extremely problematic developments: various types of pollution, decreasing resources, and threats to biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted at this compromise for a number of reasons. Firstly, it sets out in a particularly clear manner which fishing gear is authorised or banned; it lays down the parameters for drift nets, mesh sizes, the minimum size of fish, deep-sea trawling and so on. Equally, it ensures that European policy with regard to other seas of relevance to us, whether in the Atlantic Ocean or the North Sea, is coherent. It was essential to equip ourselves with tools and policies for managing the fishery resources in the Mediterranean. It is also a fair compromise, allowing the majority of the countries concerned to find an effective balance between what one set of countries or another has had to accept or refuse in order to reach this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">There remain, however, a number of issues to resolve which have in fact been raised by the previous speakers. One is the management of the entire Mediterranean basin, since we are only talking about the Member States of the European Union in this compromise. It is advisable, in fact, to strengthen the efforts of the regional organisations and to establish, within the framework of the EU Neighbourhood Policy, how we can reach agreements with the other countries bordering the Mediterranean basin. Further problems relate to bluefin tuna, which is an endangered species, or types of fishing such as purse-seine fishing, carried out for the purposes of aquaculture and involving practices that present an increasing number of problems. This compromise regulation does not directly target that type of fishing, but it is understandable how artisanal fishermen who feel themselves targeted by this regulation find it unfair that no further regulation is imposed on a developing method of fishing that creates huge problems for the preservation of ecosystems, given the means by which it is carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will repeat what Members have said regarding the need for the European Union urgently to conduct a much more active research policy on the Mediterranean. However, we do not have a large amount of the information and data which would enable us to fine-tune these policies and these tools. Equally, I believe that monitoring and implementing them depend on the political will of the Member States to enforce this new regulation. That is what the debate hinges upon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It tries to focus solely on taking measures to ban the use of fishing gear throughout the Mediterranean, whereas it is common knowledge that the burden on this sea's ecosystem is an extremely acute problem of marine pollution, as the result both of the careless use of pesticides and industrial pollution in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We know full well that the composition and fishing potential in the Mediterranean are different, due to the different conditions which prevail and interact, resulting in different degrees of eutrophication and, consequently, of sizes of catch. That is why we emphasise that the levelling down approach taken in the proposal, which generalises reductions in their output, will have different consequences from one fisherman to another.</p>
<p class="contents">When the above generalised bans are applied, they will have tragic consequences for certain areas. That is because, on the pretext of protecting fish stocks, the proposal reduces the fishing capacity, resulting in the immediate reduction and disappearance of income from fisheries for small and medium-sized fishing operations and, ultimately, a mass exodus from this occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of all the above measures being proposed will be the mass destruction of fishing communities and the abandonment of entire geographical areas, while aquaculture will hasten to cover the fishery deficit which is expected to be created and its interests will be strengthened for the benefit of large monopolies operating in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the role of capital in fisheries will become stronger and its previous social and other historic characteristics will disappear. The monopolisation of fisheries will be reinforced, as will the profits of business groups, to the detriment of small and medium-sized fishing operations, the workers and the grass-roots classes, with painful consequences for the marine ecosystem and the environment in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the policy of managing fishing capacity and the development of fisheries cannot be comprehended separately from the interests of small and medium-sized fishing operations. We consider that the development of fisheries must, at the same time, respect the ecosystem and the potential of each area, as well as the broader interests of the local society and economy, far from and contrary to the ambitions and interests of big business.</p>
<p class="contents">All this must be incorporated into a more global plan which, using cooperatives of fishery producers as a lever, will make the most productive use of individual fishery potential. Within this framework, appropriate technical measures can be assessed and imposed which will be scientifically substantiated and will be considered necessary in order to maintain fish stocks, safeguard the productive potential of each area ...</p>

It is indeed necessary to preserve a rich and diverse environment and essential food resources for future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable management of the marine ecosystem is essential. Of all the living creatures populating this planet, there is, however, one that has not only duties but also rights. I am referring to human beings. The regulation submitted to us presents a compromise, the intention of which I certainly understand: it is a compromise not only between the different sovereign nations that make up Europe, but also between the ways in which the environment is used and conserved. However, Amendment 10, tabled by our rapporteur, directly affects a Mediterranean fishing activity that is traditional to France, the <span class="italic">tonnaille</span>. This is an ancient fishing technique, specific to the French Mediterranean, in which bluefin tuna are caught using an anchored surface net.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow Members, be aware that, by approving this amendment, you will be signing the death warrant of 1 200 jobs directly and indirectly linked to this activity. On the ground, there is incomprehension, as well as legitimate anger. For years, fishermen in this sector have made significant efforts, particularly with regard to protecting cetaceans, in order to limit the impact of their activity on the ecosystem. Their accidental catches are now only residual. Scientific studies show that this method of fishing is one that respects its environment. I know that this compromise has been difficult to reach, but I appeal to the Commission, the Council and especially the French Government. What are a few extra days of negotiation compared with the distress of 300 families and an entire region? What weight will the argument regarding the compromise package carry, and that of Pandora’s box, which should certainly not be opened in France, where public opinion is increasingly aware that Brussels is out of touch with the reality of people’s lives? Let us not forget that 80% of fishing in the Mediterranean is of an artisanal nature, so why should we always favour the remaining 20%?</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Fraga Estévez, Members, reopen the negotiations in order to save these jobs! Commissioner Borg has just informed us that he refuses to approve our Amendment 34, on the grounds that Article 7(2), on which our amendment is founded, is based on a classification that does not correspond to the text. In my opinion, that is a matter of legal quibbling that concerns the detail of what the Commissioner and his services must regulate, but does not take account of the basis of the amendment, namely the protection of fishermen’s rights, which the amendment must crucially ensure is respected.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I call on you to vote against Amendment 10 tabled by our rapporteur, whom I nevertheless congratulate on the tireless work that she has carried out, and I call on you to vote in favour of our Amendment 34. On behalf of the fishermen whom you will save, I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are delighted, for example, to see resurrected potential financial support for the biological standstill, even if the new European Fisheries Fund is not considering it. Important matters remain on the table, however, which, in our opinion, are at odds with the interests of fishing in the Mediterranean. A further example: we believe that, given the importance of the whitebait sector, that species can be put on sale on condition that it is caught with statutory gear. That is why we have tabled Amendment 27, which we hope will be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">We have stressed the specific character of Mediterranean fishing a number of times: it is essentially coastal and small scale, a type of fishing that is part of culture and which, in addition to passing down a centuries-old tradition from generation to generation, constitutes a vital source for the economy, particularly in an area – let us not forget – of extensive socioeconomic degradation. We therefore believe that points 3 and 4 of Annex 2 must be taken out, the intention of which is to regulate and standardise the technical features of small-scale gear, which, precisely because it is linked to a specific type of fishing and to specific coastal zones, cannot by its very nature be the subject of regulatory enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">We congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, and harbour the legitimate hope that this regulation may be a significant breakthrough towards a Mediterranean that is careful to preserve its fish fauna, but is also the source of livelihoods and employment for thousands of European fishermen, who, up to now, have only been required to observe bans and limits, whilst for the non-European fleets the Mediterranean has been a kind of free zone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards catch potential, according to the experts, we are reaching the limit and it is therefore right that the European Parliament and the Commission are attempting to put a limit on fishing, to manage catches in a sustainable way and to stamp out destructive forms of fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Fishing and aquaculture, however, represent one of the principal activities of the Union. The European fisheries market is ranked third in the world after China and Peru. In France, Greece, Italy and Spain approximately 100 000 fishermen and tens of thousands of fishing vessels are involved in the fisheries sector. The European fleet – which <span class="italic">inter alia</span> is an artisanal fleet, as the statistical data show – consists primarily of vessels lighter than 10 tonnes. The essentially artisanal character of our fleet and our fishermen is therefore obvious. Citizens thus expect the European Parliament and the Commission to strike a balanced position, reconciling economic and ecological needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the protection of fish stocks must be more strictly based on scientific information than is the case at present, but we must also actively involve fishermen in the management of fishery resources and liaise with the environmental world in order to raise awareness and call attention to employment issues. We therefore call for the gradual application of the new regulations. Mrs Fraga Estévez’s report, on the whole, puts ...</p>

I am convinced that this can only increase the credibility of this common policy within the European fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The cooperation –– which, as I have said, was close and effective –– between the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga –– who has done a magnificent job –– and the Commission services, has allowed us to come to this House today with a compromise acceptable to the majority of Parliament, and with a clear message to the sector, which under no circumstances must we break or spoil.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing is that this cooperation should allow us to unblock a situation which had become unsustainable; unsustainable for the Community institutions, of course, but above all for a sea whose resources have been regarded as over-exploited for some time, but which, owing to its special characteristics, has remained in a permanent state of exception, and it is now time to put an end to that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean is a different kind of sea: national waters are more limited than in other areas of the Community, fish populations transcend areas and are shared, the general characteristics of the activity are different — there is above all a small-scale fishing fleet and a high proportion of fishermen fish on a part-time basis — there are many small landing sites, etc. I have only mentioned a few of the characteristics that make the Mediterranean a different kind of sea, but the objectives of the CFP are the same in the Mediterranean as in other Community waters: we must guarantee that live aquatic resources are exploited in a way that allows for sustainable environmental, economic and social conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, therefore, to the structural and market measures defined in the CFP that are already being applied, the conservation policy must be implemented in the Mediterranean in a similar fashion, as well as the regulations –– which must be improved and developed –– the harmonisation of minimum sizes and technical measures –– which must be absolute throughout the European Union and effective throughout the Mediterranean Basin –– and effective control — which must resolve a problem; the sale in a Member State, which is all too frequently Spain, of illegal fish originating from another Member State, because that illegal fishing damages both parties: the State that is selling it, because it damages resources, and the State that is receiving it, because it damages prices and, above all, damages the faith of the fishermen in the management mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur and express my hope that we will all benefit from the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a contradiction that this is what the EU recommends in the report, at the same time as having fisheries agreements with countries in, for example, Africa. These third-country agreements contribute to overfishing of the oceans and impair many developing countries’ ability to build up profitable fishing industries themselves. A recently published report by the Swedish National Board of Fisheries criticises the EU’s third-country agreements. The criticism is based on the fact that none of these agreements promotes sustainable fishing and that they are also implemented in a way that does not comply with the FAO’s code of conduct. A number of non-governmental organisations share that view and have pointed out that the agreements predominantly affect coastal communities badly.</p>
<p class="contents">If the sustainable development of fishery resources really is a priority issue for the EU, the latter must not only advocate measures in the Mediterranean, as in this report, but also recommend and implement a radical review of its fisheries agreements with third countries. In this report, Parliament has altered the Commission’s proposal, which does not promote sustainable development, in favour of the fishing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should not work on issues concerning fishing. Issues of this type should be dealt with at regional and sub-regional levels insofar as that is possible. Those issues concerning fishing that presuppose international cooperation may usefully be dealt with within the framework of international bodies in which national special interests are not as marked as is the case in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our shared objective is to achieve sustainability of fisheries in the Mediterranean. We owe this to our fishermen and also to the maintenance of a sustainable marine ecosystem to be able to support this activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Through a constructive dialogue, we have explored the avenues to finding some technical solutions to what before seemed to be intractable difficulties. I would like to underline that the aim of the proposal is to create a conservation plan for the Mediterranean. We achieved this through finding a balance and we have instituted measures to protect small-scale fisheries in particular. For example, fishing for bianchetto continues to be allowed in our proposal, but with selective gear, not with trawls.</p>
<p class="contents">With the advent of the new Parliament and when I took office, I had to decide what to do regarding the Mediterranean proposal. It was decided at that time that rather than withdrawing the original proposal, we would leave it on the table, but adopt a flexible approach. That is exactly what we did and, to this effect, we have worked very closely with the Fisheries Committee. We have taken on board the amendments proposed by the Fisheries Committee as a package. We have also taken on board a number of other amendments from individual MEPs. Consultations have been carried out in an extensive manner with representatives of the sector for the Mediterranean, both by the Fisheries Committee and by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We are discussing with the Member States with a view to having the proposal adopted as early as the June Council. We are making significant progress and we can accept certain other amendments to sensitise the regulation even further to the specificities of Mediterranean fisheries, but without forgoing the fundamental principle of sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the Community, have a responsibility to set a credible and strong example. We will continue to work with our partners in the Mediterranean Sea to convince them of the need to adopt measures along the same lines as ours. We have set up the Medisamac as a forum, bringing together most Mediterranean littoral States. We have strengthened the GFCM to be able to use it as a tool to achieve common standards, and we are working to establish a regional advisory council for the Mediterranean, which will work further in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community has to set an example. It has to take the lead in the Mediterranean. Once the regulation is adopted, we will work within the GFCM and with individual third countries through our very good relations with them on all fronts, based now on partnership and neighbourhood, to adopt measures on the same lines as these and to have a level playing field for the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, my appreciation goes to all of you, and in particular the rapporteur, for her tireless work. You have come up with a proposal that I will clearly defend in the forthcoming discussions in the Council.</p>
