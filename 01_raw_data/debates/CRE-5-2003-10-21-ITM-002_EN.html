<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We hope that a few journalists are here too on this occasion, because the evenings are always so long, and so it is sometimes a little difficult to adhere to scheduled starting times. Anyway, without further ado, let us turn to the matter in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are discussing today are better conditions for railway operations in the European Union. By means of the three directives and one regulation, we seek to ensure that conditions are improved to such an extent that the railways in Europe will again be able to transport more goods and more passengers. As the rapporteur for the Directive on the development of the Community’s railways, allow me to begin by expressing my great satisfaction at the Council’s acceptance of our parliamentary position, which, contrary to the Commission’s proposal, advocates the preservation of the Trans-European Rail Freight Network that was established on 15 March 2003. Since that date, this first step towards the opening of the rail network in the fifteen EU Member States, which effectively covers 90% of the main rail corridors, has presented rail operators, irrespective of their national origins, with an equal opportunity to use the European rail network for international freight traffic in a way that best suits the needs of customers.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Parliament agrees with the Council regarding the opening of the remaining lines in the rail network to international freight traffic on 1 January 2006. That, however, is by no means a huge leap forward, since, as I just mentioned, practically 90% of total track mileage was opened to international freight traffic on 15 March of this year. Consequently, Parliament continues to call for the rail networks to be fully opened to national as well as international freight operators on 1 January 2006 so that the entire EU rail network will be open to all freight services, be they national or international, on that date. In this way we can truly achieve the aim set down in the Commission White Paper – and I am grateful, Commissioner, that we have always followed the same line here – to restore rail transport to its former market position by 2010 and to transfer as much freight as possible to the railways.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is more comprehensive than this, however. The White Paper is not just about freight; it is about striking a balance between the various modes of transport by the year 2010. For this reason, Parliament takes the view that passenger networks must be opened up too. If you consider the increase in the number of private cars on the motorways and the growth in the volume of air traffic, you will appreciate that our motorways and air corridors are coming close to saturation point. And this is why we in this House want the rail networks to be opened to operators of passenger trains on 1 January 2008. Unless we take that step, the shift from road to rail and air to rail that is envisaged for the year 2010 will leave passenger traffic untouched.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite worrying to see how low-cost air carriers are taking custom away from the European railways. I hope, Commissioner, that in the next few days you will have something to say about Charleroi airport in Belgium, because it is not acceptable that the railways should be making huge losses on their long-distance passenger services because the cheap airlines are luring their customers away and congesting our skies. In short, we want to ensure that the aim of rebalancing the transport market by 2010 applies to passenger transport too.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people have repeatedly stressed that the Commission has announced the presentation of a third rail package by the end of the year, a package that will include passenger transport. That is all very honourable, Commissioner, but it does not help us in any way, because, as you know, if the Commission failed to present this package by December of this year, we could no longer adopt the package, or even give it a first reading, before the end of the current legislative term.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if we did manage the first reading, the intervention of the European parliamentary elections, the appointment of a new Commission and the need to reactivate the legislative process would mean that it would effectively take one to two years to put through a bill on passenger transport, and so we could not adopt a third railway package before 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that the train operators need to know for certain now whether they will be able to benefit from a legal right of access to the entire network. We want them to have time to anticipate the needs of the travelling public so that we are actually able to effect the transfer of a substantial volume of long-distance traffic from road and air to the railways by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the committee proposed that the existing options allowing Member States to permit companies other than railway undertakings to apply for train paths should be scrapped in favour of a provision enabling consignors, forwarders and the like to apply for the use of train paths alongside railway undertakings in all Member States. We believe that every effort must be made to optimise the use of the rail infrastructure. We know that there is still spare capacity today, even on the Brenner line, and there is no point in our continued grumbling about HGVs when even this transalpine rail link still has spare capacity. In other words, we must enable more players in the market to apply for and use the available train paths if we want to maximise the volume of freight carried by rail.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, as the spokesman for my group, to say a few words in anticipation of the other two reports, because it would make no sense for me to sit down and then stand straight back up again. I should like to begin these remarks on behalf of my group by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs from the other groups. We worked very well together, both at the time of the first reading and in preparation for the present second reading. Although Mrs Ainardi, Mr Sterckx, Mr Savary and I differed in our positions on specific points, we always regarded the railways package as an integral whole, hence our close cooperation as rapporteurs. I am highly gratified that we are all trying to follow the same line.</p>
<p class="contents">You will be aware that the Council has already tried to find compromises that will enable us to conclude the legislative process quickly. The Council, along with the rapporteurs, has basically been trying to reduce the number of points at issue between the Council and Parliament, sometimes by accepting parliamentary positions and sometimes by proposing compromises, with the result that the conciliation procedure will focus on a core of considerably fewer than sixty or seventy points. I hope that we shall hear some judicious statements from the Council tomorrow regarding its intention of adhering to the line we began to discuss last week. We are interested in reducing the number of disputed points so that we can really focus our full attention on the major problems at the conciliation sessions. To this end, my group will carefully examine the latest batch of amendments to the railway directives and will vote accordingly on Thursday.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to make two or three remarks on the Sterckx report. Mr Sterckx has tried very hard – for which I am grateful to him – to ensure that the European rail-safety standards guarantee a high level of safety and that there is no scope for the introduction by the back door of new national safety rules which would ultimately reinstate arbitrary restrictions on international traffic. I believe it is very important that we cooperate with the Commission in order to find a mechanism that prevents the introduction of allegedly essential safety provisions that are actually designed to discriminate against other rail operators.</p>
<p class="contents">My group also attaches importance to the proper training of train crews and all other personnel on whom the safety of rail travel depends. We still have a problem here, Commissioner, that being that one directive devoted purely to the training of engine drivers might not suffice. We must train all other safety-related personnel to the appropriate standard of qualification. I support Mr Sterckx on the last point I wish to address from his report, a point on which I believe we all agree: staff training certificates must not lose their validity when personnel move from one railway undertaking to another. We need a single market for engine drivers too. We need competition throughout the domain of rail transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to the Savary report. Mr Savary has very carefully incorporated the new budgetary rules, and I believe that the Council will endorse this so that all agencies have uniform budgetary rules and so that we avoid a situation in which each agency has its own rules, creating an incomprehensible tangle of budgetary provisions. The main point in the Savary report – and we are right behind the rapporteur on this – is the imbalance in the Council’s proposal for the composition of the Administrative Board. The amended proposal made by the Commission is for an Administrative Board comprising six representatives of the Council, four representatives of the Commission, and six non-voting representatives of the industry, in other words of the relevant railway undertakings, and rail users. The Council is now proposing that all Member States be represented on the Board. This would mean that six representatives of the interested parties, four Commission officials and, from May of next year, twenty-five Council representatives would sit on the Board. Only the Council could devise such a ludicrous scheme, and we therefore endorse the rapporteur’s view that we must use the conciliation procedure to put an end to it.</p>

Railway safety is good in most cases at the moment, and it is imperative that it remain good, at least as good as it is now. I extend my thanks to many of my fellow Members, therefore, for their valuable contribution to the debate on safety, and also to many people from the railway community, who have made a fair few suggestions, improved the texts, pointed out difficulties and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">If a European rail transport market is established, there must of course also be a European safety system. We are creating that by means of this Directive: Common Safety Targets, a method for achieving those targets, and a safety authority in each Member State that uses a common method to give licences to all the parties concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Council common position, we held a number of discussions, and there followed mediation by the Commission with representatives of the Council. We were able to eliminate a whole range of problems, as there were quite a few differences between the common position and our first reading. I have tabled a number of compromise amendments about these, which I ask my fellow Members to support, including compromise amendments concerning the driving licence for train drivers – for which we have found a solution via a new Commission proposal – and also concerning interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress the importance of the agreement reached by the social partners (the trade unions and the European railway companies). Indeed, I should like to ask that the Commission transpose that agreement as quickly as possible, so that we also demonstrate that we attach great importance to the creation of a social framework for our planned railway reforms. I think that this is an important point, and that it must therefore be emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point on which we reached agreement concerns communications and the crossing of linguistic borders, something on which I had laid a fair amount of emphasis. If Mrs Ainardi is in agreement, we shall move that point to the Directive on interoperability, and thus that, too, will be settled. There are two significant points on which we disagree with the Council, however. The first is the speed at which the new safety system should start off. The European Parliament wants to proceed more quickly, and I think that we should stand firm on that view.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – as Mr Jarzembowski has already pointed out – working towards a European safety system implies keeping the number of new national safety rules that are introduced to an absolute minimum. Hence the importance of Article 8: the role of the Commission as supervisor of the system. We as a Parliament must stand our ground on that point. We have already reached agreement with the Council on a number of points, but one remains, and we do need to negotiate hard about this. Indeed, we shall see whether the Council is also able to follow up tomorrow the points on which we reached agreement. I think that agreement is possible, and we must strive to achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to talk about the other reports and the whole package: we must keep the four directives as a single package. We must enter into the conciliation procedure on those four directives simultaneously. In general, the European Parliament is more in favour of an open European rail transport market and of European railway companies than the Council. The Council does not yet go as far as this: much less far than the Commission and Parliament. We must negotiate hard in the conciliation procedure in order to bring the Council a long way towards our position. The decreasing market share held by the railways speaks for itself: our Belgian railways again lost nearly 6% of the freight market in the first half of 2003. That is a very regrettable development. There is a small increase in passenger transport, but the situation regarding freight has taken another turn for the worse. I think that, particularly in our country, inland water transport and coastal water transport are poised to take over that market share. It is important, therefore, that the railways defend themselves much more effectively, that they ensure their presence on the market. The railways must become more efficient, much more dynamic, than is now the case. In some countries they are, but in others they definitely are not. Railway companies must not focus on themselves. They must focus on their customers, those who use their services, and they must focus on their service – ensure that they are giving their customers the best possible service – so that those customers stay with them, or come back to them. I think that this is important. Nearly every week I come across a company that says ‘We should indeed like to do a number of things by rail, but it is not possible. The railways are bad, too slow, too expensive, unreliable.’ In my opinion, these are very regrettable reports, and something must be done in this regard. That is the very first aim of this package of directives</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention that what we are proposing here is not wild capitalism on the railways. That is definitely not the aim of the directives that are on the table now. This is not an asocial or antisocial package. Indeed, my request that the agreement between the social partners be ratified took its inspiration from the social sphere. This package gives the railways the opportunity of ‘recapturing’ the transport market. My use of a military term is deliberate, because if the railways do not win their share of that transport market back, we shall really see some very serious social carnage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ainardi (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, an entire programme of parliamentary and institutional work on railways is now drawing to a close. The railways represent a tremendous challenge for Europe and for the future. The report on interoperability seeks to make the directives on high-speed and conventional rail systems more consistent. Significantly, it also proposes greater harmonisation. This is a way in which the Union can benefit the railways, enabling trains to move freely across the European network.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision to tackle the issue of rail was made on the basis of the ongoing decline of rail as a means of transport in Europe. Consequently, the proposals contained in my report seek to support the development of the railways. Rail is a sustainable and safe means of transport. In addition, it places different areas on an equal footing. Both at a European level and at the level of each Member State, public authorities should take resolute action on railways. They need it. The reasons for the decline of the railways are many and serious. Moreover, some of these reasons are not related to the aim of my report. One such reason is the failure to take account of the environmental costs of road transport, which is the main competitor of rail transport. The decline of the railways is also linked to problems concerning finance. On this issue, I am bound to refer back to what I said previously and I can only reiterate that this aspect is far from satisfactory. The time will come when it will be necessary to make available means that match our stated ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the recommendation for second reading of my report. Although there was general agreement on the common position, my report includes the proposals made by the relevant parliamentary committee at first reading. This is progress. I would like to cite two examples. First, there is the proposal seeking to equip trains with recording devices. With satellite control, these devices will greatly enhance the flow of rail traffic by monitoring changes in real time. They will also increase safety. Rail employees put this proposal to me at the very beginning of the first reading and it has now been accepted by the Council. In my opinion, this is a good example of how we can improve parliamentary work by taking the time to debate issues with the main parties involved and to listen to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to draw your attention to the amendment seeking to replace the phrase ‘minimum level of safety’ with ‘optimum level’. It was important to eliminate any ambiguity concerning the possibility of a ‘levelling down’ type of harmonisation. Allowing safety standards to differ between Member States might suggest that harmonisation could be used to reduce safety standards so as to facilitate access for new entrants. On the contrary, it is essential to ensure that all rail users respect the complete set of standards guaranteeing better safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the other reports on the rail package. I support the proposals of my fellow Member Mr Savary on a European Railway Agency. I think the proposals for each and every one of the players to be represented on the Administrative Board of the agency are essential to progress. I believe it is very important for rail employees and their organisations to contribute to the process of drawing up the technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs).</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with a number of the proposals made by Mr Sterckx on safety. I believe each Member State’s particular situation and know-how must be taken into account. In addition, however, I feel it is important to allow sufficient time. For historic reasons, our rail networks are extremely complex. Effective change must take account of the human factor. I would also like to highlight the issue of national standards. It is essential for Member States to retain the right and the ability to improve their safety conditions and systems. If this right were removed, there would be a serious risk of them all being reduced to the lowest common denominator when the aim should be to help all networks increase their safety levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, our rapporteur will understand that I do not agree with amending our objectives, including opening up the sector to competition and considering this action to be as important as safety. Everyone has their own opinion on opening up the sector to competition. We happen not to agree on the subject. It is, however, a shame to make a hotchpotch in a directive that has harmonisation and improvement of safety as its main objective.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Mr Jarzembowski’s report, I have to say that I do not share his desire for liberalisation. We have only just begun on the process of transposing the previous directive and an assessment of its impact is required. The rail sector is of such social and economic importance that the precautionary principle must be applied. No one would want the European rail system to experience the same mishaps, not to mention disasters, which have befallen certain other networks. Liberalisation at any cost implies certain theoretical assumptions. This can prove dangerous and has been shown to have disastrous consequences for the railways, employment and the social and economic situation. These are the grounds on which we rejected the proposals to accelerate the opening up of both the national and international freight sector, proposals which unfortunately were accepted by the Council. Since we rejected these proposals, it follows that we cannot support Parliament’s bid to liberalise passenger transport if the report is accepted. All, or almost all, of the main players in the sector are united in their opposition to this plan.</p>
<p class="contents">This support for liberalisation is all the more surprising given that the attempts to establish freight corridors have not yet borne fruit save in the context of cooperation. Europe needs to learn from experience. It also needs a public rail service it can be proud of. In our opinion, this is what is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, while I agree with Mr Jarzembowski’s idea that the rail package constitutes a whole, and while we all agree on promoting rail transport, and moving forward in this direction, I do not think this necessarily entails liberalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Savary (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to say how pleased I am with how this second rail package is progressing. More generally, I am also very happy with the admirable work to promote railways undertaken during this period. I am sure all of us here today have different sensibilities. Nonetheless, we are all united in the common cause of boosting the rail sector and of giving it new hope. It is a case of convincing all the players in the rail sector that Europe is not out to handicap national rail networks. On the contrary, it is here to provide an opportunity for a renaissance of the railways. This truly is the primary objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The second objective is to respond to public opinion. Nowadays, we are judged on how well we discharge our responsibilities. In so-called transit and junction countries like mine the trend towards transporting everything by lorry has led to intolerable situations. Significant political tensions have arisen in such countries. These tensions came to the fore over the Mont Blanc incidents and a similar situation is arising in connection with the Pyrenees.</p>
<p class="contents">This second rail package has several dimensions. Firstly, it has a very strong technical dimension, which is embodied in particular in the report by Mrs Ainardi. We fully support her report and I personally support it unreservedly, in particular because it provides for the installation of black boxes, something that is Mrs Ainardi’s personal wish. The Sterckx report addresses technical concerns too and is also important as it establishes European safety standards. There is, therefore, no question of opening up the sector without providing a safety net. Careful preparations will be made. Safety will be at the heart of the opening up process. Safety must always be our objective and our watchword.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I have a more qualified opinion about the relationship between national safety standards and European safety standards. I believe safety cannot be sacrificed in the interests of freedom. As regards the rail sector, safety is obviously crucial at all times to the work of railway employees. Nevertheless, I think it is essential not to use standards as a pretext for preventing other trains from using a particular network. Personally, I hope an appropriate agreement upholding the safety imperative will be reached on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, for the first time these texts have a very significant social dimension to them, which fills me with great hope. I share the view that far greater progress has been made on integrating the European Union’s roads than on integrating its railways and I have said as much. The reason why rail is lagging behind is that so far railway employees have failed to understand that we are also trying to integrate the railway employees of the European Union, which will be to their benefit too.</p>
<p class="contents">Significant progress has been made, nonetheless. Firstly, there is the establishment of the Agency. This achievement is down to my fellow Members, and to the understanding and ongoing support of the Commission and the Council. The Agency will bring employers and employees together for the first time. I think we should feel satisfied with this. I believe this agency should be a common forum for the rail sector. This was why we sought to include employees’ representatives as well as bringing together rail users, rail companies and infrastructure managers.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust Amendment No 4 and Amendment No 5 will be upheld. In particular, I hope the provision in Article 3 for trade unions in working groups will be retained. I believe this represents a considerable step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Sterckx and the Ainardi reports uphold the principle of the primacy of social dialogue in the legislative processes of the European Union. Whenever employers and unions can come to an agreement, within a suitable time frame, the need to legislate can be avoided. Legislation can then be drafted at a later date. From this point of view, the developments regarding the driver’s licence mark a turning point. This is the first time the 32 rail companies and union representatives have reached such an agreement which will form the basis of a text. This text will, of course, inform the Commission’s work too. Thanks to the agreement, the Commission’s work will have far greater legitimacy than it would otherwise have had. I hope all this augurs the establishment in the very near future of a convention bringing together all European rail employees. I believe that this will trigger the liberation of European Union railways and lead to their rapid integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalisation is also an issue. My views on this are much more qualified than those of Mr Jarzembowski. I am not sure that it is very useful to keep changing the agenda. I am not sure that liberalisation is the only basis for integrating the railways of the European Union. Indeed, I believe the opposite is the case. Clearly, it is important to ensure trains can travel freely across all Member States. In my view, however, many other conditions still remain to be met for railways to regain their rightful status and be able to compete with road transport. I am not sure we should address the issue of passenger transport prematurely. We must not adopt a blinkered approach. In my opinion, there is no point in setting a date without being fully aware of what is involved, particularly on the economic front. I fear we may be drawn inexorably towards a collision of all the risks. The nearer the elections draw, the greater are the opportunities for the Council to diminish certain positions. I regret this but we shall move together in that direction, Georg, because we all accepted that this is a rail package.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like to finish by saying that we attach great importance to the budgetary aspect. I am concerned that the directive on European tax discs falls short of the ambitions of the White Paper. It will allow national taxation policies to be implemented, which is likely to result in many contradictions concerning tax deductions and the allocation of these funds. I would have preferred a Swiss-style system for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is certainly satisfactory to be holding this debate in the morning, with the benefit of plenty of light and with Minute-takers present. It is worth noting that we are actually working in daylight. For once, we have not been relegated to the twilight hours. Issues of this kind are usually consigned to evening sittings. I would therefore like to reiterate how delighted I am to be dealing with them in prime parliamentary time.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this programming is an indication of the widespread recognition of the importance of the subject under discussion. In particular, it reflects the importance attributed to it by the House. I would like to begin by thanking Parliament most sincerely for all the work undertaken over the years. As several honourable Members recalled, we have now been working together for a long time in the hope of breathing new life into European railways and ensuring the recovery of rail transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the four rapporteurs very much for their excellent work. I admit to being one of those who would have preferred to conclude at second reading. Nonetheless, we are proceeding to conciliation. It is to be hoped that the amendments will be adopted tomorrow and will provide what little further clarification is required on the minor points remaining for discussion in Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe that a positive result for the rail sector will eventually be achieved. The ultimate beneficiary will be European society. Throughout the time we have worked together we have contrived to find solutions to most of the problems raised. We have also clarified our positions and found ways forward resulting in compromises and agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin by responding to Mr Savary. The Commission<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> does not object to most of the amendments tabled concerning the European Railway Agency. We are only opposed to five of the 32 amendments tabled. Essentially, we adopted this stance on the grounds of legal clarity or in the interests of avoiding complications or excessive bureaucracy in the Agency’s work. I think it is worth emphasising that the Commission does support the amendments relating to the composition of the Administrative Board. The rapporteur has just referred to these. We also support the amendments concerning the composition of its working groups. I believe a good balance can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs Ainardi for her work on such a technically complex matter. We have cooperated in an exemplary manner. I should state that the Commission is able to support the two amendments tabled by Mr Sterckx at the eleventh hour.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sterckx was the rapporteur for the directive on safety on the Community’s railways. A large number of amendments to this directive were tabled. This illustrates Parliament’s wish to forge ahead more quickly in this area. We are of course also eager to do so. Nonetheless, some of the amendments tabled incorporate provisions that already exist in the directives on interoperability. Others refer to provisions that will appear in our proposal on driving licences for train drivers due towards the end of this year. Further amendments relate to systematic shortening of the deadlines for drafting European texts on rail safety. The Council had already drastically shortened the deadlines. I therefore believe this is not about being arbitrary but about being realistic. The Council had already shortened the deadlines contained in the initial proposals. A balance seems to have been reached. In that connection, I maintain that for the future agency to succeed from the outset, it must not be overloaded with work. It is also worth mentioning the issue of national safety rules and their monitoring at Community level. These are the most significant amendments, especially in the context of preparing for the vote in the Council. I believe the rapporteur achieved a good balance. We therefore support his amendments to Article 8. Once again, I should like to thank Mr Sterckx for his work.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mr Jarzembowski’s report, it should be noted that it falls into two parts. One concerns freight transport and the other passenger transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully support Parliament’s amendments regarding freight transport. It should be borne in mind, however, that eventually agreement will need to be reached with the Council concerning deadlines and authorised applicants. Nonetheless, I am confident of a positive outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding passenger transport, I am well aware of Parliament’s position. The House made this abundantly clear at first reading. I informed the Council accordingly. The vote in plenary at first reading in Parliament was dealt with as appropriate. The Commission is also fully aware that this position has been maintained in the vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">I should reiterate before the House that we appreciate the concerns underlying these amendments. The Commission has, however, given an undertaking to Parliament and to the Council to present a proposal on opening up passenger transport to competition. The Commission intends to present this proposal before the end of the year. The texts are practically finished. The last internal discussions are under way. The texts are more complex than they appear at first sight. The document should be available to you in a month and a half. You will have it before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed the case that even if the Commission presents the proposal on time, it will not be possible to debate it during this term. Mr Jarzembowski was quite right to point that out. The debate could perhaps be launched, but I suspect it would not be possible to conclude the first reading. On this subject, I would like to say to honourable Members that the Commission will present the text. We trust this Parliament will begin work on it, and that it or its successor will bring the work to a satisfactory conclusion. We are all fully aware of the importance of opening up passenger transport to competition. Furthermore, as soon as the Trans-European network is established it will be essential to stop thinking in terms of national criteria for railways and begin to consider European railway criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Henceforth, the geographical reference context will be the whole of Europe, not one specific country or another. It will be necessary to think in terms of the European network as a whole. Consequently, all the companies already in existence in the various European countries must have free access to that European network. Once access is granted, the companies will compete amongst themselves. That is the logical outcome of the steps taken.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as a European railway law comes into force, existing European operators will begin to compete amongst themselves. Competition will automatically come about as soon as Europe becomes the reference area, rather than some specific country. This is not an ideological issue. It is a fact. It is simply a logical consequence of the nature of the measures adopted. It is one of the advantages of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I should say that I believe this kind of competition will spur the railway companies to modernise. Modernisation is sorely needed. Ladies and gentlemen, I certainly agree with you that the safety criterion is crucial. It must remain so. Safety needs to be the aim and the watchword of rail transport. It must not be compromised by the other changes envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Jarzembowski, I should like to congratulate you on your efforts and on the work you have put in. I understand your position, one shared by a substantial majority of the House, but I am unable to support those amendments. I can, however, provide an assurance that the text on opening up passenger transport to competition will be presented before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">As I conclude, I should like to thank the rapporteurs once again. Mrs Ainardi, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Sterckx and Mr Savary have all done splendid work. Thanks are also due to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and to the whole House.</p>
<p class="contents">Some points do remain for conciliation with the Council. A number of them may prove problematic. It is to be hoped that suitable accommodations will be found. The second rail package could then be finalised. The first rail package was completed during this Parliamentary term. If the second package is concluded before the term comes to an end, this Parliament will be able to pride itself on having moved European rail freight transport forward into the twenty-first century. This represents a considerable challenge. It is a challenge that must be met, however, if Europe is to have a balanced and sustainable transport system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must ensure that the twenty-first century marks the revival of rail travel in Europe, otherwise we shall have a gridlocked road network with all its repercussions on people’s lives, on the environment and on the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The railways, of course, cannot be synonymous with long-distance transport as they were in the nineteenth century, but they should be an important link in a chain comprising all the modes of transport – air, road, sea, waterway and rail. In order to play their part in this chain, the railways must be up to the tasks required of them. They must be fully integrated within their own structures, and the grandiloquent concept of intermodal transport must be fleshed out so that the links between the various modes of transport can actually work in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Time is short, which is why Parliament was dissatisfied – and, indeed, is still not quite satisfied – with the original timetable, but we do see signs of movement, and we hope that there will be further movement – and very soon, please, if possible. Accordingly, we stand by our earlier proposals. Especially with regard to the package covered by Mrs Ainardi’s report, we stand by our stated position, and we must insist on the realisation of interoperability throughout the network. This, of course, cannot be fully achieved unless it is an effective binding requirement for all parts of the rail network and unless steps are taken to ensure that international transport operations are not obstructed again by piecemeal measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In the drafting and adoption of technical specifications, consideration must be given to the economic costs, and care must be taken to ensure that the requisite safety standards are in place and that due account is taken of environmental and social concerns too. One of the main prerequisites for an entirely effective and safe trans-European high-speed rail network is a functioning system of communication, especially between those who conduct operations and those who oversee them. For this reason we need an appropriate code of terminology for operational communications. Rather than organising all of this on the basis of the lowest common denominator and minimum safety levels, we must guarantee compliance with the highest possible standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me, as an Austrian, to take this opportunity to comment on another subject that has been in the news again in recent days. I refer to the proposed regulation on the ecopoints system for HGVs travelling through Austria, which was the subject of the Caveri report and which has now gone to conciliation, although the conciliation process has not yet begun in earnest. In this context, may I make an urgent appeal, especially to the Council and its President-in-Office, Mr Lunardi, to ensure that the most directly affected countries are able to agree on a common position so that they can signal to everyone, including Parliament, that the deadlock is being broken.</p>
<p class="contents">The deadlock needs to be broken; once it has, Mr Schmid’s earlier quotation from Goethe can be applied to the ecopoints issue too, albeit in a slightly modified form: ‘For he whose strivings never cease will finally achieve success’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my contribution to this debate, I should like to focus on the work that Mr Jarzembowski has done and to enumerate the conditions in which liberalisation can truly succeed. As far as freight transport is concerned, there are no differences between us; we agree on the need for liberalisation or opening of the market in freight transport, because, over the past few years, and indeed decades, the percentage of freight transported by rail has steadily fallen. This is not the result of liberalisation, which came along much later. On the contrary, liberalisation is actually a necessary, albeit inadequate, response to this development.</p>
<p class="contents">The domain of road haulage has experienced the very liberalisation that we actually want to see in the realm of rail transport. National borders now present virtually no obstacle to international road transport within the European Union, nor do divergent technical or safety standards. The external cost of road transport, however, is not borne by carriers, which has been to their advantage, and the road network has received massive amounts of public investment. The primacy of road over rail cannot be regarded as the triumph of free enterprise over nationalised industries, because road transport could not have flourished without public investment.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as passenger transport is concerned, I am very grateful to the Commissioner for her explanatory remarks, and I hope that the pragmatism and logic of her arguments have also convinced Mr Jarzembowski, who is not entirely immune to the sort of cogent argument of which the Commissioner availed herself so amply today. Let us be honest: the crucial point is not whether the rules take effect in 2005 or not; what is crucial is that they are introduced at some time in the next few years. We are in agreement on that point. My group will vote for the Jarzembowski report, but I should like to say very clearly on its behalf that attempts to liberalise freight transport will only succeed if they are accompanied by greater flexibility on passenger transport. Freight transport must take precedence for the reasons I have given, subject to certain conditions. The successful liberalisation of rail transport will also depend on measures such as the harmonisation of technical specifications and safety standards. Much has been said about this already, and we fully agree with what we have heard. The obstacles to a single European market that still exist in this domain must be systematically removed. This is a challenge to politicians throughout Europe and more particularly to both sides of the rail industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Which brings me to the second condition. It has become fashionable today to implement reforms that run counter to the interests of the people who are most directly affected by them, namely the workforce. I believe it would be better if we could secure the support of employees, particularly railway employees, for reforms and changes. The agreement reached a few days ago on train drivers’ licences is a very good sign. If we assign responsibility to the two sides of the rail industry – employers and employees – subject, of course, to the proviso that failure to exercise this responsibility will result in an imposed political decision, I firmly believe that they will arrive at an effective solution, as has happened in the case of the train drivers’ licence. I hope that this is indeed the start of a constructive partnership between management and labour in the rail industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, liberalisation will only work if more funds are invested in the infrastructure. Reference has already been made to the electricity market, to the situation in the United Kingdom, for example. If we liberalise but do not strive to ensure that there are sufficient incentives for investment, there is a real danger that networks will collapse and that the seeds of insecurity will be sown. After all, the aims of competition are to push prices down, which also reduces profit margins for infrastructure operators, and to achieve better or fuller use of the infrastructure. If no compensatory or supporting public investments are made, serious problems can arise.</p>
<p class="contents">I am somewhat saddened by the fact that, following a very good submission or submissions to the Council by the Commission, no clear statement has emerged on investments in the trans-European networks, particularly on additional incentives, in other words the 30% that the Commission is seeking for cross-border projects. We must encourage all the Member States to step up their investment in the rail network, with special emphasis – needless to say – on cross-border measures. How do we want to bring Europe together if there is insufficient investment in the rail infrastructure? I hope that a statement on this point will be forthcoming at the December summit, if not before. And let me reiterate my gratitude to the Commission, which has done so much good groundwork.</p>
<p class="contents">My last prerequisite for the success of liberalisation is the creation of a level playing field. As I have already mentioned, one of the many reasons why road transport has established its supremacy is that road users do not pay the external costs, in other words the environmental costs. They pay neither for the additional wear and tear caused by heavy vehicles nor for the environmental damage caused by vehicle emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has presented a Directive on infrastructure pricing that I do not find entirely satisfactory, because I feel it offers too little scope for the rectification of this imbalance. I do find it alarming, however, to read about what has been happening in the Council, to learn how little approval and support there is for the position adopted by the Commission. I hope that this House will support the Commission more strongly on this issue, and I should like to express my thanks once again to the rapporteurs for their efforts in this direction. Mr Jarzembowski has produced an excellent piece of work. All he has to do now is to make that leap of faith and focus on freight transport; above all, he should fully endorse the position of his esteemed colleague, Commissioner De Palacio, and then we shall arrive at a good decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since last week, I have been able to see with my own eyes that it is indeed possible to do business on the railways in Europe. I visited a private company in Rotterdam that now transports half of its containers by rail: that means a 50% market share compared to the old monopolists that are stuck in their ways. The entry of private entrepreneurs into the market has therefore contributed towards halting the comparative loss of a mode of transport. We must therefore encourage more private players to invest in the use of the railways, so as to secure their future as an alternative mode of transport. I admire and endorse Mr Jarzembowski’s commitment to going the full distance with the railways and also to the aspiration of liberalising passenger transport by 2008. I do hope that the Council adopts this. I should also like to warn, however, that in so doing we must not hinder a number of countries from liberalising freight transport. Here, I am referring in particular to countries such as France and Belgium: although their organisations are investing abroad, they do not permit foreign undertakings to develop activities on their railways. I hope that, by January 2006, that will be a thing of the past, and I do believe that it will. Safety and interoperability go hand in hand, and are also the most important reason why the railways have the potential to be a good, quick and competitive mode of transport compared to road transport. For that to be the case, however, a great deal will have to change.</p>
<p class="contents">I have observed that a train travelling from the Netherlands to southern Germany – through two countries and three <span class="italic">Bundesländer</span> – has seven changes of locomotive. It is absolutely ridiculous that this is supposed to be the alternative to road transport. I am happy, therefore, that there is an excellent proposal on the table here that will enable us to eradicate conditions such as these. It will enable us to ensure that we have uniform training throughout Europe, a single, recognisable, system, which is accessible and also promotes through-travel; thus increasing the real speed of freight railways, and, with it, safety and reliability.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to advocate that a great deal of attention be paid to the interconnection of route plans at international level, therefore. This will clear the way for those wishing to travel by rail to be able to do so. This would necessitate interconnection of routes. Such things must not be organised separately for each <span class="italic">Bundesland</span> and each country. An all-encompassing, integrated approach is required, and I think that it is extremely important that this proposal is on the table. In my opinion, this issue of safety and interoperability presents us with a very good chance of making the railways an attractive mode of transport, alongside road transport and also alongside transport over water. I think that this represents a step that is of considerable importance to freight transport throughout Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their railway lines did not form a coherent network and were mostly inaccessible to other companies with different kinds of trains. Many of those companies went bankrupt or were notable for their poor-quality, frequently interrupted service. When that system failed, State-owned companies came along, and tried to develop a uniform model for their respective countries as far as possible. Rail transport became a core responsibility of the State. We have now reached a phase in which a large-scale uniform European model is aspired to on the one hand, but at the same time a return to the nineteenth century model of individual private companies is being propagated. Those two aims will probably prove difficult to reconcile in practice, and be a constant source of tension. The champions of this model hold up transport companies that have undergone prolific growth in the free market, such as airlines and HGV companies, as an example to the railways, which they see as outmoded. They believe that freedom of competition will lead to growth and make the railways attractive to a broader clientele that has not been using them up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">Others fear that liberalisation will only lead to a separation between profitable and loss-making activities and to cutbacks in infrastructure, service and staff, resulting in a deterioration in safety and a rise in fares. In their view, there are more grounds for entrusting long-distance cross-border transport to effective coordination between the existing State companies or to one individual European company than for making room for new private companies; and measures to restrict environmentally unfriendly air and road transport are a good supplement to that.</p>
<p class="contents">The four reports that are on the agenda today are a product of this major difference of opinion. They all have in common that they envisage an important role for rail transport again in the future, too; and that represents progress in relation to the time when the railways were consigned to the museum of nineteenth century curiosities. Opinion differs widely on the means to achieve this, however.</p>
<p class="contents">The Jarzembowski report is one of an endless succession of attempts at greater and faster liberalisation, not only for cross-border freight transport, but even for domestic passenger transport. Although I am not a supporter of great power on the part of the Council, I hope that, if a majority in this Parliament supports the rapporteur, the Council will restrict such an attempt this time, too.</p>
<p class="contents">The Sterckx report places rather less emphasis on a free market, but takes a fairly centralistic view, such that it leaves insufficient scope for national and regional measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ainardi and Savary reports are aimed at quality for society, users and staff, and thus have my support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is as much the case now as it has been in the development of modern states over the last 200 years.</p>
<p class="contents">These services are needed for economic progress and modernisation, just as the measure of extending the high speed network is also required, at present, in order to dynamise and revitalise productive activity. The rail package, therefore, is not simply a new tool enabling private companies to do business as quickly as possible, but is rather a tool for building the road to political, economic and social integration throughout the Union. My group rejects Mr Jarzembowski’s report, since his approach runs counter to the one outlined above, but will vote in favour of the Sterckx report on safety, the Ainardi report on interoperability, and the Savary report on the European Railway Agency, which are compatible with it.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, as a Galician, and for all inhabitants of nations located far from the geographical centre of Europe, these European Parliament decisions should, of course, be a way for us to gain access to high-speed communication with the whole of Europe. The plan for investment in infrastructure currently being developed by the Commission should share this aim, bearing in mind above all the fact that railways are kinder to nature and also more favourable to social welfare than any other transport network. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Judging from the reactions to the White Paper, that has broad support. The only question is how it should be done.</p>
<p class="contents">A drastic change in attitude is needed within the sector. This package undoubtedly has the potential to contribute to this, provided it is properly developed and implemented. An important element is access to the market. Who receives user rights – and what for? In order to stand up to competition with road transport, forwarders and consignors need comparable freedom. That is to say, the parties involved in freight transport need direct access to the network. Whether it is advisable to claim this for passenger transport, too, in the short term, I venture to doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">If we give entrepreneurs this scope, it is important that we lay down clear rules on use and safety. In our opinion, Mr Sterckx has put his finger on the relevant areas. We agree with most of his proposals, therefore. The same goes for a number of proposals contained in the report by Mrs Ainardi. As regards the functioning of the Agency, the development of the railways in recent decades has not produced what we had hoped. The Agency should therefore provide the impetus for a new direction. We should take this into consideration when it comes to the participation of the various parties concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, we have here a solid package that will hopefully enable us to create some scope for the sector to develop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Iron Rhine is an outstanding example of a European transport line that is useful to an open economy. After all, the Iron Rhine in the Ruhr area of the German hinterland opens up not only the port of Antwerp, but also the ports of Ghent, Zeebrugge and Ostend. The Iron Rhine already exists, and has proved its usefulness in the past, but it fell into disuse some decades ago because the costs of environmental adjustment, such as tunnelling in certain places, became much too high for the line to be made profitable in a short space of time. This, however, is a bogus argument that the Dutch Government hides behind when continually blocking the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowadays, however, Flanders feels the need to reactivate this railway line, in view of the growing problems with container traffic in Flanders, the Netherlands and Germany, which is growing at an exponential rate. Germany, and more particularly the <span class="italic">Bundesland</span> North Rhine-Westphalia, has been supporting Flanders for years in making this economically necessary call.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, the Netherlands is conducting a policy of obstruction in this matter, one that is dictated by its own plans to provide the port of Rotterdam with a modern connection to the Ruhr area via the extortionate and environmentally damaging Betuwe Line, from which, however, not a single European country stands to derive any economic benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">For years, therefore, the situation has been deadlocked in this way: this benefits no one, and has only resulted in great economic damage to the Flemish ports and to container traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that Europe has formally recognised the importance of transnational railway lines, I should like to express my hope, as a Fleming and a <span class="italic">Sinjoor</span>, that a breakthrough – one that offers a satisfactory solution for all parties – be sought at European level in the Iron Rhine dossier that is so important to Flanders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, shipping has been liberalised for a great many years now. Road transport in Europe has been liberalised for a number of years now. The same applies to air transport. I think this is a paradox. There is no justification for why the railways in particular should be shackled and why there should not be a single network and free competition at European level. I should honestly like someone to explain this to me in good faith, not hidden behind the interests of certain groups or companies, but on the basis of the rules of common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">We must always bear in mind that we cannot talk about a single European market if we do not have a single transport network. And unless the rail network is also liberalised, this cannot be achieved. All the more so in that all the political powers of Europe want, theoretically at least, to promote the railways, because they are an environmentally-friendly means of transport. Consequently, it is vital that we proceed with courageous steps in the field of liberalisation and I would honestly say to you that, if I personally had to decide what needed to be done on the railway market, I would liberalise it tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning, of course taking all the steps needed for safety rules, so that we have liberalisation at a high level with no risk to passengers, as is the case in air transport. Having said which, I think it is absurd to continue this debate, which keeps putting the issue off and looks like a rearguard battle which quite simply, in my opinion, seeks to serve specific interests. However, in all events, we need to operate here not on the basis of my personal wishes but on the basis of political consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, for years at the vanguard of the liberalisation of the railways, is quite right to insist on the amendments made at first reading and I hope that, within the framework of the conciliation which will follow, we shall be able, with the Italian Presidency, to find the best possible result by December. I hope that the Commissioner will help us with the statement she has made and which may be used as a final refuge so that, immediately afterwards, we can proceed to liberalise the railway market as far as passengers are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Thereafter, the permanent concern of Parliament, and obviously of our group, is safety. That is why we talk in the Sterckx report of black boxes, as used on ships and in aeroplanes. That is why we talk about European driving licences for train drivers, that is why, in the report by Mrs Ainardi, we raise the question of funding for interoperability, because we want interoperability at a high level and not at a minimum level, as the Council wants. We shall proceed in this spirit, hoping that, by the end of the Italian Presidency at the end of December, we shall have the best possible result on the criterion of the liberalisation of the railway market, not because we consider it an end in itself, but because we believe that it is the best way of serving the European economy, European consumers and the workers themselves, in that more jobs will be created. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Simpson (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I would like to thank all our rapporteurs for their work on a complicated yet important area within the transport brief, namely our railways and the future of our railways.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start with the issue of freight and what has been said about it. In the area of rail freight, the rail industry is presently sitting in the 'last chance saloon'. Unless we all pull together to develop rail freight on a European-wide scale – including opening up national networks, more progress on inter-operability and changes in the way the industry thinks and works – there will be no rail freight to defend or be worth mentioning by the year 2020. It will have disappeared on to the roads mainly, with all the consequences that will entail.</p>
<p class="contents">So I start this morning with a friendly warning to the railway industry that unless it gets its act together, and unless we all work together in the area of rail freight, it will disappear in 20 years or so.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, any action along those lines must be based on cooperation with the trade unions and the social partners. A theme that my group has consistently pushed for, for many years now. In that regard, I welcome some of the agreements recently undertaken between the ETF and the CER, particularly the issue of driving licences, as well as the commitment from the Commission to come forward with a proposal at the end of the year on that subject.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to passengers, I would urge caution. I note that my colleague Mr Hatzidakis says 'be bold'. But the problem with that is that one country that decided to be bold with its railways some years back was the United Kingdom. The result of that 'boldness' was a botched privatisation that caused absolute chaos in the railway industry and has caused the present government to spend a lot more money on the railways than was planned. Yet we still do not have a better service.</p>
<p class="contents">That does not mean that we all retreat into our shells and say that the nationalised railway is the be-all and the end-all. That clearly is not the case. But we need to ensure that nobody makes the same mistakes as the United Kingdom. Liberalisation of the passenger side must proceed step by step.</p>
<p class="contents">In that regard, our rapporteurs have produced a balanced compromise that everyone can live with. We must all remember that providing a railway is not just about profit – it is also about safety – but it is also about service and service levels to the people that are supposed to be transported from one place to another. In the end, people should come before profit but, sadly, that is not always the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now focus briefly on Mr Sterckz's report which I shadowed for my group. I would like to thank him for his work and, in particular, for his efforts to get a compromise solution that is acceptable to us all. He should also be congratulated because the battle with the Council – indeed all our rapporteurs' battles with the Council – has made that work especially difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to say that everybody supports safety. No politician is going to stand up here and say that he does not think safety is important, that is political suicide. It is a matter of getting the balance right between what is practical and what we can do, as well as making sure that the safety levels we have are as high as possible. Sadly, we have had instances on our railways recently where some standards have not been what they should be.</p>
<p class="contents">I again thank the rapporteurs and finish by saying to the railway industry that this is a crucial time for all railways in Europe. For freight, this is the last opportunity. I hope we do not throw it away. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have done excellent work with respect to this important matter. The rapporteurs have addressed the issue thoroughly, listened to various experts and committee members, negotiated, and sought viable compromises, keeping all the while to the main goal, which is to improve the competitiveness, safety and compatibility of the railways. The proposal for a Railway Agency lends further support to this whole objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is important for the Council not to put the brakes on the implementation of the reforms. We have dawdled far too long in the development of the railways. It is high time a competitive alternative with regard to railway transport were established.</p>
<p class="contents">Arguments for implementing the rail package have been put forward many times now. Developing the railways means we can ease congestion on the roads and encourage environmentally friendly transport. A workable railway system and moderately priced and competitive services are important both for congested areas and also the export industry in more remote regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The opening up of competition in freight and passenger transport will encourage the development of rail transport. For this a viable package must be created, with a clear timetable too for opening up competition in the field of passenger traffic. We must be able to make progress in the areas of technical compatibility and safety standards as well as other regulations, so that trains run throughout Europe speedily and safely, offering a competitive alternative for the transport of both freight and passengers. Mr Sterckx’s aim for a high level of safety in rail transport will certainly have the support of everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the Member States in their adoption of national rules will also be important. They should not slow down the long-term process of development, and Member States should obtain the approval of the Commission for new national rules. For safety’s sake it is also important for trains to be equipped with a black box and that the data compiled by the equipment and the way that data is processed are standardised.</p>
<p class="contents">The main task of the Railway Agency will be to promote best practice and facilitate cooperation between the players in the railway sector. The various players in the railway sector must be involved in the work of the Agency but not every Member State can be represented on the Administrative Board. The work of the Agency must nevertheless take account of the different conditions to be found in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Speaking both personally and as a member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, the left-wing group of the European Parliament, I would like to remind you in the clearest possible terms of the principles that must inform the assessment of this European rail package.</p>
<p class="contents">The first principle is that rail transport is a public service. Where rail transport is still a public service, it must remain so. Where liberalisation has severely reduced its status as a public service, this must be restored.</p>
<p class="contents">The second principle is this. Europe is a densely populated continent, with many urban areas. It also has rural and mountainous areas affected by desertification. On our continent rail transport plays an essential role in national and regional development. Only the railways can put a stop to two interrelated tendencies whose consequences are abundantly clear. On the one hand there is the unchecked concentration of people in urban areas and on the other the desertification of the countryside. Together, they are laying waste to our land.</p>
<p class="contents">The third principle is as follows. Rail transport is the only effective answer to the rapidly rising demand to transport more and more people and goods. It is also the only answer to the apparently contradictory but equally important need to preserve our environment and increase the quality of our lives.</p>
<p class="contents">These three principles are convergent and interlinked. These are the grounds on which my group and I oppose the compulsory privatisation of the railways. We also oppose all decisions or measures seeking to regulate the rail industry solely by market forces. Countries that went down this road are in a worse position than those that did not. They are in a worse position as lines have been closed. Worse, they have serious safety problems. I am sure you know which countries I am referring to. I need not name them.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these three principles, our group opposed what I would term Mr Jarzembowski’s compulsive desire for liberalisation. This was also the basis for our rejection of the harmonisation of the networks as proposed in the Sterckx report. We would prefer harmonisation to be less of a herald of liberalisation. We therefore endorsed the Savary report, concerning the creation of a European Railway Agency. Representatives of employees’ organisations would sit on its Administrative Board. Lastly, it was because of these three principles that we voted for Mrs Ainardi’s proposals. The latter provide for social and environmental issues to be taken into account and for high safety requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the decisions of the Council after the first reading, and the recent votes in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, we will again oppose liberalisation of freight transport by 2006 and of passenger transport by 2007. We will establish our final position on the Sterckx report on the basis of the results of the vote on the amendments in plenary. We will continue to support the reports and positions of Mr Savary and Mrs Ainardi. They are in line with the principles we hold dear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Well then, in the twenty-first century, Europe must finally be put back on the railways. That is why this package is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">In the period between the debate at first reading and this debate, however, the facts have demonstrated that it is still too soon to support Mr Jarzembowski’s high-speed rail system. The Sterckx, Ainardi and Savary reports are more in tune with the needs of today. My fellow MEP Mr Jarzembowski is impatient and is already arguing in favour of the accelerated liberalisation of passenger transport. We are already seeing in a few countries the damage this can do to regional cross-border passenger rail transport. Conventional international trains are being cancelled, for example. Service is declining in those cases, therefore.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely it cannot be the case that, in a United Europe, non-TGV cross-border rail traffic, of all things, becomes much more expensive or even disappears. I have already drawn the Commission’s attention to this, in a parliamentary question, and, in its reply, it shares my opinion, calling this ‘an anomaly in the internal market’. Try explaining that to the electorate.</p>
<p class="contents">Another pressing concern is the disappearance of, or change in, the range of international trains that is therefore not being identified. I hope that the European Agency carries out a clear evaluation of this, and that we include this aspect in the debate on trans-European networks. We shall vote against premature liberalisation without a framework of accompanying measures. Mr Simpson has pointed out the potential consequences of this.</p>
<p class="contents">We propose awaiting the proposals that the Commission is going to make at the end of this year with regard to liberalisation. That is the point at which we should hold this debate, Mr Jarzembowski, and I hope that we are still able to get through the first reading here, so that this work is not wasted. Let us first concentrate on freight transport, however, as that surging flow needs to be put on the railways urgently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The initial aim was to put rail transport back on an equal footing in the face of the success of road transport. While road transport is cheaper and more practical in terms of accessibility, it also causes a great deal of pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">From my point of view, I would have preferred interoperability to be firmly implemented. The advocates of this liberalism were spurred on by the Commission’s initial proposal that national and international freight transport should be liberalised. They then set their sights still higher. The European Parliament made a higher bid and declared its support for opening up rail passenger transport to competition at the first reading. Faced with the opposition of the Council, we are now witnessing an attempt to force this through at the second reading. This is quite unacceptable especially as no impact assessment of the first package has demonstrated the benefits of excessive liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we would be afraid of the result. As a member of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, I cannot subscribe to Amendment No 2 or Amendment No 7. They take liberalisation too far. Such liberalisation would particularly affect France. In France, international passenger transport accounts for 20% of rail passenger transport whereas the figure for other countries is between 2 and 7%. The desertification of the least profitable areas of the country is inevitable. What will become of life in country areas? These are of little interest to private operators looking to make a profit. The concept of rail transport is that of a precious public service that contributes to social cohesion and to harmonious national and regional development.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, where liberalisation has been badly managed, there have unfortunately been more and more accidents, indicating a dearth of investment. It has even been necessary to renationalise in some cases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The common position of the Council is 1 January 2006 for opening up international freight services and 1 January 2008 for national freight services. No schedule for passenger rail transport has been established. The Council has adopted a prudent approach taking account of the need to move ahead stage by stage. On the other hand, our rapporteur advocates doing away with the schedule altogether. He proposes instead that all crossborder freight and passenger services be opened up as of 1 January 2006 and all services across the network as of 1 January 2008. We must question whether it is pertinent to lump everything together in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a pressing need to address the underdevelopment of freight transport services affecting many countries. Freight transport tends to be characterised by poor service, prohibitive costs, archaic procedures and constant strikes. This all means that timetables are not kept to. In this respect, the prospect of the appropriately staged liberalisation of services could provide a salutary incentive for national reforms, provided that the highest safety standards are upheld and that the existing quality of passenger services is not compromised.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary, however, to distinguish clearly between freight and passenger services. In many Member States passenger rail services are instrumental in national and regional development. They also have public service responsibilities, which must not be sacrificed to hasty liberalisation. A trend is emerging in certain railway companies. They are passing their duty as public service providers onto local authorities. They are also neglecting the equipment and networks providing important links between regions in order to concentrate solely on the most lucrative lines. It is important to ensure that premature liberalisation does not make this situation worse instead of better. We must ensure that this decline is not accelerated instead of remedied. Premature liberalisation entails the risk of creating areas totally bereft of rail services and of aggravating regional inequalities. This is not what the citizens of the Member States want. It is not what the European Union wants either.</p>
<p class="contents">We prefer the wise approach adopted by the Council to the haste advocated by our rapporteur. We will therefore support the common position of the Council. This provides for access rights for passenger transport services to be addressed within the framework of the third rail package. Madam President, this work will be based on the conclusions drawn from a careful assessment of the first stage of the process. In this assessment, particular attention should be paid to safety, market share and rail freight volumes, the status of companies and employees’ working conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been very important because the maintenance, safety and development of our railway system throughout Europe have to be encouraged and not discouraged. Liberalisation is certainly inevitable; it has got to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Traffic has to come off the roads. Taking traffic straight off roads and on to the railway can only be good for the future. The development of high-speed trains has to be welcomed; it should not be stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">Where I come from – and I am going to be parochial for a little while – we are lucky to have any rail links left at all. We have the Belfast to Dublin rail link, but we have hardly any rail links left in Northern Ireland. TGV is not an option for us. We are lucky to have even ordinary railway links. Indeed, they are even trying to close the important link between Belfast and the port of Larne. I just do not understand this.

<p class="contents">This line has been allowed to run down into poor condition; its safety is questionable and the rolling stock is a disgrace. It is not a solution simply to put more traffic and freight on to our roads. This is a part of our problem. While Northern Ireland may be a very small place compared to other European areas, we need and require railways in Northern Ireland as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe most if not all of those present here today agree that the rapporteurs have done excellent work. They are in fact working on the Council right down to the last moment. They are still requesting greater speed in certain areas, and calling for approaches more in line with what we require. I should like to start by saying it is essential to take account of four variables if the vital importance of the subject we are concerned with today is to be properly recognised and assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the serious situation European transport finds itself in at present, bearing in mind too the forecasts provided by all the studies received. In no way can this be a measured legislative process. On the contrary, essential urgent legislation is called for.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the European variable as presented by the Commissioner. It is crucial to the rationalisation of European transport. Whatever its heritage, no State can attempt to resolve its transport problems without reference to this splendid and vitally important European variable. This variable is essential. There needs to be a holistic European approach to transport problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, nothing other than an integrated analysis is appropriate. It is essential to understand the situation of each of the forms of transport. They all need to be involved in the solution. Railway transport is in a critical position in the context of the other forms of transport. This must be remedied.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, each individual form of transport is not important in itself. What is actually important is interoperability between them. I trust rail transport will receive a new lease of life thanks to these reports and proposals. Unfortunately, although to date directives have operated efficiently in Europe, trains have not.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be stated unambiguously that our current mission is to save the railways. That is what we are about. As Mr Simpson clearly stated, the railways are in decline. Parliament hopes to reinvigorate and strengthen them and get them back on track. Liberalisation is the only way to do so. The time for monopolies is past. In a monopoly, the railway waits for freight to arrive on its doorstep. The employees sit tight in their offices. That is how monopolies operate. By contrast, orderly, appropriate and socially responsible liberalisation involves going out to companies and local authorities in search of freight. Freight has to be sought out.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that safety should be the only consideration governing the deadlines. No other reason is sufficiently powerful to be allowed to delay liberalisation of the railways. It has to be recognised that safety is vital. Delays could be tolerated in the interests of safety. Safety must never be used as a pretext for artificially delaying the entry into service of the various sections, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, these reports will highlight the importance of finance and bring it to the attention of all concerned. The railways need finance. There are no adequate budget lines for the purpose. Parliament proposed setting up a European transport fund. This proposal should be developed further in the next financial perspective. Safety is certainly the crucial factor where the railways are concerned. I would venture to remind you also, Commissioner, that road safety is another area of concern for us. We would welcome an initiative by you to ensure that the European Road Safety Agency is presented at the earliest opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, I would like to draw your attention to the untenable situation of the Italian railway line between Savona and the border with France; a rail link connecting western Liguria with the Cote d’Azur.</p>
<p class="contents">This single track – I repeat, single track – line is a bottleneck for freight and passenger rail traffic, causing substantial damage to the economy of the area, which is dependent on tourism, olive-growing as well as the production of flowers and fruit and vegetables. The single track also increases safety risks and such a shortfall in the rail system has repercussions on road traffic, with serious congestion problems and pollution in an area that is heavily geared towards tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been talk of laying a second track since the 1950s, when I was still a small boy. Since then, the situation has not changed and increases in the volume of traffic make it even more critical, almost unsustainable, due to the continual delays that are building up and also affecting the adjoining French section of the line.</p>
<p class="contents">Relatively recent works have moved further inland some sections of the railway line – also single track – that runs right along the coast and is therefore subject to coastal erosion. This has worsened the state of affairs because it has caused further bottlenecks.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude with the hope that, as part of revitalising the international networks in the European Union, a speedy solution will be found by 1 January 2006, the date set for opening the rail networks to all types of rail freight services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Far from learning the lessons of the liberalisation in Great Britain, Germany and elsewhere, the reports by Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Sterckx in fact propose only that liberalisation be speeded up and made the norm. Not only international and national freight but also passenger traffic is from now on to be exposed to the laws of the jungle prevailing in the market. The proposed standardisation will take place only on the basis of the lowest common denominator, to the detriment of high safety standards and in such a way as to encourage social dumping, as in the case of road transport. This ultra-liberal position must therefore be rejected. To adopt it would be, on a long-term basis, to turn our backs on the prospect of putting in place a European public rail transport service. As an MEP, I shall not wait for the next disasters to be announced before joining forces at European level with rail users and railway staff to thwart these trends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should mainly like to focus on the development of rail transport rather than safety, interoperability and suchlike. In the first instance, these seem to me to be excellent reports. The importance of this development of the railways to the environment and to safety is of course abundantly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The first rail package was aimed at opening up freight transport, particularly internationally, and set a specific date. We fought hard for that, and we actually agreed at the time that we would keep our hands off passenger rail transport until there was a separate document about it. In my opinion, Parliament is going two steps too far: firstly, in going ahead and talking about liberalisation of countries at internal level, and, secondly, as regards the liberalisation of passenger transport, in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is a lever for negotiations, I can understand it. In my view, however, we should drop it immediately and wait until the Commission makes a proposal following a detailed evaluation of the situation in a number of countries, particularly in the UK (privatisation), the Netherlands and several other countries. These are experiencing great problems as a result of splitting up companies. It already starts with deregulation; it already starts with the division of companies. As an industrial engineer, with knowledge of the way companies should be organised, I say that it is necessary to keep a firm hold on the maintenance of materials and other things, for example. We should go back to that. We should have an evaluation first, and then a debate on how to proceed with this kind of liberalisation. I wholeheartedly support the position of the Council in this connection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In principle, some might view this as a positive development, since it could provide the UK with new market opportunities in other Member States. However, even my limited experience has taught me to be cynical. Whereas the UK market is largely open, according to single market principles, regrettably the same cannot be said for many other Member States. France, Belgium and Luxembourg remain solidly against completing freight liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The safety directive has introduced a European Railway Agency so that all national safety regulations henceforth can only be introduced by prior consultation and notification to the Commission, thus enabling the Commission to examine draft national rules and question them if it wants. So out of the window goes any possibility of introducing urgent Member States' legislation if national rail safety so requires. This, in my view, is yet another example of the nanny super-state, where Brussels supposedly knows best. Try telling that to our fishermen and farmers! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rail package makes a contribution to the liberalisation and modernisation of rail transport in Europe, even though work on this is not yet finished. New EU rules provide the railway sector with a new framework. Nevertheless, this sector needs to develop its own economic strength if it is to contribute to solving Europe’s traffic and transport problems. If it does not, other modes of transport will finish the job. The railways can still learn a good deal from them.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to express my opinion on the report by Mr Jarzembowski about the development of the rail network. In so doing I should like to thank him personally once more for his work as a rapporteur. He deserves praise for striving for the complete liberalisation of freight transport by 2006. In view of the comparatively international nature of this mode of transport, it is a logical development that this market be opened up quickly. As regards the European railway sector, there is still no genuine internal market in spite of efforts in the context of the common transport policy. The railways directive has not led to a complete opening-up of the market. The railways are still unable to compete with road, water and air transport in many cases. The amendment of the Directive on the development of the Community’s railways would, in my view, contribute to a positive development in this regard. In addition, there must above all be a change in attitude in the sector itself, too.</p>
<p class="contents">The present rail package holds out the possibility of a genuine European rail transport market. For example, granting what are known as ‘authorised applicants’ (consignors and forwarders) the right to use the services of the railways is a step in the right direction towards a more efficient use of the infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent reports of forthcoming cooperation between the German, French and Italian operators of high-speed trains on the construction of train units are a signal that European cooperation is getting up steam; and now on electricity, too. The momentum currently existing with regard to the rail package is not unconditional, however. The European Council makes a more definite distinction than the European Parliament here between the liberalisation of freight transport on the one hand, and the liberalisation of passenger transport on the other. In my opinion, the liberalisation of freight transport is more important than that of passenger transport at this time. The liberalisation of freight transport must not fall victim to fighting between Parliament and Council on this matter. It is of the utmost importance that we have a complete rail package by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hold the report by Mr Sterckx in high regard. Maintaining high safety standards, whilst preventing the protection of abuses on our own market, is a good combination of priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the reports by Mrs Ainardi and Mr Savary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So far, we have ignored the reality that there are some parts of Europe that are not connected by a land bridge or indeed rail tunnel.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from one of those islands, the island of Ireland that does not have a tunnel connecting the rest of Europe, or indeed a land bridge. Much of the debate, therefore, about opening up rail links and so forth to some extent goes over our heads. Having said that, we have a population of 4 million people, and we export 90% of our production. We need good internal links between our major urban centres, and we need good links to our major ports so that our goods can be shipped out effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, I am quite keen on the idea the Commission recently mentioned – and perhaps the Commissioner might listen to what I have to say – in relation to 'motorways of the sea'. This is quite interesting to those of us who live on the island of Ireland in terms of having our goods transported and sold.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point I want to make is that rail internally, both on the continent of Europe and in Ireland, is important as a public service. It is not going to be possible to ensure the free and fast flow of goods and people around the continent, or indeed on the island of Ireland, unless we have fast, efficient, safe and comfortable rail services, not only to and from our major urban centres, but also to provide cohesion in those parts of our continent whether there is underdevelopment.</p>
<p class="contents">The major financiers who would be interested in cherrypicking the key commuter belt rail services are not interested in providing rail services in the western corridor of the island of Ireland, for instance. But that is essential if we are going to provide any kind of proper spatial development to ensure that the population does not drift entirely to the eastern coast.</p>
<p class="contents">These are aspects that need to be addressed. This is why I am quite keen on the idea of the European Rail Agency proposed in the Savary report, because there are a lot of other aspects in this rail debate which need to be addressed, both in terms of the commercial life of Europe, but also its spatial development and the development of cohesion. That, after all, is an objective of the Lisbon process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the majority of European countries, the rail infrastructure has in large part been put in place with state money, that is to say with taxpayers’ money. Now that this infrastructure exists, a horde of private businesses is hurling itself upon this sector so as to be able to derive profit from it. Apart from the fact that it is a case of fraud and of collective funds being misappropriated and directed towards private groups, it also constitutes a danger for the future. The British experience has shown that, in order to increase their profits, private companies cut back on staff and make savings on infrastructure and maintenance, so putting passenger safety seriously at risk. This also leads to stations being closed and unprofitable lines being done away with, even if they are essential to the population to which they provide a service and which then has no choice but to use the roads.</p>

We urgently need an end to social dumping. It is a scandal that the Italian Presidency of the Council is not putting the Markov report on its agenda. It is a scandal that road and air carriers are still not required to foot the bill for the social costs of their respective transport operations; we need an internalising mechanism along the lines of the Swiss model.</p>
<p class="contents">The great demise of the railways, incidentally, is not confined to freight traffic. Are you aware that even a privately operated passenger service such as the Thalys high-speed link between Paris and Brussels is not profitable? In fact, all European passenger lines are running at a loss today, and liberalisation will not change that. In other words, we need less ideology and more political action; we need investments in the infrastructure, financial compensation for anti-rail dumping on the basis of the model we have in the domain of renewable sources of energy, where we subsidise losses to compensate for the fact that producers of energy from non-renewable sources do not pay for their environmental impact, and, thirdly, an end to social dumping. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, I feel that rapid liberalisation of the rail sector in all the Member States would favour this mode of transport as a credible alternative to rail and road transport, and as a means of combating the explosion in these sectors, which have disastrous effects on the environment and on regional planning.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, this liberalisation can only be understood in the broad sense of greater competition in both the freight and passenger transport sectors, at both national and international levels. This liberalisation will mean that any Community rail transport company will have fair and equal access to infrastructure in all the Member States for commercial ends.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already had occasion to emphasise, however, we need to fight against a very widely-held prejudice: liberalising rail transport does not mean that safety standards cannot be stepped up. This rail package actually enables safety regulations to be toughened, in particular by harmonising working times and rest periods for train drivers and other train staff performing safety tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Since technology enables extremely high levels of safety, there is no good reason why legislators should be content to pass laws providing less protection for passengers. For instance, installing black boxes on trains is another safety measure that I completely endorse. Since these devices have proved to have clear benefits in the air and road sectors, in lorries and on buses, I cannot conceive of any justification for not applying the same technology on the railways. I insist that safety must have top priority, and would also like to express my support for the establishment of a European Railway Agency, which would permit a higher degree of interoperability and safety of the various trans-European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot end this speech without levelling some harsh criticism at the EU’s new priority projects scheme, known as the Quick-Start Programme. With a view to stimulating economic growth in Europe through large-scale projects, the Commission has drawn up a list of 13 initiatives, seven of them linked to rail transport. It is regrettable that the list only benefits transport networks in the centre of the European Union, failing to include the Iberian TGV links between Lisbon and Madrid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have accepted this as a worthwhile experiment, partly because it is not beyond the bounds of possibility – although this is by no means proven – that it will help increase the amount of goods transported, and partly because it will enable a more detailed comparison to be made between rail and road transport, with the latter having, from the start, been familiar with the dual approach being introduced by the Community to the railways.</p>
<p class="contents">The same reasons have led us to oppose the ceaseless efforts on the part of the right to anticipate the possible parameters of passenger transport, the Commission’s proposal, the current wishes of the Council of Ministers and, above all, the Commission’s evaluation of experience, included by Parliament at first reading in the draft directive. This constant push on the part of the right towards anticipating liberalisation demonstrates what we have persisted in saying, namely that, for many, liberalisation is only a back door to privatisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have voted against such anticipation by rejecting Mr Jarzembowski’s report, and we shall continue to do so. In spite of the many and varied efforts made by Mr Sterckx, we have also voted against his report on safety. In spite of many major improvements, emphasised by my colleague Mr Savary, Mr Sterckx’ report does in fact ratify what has been accepted by the Council of Ministers, namely the subordination of safety to profitability. The fact that Europe – a little, a lot or passionately, depending upon the circumstances – contributes to making safety dependent upon profitability, even though experience clearly shows that liberalisation, by its nature, increases the risks, says a lot about the wayward liberal approach to European integration. Acceptance of this notion is all the more dangerous in as much as, once it has taken root in the railway sector, it will spread like a cancer to the other means of transport. For this reason, among others, my colleagues and I shall therefore also continue to oppose Mr Sterckx’ report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all believe that we need to work to ensure that there is the necessary shift of demand for and burden on certain means of transport, road and air in particular, to avoid congestion and problems caused by excessive use, and subsequent overloading. It is, to some extent, a question of moving from intentions to facts and to specific proposals, guaranteeing competitive prices, safety, reliability and, above all, the provision of the infrastructure and the investment needed to optimise the available alternatives, beginning with the railways.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is necessary, I must honestly admit that I never thought that the opening up of the market and the processes of liberalisation would, in themselves, be the sole answer, a kind of a shortcut to a miracle. They have to be subject to certain conditions: if we remove ideological pretexts and inflexibility, then we must recognise that they can help and facilitate these processes. On certain conditions, of course: without a doubt, all aspects of safety, professionalism and the social protection that have to be provided for in the processes of opening up the markets and competition, are indispensable, precisely to avoid competition being achieved to the detriment of these factors and guarantees; in the same way, it is also necessary to increase the provision of universal services and services of public interest in order, once again, to prevent competition from concentrating investment and management interests solely in strong market areas where demand is high, disregarding the situations where the supply of services is crucial, rather, for encouraging and driving forward development processes, in other words to respond to what are actually inalienable needs for both freight and passenger transport services.</p>
<p class="contents">Subject to these conditions, there must be fixed deadlines for liberalisation, although not too short, because it is only under these conditions that it is possible to guarantee private resources are contributed to infrastructure investment projects. Otherwise, they could be destined to be delayed because of the chronic difficulties that we have, as we know, in raising the necessary public funds to complete these processes. We need to guarantee the principle of reciprocity in this context, as stated in the amendments tabled before Parliament, because we believe that this will avoid distortion of the market, which has already occurred in other liberalisation processes. I hope that adequate solutions can be found which take into consideration these principles and choices in our negotiations with the Council too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must once more express my regret that we in Parliament have never managed to engage in a comprehensive discussion of this subject instead of focusing our deliberations on one mode of transport at a time, on the basis of the project under consideration. Had we been able to have such a discussion, I believe we could have broken down certain prejudices that rear their heads in every debate.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, liberalisation is something that can only take place – and road transport, I believe, illustrates this very well – if we accompany it with supporting regulatory measures. These measures relate to safety, working conditions, the right to practise a trade and other factors, including technical interoperability. It is our task to make this happen, and what we have on the table today is, in my opinion, a considerable step forward which will enable us to discuss not only the liberalisation of rail transport but also accompanying measures that will meet the requirements to which I have referred. Must liberalisation mean social dumping? Not in my view. Does it have to result in job losses? Again, the answer is no. And does liberalisation mean less safety? Not at all, as I believe is very clearly illustrated in Mr Sterckx’s report . Britain is not a good example for us, and no one in this House would want to follow it. What we have tabled here relates to the very thing that was not done in Britain, namely proper preparation of the liberalisation process. And let me say to the Members from Belgium and France that jobs are already being lost at the present time. In my own country of Belgium, for example, the railways’ share of the transport markets is falling; in ten years the number of private sidings has fallen to a third of its former level; this means that the rail industry has not furnished proof of its efficiency, and as a result of this it has been gradually shedding jobs. Anyone who warns us that jobs will be lost and forgets that they are already being lost now, when the railways are still in the public sector, has not, to my mind, assessed the situation fairly and objectively.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to grasp the nettle in our own countries too and acknowledge that our governments have been underfunding the railways and that we have not provided our rail operators with the resources they would need to organise tomorrow’s large-scale rail network. We must also recognise that the wage bills these institutions have to meet are far too high and that national governments must intervene here too in the first instance. I have no wish to become obsessed with dates, but I should like to point out that it would be bad for the railways and for our countries if we in this House did not set any deadlines, because we are convinced that tomorrow’s transport map will cover the whole of Europe, and this development must not be stopped in its tracks by special measures and special rules in the small countries.</p>

A number of different approaches were put forward. Everyone seems to agree, however, that this is the last opportunity to give a real boost to the rail sector. It is the last chance to make rail a competitive form of transport in the twenty-first century. Thus, it is the last chance to ensure rail becomes a genuine alternative to road for freight transport. That is the first task. It is being completed today by means of this second rail package. The next challenge will be to make rail a genuine alternative form of passenger transport also.</p>
<p class="contents">We totally agree that a number of actors will emerge once the railways are fully integrated in the field, when a European railway network is in place and geographical integration a reality. Competition will then come about. This will result in better services, prices and quality and increased competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for funds was also mentioned. Funds are required to carry out the necessary technological changes in the years to come. These changes will secure the existence of a Trans-European network transcending current borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I should point out that new proposals for amendments to the regulation give priority to this factor with regard to the Trans-European networks. You will nonetheless be aware that in the context of the financial perspective after 2007, I am proposing an eight or nine-fold increase of the funds allocated to these networks. I am actually proposing that in excess of EUR 4 000 million be set aside for this purpose each year. The rail sector will certainly be a priority then, along with the accomplishment of a Trans-European railway network, or to put it in other words, interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the human factor, this is crucial. We will be presenting the third rail package for passenger transport. In addition though, we shall deal with the whole issue of qualifications, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure we all realise safety is absolutely essential in the rail sector. It is essential for any form of transport. The railways certainly have a fine tradition to live up to. It is important to maintain and build on this tradition. Indeed, it should be developed further and common criteria shared across the European network.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the House already helped to ensure the survival of the railways by supporting the first rail package. This second rail package will allow Parliament to make a further contribution to ensuring that our railways do not end up as relics of the past. They need to become the network of the future, dedicated to the service of society and of the common good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
