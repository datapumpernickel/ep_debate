<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pronk (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, this is a report on health and safety. There have been many, but this report stands out because it will be the first report to be adopted under codecision, provided that, tomorrow, the House agrees with our recommendations to indeed approve the agreement with the Council. I believe that this is what is of such historic importance about this report. In fact, it is also the first report in the social sphere that has ever gone through under codecision. Parliament has always made a fuss about the fact that not enough emphasis has been placed on the social dimension in legislative practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not encounter a great deal of problems with the Council regarding this report. This is also reflected in the number of amendments which this Parliament brought at second reading. We do have to note, of course, that all this took rather a long time. This special directive implements the framework directive which was adopted in 1989. Our first reading was in 1996. It is now 1999. The directive will not enter into effect until 2003. This illustrates that it sometimes all takes longer sometimes than expected. If we consider the numbers of people still being killed due to unsafe working conditions, then more urgency is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">So what was the key point in the negotiations with the Council? This is when codecision proves so important. It mainly concerned the publication of what we have agreed upon here. We at the Parliament requested right from the outset that companies be informed of European legislation. This legislation is, of course, also included in national legislation, albeit in a covert way. Moreover, national legislation is far from adequately disseminated. Initially, the Council was strongly opposed to this. We went through some tough negotiations. It is, of course, a little ironic that a provision which may prove important to all companies should be kept more or less concealed. </p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my second point of concern. We now have more or less an actual framework of minimum directives in terms of health and safety. This is of great importance. A number of countries have not yet implemented certain directives. The Commission should be commended for bringing a number of these countries before the Court of Justice over the past couple of years and also for the fact that changes have been made. But it appears that it still takes much longer to tackle countries in this sector than it does in others. This is regrettable. Practical benchmarking, however, which is very important, is still not up to scratch because, after all, what it comes down to is that more or less the same minimum requirements apply within a company, be it in Denmark or in Spain. This benefits competitive relationships but it mainly benefits those employed within those companies. </p>
<p class="contents">If there is no exchange, if the practical benchmarks are not equal, then something else is still lacking. We have the strong impression that this still has not been regulated terribly well. This is the very reason why this vade mecum, as we called it initially, is so important. It may be of interest that this vade mecum has now turned into a guide. Why is this? It is because the Council could not come to terms with the word “vade mecum” for some unknown reason. The term vade mecum is understood in most European countries without any explanation, without a translation and a complex, long, reasonably procedural title will, of course, be less easily understood. But Parliament made this concession. We will not dwell on this any further. </p>
<p class="contents">It remains important, however, that everyone is informed of these directives and, above all, that they can apply them. A whole raft of companies do not apply those directives properly. This is not because they refuse to, it is simply because they are not sufficiently aware of the possibilities for applying them. Such a guide may be helpful in this, and this is how we voluntarily reach not harmonisation but minimum standards. I think that this is how we will gradually grow closer together.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to take a much harder line on this practical benchmarking than it has done in the past. We have a new Commissioner and I know that she has a great deal of experience in this field. Maybe we can expect fresh momentum in this respect too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Skinner (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I am a great believer in health and safety, but I am also a great believer that we are not going to change everything by legislation. If we could legislate away things like poverty, accidents, illness and death, then we should have done it yesterday, but we are not going to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, there are things we can do at European level, which include changing the culture, the culture where we work, the culture we live in. This report by Mr Pronk goes some way towards doing that and doing it very well. He should be congratulated on all that, because he has brought excellent conclusions into this report. He has made history as well, by having the first report to go through under codecision and the first report on health and safety. It augurs very well for the future of what we should hope to achieve through this process, because Parliament has been very responsible in its approach to using codecision. Parliament is not always pointed to as being responsible or informed, but in this particular area we were better informed and, in some respects, I feel, more responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">It has made spectacular progress in the area of small to medium-sized enterprises, by far the biggest sector we could ever hope to address. This is where most accidents occur in the workplace and yet there is undisguised dismay amongst myself and other colleagues at the fact that we take very little account of this. You are 50% more likely to have an accident at work if you work for a small to medium-sized business. The information which will be provided, which was a vade mecum in this report, to small businesses and which they now have a right to be informed about, will go a long way in helping to change the culture in the workplace. It should be used in other reports in other areas, and we should learn from that.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, as a participant in the conciliation process, I was pleased at the very real response of the Council to Parliament’s amendments and take note for future reference about how we can achieve the various amendments and positions we wish. Under the former procedure of cooperation of course we had our successes and the Commission was very much a part of that, and we still enjoy that acceptable relationship. Safety is one of those areas where we can always find middle ground to achieve what we really want.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time now for governments to listen to what this Parliament has to say 100% of the time and for those governments to act. Parliament is not in opposition to other institutions, it is a balance and it is a brake. It is unfortunately precisely because ministers were too close together, too keen to have cosy relationships away from scrutiny at European level, that we now have this process. It introduces transparency and clarity, and that can only be good for the trust of the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Many lives will be affected by this report and the work that has gone into it, many businesses will be pleasantly surprised by the balanced outcome, and if there was more work like this, perhaps even Europe would become popular in places like Britain, who knows? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is vital to protect the safety of employees anywhere in Europe, or anywhere in the world, for that matter. It is regrettable that I did not get involved in this report until later because I was elected for the first time in July. As Mr Pronk indicated, they have been working on this since 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">Why did I say this? It is an excellent report and we give it our full backing, but it is regrettable that, in my opinion, the warning panel, in particular, is still rather unclear: a triangular panel with a red border and black letters spelling "EX". To someone like me, a layperson in the field of explosive atmospheres, this could mean anything. Is it a warning concerning my ex-partner who can be rather explosive? Are they explosives or whatever? I think it would be a good idea if the same panel, the same warning sign or pictogram, could be used as is used throughout the international world of transport. In fact, I also brought this to Committee, I even sent a letter questioning this very point. I received a reply, upon which I do not wish to elaborate. I do hope, however, that in the short term, the same warning panel will be used across the board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall stand up anyway, although I am far too tall for this device. </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done. What did occur to me, however, even as a new Member, was that the original proposals have been toned down quite considerably and that he is actually deeply regretful, despite what has been achieved. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the need for this type of directive is underlined regularly, and especially the fact that it is an evolving process. In the Netherlands, for example, there have been a number of explosions at the same factories year after year, caused by dust. The knowledge as to how exactly this happened is lacking. </p>
<p class="contents">Another repercussion is that repair activities are carried out by hired companies. As a result, the overall business layout is unclear, especially to these temporary staff. This is exactly why it is important to characterise and classify companies, workstations and suchlike effectively, and to divide these into areas, etc. This is included in the proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, a cause for great concern that, although there are minimum directives, no obligations have been laid down pursuant to the guide we discussed, let alone the provisions to be included therein. I would therefore ask the Commissioner how the new practices will be developed technically and how the effects of hiring temporary staff will be dealt with. In other words, have an evolving process but still ensure that there are substantial obligations in respect of minimum directives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is particularly significant and interesting from a political point of view that, as Mr Pronk stated, we have, for the first time since the Amsterdam Treaty, a piece of legislation addressing social issues, in particular health and safety issues, which has been passed through under the codecision procedure. The directive is extremely important and concerns workers in particularly hazardous places who are exposed to explosive atmospheres. As you know, this follows a long dialogue and extensive negotiations between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament on this matter. </p>
<p class="contents">Despite it taking so long, almost four years, to achieve this result, Parliament’s insistence on certain amendments has proved to be fruitful. With reference to Mr Pronk’s report, I too should like to stress that the adoption of Amendment Nos 4 and 5 on information to undertakings and vade mecum, which I agree could be improved and made more binding – not forgetting that these amendments were accepted at second reading – just goes to show the importance of the codecision and cooperation procedures of Parliament and the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the matter of the application of this directive. Of course, it is not the application of this particular directive which raises problems, but of all directives. Admittedly, the Commission’s control mechanism is not tight enough to monitor all the Member States and all the directives that are passed. Nevertheless, I did state, and this is a commitment on the part of the Commission, that every effort would be made, in collaboration with the Member States and in collaboration with all the Directorates and Commission mechanisms, to achieve the best results. </p>
<p class="contents">As to the question of how it will be applied to companies themselves, whether there will be problems with subcontracting and part-time employment, I should like to tie my answer in with the Commission’s other policies and measures. Thus, how undertakings are linked and how sub-contracting works is up to each Member State. Nevertheless, special training for workers and special programmes for the health and safety of workers and employers are included in the employment strategy guidelines and are funded by the European Social Fund and we also have benchmarking between countries in order to improve health and safety conditions as best we can. </p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I concur with Mr Skinner that we cannot merely legislate away such a serious problem as health and safety but we believe there can be constant improvement in conjunction with policies, with resources from the social funds and, of course, with the policies of Member States.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
