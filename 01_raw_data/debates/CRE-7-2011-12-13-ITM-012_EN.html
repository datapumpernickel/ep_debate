<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Madam President, may I, through Ms De Keyser, send my condolences to those who have lost loved ones or who have been injured in this terrible event in Liège.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for the opportunity to talk about the EU-Russia Summit which, as honourable Members know, will take place in Brussels beginning tomorrow evening. Let me first say a few words by way of opening on the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">As honourable Members know, parliamentary elections to the State Duma were held on 4 December. When we discussed in July in this House the preparations for those elections, I expressed then some concerns, especially regarding restrictions to political pluralism. Following up on those observations today, the prior exclusion of various opposition parties has been confirmed as a key flaw of those elections. In addition, we have seen reports about procedural violations such as a lack of media impartiality and the lack of clear separation between political party and state.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also expressed concern at the detention of protesters demonstrating for free and fair elections, and reports of police violence against activists, journalists and mere observers. In contrast, the large demonstrations over the weekend in Russia were peaceful and the authorities, in my view, generally handled them very well.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the instructions by President Medvedev for all accusations of irregularities to be properly investigated. The electoral legislation that exists in Russia provides for appeal and rectification, and we expect of course that this legislation will be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The evidence needs to be looked at, and OSCE/ODIHR and other organisations will issue their final reports in due course. Their findings must be addressed by the authorities in order to allow for smooth and fair presidential elections in March.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also recognise that the Russian people have made full use of existing possibilities to express their dissatisfaction with some aspects of the political situation. To many commentators’ minds, voters expressed their views on issues such as corruption, the lack of political freedoms and their economic situation by voting for other parties, bringing down the registered result for the leading United Russia party from 64% in 2007 to less than 50% now. Thus, the citizens have passed a clear message, and it certainly has not gone unnoticed. Both President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin have acknowledged receipt. The future development of democratic institutions in Russia, as I said in July, should depend on the Russian people and their choices.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU though is not a bystander. We have close links from the economy to family ties and our common history. When acting together, as strategic partners, the EU and Russia can have a decisive influence on key challenges and conflict situations around the globe. We have also taken joint commitments to develop democratic institutions and human rights in the UN, the Council of Europe and the OSCE frameworks.</p>
<p class="contents">We will, of course, be raising our concerns about the elections at the upcoming EU-Russia Summit tomorrow. For us, modernisation means both Russia’s full integration into the international rules-based system and the development of citizens’ rights and freedoms and I am pleased to report that this approach of constructive engagement does work. The summit may actually produce a number of results.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me mention Russia’s WTO accession first, which should be officially decided in Geneva on Friday. As Russia’s largest trading partner by far, the EU was a crucial partner in the 18-year-long negotiations. As former Trade Commissioner, I had my own personal experience in this process. WTO accession will be a historic moment which will open a new chapter in our bilateral relations. It will bind Russia to international trading rules, open new opportunities for trade and investment and protect our companies from arbitrary decisions. WTO accession should also give new momentum to negotiations on the new EU-Russia Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">On visas and mobility, the Presidents will be approving a list of common steps towards visa-free travel, full implementation of which should lead to the opening of visa waiver negotiations. This process implies a significant modernisation in areas like migration policy and border management, but also guarantees for the respect of fundamental rights. Improved mobility and people-to-people contacts will bring our people closer together and facilitate the exchange of experience and values, cultural cooperation and business.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the Partnership for Modernisation is under full implementation, with new projects being prepared. At the summit, we will re-emphasise our conviction that modernisation is not only about technology. Rule of law, protection of citizens’ rights, civil society engagement, and a level playing field for companies are all crucial elements of successful modernisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish with a few words on foreign policy. Russia is a major partner for the EU. Sergei Lavrov and I meet regularly and try to build common approaches to the most pressing international issues. Generally we succeed, but in some cases our positions differ. The obvious example at the moment is Syria, which will no doubt be under discussion at the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to advance on protracted conflicts. On Transnistria, we have managed to restart formal 5+2 talks. Progress on substance now needs to follow. We will continue to engage in order to support the mediation efforts over Nagorno-Karabakh by the Minsk Group, in which Russia is a member. As I mentioned earlier, I visited the South Caucasus last month and we are concerned about the lack of progress in these talks, as tension is very clear throughout the region. And we will continue to engage Russia over Georgia, where Russia still needs to fully implement the commitments it made in the August and September 2008 agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude. As you see, we have a broad agenda with Russia, which reflects the way in which our economies, our societies and our strategic concerns are increasingly intertwined. As we remove barriers to trade, travel and exchange, the outlook and expectations of our citizens can be expected more and more to converge and the fundamental interest of cooperation will increase.</p>
<p class="contents">Our ambition is for EU relations with Russia to be the engine for this modernisation process, which we have always maintained must be both economic and political. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think the most significant change that has happened is in the minds and attitudes of the Russian people, who have lost their indifference towards politics, who are taking an active part in monitoring elections and protesting against the rigging of the same.</p>
<p class="contents">And the second thing we have to take note of is that Mr Putin’s party has become a minority party. At a meeting last week with Russian opposition leaders, together with Mr Kasparov, in Brussels, it became very clear that even this figure of 49% is not trustworthy and that the real result might be much lower, about 30%.</p>
<p class="contents">Now there is a question for the EU and we must consider our opportunities: what to do, how to change and how to help restore democracy in Russia? I think that business as usual will not do it. As the Russian author, Lilia Shevtsova has said, Russian style thus far has been to pretend that they do have democracy and the style of European leaders has been to pretend that we believe this. This time has now passed and we have to react in a similar way to how we reacted to the Arab Spring. There might be a Russian Spring also and we need to take this into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would ask the High Representative to convey to our Russian counterparts the message that we take democracy seriously, we take the intentions of Russian voters and the Russian population seriously, and that their leaders have to change their style. This includes also putting restrictions upon officials who are guilty in the Magnitsky case and also of rigging elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, in the dialogue we have to have with the leadership in Russia and the energy dialogue and, of course, the conclusion of WTO entry. We have the visa liberalisation and we have the partnership and cooperation agreement on which we should work. I hope we can have a real restart on the issue. Of course, we have also the election question, as you just mentioned and thank you very much for your very clear position, High Representative.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a sign of the maturity of the Russian population and of their unwillingness, as my colleague said, to accept everything coming from the Kremlin or the White House – the Russian White House, I mean – and I think we should support all civil society that is trying to convince the political establishment that another way is much better: an open way, a democratic way. I think this is the line we should follow. As we now have in our joint resolution, and as you said, High Representative, we call on the commission that was set up by Mr Medvedev to look into the matter seriously, openly and frankly. I was, together with Mr Fleckenstein, in Russia at the beginning of November. We saw already at that time that there would be serious flaws in the election, and we hope that a good result comes out of this research and inquiry. I would suggest, and have suggested, to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, together with the delegation, holding a hearing in the European Parliament in January with representatives of all the parties – of the parties who could run, with the parties who were prevented from running, with civil society, with the OSCE, in order to have a real open picture.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I will reject now an appeal in our joint resolution about the parliament’s re-election to be repeated. Let us wait and look into the detail, let us look into the facts. Maybe we will come to a result; maybe even the Medvedev commission will come to a result that in some areas it should be repeated. I think we should have a clear position and have real facts on the table before we come to these conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Taking into account the preliminary conclusions of international and local monitoring organisations, the legitimacy of the newly elected State Duma is at best questionable. By extensive ballot stuffing, vote rigging and not allowing several opposition parties to register, the people of Russia were not granted their constitutional right to choose their representatives in free and fair elections and frankly, like many Russian people, I personally do not believe President Medvedev’s promises to check up the results of the last elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Russia is, and will remain, an important partner to the EU, our economic interests may not overshadow the principles of democracy that the European Union stands for. Thus, the EU should thoroughly review how to proceed with a partner that lacks the necessary mandate to represent its citizens. Yeltsin’s Russia is in the past and now we are dealing with Putin’s authoritarian state.</p>
<p class="contents">The idealistic approach that we can prevent the Kremlin from turning Russia into an authoritarian state by working as peers in different organisations has obviously failed. The harsh truth is that with Putin and his cronies in the Kremlin, it is unlikely that the long-term objectives or the values of the EU and Russia could be conciliated.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I would call on the High Representative to insist that all the peaceful demonstrators who were arrested by the Russian authorities are released. Second, the Russian authorities must be reminded of their international obligations stemming, in particular, from Russia’s membership of the Council of Europe and the OSCE. Russia must hold new elections – free and fair elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose and success of our modernisation partnership will depend on whether the Russian state is prepared to enter into a similar modernisation partnership with its own people and to restructure Russian society by introducing more democracy, the rule of law and respect for civil rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The preliminary report from the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the results of monitoring by the Russian NGO Golos show that the elections to the Duma were heavily manipulated and falsified in favour of the ruling United Russia party. As far as we can tell, United Russia did not have an absolute majority. Ten thousand people protested against this because they feel that they have been betrayed and that their dignity has been violated. They do not want a revolution. They want fair elections and real opposition parties. Even Mikhail Gorbachev, who until now has been restrained in his criticism of Mr Putin, is calling for these elections to be annulled and new ones to be held.</p>
<p class="contents">We should support this democratic movement and not just stand by and wait to see whether it manages to ensure that its demands are met by its own efforts. The courage and the lack of fear shown by these people point towards a new era. However, it is crazy to expect independent investigations to be carried out by the people responsible for the election fraud. What do we expect from President Medvedev? He was Vice-President under Mr Putin for four years, he intends to investigate the accusations, while already knowing that this will come to nothing, and he will do nothing to deal with those responsible for the election fraud, but instead threatens those governors who have not come up with the required figures.</p>
<p class="contents">The results from the Caucasus alone are completely unbelievable. On the other hand, Mr Medvedev still has the opportunity to make up for all the disappointed hopes following his announcement of reform by at least showing that he is a real president before his departure and arranging new elections. What do we expect from Mr Putin? He has dug out the old cock-and-bull KGB story about the USA managing the protests. He is a dyed-in-the-wool dictator who has been ignoring civil society’s calls for democracy for years. In Russia’s sovereign democracy, it is not a sovereign that is needed, because Mr Putin makes all the decisions. Therefore, the EU should not, as it usually does, obediently call for clarification and investigations on the Russian side on Thursday. Only new, fair and transparent elections and the inclusion of the parties that were previously excluded will reduce the discontent of the Russian people and enable the conflict to be overcome. Therefore, I am asking you to support our amendment tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would, however, like to draw the High Representative’s attention to the following issue. We have a political consensus in this House with regard to our opposition to the undemocratic character of the most recent elections and the need to provide assistance in stimulating the emergence of a civil society in Russia.

I would like to ask the Commissioner to note this. The European Conservatives and Reformists Group is naturally also very determined on this matter. The opinion of ECR is that this awakening of a civil society requires our support, and is a prerequisite to Russia becoming an important economic and political partner of the EU, which is what we want it to be.

It also means making concrete achievements, ensuring that the political decision-making processes are transparent for everyone, and explaining the electoral procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree on the fact that nothing can happen without joint security. However, it is difficult to understand why joint security is not being established jointly. The proposals for discussion have been put on the table, including by the EU. The next summit must deal with these proposals. It must come to a binding agreement that the money used to buy more weapons would be better spent on the specific processes for establishing the modernisation partnership. This is in the interest of both sides and also in the interest of our citizens, who want to have their fair share of the economic progress.</p>
<p class="contents">A prospering economy and a fair society will ultimately make obsolete the arrogant behaviour which comes with power.

In the face of Mr Onishchenko’s thinly-veiled political manoeuvre, the protesters demanded that medication be administered to a corrupt social and political establishment, and rightly so.</p>

<p class="contents">When it comes to the nuclear dispute with Iran, how do you rate the chances of Russia adopting a more positive, that is, a more cooperative, attitude towards Western efforts to settle this inflammable conflict peacefully?

That is what the agenda says. It will really be about the ways in which the EU and Russia can strengthen each other. May I say that, in this respect, this summit could turn out to be a positive one? Russia will become a member of the WTO and that, therefore, means that we now have an opportunity to kick the Partnership Agreement into a higher gear again. That is something which is sorely needed. Energy, visa liberalisation, mutual investment in business, but also reciprocal conditions and an end to discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing which is part and parcel of any partnership is values – and that means genuine values. You said that, Baroness Ashton. By ‘values’, we mean democracy and civil rights. However, Russia showed a lack of respect for these things in the recent elections to the Duma. In some regions, more than 100% of the votes were cast for a single party. That means that they have now become worse at adding up than they were in the times of the communism of yore.</p>
<p class="contents">As one person put it, this government has no respect for maths. However, it is of the utmost importance that, in the coming presidential elections, we prevent a repeat of this same drama and of the same lack of respect for the values of free elections and that we reach a clear agreement on that with President Medvedev.</p>
<p class="contents">On that score, we therefore need to give Russia a piece of our mind. A country which purports to set so much store by peace and values will also have to once again ensure compliance with one of those fundamental values: democracy, the right to vote and be voted for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We very much want to make it clear to the Russian President that his announcements must be followed by actions and that we will take him exactly at his word. I think that what Mr Swoboda has said is right. We should hold a major hearing for everyone involved, once the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) has submitted its report. Therefore, I think it is wrong to call for new elections now, before the report is available.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to say one thing to Mr Kelam, but unfortunately he is no longer here. Perhaps it is simply an error in the interpreting. He said that the demonstrators in Moscow represent an opportunity for us. I do not believe that this is right. It is not an opportunity for us, but an opportunity for the people of Russia. We need to be careful about what we say.</p>
<p class="contents">Elections will be an important topic of conversation at the summit, but this can also be a summit which gives confidence. There are two positive points which I would like to mention briefly. One is accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) after 18 years of negotiations. This not only clarifies the rules, but could also make a new agreement with us easier, hopefully in future prevent the unilateral trade restrictions that there have been in the past, and alleviate the repeated pressure caused by the Siberian overflight rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The second and final point that I want to touch on briefly is the question of visas and free movement. We are pleased that a regulation will be put in place on the border traffic to and from Kaliningrad. That will really make the situation easier for people in Poland and in Kaliningrad in particular. The joint steps which the two countries aim to agree on and which have been carefully prepared will hopefully, with good will on both sides, lead to a regulation on visa-free travel at some point. We will be discussing modernisation, human rights and the development of a civil society and we want to achieve sensible, positive results. However, without personal contacts, none of this will succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not forget that he won his first election and came to power by starting a campaign to exterminate the Chechens. During his entire period of office as president and prime minister, he did nothing else in both his domestic and foreign policy but reverse the partial democratisation of Russia that had already been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Medvedev put a friendlier face on the whole thing, but the Bible says: ‘By their fruits shall ye know them’. Unfortunately, we have not seen any fruits of this kind. Therefore, I believe that the call for democratic elections in Russia is a justified one. It makes no sense at all for us to ask the people who manipulated the elections to investigate and uncover their own manipulation. That simply will not happen. People are constantly saying: ‘Yes, but stability in Russia takes priority’. This is what was said in North Africa and it was followed by crocodile tears over Mr Mubarak, Colonel Gaddafi and others. We are interested in stability in Russia, but this can only come about when Russia is a democratic state under the rule of law, as embodied by the civil rights campaigners and opposition groups in the gallery and by the Russian demonstrators for freedom. There can be no stability without freedom. That is a lesson from history which we must finally learn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, sometimes we tend to use any opportunity to give general assessments on all aspects of life in Russia, which is not always helpful because that makes us less focused. This time, it is fully understandable that we use this opportunity to give our assessment of and recommendations concerning the problem with the elections in Russia. We hope that the presidential election next year will be better prepared, better managed and more fair and free.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with the criticism we should, however, recognise that, despite the expected win of the ruling party, Russia is different today, and we have to use the momentum not just to blame the authorities, but also to encourage them to change their approach next March. At the same time, those who fight for more democracy in Russia should feel our backing as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to call Russia to join the EU in its efforts to help the common neighbourhood. Both sides are interested in the stability, sustainable economic development and social progress of these countries. In this respect, we should encourage Russia, particularly the new leadership that will be elected next year, not to compete with the EU for influence, but to contribute to the resolution of frozen conflicts, especially in Nagorno-Karabakh in Transnistria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Blatant violations, which were an integral part of the election campaign and which were evident and recorded by international observers and independent Russian observers on polling day, and vote rigging bear witness to the fact that the elections in Russia were neither free nor fair. Many Russians were denied the constitutional right to vote and stand in the elections. Secondly, the people of Russia have taken to its streets and city squares in protest. As we have already heard today, Mikhail Gorbachev, the first and last President of the Soviet Union, is calling for fresh elections to be organised.

We will be raising the elections, that is very clear, and I want to say first of all to Mr Kelam that we are following the Magnitsky case very closely. It is indeed, as he described it, very troubling.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it is important to let honourable Members know that we will be meeting with the EU-Russia Civil Society Forum on Thursday as well and that will give us an opportunity to discuss with them recent events and more generally the relationship between us, and we always discuss the international obligations that we have when we meet at the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">My staff have met with former Prime Minister Kasyanov, who is here again, and of course I met him in July and recognise that he is here with us this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">In all our discussions with Russia, there are a number of issues that continue to be raised of which, of course, Georgia is clearly one, and in our foreign policy discussions, the particular points that honourable Members have made are indeed part of that.</p>
<p class="contents">On Iran, yes, Mr Belder, you are right to raise the fact that this for me is a big and major issue and a great deal of my time is taken up with working to see how we can move forward on this. Russia is part of the E3+3 and works very collaboratively with us, with me, in order to try and find ways in which we can persuade Iran to turn away from the issue of acquiring nuclear weapons, which I think all honourable Members are very concerned about.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk too about the common neighbourhood, as Mr Vigenin called it, we discuss the issues of Transnistria and of Nagorno-Karabakh and, as I have indicated earlier in this debate, it is very important that we see some progress there. I was quite concerned when I was in both Azerbaijan and Armenia at how tense the situation is. Russia could play a part in helping to reduce that and through the Minsk Group to find a solution to it.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the points that have been raised about ensuring that we show that we take democracy seriously and expect Russia to as well are very important.

I hope that this will pave the way for the Kaliningrad region to further open up to Europe. However, complete demilitarisation of the enclave has to be an essential precondition. For we should remember that this territory is still being used by Russia as a means of exerting military pressure on the European Union and NATO. In recent weeks, the Kremlin released information regarding the deployment of Iskander missiles in the region. Since December 2010, Russia has also been developing radar systems responsible for the positioning and trajectory control of ballistic missiles. The missiles located in the area pose a significant threat to the safety of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, while their importance as part of the strategic protection of Russia, as argued by the Russians, is negligible. Therefore, the issue regarding the demilitarisation of the Kaliningrad region should unquestionably become one of the discussion topics at the forthcoming summit.
