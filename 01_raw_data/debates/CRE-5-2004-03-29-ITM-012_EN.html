<p class="contents">Of course, legislation cannot resolve all the problems and a great deal still needs to be done in order to wipe out pay differentials between men and women. In 2000, the Commission announced in the social policy agenda that it would examine discrimination outside the labour market. This idea was supported by the European Council in Nice, which called on the Commission to strengthen rights relating to equality by approving a proposal for a directive on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Before a detailed proposal was drafted, broad consultations were held with the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Men and Women, on which all the Members States and the social partners are represented, together with the insurance and other sectors, the European Parliament and civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">You have this proposal before you. Following the example of the earlier directive on ethnic discrimination, the present directive focuses on the basic sector of access to goods and services, where there was evidence of unequal treatment of men and women and where it is known that legislation can change the situation. Consequently, the present directive will mainly cover financial services which often require women to have a guarantor in order to obtain a loan, but not men. Similarly housing, where single parent families, mainly women, face greater difficulties than men in renting accommodation and, of course, the insurance sector, mainly the car insurance, life assurance and pension sectors, as well as health insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal to ban discrimination between men and women with regard to access to goods and services is equivocal to the Council, Parliament and society in general. It is equivocal because it questions established ideas in relation to the treatment of men and women, because it maintains that there are factors more important than gender when calculating premiums and because it implies that the approach which most insurance companies use today is basically unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, however, an important step for the principle of equal treatment and it will change the lives of both men and women throughout the whole of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prets (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for what you have just said, which makes us very optimistic that we will be able to get rid of the unequal treatment that exists in the insurance sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The preparatory work has been very hard work and very long, but it has brought us at last to the point where we can vote on the report. This proposal for a directive was announced as long ago as June 2000, when it featured in the Commission’s social policy agenda and was called for by the Heads of State or Government at the Nice European Council in December 2000. Four years on, the same gentlemen are still around and, now that the draft of such a directive is on the table, they are opposing it. It took three years before, in September last year, a proposal was submitted, and this, too, was given a very rough ride by the Commission. Then, in September 2003, I, as rapporteur, organised a public hearing in order to gain broad public support for our cause.</p>
<p class="contents">This hearing was very interesting and gave rise to some exciting developments, including the discovery of how questionable are the often-quoted statistics on the basis of which it is possible to charge women higher insurance premiums. In the United Kingdom, for example, the lowest life expectancy for both men and women is in Manchester, while men’s life expectancy is highest in West Dorset and women’s highest in West Somerset. This exactly parallels the way in which men in the former East Germany live longer than men in the West, and the East-West divide, in terms of life expectancy, that exists in Austria. What this means is that gender is certainly not the only factor in this; I believe that our approach to this equality directive cannot be based on economic factors to the exclusion of all others, and that this involves a purely political decision, the political will to declare ourselves in favour of equality or against it.</p>
<p class="contents">We also found it very regrettable that the final Commission proposal for a directive took no account of education, decision-making processes, and the content of media and advertising. This leads me to agree with my colleague Mrs Swiebel’s view that, while a progressive approach is certainly not the best solution, it may well be the first manageable one. This directive is very feeble in comparison with the existing directive on the principle of equal treatment on grounds of race, which goes much further in its demands. So let me thank Commissioner Diamantopoulou for taking this important step, while, at the same time, encouraging the Commission – through you, Commissioner Dimas – to delay no longer in adopting further proposals on comprehensive measures to combat sexual discrimination and to guarantee de facto equality in areas other than employment.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is explicitly founded upon Article 13, inserted by the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, and I do not share the view of certain members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it should have Article 95 as its basis. Were that the case, I believe that it would have permitted access to the internal market in purely economic terms, and I am not sure that the Council would have allowed Parliament the power of codecision over it.</p>
<p class="contents">What is crucial – it is indeed at the heart of this report – is the actuarial factor, on which the insurance lobby has based its arguments, and which is the starting point for most of our differences. Gender must not be used as an actuarial factor in calculating premiums and benefits. To use gender as an objective factor is discriminatory, as gender is not freely chosen; women and men are born as what they are. For example, I have learned from many discussions that women in the insurance sector, and not just insurance companies themselves, defend the idea that women alone should bear the costs of pregnancy, justifying this by saying that they too, use medical services. As all women pay the same amount, there is solidarity between women who have children and those who do not, but what about men, who do, after all, have some part in women becoming pregnant? At the moment, family policy is a big thing; demands are made for families to be supported and we are told that we need more children to be born, economics ministers trumpet aloud improvements to family policy while, at the same volume, proclaiming their opposition to this directive. This goes to show that family policy, just as much as women’s policies, is very often no more than a way for our male politicians to get themselves off the hook, with their fine words left hanging in the air while none of the things that are promised actually materialise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to clarify that the calculation of premiums on the basis of risk is to continue to be possible, but that gender must not be included as a factor in these calculations. Using gender or race – both of them factors outside the control of the individual – as a factor in calculating premiums amounts to discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In statistical discrimination, the average differences, established at a given point in time, between groups, in this case groups of men and groups of women, are made absolute as permanent assessment criteria for individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this statistical discrimination still occurs very frequently in the private insurance industry in a number of countries. However, the essence of insurance is about sharing the risks. Judging people on a characteristic over which they have no control must be considered discrimination. The apparent logic of taking into consideration the difference between men and women by the insurance industry is a remnant of times gone by – taking the easy option. We have to fight this as a matter of principle. The opponents are fighting a rearguard action. I am therefore pleased that such a large majority on the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has approved Mrs Prets’ report, and I hope that the plenary will do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, however, waiting for the next step, which will put a stop to the so-called hierarchy of equality. European anti-discrimination legislation is a patchwork which itself discriminates between the different grounds of discrimination. Consequently, different groups are given different levels of protection. Why is race discrimination prohibited by EU legislation in the areas of education and social services, while sex discrimination in those areas is not? And why has in this area and that of social security no provision been made for discrimination on the basis of age, disability and social orientation?</p>
<p class="contents">We are looking forward to the Commission's promised Green Paper about the future of anti-discrimination legislation as a whole, and subsequently to new reparation legislation. After all, a hierarchy of equality is not acceptable in the European Union, which reportedly wants to be a community of values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We should not, however, allow this concern to deflect our gaze from the problems that this directive engenders. In essence, it has to do with the insurance sector. The Commission, along with many Members of this House, takes the view that gender should no longer be taken into account when calculating insurance premiums, claiming that this is intrinsically discriminatory.</p>
<p class="contents">A majority on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market disagrees with this approach; the fact is that calculating risks is what insurance companies do, and where there are different levels of risk, these may be taken into account. To take one example, in private old age pensions insurance, insurers take account, in their calculations, of the tendency of women to live longer than men can expect to do. I do not see that as intrinsically discriminatory; it is one of the factors that may be taken into account when working out the contributions. Another example is to be found in motor insurance; according to the statistics, it so happens that women cause fewer accidents than do men, and so insurers charge women lower rates. I do not think that is discriminatory; that is the application of mathematics, which cannot simply be abrogated by legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The one exception I would make is in the case of maternity and pregnancy, where I do not believe there should be any difference between men and women when it comes to the costs. This is an area where both sexes, of course, share responsibility, and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has therefore decided that they must be treated equally in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">What leads me to oppose this directive is the fact that it stands for massive interference in people’s private affairs. I am opposed to the introduction of unisex tariffs, and I hope that the amendments that our group has resubmitted will be supported by a majority of the plenary tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zrihen (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">draftsman for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my support for Mrs Prets’ report, which is of major importance to women. Indeed, non-discrimination between persons is one of the common principles of the EU and its Member States. We are not asking for money, as many seem to suggest; what we want is respect for European values and for the treaties. Nor – contrary to certain people’s frequent apparent accusations – are we asking for special privileges.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s opinion must not be drawn along party political or partisan lines, but must be a political act in the cause of greater respect for gender equality. We had for a long time hoped for a more wide-ranging directive, encompassing numerous fields in which to promote gender equality. The directive before us, however, is somewhat limited, yet is very important for equality between persons, and in itself represents a step forward. We expect that this directive will bring greater solidarity and equality between the sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that we must oppose any discrimination based on criteria over which people have no control, such as sex, race, ethnic background and age. This proposal for a directive does not target the calculation of premiums according to risk, but is solely concerned with the inclusion of sex as a factor in this calculation by the insurance companies. Excuse me, but I am a woman and I do not believe that my gender constitutes a risk. Other factors connected with lifestyle, irrespective of gender, can be taken into account in the calculation of certain types of insurance. I should also like to underline that the right to equality between women and men is an individual right that belongs to both women and men as individuals and not as members of a group.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those who put forward arguments designed to alarm our female citizens. Before I make a quick synopsis of the possible implications of the directive, I must emphasise that possible, not probable, reductions or increases in certain areas of insurance will only be applicable to new policies and not, as some would have us believe, to existing ones. Furthermore, not only does this directive concern women, it also concerns men. It will therefore affect insurance premium calculations for men, as well as other areas covered by this directive, namely access to and supply of goods and services. Equality in the access to and supply of goods and services is essential. Even today, in our civilised societies, discriminatory practices remain commonplace. It is normal to see posters specifying that an apartment can only be rented either by men or women; and to see places or services that are only accessible to one of the sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">We have previously debated the subject of equal treatment between women and men in the field of cooperation and development. The report concerned, which was intended to make it possible to strengthen the role of women and to combat discrimination between men and women in third countries, is an example that we must follow here, in our own back yard.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those whose amendments are aimed at removing all of the directive’s substance. I hope that this will not happen when it comes to the vote, and that we will approve this report. I also hope that the EU and the Member States will put this directive in place and enforce it. While EU law lays down the principle of equal treatment between women and men – and a directive has already been adopted to this end – this principle has always proved difficult to implement in practice. Good will is all very well, but there is still disparity between men and women in the job market. Such inequality, however, is now criticised as a hindrance to European competitiveness and to achieving the Lisbon objectives, as stated in the Commission’s latest report on equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, I hope that during the coming legislature, the Commission will table a directive that plugs the gaps of non-discrimination between women and men in fields not yet covered. I especially hope that tomorrow Parliament will send a strong and clear signal affirming non-discrimination and the equality of women and men. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I can understand the concerns of the insurance industry. The proposal will bring considerable changes to its practices and at present it is uncertain as to how to go about implementing these changes. Understandably, industry never likes uncertainty. However, I do not understand industry's argument that the current use of gender to differentiate premiums and benefits is not discriminatory because it is based on objective factors. Even if it is the case that on average young men have more car accidents than young women, or that on average women live longer than men, this is not true of all individuals, and these individuals are disadvantaged accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the existence of objective differences, whether between individuals or groups, is not of itself sufficient grounds for according them unequal treatment. There must be a sound political justification for doing so. I have to say that in the 21st century I do not believe that such a justification can be provided where the routine provision of goods and services to men and women is concerned, any more than it could be where other such socially constructed groupings were involved. If I speak with some feeling on the matter it is because, on several occasions in my own life, I have experienced the kind of discrimination that this directive is intended to prevent. I do not want to see new generations bearing the same scars.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask insurance companies to look to see whether the changes might not actually afford opportunities to them. I would not willingly purchase an annuity because I do not believe it would offer a financially advantageous way of arranging my affairs. Perhaps I am not the only woman who feels this way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been fighting since 1963 for equal treatment and opportunities between men and women, in women’s organisations, at national and at European level, and most of the time as president. I cannot, therefore, be accused of not promoting the implementation of the principle of equality between men and women by directives covering all fields.</p>
<p class="contents">I also, therefore, believe that there is a real moral and legal obligation to support this proposal for a directive establishing equal treatment between women and men in the access to and supply of goods and services. In politics, however, nobody is forced to do what is impossible or absurd.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Commission’s proposal does not take account of the fact that in the field of insurance there is a further directive that requires insurers set sufficiently prudent premiums, taking into account all future commitments. It is a fact that for certain risks, sex – I prefer to use the term gender – is an objective criterion that insurers must take into account in determining the level of liability that they are to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, therefore, prohibit insurers from taking sex into account on prudential grounds in the actuarial risk calculation, even if the premium does not eventually vary from one sex to the other. Given that all those insured, regardless of sex, are primarily interested in the financial viability of insurance, we have tabled amendments to take account of this concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Commission, we wish to lay down the principle that the use of sex as a determining and discriminatory factor in the calculation of premiums for insurance purposes must be prohibited for new contracts concluded after the directive has been adopted. We would not accept retroactive legislation to cover existing contracts. We would, however, allow sex to be taken into account according to objective, verifiable and transparent criteria, to be monitored by the Member States, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> for actuarial calculations. This makes sense and is in the interests of all insured parties, especially since, as the Commission says in its short justification, ‘there is little evidence of the existence of consistent discriminatory practices in the area of the access to or supply of goods and services’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission says, in fact, that in the setting of rates, insurance companies should take into account criteria other than sex, such as lifestyle, behaviour or professional status. I doubt whether such practice would be compatible with respect for private life, quite apart from the fact that it would cause new and manifold forms of discrimination between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I do not see why we have to include provisions in this legislative text regarding sexual harassment. I really do not see how I could be harassed when buying a commodity or service. I do not believe, for example, that the chemist would harass me for buying condoms or Viagra for my husband or my boyfriend. I would not do this, as I do not have either, but let us drop all of these politically correct elements that are a waste of space in a legislative text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was quite legitimate that they should be there, but also very instructive because, when it boils down to it, the proposal is about rectifying a situation in which women pay more, and obtain less, than men when it comes to life assurance, pensions etc.</p>
<p class="contents">When they came to my office with views opposed to the proposal, a number of insurance people said that they just wanted to see a fair system. It set me thinking about what is really meant by fairness. Their conception of fairness was obvious. It was quite fair that there should be solidarity among women and solidarity among men. This means, for example, that women who cannot have children have to pay for those who can, while, from this insurance point of view, the children’s fathers do not participate in any form of financial solidarity at all. I am of course in complete disagreement with the insurance industry. Equality is a fundamental principle in the EU. It is there in the existing Treaty and occurs again in the new draft constitutional treaty. It is also stated that the EU must take initiatives to remedy situations in which these principles are not being complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to thank the former Commissioner for the work she has done in this area, and I now hope that it will get through the European Parliament and, subsequently, the Council. I should like to say that, in my view, there is much more at stake than just this proposal, for it is in reality the future of the EU that is at issue. The proposal demonstrates whether there is a link between words and action. When women now look at the ‘family photo’, it is difficult for them to identify with the EU they see there. If – and this can perhaps be excused – we in the Commission, the Council and Parliament show that we cannot even remedy an area such as this, there is no chance of getting women also to vote in favour of the future EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The point has already been made that the directive to combat racism and discrimination based on ethnic origin was approved in the year 2000 – some four years ago. It could be that nobody is interested in this issue; it could also be that this is simply an extremely tricky one.</p>
<p class="contents">It also appears to me that the Commission had a great deal of difficulty in reaching this agreement. The programme should have been much broader and should have encompassed education and the media, yet all of this is absent from the final draft. I regret this, given that we are not satisfied with the replies given regarding the media and discrimination in the media, which consisted of saying that self-regulation is sufficient, and that we have been told so by those who work in the sector. I feel that all of us here can confirm, with regard to our own countries, that self-regulation is not sufficient. The ‘Television without frontiers’ directive also contains provisions to combat sexism in the media. The reality of the situation, however, leaves something to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">The area before us – that of housing, insurance, goods and services – is important; having listened this evening and read this report and draft, we realise how difficult it is to combat these forms of discrimination. Against this backdrop, I do not wish to complain, but rather to take satisfaction from the fact that Europe is achieving more than each of our countries in terms of addressing an extremely tricky issue, namely, fighting against stereotypes in the criteria used to calculate premiums or in types of insurance. I think it is tremendous that Europe is able to devote its attention to problems such as these.</p>
<p class="contents">Some speakers have suggested that, in actual fact, we are far from achieving our goal, that stereotypes still prevail, that we are content to use stereotypes rather than, as has been said time and again, to consider a range of contributory factors that would enable us to address more appropriately the difficulties that people have in the area of insurance. This is all too true. I feel that it is imperative that we combat stereotypes in the area of insurance underwriting and risk assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that women are the ones who lose out. Men might say, from their point of view, that they do not all wish to be seen as road hogs and bad drivers. It is, consequently, both men and women who will be affected if we manage to achieve equal representation in the area of insurance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We nevertheless believe that this proposal puts plenty of wind in the sails of equality for women and men in the EU. The removal of these inequalities in services was long overdue, and, with this report, we have set up a landmark for equality policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hypocritical and unfair for the private insurance sector to make threatening gestures; it is merely trying to promote panic among consumers and its customers. As has already been said, it is far better to include other risk factors in calculations. It is lifestyle that is crucial to life expectancy. We know from studies in the USA that 86% of us live for the same length of time. Just as nobody thinks in terms of discriminating on the grounds of ethnic origin, there must be no discrimination on the grounds of gender. Now of all times, when the adoption of a European constitution is about to be adopted, it would be a mockery for us to fail to push forward the equality that it – as has already been said – has as one of its core values. Although I see the Commission’s proposal for the progressive removal of discrimination as something of an admission of its inadequacy – we would have liked more than that – I do believe that, when we vote, we have to send a clear and unambiguous message in support of equality policy and against discrimination. The principle of equality must count for more; after all, even private insurance companies are bound by it, and it is intolerable that these should use unacceptable forms of discrimination as a means of securing themselves a competitive advantage over statutory insurance schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like us to be seen by the whole world as a beacon for equality policy; I want the EU, being such a great economic area, to set up a landmark, and our vote to carry a clear message. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore not logical for the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to have been allocated this report. It has replaced the principle of equal treatment by equality of men and women, but that is not the issue. The consequence of this change is that the text lacks coherence. For example, Amendment No 19 stipulates that there shall be no sex discrimination, including less favourable treatment, also as a result of paternity.</p>
<p class="contents">There should also be equal treatment in the insurance industry, so that life expectancy on the basis of sex alone should no longer play a role in calculating insurance premiums. The calculation of risks on the basis of life expectancy is based on outdated information and according to other male and female role models. The premiums should therefore be based on solidarity between men and women. The fact is that there is a greater variation within the group of men or women than there is between men and women. There is, admittedly, a significant difference between men and women statistically speaking, but this can be explained historically. In the future, the increasing similarity in lifestyle and occupational pursuits will mean that this statistically significant difference will not necessarily continue to exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In that respect, we have played a pioneering role, certainly as regards the equal treatment in what – for the sake of convenience – I should like to call the working and professional environment. That has not always been the case. Now that we have a legal basis enabling us to go one step beyond the professional and working environment, I think we should do this.</p>
<p class="contents">I do welcome the fact that, in terms of tax law, the Commission provides, at least at the moment, for temporary derogation. I believe that to be important, because where tax law is concerned, we move into the realms of family policy, and I think that we should continue to give the Member States free choices in that field.</p>
<p class="contents">Understandably, the insurance industry has asked for a derogation to be put in place for them, because the proposal requires them to make huge adjustments. I would, however, ask them to understand that we nevertheless want to include insurance in the scope of this directive. I accept the legal argument that, strictly speaking, the unequal treatment of what is different does not amount to discrimination. This, however, should not stop us from taking positive steps in order to establish the equal treatment of men and women in the broad sense of the word, in society. That, therefore, means that we need to go beyond working and professional regulations and in that sense, I can also largely support the Commission's proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is the delay in tabling a proposal for a directive, as has already been mentioned here, to prohibit discrimination based on sex in fields other than work. This was announced in the social policy agenda in June 2000 and we have repeatedly called for such a proposal in various reports approved by Parliament. We deplore the fact that pressure and resistance on the part of various interested parties, in particular the insurance and media sectors, have delayed its passage.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue concerns the vastly reduced scope of the proposal presented by the Commission, which covers only access to goods and services and the supply of these, and excludes other fields, such as media and advertising content, education and decision-making processes. This is an appalling state of affairs, particularly when one sees the discrimination that persists in the media, in advertising and in decision-making processes. Other areas, such as vocational training and social security, are covered by other directives, although we must look again at these areas in order to improve the content and to eliminate discrimination based on sex in all areas, particularly in occupational social security schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">The third is the need for mechanisms to ensure that the principle of equality is applied on the ground. This principle has already been set out in previous directives, but is still not being implemented. We therefore support the inclusion of some practical measures that will ensure that this principle is applied more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth question concerns the need to eliminate discrimination in services that are essential to ensuring women to live on an equal footing with men on a day-to-day basis. Unequal treatment between women and men must be prohibited in all areas of the supply of goods and services. It is unacceptable that insurance companies include gender as a factor in risk calculations or that banks discriminate against women when granting credit. The rapporteur, whom I should like to congratulate on her work, states that the right to equal treatment belongs to the citizen as an individual and not as a member of a group. The ways in which insurance companies analyse risk, premiums and payment deadlines in terms of groups and of male and female averages, are, therefore, unacceptable. This does not mean, however, that we should not be proactive in eliminating inequality and in promoting equality between men and women. This is a tentative and incomplete step, which I hope will be approved tomorrow and will accordingly become a EU directive. We must strive to fully implement, at the earliest possible opportunity, the processes that are still lacking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dimas,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have followed these interventions with a great deal of interest and I should like to thank the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, as well as the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their contributions to the report being debated. I should like to congratulate Mrs Prets on her excellent report, which proposes numerous improvements to our proposal and gives it greater clarity and greater cohesion with previous Community directives. In particular, we welcome the amendments which bring the Commission proposal into line with Directive 2000/43 on racial discrimination or Directive 2002/73 on equal treatment for men and women in employment. I refer to Amendments Nos 3, 4, 5 part three and part four, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 20, 23 part one, 25 part one, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 43. I should also like to thank the Committee on Women’s Rights on its proposed Amendment No 15, which clarifies the dividing line between private pensions and occupational pensions, which are covered by existing directives on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The above amendments are also in keeping with the discussions held in the Council. We cannot support a number of other amendments, even though they are constructive, because they deviate from similar provisions in current directives and because we believe that it would be preferable to maintain the same approach for reasons of cohesion. I refer mainly to Amendments Nos 16, 19, 21, 24, 25, 28, 29, 34 and 40. Nor do we agree with the abolition of the exceptions for which provision is made in Article 1, paragraph 3, given that it is necessary to maintain a limited number of exceptions if the directive is to be applicable in practice. I refer to Amendments Nos 9 and 13. Nor can we support the amendments which extend the proposal to the education, mass media and advertising sectors. The Commission proposal focuses on a specific sector, the goods and services sector. As such, it is a step by step approach to a sector in which, as everyone knows, there is a great deal of gender-based discrimination which can be wiped out with a binding legislative act.</p>
<p class="contents">We recognise that the representation of the sexes in the mass media and advertising raises serious questions regarding the protection of the dignity of men and women and that, in the education sector, girls and boys are often discouraged from following non-traditional paths, but other complicated issues also arise, such as the freedom of means of communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Commission considers that, in order to deal with them, a binding legislative act is not appropriate at the present stage. I refer to Amendments Nos 38 and 39. Finally, as far as Amendments Nos 35 and 36 in Article 4 of the proposal are concerned, we cannot agree to amendments designed to allow the use of gender-based actuarial factors. The use of gender-based actuarial factors is not compatible with the principle of equal treatment and cannot therefore be justified objectively. Such actuarial factors make broad generalisations about all men and all women and cannot be justified. They reflect statistics on the average population, but these statistics are misleading because they conceal the fact that other factors relating to life style are more important than gender. In fact, studies have shown that 86% of men and women have the same life expectancy. In this group of 86%, a woman is treated differently from a man under the same conditions, purely and simply because an inaccurate generalisation is made about the life expectancy of all women. This practice infringes the principle of equal treatment and, as such, cannot be justified by a statistics-based generalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we welcome the fact that the proposed amendment recognises that the cost of pregnancy in life assurance should be borne by men and women equally, in order for there to be compliance with the principle of equal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Amendments Nos 10, 22 and 41, which propose on the one hand, a reduction in the transitional period of six years provided for in Article 4 for gender-based actuarial factors and on the other, stricter monitoring requirements during that period, we do not agree with them because we believe that we cannot expect the insurance sector to adapt from one day to the next and because we consider that the additional six-year period provided for in Article 4 is needed in order to develop working methods for using other, more accurate factors than gender.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we hope that, at the end of this period, the insurance industry will have no problems applying the principle of equal treatment and European consumers will reap the relevant benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments which propose replacing the term ‘application of the principle of equal treatment of men and women’ with the term ‘application of equality between men and women’ throughout the proposal, we cannot support these amendments because this would go beyond the legal basis of Article 13 of the Treaty. Article 13 authorises the Community to take action to combat discrimination, in other words to safeguard the equal treatment of men and women. It does not grant it wider powers to promote equality or to guarantee full equality in practice. Although Article 3, paragraph 2 of the Treaty makes provision for the Community to aim to promote equality between men and women in all its activities, this provision cannot change the nature of the legal basis of Article 13 of the Treaty. I refer to Amendments Nos 1, 5 parts one and two, 11, 18, 23 part two and 42.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, regarding the last proposed amendment, Amendment No 45, which proposes that the Member States engage in dialogue with non-governmental organisations working to combat discrimination and the social partners, we agree in principle but we believe that the wording should be broad enough to cover all the agencies involved, because there are other organisations which represent social agents, such as consumer associations, social organisations and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry I had to overrun my speaking time, but at least the good news is that we see that we men shall live approximately the same number of years as women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
