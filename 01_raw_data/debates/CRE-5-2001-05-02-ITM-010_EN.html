<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, honourable Members, the Chernobyl accident in 1986 was a tragedy on a global scale and we continue to feel strongly for the victims this tragedy has caused, both among those involved in the clean-up and plant workers, and among people not directly involved, including innocent children. We also recognise the huge economic burden this accident has put on Belarus, Russia and Ukraine and other countries and the problems for the population in contaminated regions to restore normal living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of the accident on EU territory were comparatively minor but nevertheless important efforts continue to be made for monitoring levels of radioactivity in the environment and in foodstuffs: controls on the import of foodstuffs were even recently strengthened. The commemoration of this event provides us with an opportunity to reflect upon nuclear safety in the region. On 15 December 2000, Ukraine shut down definitively the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The Commission welcomed this decision as a major contribution to the improvement of nuclear safety in Europe. We also appreciate that by deciding to close the Chernobyl plant before the end of 2000, Ukraine lived up to the commitment it made under the international agreement signed with the governments of the of the G7 countries and with the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has provided considerable support to Ukraine over the last few years in addressing and overcoming the consequences of the Chernobyl accident, which had such devastating effects on the population and the environment. Over EUR 340 million have been granted in assistance today, not taking into account technical assistance provided for other nuclear installations in the Ukraine. For Chernobyl, important EU support is related to turning the sarcophagus into an environmentally acceptable system and addressing social needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will soon adopt the formal proposal for a Council decision on a second contribution to the Chernobyl shelter fund at the EBRD which will then be submitted to the Council and to Parliament for decision. Nuclear safety is a priority for the European Union. Since the beginning of the political and economic reforms that took place in the former Soviet Union, the European Union has actively assisted the countries of the region in improving the safety of their nuclear installations.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy followed by the EU was in line with the G7 multilateral programme of action. This included support for short-term measures for nuclear safety improvements as well as longer-term measures to replace unsafe reactors by alternative energy sources. In the particular case of the candidate countries of central and eastern Europe, the PHARE Programme has helped and continues to help improve nuclear safety there as well as to develop economically and environmentally sound energy strategies for the replacement of the less safe nuclear reactors.</p>
<p class="contents">As requested by the Council, the Commission has given a high priority to nuclear safety in the accession partnerships and in using pre-accession funds to pursue these priorities. Important landmarks are: the agreement to close non-upgradeable units in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria; the support that the programme has given to the nuclear regulators; the short-term urgent safety improvements made to some reactors; the design and operational improvements in upgradeable reactors and also considerable assistance to tackle the problems related to radioactive waste and spent fuel.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of the Russian Federation is particularly important. Russia is the only state of the former Soviet Union involved in all aspects of nuclear power, from uranium mining to plant design, power generation and spent fuel reprocessing. Some 15% of electricity in Russia is generated by nuclear power. Russia's civil nuclear industry is also a major source of employment accounting for approximately 300 000 people in direct jobs. Given the limited size of the available EU budget, the large number of operating reactors and the special economic conditions in Russia, it would be impossible for the European Union to offer Russia financial assistance equivalent to that made available to the candidate countries and to Ukraine. Nonetheless the basic policy orientation is the same: to use the technical and financial resources available to the European Union to help the Russian Federation improve safety levels.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Russia, we also pursue an active cooperation in spent fuel and radio active waste management in north-west Russia. An enormous quantity of spent fuel from nuclear submarines is stored under very poor conditions. This poses a major threat to the Barents Sea and the Arctic environment. The Community is not party to the Arctic monitoring and assessment programme, but is nevertheless closely involved in the work related to environmental radioactivity in the Arctic. We are at present involved in active negotiations on a specified multilateral agreement, the MNEPR, which should allow us to set up and implement a large international effort.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Commission has undertaken an active policy in assisting our partner states in their efforts to increase nuclear safety. We are committed to continue this policy and hope very much that together we can ensure a secure and safe energy supply consistent with sustainable development and respect for the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I stress this point because we have, of course, acted in the debate on many occasions as if Chernobyl were everywhere. It is not. Twelve years ago a dictatorship crumbled, a dictatorship which from the outset did not have the standard of technical safety which we have in the rest of the world or, more to the point, in Europe. For the rest, we should clarify that, in a democracy, discussion takes place in public. That alone contributes to safety. A democracy has independent supervisory agencies. That too contributes to safety. And it has independent courts, which again contribute to safety. In other words, a democratic system operating under the rule of law is, per se, such an important safety factor that any parallels need to be made clear at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of the cynical attitude of a dictatorship, which had a nuclear power station which was unsafe from the outset and four reactors which were shut down in December in response to international pressure, have had to be borne mainly by the people in the countries affected. I note that, even twelve years after the fall of the Soviet Union, many leading politicians have yet to depart from this cynical attitude towards the people, as the truly abysmal treatment of the people after the sinking of the <span class="italic">Kursk </span>proved. Public discussion is still not a routine matter there and we would do well to bear that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">We are right to say in our resolution that there is widespread concern. But I also notice that many people are wrongly feeding this concern in order to achieve a completely different objective, namely to lump unsafe nuclear power stations together with the safe nuclear power stations which are currently being built around the world, including soon in the Union and America, and this is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not apply in other technical areas: if something goes wrong with a car, we do not ban all cars, and if an aeroplane crashes, it is terrible, but we do not ban all aeroplanes.</p>
<p class="contents">We want help for the Ukraine. But we must also tell the Ukraine and ourselves that we cannot rest easily just by giving money; we must put conditions in place there so that money in a functioning economic system can fulfil the same purpose as it does in a democracy, which is why we expect – as the resolution makes clear – all manner of changes and adjustments to the energy system in the Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Wallström, if we are talking about learning lessons, then that applies in particular to the candidate countries. We have nine new nuclear power stations there with 27 reactors. Of which we know that three power stations with eight reactors are to be shut down. But we know equally well that other parts of nuclear power stations can be upgraded and that brings me to my sixty-four thousand dollar question to you, Commissioner: the Commission is conducting accession negotiations, including on the “standard energy safety” chapter on behalf of the European Union. Parliament is still waiting for you to tell us and the public exactly which nuclear power station safety standard the negotiations are based on. To my knowledge you have promised Parliament as much on several occasions, but the matter is still pending. The Commission has a debt to discharge here. I only hope that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy will receive a clear answer from you as soon as possible as to what safety standard negotiations with candidate countries are based on. It is a question of the utmost interest to all of us and all of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Adam (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant has, of course, been widely applauded by Members in political groups in this House, but it could have happened earlier and the reasons why it did not are instructive. The Ukraine does not wish to increase its dependence of supplies from Russia and therefore it wished to complete the reactors at Khmelnitski and Rovno and in their eyes we have been rather slow in operating the memorandum of understanding that was concluded in 1995. However, the decision to make the Euratom loan available to complete those reactors marks a very important step towards improving EU/Ukraine relations because the loan agreement marks the willingness of Ukraine to operate its nuclear plant to safety standards equivalent to those in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is one thing talking about the operational standards of safety, the other important aspect is the regulation of the industry. I am pleased that the Commissioner made such reference to the support that we give to regulators throughout eastern Europe, because this is the area that gives us the greatest concern. It is not in any way to challenge the competence of the regulator or his staff in Ukraine. It is a question of the power of the regulatory body to authorise start-up procedures to ensure stoppage for maintenance and to be the final arbiter for loading and restarting. There is still an outstanding need to satisfy the West that the status of the regulator in Ukraine, and in some other eastern European countries, is equivalent to western practice: it certainly should be established before K2 is finally commissioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 12 of the joint resolution calls for closer cooperation and dialogue between Ukraine and the European Parliament on energy-related matters. This is crucial to building up the Ukraine economy, because structural and technical improvements are also needed in the gas, oil and coal sectors and while the commitment of Ukraine to improving energy efficiency and developing renewable energy sources is welcome, the dominant factors for the foreseeable future will be fossil fuel and nuclear power.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that this Parliament, its committees and its delegation to the Ukraine are linked into the work of the subcommittee of the political cooperation agreement which handles energy and environment issues. Parliament should also be kept fully informed of progress in the shelter construction, the decommissioning of the site and the completion of the two reactors. These are the pressing practical matters which must follow from the voting of this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Fifteen years after Chernobyl, the safety of nuclear power and its effects upon health are the subject of this resolution. Chernobyl is a constant reminder to us that we cannot continue to ignore the risks of nuclear power, and it constitutes the clearest warning of all about the threat posed by nuclear power to our whole existence. I would say to the previous speaker that nuclear accidents were not the invention of Communism. Rather, accidents have also occurred in the United States and Japan. Is that at least not something we should be able to agree about?</p>
<p class="contents">The UN’s Department for Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 9 million people have been affected directly or indirectly by the disaster in Chernobyl. In Belarus, 18 per cent of the total population live in a heavily polluted environment. These figures are extremely high, considering what they mean for individual people. Just as Commissioner Wallström pointed out, children are the most vulnerable. The World Health Organisation reports that the annual rate of thyroid gland cancer among children in the Gomel area of Belarus and the most affected areas in Ukraine exceeds the normal values by almost a hundred times.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is whether we have learned anything since then. Is the precautionary principle being applied today? EU funds are still being handed out for the purpose of completing the nuclear reactors in Ukraine, and Euratom still spreads the gospel of nuclear power, praising its splendid qualities. It is, of course, commendable that the EU should contribute to nuclear safety, but should we not also at some point provide funds for <span class="italic">closing down</span> nuclear power stations?</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ask Commissioner Wallström if the Commission has any plans to require the applicant States to close down nuclear power stations before they can become members of the European Union.

Even before 1986, there was the disaster in Harrisburg in the US, where an overheated and melting nuclear reactor threatened to sink into the ground. The fact is that since the 1950s, there has been too much optimism worldwide about the characteristics of nuclear energy. It was expected to be a non-exhaustive source of cheap and clean energy, but instead it turned out to be a risky business which, even after production was stopped, continued seriously to pollute the environment. Fifteen years after the disaster, a large area in Belarus and Ukraine is still not inhabitable for people who do not want to get cancer. Those who stay have become dependent on government aid, and those who should be able to help those most affected avoid or leave the area. Food from the polluted area remains unsuitable for consumption. To solve this situation, we do not need a new type of nuclear power station, but rather a recovery plan for the affected area, alternative ways of generating energy, as well as energy-saving measures. Only a financial contribution is in the interest of all Europeans; anything else will just lead to wasted energy and to future disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the finding in a report by the Otto-Hug-Institut at Munich University. According to WHO forecasts, in the district of Gomel in Belarus alone, which is the main area affected, a third of the children who were under four years of age when the accident occurred will contract cancer of the thyroid during their lifetime. The repercussions could become apparent in seven million people over the next 50 to 70 years. In Belarus alone, there is a shortfall in the funds needed to treat radiation victims of EUR 800 million a year. Because there is no money, people over the age of 45 are no longer being treated. Meaning that they will die. Compare this amount with the EUR 1.2 billion spent by the Commission on nuclear research under the sixth EU nuclear research programme and draw your own tragic conclusions.</p>

Of course, I believe that this sort of thing could never happen in a British, French or German nuclear power station. But we are surrounded by nuclear power stations using obsolete Russian technology. I need only think of Bohunice, Kozlodoui or Ignalina. These power stations cannot be upgraded, even with the very best western technology. In Austria no one – not one party – is in favour of using nuclear energy. We have learned to accept that we cannot force others to follow our example. But what we can do is warn them about dangerous nuclear power stations, about nuclear power stations which would be unable to obtain an operating licence anywhere in the European Union. When someone builds a house, the neighbours are asked if the tree in the garden is too tall and is blocking out too much light. When someone builds a nuclear power station which would not be able to obtain a license anywhere in the European Union, suddenly it is a question of national sovereignty and everyone is insulted if you question safety standards or ask for information.</p>
<p class="contents">In Austria – and I think that I really can speak for everyone – we have taken great pains for a long time to call for uniform standards which apply in all the European countries. Commissioner, the same thing has been put to you twice today already. I know full well that we cannot compare French technology, for example, with British technology and that the French industry may wish to guard its secrets. But we must have a minimum consensus. We must be able to say if an old or a new nuclear power station built in a candidate country – and I am thinking quite specifically of Temelin here – is safe. I have to say that, if a nuclear power station would be unable to obtain an operating licence anywhere in the European Union, then I am against it, I do not want any nuclear power stations in any candidate country which do not meet our standards, irrespective of which country has issued them.</p>
<p class="contents">We harmonise so much in the European Union – our common values, thank God. We shall soon have a common currency – wonderful. We also hear talk of standard shapes for cucumbers. So why no minimum consensus here?</p>
<p class="contents">I have tried to achieve a minimum consensus in my group. I believe that Mr Mombaur or Mr Chichester will be tabling an oral amendment tomorrow. I call on you, if you are still here and can hear me, to vote in favour of this oral amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, it is precisely because we are surrounded by dangerous nuclear power stations that I say to you: there is no border at which the danger stops – and I am thinking here of the candidate countries, I am thinking of nuclear power stations which cannot be upgraded and I am thinking of new nuclear power stations which may be built. It must be possible for us to say that we demand British, French or German standards. If we cannot, then what I want to know is why we bother about the shape of cucumbers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the West, it is a little known fact why that is, for the nuclear power station was located in Ukraine. But upon closer inspection of the effects of the disaster, it becomes clear that Belarus, where more than 70% of the nuclear fall-out ended up, was at least as badly affected as Ukraine. In the latter country, nearly two and a half million people were exposed to radioactivity. Over the past ten years, the Ukrainian government has spent USD six billion to combat the effects, and this spending is set to continue for the time being. To quote a few examples: funding is needed to repair the housing built around the exploded reactor as it is deemed unsafe. A great deal of materials polluted by the explosion need to be stored and processed. Ukraine’s main river, the Dnepr, is still at risk of becoming contaminated.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has addressed a number of these problems in good time and has given a great deal of aid to Ukraine – something which the Commissioner already referred to – although the effectiveness of that aid is sometimes called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Belarus is possibly worse still. About two and a half million people are still living in the contaminated areas where they often eat contaminated food. The health situation is alarming, especially for the children. The socio-economic situation in that country is bad anyway, which makes the people more vulnerable to disease and adverse effects than in normal circumstances. The government in Minsk may spend a huge proportion of the government budget on the effects, but it refuses to deal with the problem openly. Its policy is often counterproductive and screens the problem from the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community is involved, albeit on a small scale. NGOs carry out their work under difficult conditions. My admiration goes especially to the European organisations which bring thousands of children to western Europe annually for a holiday in order to enable them to recover to some extent from the effects of radiation. But that, of course, is not enough by a long chalk.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations between the European Union and the undemocratic government in Belarus are strained. We can understand that. At the same time, it is difficult to accept that not more of an effort is being made, precisely in the interest of the people affected, who are not at all involved in government politics.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said before, but I would once again like to make an urgent appeal to the Commission to free up more specific aid for Belarus. I am not convinced by the argument that neither TACIS nor ECHO allow this. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people who are still in need and still require direct aid. Let us for once overstep our own political and bureaucratic boundaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After 14 years, the European Union has a responsibility to take a different course of action, as, in response to this human tragedy, the measures taken still focus largely on the energy technology aspects. The European Commission gave in to blackmail by the Ukrainian authorities by approving the construction of two new nuclear power plants in exchange for closing down Chernobyl. This self-seeking collusion between the political elite and the nuclear lobby rides roughshod over the total disapproval of Ukraine’s citizens and the potential that Ukraine has for renewable energy sources and energy savings.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Belarus, 23% of the territory is affected by radiation and needs to be evacuated immediately. It is essential, therefore, that the second part of the TACIS programme be implemented in Belarus to provide medical and health support, in Belarus and within our own Member States, to the civilian population still living in the contaminated areas and particularly to children. This moral and humanitarian duty must be accomplished with adequate resources and funding which are in line with the extent of the ecological disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">The autocratic and repressive regime in Belarus, which wants to play down this public health crisis as far as possible and to silence scientists such as Mr Nesterenko and Mr Bandazhevsky, can no longer be used as an alibi by the European Union and pro-nuclear lobbies to hide the reality of Chernobyl and abandon the long-suffering communities of these contaminated regions, to their fate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the responsibility of the WHO, a direct accomplice in this tragedy through an incestuous agreement concluded in 1957 with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which takes, of course, a pro-nuclear stance, and which has since become its legal censor in nuclear matters. It is also the European Union’s responsibility to free the WHO from the control of the IAEA. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Victims, human lives are being lost to cancer. And this disaster did not just affect the neighbouring countries, Ukraine and Belarus, it affected countries thousands of miles away, including my own.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is, and I agree with previous speakers here: have we learnt our lesson from this accident, have we finally understood that human error is always there, lying in ambush waiting to strike? Where human error combines with a nuclear reactor which is unsafe and does not meet proper safety standards, as in the present case, then of course the dangers are immense.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this, Commissioner, because similar reactors are still operating in Europe. They are operating in Russia, they are operating in Lithuania, they are operating in Slovakia and four reactors are operating in our neck of the woods, close to Greece, in Kozlodoui. I, for one, disagree with the Commission’s timetable for shutting down these reactors which, as the Commission itself says, cannot be upgraded at reasonable expense to the safety standards which a nuclear reactor should meet. For example, what has been said about Kozlodoui? That two reactors should be shut down in 2002, while we have yet to agree that the other two should be shut down in 2006. Surely this is a very long time to leave dangerous reactors in operation. And why? Because there are financial considerations. Well, let us deal with the financial considerations. Financial considerations cannot take precedence over the environment and human health in general and the health of European citizens in particular. Consequently, I say to you, as you are here, that you should be forceful, not only because some of the candidate countries do not want to keep to these dates, but also because various arguments as to how their service life can be extended are already being bandied about. For example, I read in the papers two days ago that the official press in Kozlodoui said that it could stay in operation until 2010. The reactors may even be sold to private individuals. For the love of God, how can they say such things?</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that, fifteen years after Chernobyl and with what we have to do so that Chernobyl is safe and sound under its sarcophagus, we need to be sure, over and above these efforts, that we intend to put an end to these dangerous reactors in Bulgaria, Slovakia, Lithuania and Russia. I think that, if money needs to be spent, Commissioner, we should spend it. The financial problem is secondary. The most important considerations are the environment and health, the public health of the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As well as the deaths and the terrible illnesses in the region, 15 years on there is still a frightening legacy of radioactive contamination. An area about the size of Britain is permanently contaminated and uninhabitable.</p>
<p class="contents">Much less tragic, but serious even so, in my constituency in Wales, following contamination from Chernobyl, 359 farms are still under restrictions today and thousands of sheep are restricted from movement to ensure that no animal contaminated with radioactivity enters the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been continuous monitoring for 15 years and the restrictions will last for another 10-15 years. We must have sustainable energy policies. Nuclear power is no solution. It is not clean and it is not cheap. In over 40 years of operation the nuclear industry has not even solved the problem of radioactive waste and, above all, it poses massive threats to human health and the environment. Nothing illustrates that better than Chernobyl and we have to learn from it. We may never know the full impact of the disaster but we must make every effort, as outlined in this resolution, to find out all we can and provide effective assistance to help the worst-affected areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is important that we remember the event in Chernobyl 15 years ago, and you have yourselves provided testimony to the ways in which this affects us even today and in our Member States too.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like to be able to debate energy policy, but I believe we should avoid that today and instead concentrate on the subjects of how we can improve nuclear safety in the applicant States and, of course, of how we are to continue to cooperate with Ukraine and Russia. These issues also illustrate the nature and character of the environmental problems. They acknowledge no national borders, but follow a river or prevailing wind, something for which we are still paying a high price today.</p>
<p class="contents">I have received a number of questions, which I shall try to answer, but I should perhaps say first of all that I hope that Parliament can take the time to deal with the communication on which the Commission decided in September of last year and which concerns the Commission’s support for improved nuclear safety in the applicant States. In this, the Commission explains its view of how these issues must be worked with, that is to say that both short- and long-term approaches are required.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short term, it has been a question of getting a number of applicant States to close down the old-fashioned Chernobyl-style reactors they use. We have tried to encourage the applicant States to submit concrete timetables for doing that. These must then be followed up in order to ensure that they are really being implemented. Naturally, Members of Parliament know as well as we do that we do not have competence in this area to force either the Member States or the applicant States to do anything. We must try to work with them through a variety of agreements, through sound cooperation and also by means of support in many different forms. We are concerned here with everything from education to financial support for upgrading safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been asked what standards are applied. As you know, we have no special European standards, but we say that <span class="italic">European Union Practices</span> must be complied with. What does that mean? Over the years, the EU’s Member States have developed a safety standard which we should also like to see the applicant States being able to comply with. There is now also a working party in the Council which compares those standards that exist in the applicant States with those that exist in the EU countries, identifying those shortcomings and differences that exist so that it will be possible to overcome these and upgrade security in the applicant States. The IAEA’s standards form the basis, of course, but these are so general that they require ‘practical application’.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, Mrs Schörling, in fact also have agreements to close the most dangerous nuclear power stations of all – Kozloduy, Ignalina and Bohunice – and to ensure that the safety of the remaining reactors is upgraded so that we obtain an acceptable standard.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have explained fairly well in this communication from the Commission how we view these issues, but we can perfectly well use this day and this opportunity to reflect upon the vulnerability of even the very most modern nuclear technology and nuclear power used. We are still vulnerable, and we still have a problem with waste. You probably know where I stand when it comes to the use of nuclear power but, even though I am critical of this, I believe that the research into safety issues must continue. That is incredibly important, I believe.</p>
<p class="contents">In this area, we cannot decide over the heads of the Member States or against their will. We must cooperate with the Member States on these issues and do all we can, because we share the same environment and are all exposed to risks if we live with unacceptable safety levels. Above all, I agree with what one MEP pointed out, to the effect that we must remember the children and make sure we do everything in order also to help and support those children who still have to pay the price for the dreadful tragedy of Chernobyl.
