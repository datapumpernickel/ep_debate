Mr President, it is my pleasure to join you tonight for this discussion on the report by Mr Wortmann-Kool on the Commission’s proposal to repeal Regulation (EC) No 4056/86.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very pleased with the report’s recognition that price- fixing liner conferences are no longer justified in today’s market conditions, either legally or economically.</p>
<p class="contents">The thrust of our proposal is to increase EU competitiveness, much in keeping with the Lisbon agenda. Roughly 18% of imports and 21% of EU exports are affected by carriers’ ability to fix prices jointly under the liner conference block exemption. The repeal of this block exemption will result in lower transport prices, engendering an overall benefit to the EU economy.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, the Commission has also been concerned with preserving the competitiveness of the EU liner shipping industry. That is why we are preparing guidelines explaining how competition law will apply to the liner sector, once Regulation (EC) No 4056/86 is repealed. The Commission is committed to promulgating the guidelines by the end of 2007. In view of the two-year transitional period, the guidelines will be in place before the repeal of the liner conference block exemption takes effect, thus giving industry ample time to adjust to a new competitive environment in the knowledge that what it seeks to do is lawful.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been discussing closely with both the transport providers, carriers, and the transport users, shippers, on the content of the guidelines. The focus will be on ensuring the competitiveness of the transport sector. I think we all agree that ensuring competitiveness is not the same as shielding the sector from competition. Information exchanges are lawful and are common practice in most industries, because they enable business to make better decisions. However, they must not go so far as to prevent undertakings from determining their conduct in the market independently of each other.</p>
<p class="contents">The process leading to the adoption of the guidelines by the Commission includes discussions with both transport users and transport providers, as well as with the Member States in the European Competition Network’s maritime transport subgroup. Draft guidelines will be published so that all interested parties have the opportunity to comment. Other institutions may also put forward comments during that time.</p>
<p class="contents">In other cases, notably in the field of state aids, the European Parliament has used this opportunity to make its views known. We look forward to the European Parliament’s continued interest in this important initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the concerns raised on international issues. I would like to reassure you that we are keeping our trading partners aware of our initiative, explaining the economic and legal reasons that underpin it. These contacts have so far been positive. There is a general acknowledgement that the repeal of the liner conference block exemption by the EU will not cause conflicts of law with third countries and that it is a process that responds to today’s market conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the Commission can take on board most of the amendments tabled. This should, however, not be in the form of recitals to a legislative text. I believe it should remain a clear and simple repeal of Regulation (EC) No 4056/86. However, your recommendations will be reflected in follow-up measures. These include the guidelines, as well as the information updates and the reassessment of other legislative texts such as Regulation (EC) No 954/79 on the accession to the UN Convention on the Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences, to which the European Parliament has drawn the Commission’s attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corien Wortmann-Kool (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the maritime sector’s economic importance is considerable, and its growth potential enormous. Precisely at a time when globalisation develops at an ever quicker pace, those global transport flows and the effective handling of them are of key importance. European industry has an important and strong role to play in this. It is a sector that is becoming highly competitive, and it is in actual fact the only sector that is still exempt from the application of the Treaty's rules of competition. It is therefore high time we abolished this exemption.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, this House pledges its support for Commissioner McCreevy’s proposal to repeal the present Regulation 4056/86. Legal uncertainty about the interpretation of competition rules is, however, something we want to avoid, and I am pleased that the Commissioner recognises this, because the Commission will, not least in the future, need to continue to take into consideration the specific characteristics of this internationally operating sector. That is why the rules should become clear in future.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also the reason why this House would like to see clear guidelines drafted for the sector before the regulation is withdrawn. I am pleased that the Commissioner has expressed the intention of doing so before the end of 2007 with regard to liner shipping. This House, though, since this criterion is an essential pillar in this proposal, believes that it should be explicitly mentioned in the legislative text. The sector must be given guaranteed legal certainty about what is, and is not, permitted in the present regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to hear that you have entered into intensive debates with the sector. This House would also ask you, though, and will also do so explicitly tomorrow, to consult it about the content of the guidelines. Can you give your word that this House will be consulted on this matter? This is, after all, often good practice in other areas too. I am pleased to say that, by the looks of things, we will, by a large majority, be able to send this powerful message to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This House sets great store by the fact that the Commission spells it out that other forms of cooperation, including the consortia block exemption, would continue to apply to this container liner shipping sector, because important operational agreements can be made in this respect, for example in terms of capacity. Whilst that is a necessity for this sector, this should, of course, always be subject to Article 81 of the Treaty. It is vitally important to ensure that this cooperation should run smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to cabotage and tramp services, the Commission suggests moving the enforcement of competition rules to European level. That is a logical step because the Treaty already applies at that level. Since this enforcement also belongs at European level, you can count on our support in this. Some Members of this House have proposed exempting cabotage, but I will not be supporting that view. Parliament would like to see guidelines drafted in the tramp sector too, because that sector, just like the other sectors, is also entitled to know where it stands. According to Parliament, guidelines should therefore be known in that area too before this legislation enters into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Clarity right from the start prevents all kinds of costly legal procedures which the sector can really do without. There are already examples of such cases in the tramp sector with regard to pool agreements. There have been complaints in that sector, and it is unclear to that sector how the Commission will go on from here. So, once again, this lack of clarity should be mitigated by guidelines in that sector too.</p>
<p class="contents">The international dimension is, of course, vitally important to this internationally operating sector. We would therefore ask you – and fortunately you are already aware of this – to be very mindful of this international competitive position when the proposals are fleshed out further. That also applies to the repeal of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) code, and we look forward to receiving a report about those international developments so that we can follow them closely. Once again, we will be pledging our support, but the conditions are tough as nails as far as this House is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have exchanged views with the European Commission within the framework of the White Paper, and in a resolution adopted by a large majority the European Parliament maintained that our merchant fleet, in the competitive and rapidly developing international environment, needs a clear framework for manoeuvre which must guarantee fair and healthy competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Our economy and development plan are based on competition. However, it is up to us to predict the conditions and possible side effects and to create a suitable political framework. That is why we called on small and medium-sized shipping enterprises not to throw away opportunities and not to sacrifice their interests and their business plans to mergers and to the behemoths being created in the industry, especially on regular lines.</p>
<p class="contents">We called for care to be taken to ensure that the market was not sent into shock by the European Commission's proposals and for gradual and creative adaptation to the new circumstances. We want our concerns to be taken seriously by the European Commission in all cases.</p>
<p class="contents">My thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, and to the Committee on Transport and Tourism, whose opinion proposes solutions to the matter which I hope will be voted through and accepted by the European Commission. Allow me to reiterate the matters that concern us; they are the transitional period for proper adaptation to the new circumstances and clear guidelines. I agree with the rapporteur that cabotage should not be exempted from free competition.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I wish to highlight the lack of attention on the part of the European Commission to the international dimension of the matter, both as regards whether the UNCTAD code will apply and how the Member States will be able to change regime, and as regards the lack of detailed information on the dialogue with our partners China, Japan, Singapore and India, as regards their reaction to a possible change of regime. I would point out by way of example that Singapore has already announced that it will continue to maintain the conference system.</p>
<p class="contents">This is therefore a point on which I expect a reply from the European Commission as to how the European Union will act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a balanced report, and while it does not include all the views expressed by my group, it is still acceptable, since it stresses the most important things. It asks for the speedy publication of guidelines by the Commission so as to afford greater legal certainty to those providing international tramp and maritime cabotage services.</p>
<p class="contents">It also points out that exchanges of information are important and may be beneficial for the stability and efficiency of these sectors. It brings useful detail and, lastly, gives particular importance to small operators.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of this Parliament’s Committee on Transport, I would nevertheless like to express a few regrets, stressing one point in particular. Together with my colleagues Mr Savary and Mr Sifunakis, I tabled an amendment concerning the legal basis of the text on which Parliament is to vote tomorrow morning. That amendment was rejected by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. As a result, it could not be submitted for the vote in plenary. I deplore that. Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86, which this regulation proposes to repeal, was adopted on a twofold legal basis: Articles 84 (transport policy) and 87 (competition) of the Treaty, now Articles 80 and 83. The proposed repeal takes up only Article 83 (competition).</p>
<p class="contents">That is a political choice with serious consequences. It in fact determines the procedure applicable and limits the powers of Parliament, since the legal basis relating to competition alone involves a consultation procedure. The legal basis relating to transport, on the other hand, would have resulted in a codecision procedure. In my opinion, that would have been preferable. While I think that competition may be stimulating and beneficial to the economy, I do not see it as a panacea and am not in favour of its blind and indiscriminate application to all sectors of the economy, with no regard to their specific nature or even the state they are in.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, the Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition has sometimes given us the impression of defending that rather dogmatic outlook against all comers and especially against the opinion of other Commission services.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is a consultative document, I hope that this report will at all events give the Commission a better picture of the concerns of operators who are not against the idea of reform, but who would like some guarantees and guidance regarding the changes with which they will be faced. These are legitimate concerns, and all the more so because this sector is of fundamental importance for Europe’s future and its development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These are similar in form but less advanced than the pools of chemical shipping companies which were set up later. Shipping conferences regulate the lines of ships' round trips, the ports they put into, the number of ships available for each line and the freightage charged.</p>
<p class="contents">The argument that shipping conferences have supposedly brought about better and cheaper services for the workers is unsubstantiated. Inflation, poverty, unemployment, poorer and more commercialised services are the harsh reality which workers have to put up with.</p>
<p class="contents">Shipping conferences were developed for the transportation of raw materials and in international trade in general, mainly between the northern European shore and shipping monopolies, and they secured huge, astronomical profits for euro-unifying capital. Today, the same business groups are calling for shipping conferences to be abolished and the European Commission agrees with this.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the new legislative initiative is obviously to strengthen competitiveness, expand the insulting privileges of the euro-unifying monopolies engaged in maritime transport and allow them carte blanche to increase their profits.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the concentration of capital in this specific sector has advanced to such a degree that basically a few companies, which can be counted on the fingers of one hand, control transport on regular lines. Typically, one European container transport company operates 550 ships while, by contrast, a similar Asian company operates 112 ships. To talk of competition under these circumstances is pure hypocrisy. We do not agree that cabotage should come under competition rules, just as we do not agree with Regulation No 4050/86 or Regulation No 3577/92.</p>
<p class="contents">The reactionary institutional framework for shipping, the anti-grassroots policy of the European Union is strengthening the implacability and insatiable lust of shipowners for profit and is creating serious political and social problems in Greece, France, Finland and Ireland. Of course, the Council and the European Commission, in collusion with employers, are pushing them towards the European Court of Justice. The point is that they will have to face them because the workers are not prepared to sell out their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Unequal pay for equal work, a heavier workload for maritime workers, the fact that ticket prices and freightage have gone through the roof, the reduction in schedule frequencies and the system of keeping overly old, under-maintained ships in coastal shipping are typical of domestic maritime transport. The application of the anti-grassroots Regulation No 3577/92 has already struck a heavy blow to maritime transport and caused serious problems for workers, passengers and residents, especially in isolated island regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Maintaining the exemption of maritime transport conducted solely <span class="italic">(at this point the President asked the speaker to speak more slowly for the benefit of the interpreters)</span> between ports of the same Member State from the application of the competition rules is of strategic importance to the economic development, social cohesion and national defence of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, it is vital to maintain the exemption provided for in Article 32(b) of Regulation No 1/2003. That is why we propose Amendments 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 in this direction. In addition, the anti-grassroots Regulation No 3577/92 urgently needs to be abolished for coastal shipping. Maritime transport is a social necessity which cannot be satisfied within the framework of an anti-grassroots competition policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that we have worked towards an initiative that will have an echo in the years to come in other jurisdictions as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Liner shipping has been organised as a cartel, albeit legally, since the 1870s, not just in Europe but in most other industrial nations. By taking the step of examining market conditions carefully, we have all come to acknowledge that liner shipping is a highly competitive industry that does not need to be protected against competition. We are confident that our initiative will encourage our major trading partners to review whether their approach to this industry is correct and economically viable and, most importantly, our perseverance has convinced the industry that it does not need price-fixing. It is now considering in earnest how it can best adapt to a very competitive environment, fuelled by globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s contribution to this process has been significant. First, the Committee on Transport and Tourism produced an own-initiative report in December 2005, in response to the Commission’s White Paper, drawing our attention to several issues we had not considered before. We took those issues on board as we pursued our revision process. Then the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs set out its views after extensive discussions with my services.</p>
<p class="contents">We are grateful for your work and the confidence you have shown in addressing these complex issues. We will respond to your suggestions in the coming months in several initiatives, for instance through information updates on the situation regarding the application of competition rules for liner shipping in third countries, the Commission guidelines on the application of EU competition law to the maritime transport services and a reassessment of other legislative texts on the validity of which you have raised doubts. We will consult widely and look forward to Parliament’s views on the guidelines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
