<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolaï,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to discuss with you the situation in Ukraine before the presidential elections, and the state of relations between the European Union and Ukraine. The Ukrainian people stand at the crossroads of very important presidential elections. These elections will determine the direction Ukraine will take over the next four years.</p>
<p class="contents">At this important time, the European Union has four clear messages for the Ukrainian people. The first message is simple: the EU is following the developments in Ukraine very closely. Since we are neighbours, we know we matter to each other. However, this does not mean that we always think the same way. In fact, certain developments within Ukraine are followed with a certain degree of concern by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine’s track record in the areas of democratisation, human rights, upholding the rule of law, and the reform process, is mixed at best. To give just a few examples, there still remain questions about the disappearance of a Ukrainian journalist, the current process of constitutional reform and the virtual absence of a pluralist media. The EU regularly conveys its concerns to the Ukrainian authorities, for example during the recent EU-Ukraine summit, but also during other political dialogue meetings and through our embassies in Kiev. We are therefore following very closely and with particular attention the electoral campaign in Ukraine in the run-up to the elections on 31 October.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased that Ukraine has generously provided invitations for international monitoring of the elections by ODIHR. Many EU Member States will send observers and the ODIHR findings will be a very important reference point for the EU. But we already have some concerns about the electoral process. I will give a few examples.</p>
<p class="contents">There are clear indications that there is a biased media coverage. As you all know, it is essential to provide all political candidates with equal access to the media. Direct pressure on independent media has been growing in Ukraine, making it extremely difficult for the electoral process to be covered by a pluralistic and independent mass media. Only independent and free media coverage of the electoral process can ensure free, fair and transparent elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there are reports of political pressure against voters, coercing them to take part in rallies and campaign events. Other reports mention administrative harassment of the opposition, use of administrative resources to obstruct presidential candidates from campaigning by depriving them of campaign materials, the use of state money, property and equipment for campaign purposes, and so on. We hope that these incidents will not threaten a credible and democratic election outcome. The Ukrainian Government has to ensure this.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, we appreciate the Ukrainian invitation to monitor the election campaign and the elections, but foreign observers alone are not enough. These are Ukrainian elections, for the Ukrainian people, needing Ukrainian observers. We regret, therefore, that independent, non-partisan observers are not allowed to monitor the presidential elections as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We have communicated this message to the Ukrainian Government through our Council conclusions and through the declarations of an earlier presidency. We have also used our various high-level contacts to get this message across. And the Council will remain active, not just during the first round of elections, but also at the possible second round later in November.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that this message will convince the Ukrainian Government to respect democratic norms more strictly. There should be no manipulation of the election process to the advantage of one particular candidate and to the detriment of others. Free and fair elections and respect of democratic standards are essential if Ukraine really wants a rapprochement with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The second message we have for the Ukrainian people is closely linked to the first one: Ukraine matters to the EU and vice versa, especially since enlargement. Several of the new Member States of the EU have strong economic, cultural and historical ties to Ukraine. Since enlargement, Ukraine is now a direct neighbour of the EU. The enlargement process has increased the importance of Ukraine to the EU. Moreover, the knowledge which the new Member States have enables the EU to conduct a more active and effective policy.</p>
<p class="contents">But our relationship is not just about economics, culture and history. Ukraine is also an important political actor. Its close relationship with Russia and its role in the UN, illustrated by numerous Ukrainian contributions to peace-keeping operations, are clear proof. Our cooperation, therefore, in the area of foreign policy should be developed further. ESDP is one area, and the fact that a framework agreement for Ukraine's participation in EU crisis management operations will be signed soon is testimony to this.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the third message. The EU has the right instruments to conduct an effective policy towards Ukraine and intensify our relationship. First and foremost there is the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which comes with ministerial troikas, political dialogues and numerous expert-level working groups. The PCA will remain the cornerstone of EU-Ukraine cooperation. Furthermore, I hope that we will soon be able to adopt the action plan under the European Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This action plan is an EU-Ukraine co-production and it will offer concrete objectives for the coming years. As President Kuchma stated at the last EU-Ukraine Summit, we need to commit ourselves to implementing what should be a plan of action and not merely a plan of intention. And the EU is committed to working on this in close cooperation with any candidate who wins in free, fair and transparent elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our fourth message: EU-Ukraine cooperation will not always be easy, but it is in our mutual interests that the long-term trend is uphill, not downhill. If one listens to the comments and opinions of opinion-makers and politicians, both in the EU and in Ukraine, one often gets the impression that the EU-Ukraine relationship is sub-optimal at best. Ukraine wants the EU to offer more: the prospect of EU membership, better treatment in the area of free movement, etc. And some say that if the EU does not do more for Ukraine, Kiev will automatically drift into the arms of Moscow.</p>
<p class="contents">The single economic area is often quoted as evidence that this is already happening. Furthermore, the conduct of the upcoming presidential elections could possibly cast a shadow on our relations. Here lies a task for the Ukrainian Government and its people.</p>
<p class="contents">But I believe that, even though our cooperation may sometimes be difficult, the long-term trend will be positive. The trend simply is not towards isolationism one, but towards integration. On 14 September the Ukrainian Parliament held a debate on EU-Ukraine relations. At that meeting a large majority of the parliamentarians supported EU integration. The joint action plan will be testimony of our own desire to enhance the quality of our relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude that it is time for the Ukrainian people to make a choice. Our message is clear, both on the elections and on the future of EU-Ukraine relations. Election time is always hard and we wish the Ukrainian people every wisdom. We hope they make the right choice: a choice for democracy and development, for justice and for the rule of law. And let us hope the circumstances will be such that they can make that choice.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to point out the enormous importance of Ukraine as a strategic partner of the European Union. Ukraine, being one of our immediate neighbours, with which we have close economic, social and human ties, is very particularly significant in terms of the long-term stability, security and prosperity of our European continent. Ukraine is an important partner in establishing security and stability throughout the region; there is no doubt that it shares in our European culture and in our common history.</p>
<p class="contents">In its November 2003 resolution on the European Neighbourhood Policy, the European Parliament reaffirmed that Ukraine – like any other European state with a democratic constitution and a market economy – should have the option of, one day, applying for membership of the European Union, subject to its fulfilling the relevant conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not, at present, on our agenda, but my staff and I have nonetheless, over the past months, devised a medium-term and concrete perspective for the enlarged European Union’s neighbours – the European Neighbourhood Policy to which Mr Nicolaï has already referred. Liasing closely with the Ukrainian Government, we have devised a concrete and tailor-made action plan, which I will shortly be submitting to the Commission and, immediately thereafter, also to the Council and to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Nicolaï has already referred to the many vital and new things that are on offer to Ukraine and to its people through the Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget that we have cooperated to a significantly greater extent with Ukraine over recent years, especially since the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement entered into force in 1998. Dialogue is being cultivated in a variety of ways, including an annual summit. The European Parliament also, under our Partnership Agreement, has developed its own framework for in-depth dialogue with the Ukrainian Parliament. It gives me great pleasure that the new chairman of your House’s delegation to Ukraine, Mr Siwiec, is from Poland, one of Ukraine’s immediate neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">Although open and frank dialogue between partners ought to be the most obvious thing in the world, it is rather remarkable that the Ukrainian presidential elections scheduled for the coming weekend have shown themselves to be – to put it mildly – deserving of criticism to a significant degree. I can, unfortunately, do no other than concur wholeheartedly with Mr Nicolaï’s expressions of the gravest concern at the omissions and irregularities apparent in the election campaign, especially as regards the freedom of the media.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want the Members of this House to misunderstand me; this has only a very tenuous connection with the debate we have just had on Belarus. There is no doubt whatever of the progress Ukraine has made towards becoming a democratically constituted state, and, when it is borne in mind that the states that succeeded the former Soviet Union found this road a particularly long one, credit should be given for that. Real political parties are coming into being. Civil society is taking shape, and a whole array of non-governmental organisations are becoming vigorously active. Regulations and mechanisms intended to guarantee due legal and democratic process have been drawn up and reformed in close cooperation with the Council of Europe and the OSCE, in which the support of the European Commission has been crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Still to this day, though, it is a regrettable fact that, in Ukraine, many of these ground rules of democracy and the rule of law exist only on paper. This is probably the fundamental truth that emerges from the present situation, as that country is preparing to go to the polls.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that what we can see going on there now is an election campaign with virtually no holds barred. We can of course see that as a positive sign, an indication of political competition, but it can also be seen as evidence that there is much still to be desired as regards political culture. We should not forget, though, that there is a significant difference in comparison with other states in the region. Whatever else might be said about it, the present election campaign in Ukraine is a real one, with several genuine and competing candidates.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make it clear to you, though, that we cannot lower our standards for adherence to shared values and democratic principles, on which depends the implementation of our European Neighbourhood Policy action plan for the future – which is a very ambitious one.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable that authorities and other state bodies should interfere in elections at various levels and in all manner of different ways. Nor is it acceptable that not only opposition politicians, but also independent civil society initiatives should be subject to increasingly repressive measures. The first preliminary reports by the observers sent by the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights paint a somewhat gloomy picture of only partly objective reporting on the part of the national electronic media.</p>
<p class="contents">Critical and sceptical I may be, but I remain confident that the presence of election observers can help the elections to proceed in a democratic and legitimate manner. The European Union has mounted a number of projects in order to try to help the Central Election Commission, non-governmental organisations and journalists to play their parts in the election process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is cause for gratitude that the European Parliament, like the EU’s Member States and the Commission, is sending observers to participate in the OSCE’s International Election Observation Mission. Those who are then to report to us from Ukraine will have very great responsibilities, for much of what we do in Ukraine in the future will depend on what they have to say.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the election represents a crucial test for democracy in Ukraine. We in this place should appeal to the state authorities, to the media, to the political parties and, not least, to the candidates, to allow the remaining days of the campaign leading up to the election to be characterised by democracy, the rule of law and fairness, which are absolute requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Commission is indeed prepared to promptly implement, under the New Neighbourhood Policy, the closer cooperation with the new President that we seek, it is not in the least irrelevant to us how this election is won. Let me conclude by repeating that the closer partnership with Ukraine that we want is dependent on its commitment to common values and democratic principles and a determined and unambiguous policy of allowing these values and principles to be realised in day-to-day political life.</p>

Unlike other former Soviet countries, the outcome is still genuinely uncertain and contrasts markedly with the election two weeks ago in Belarus, where a massive fraud was perpetrated on the people of that country. Nevertheless, so far in the campaign, there have been widespread allegations of bias by the authorities against the opposition front-runner, Mr Yushchenko, ranging from the use of administrative resources dedicated to backing the incumbent Prime Minister Yanukovych as a presidential candidate, to bizarre allegations of KGB-style poisoning with ricin.</p>
<p class="contents">Of more concern has been the harassment of opposition print media and impeded access to state and private TV coverage. There are also allegations that there have been numerous paper or technical candidates submitted by backers of Mr Yanukovych in order to distort the composition of the local election committees. In fairness, such tactics occur everywhere, are legal, and the government of Ukraine would have faced Lukashenka-style criticism if these candidates had been rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also concerns that the polling stations set up in the Russian Federation will be very hard to monitor independently. Also, I was personally concerned to hear last weekend that two serving policemen were found to be part of the mob that physically attacked a pro-Yushchenko rally.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I welcome the government of Ukraine's invitation for me to attend – with six other MEPs – as an observer in Kiev. I call for restraint from any action to distort the true will of the people to elect a president of their choosing. Ukraine now has an opportunity to demonstrate its commitments to free, fair and transparent elections as part of the European community of nations, where it truly belongs.</p>

<p class="contents">Democratisation in Ukraine is one of the greatest challenges for the Neighbourhood Policy, which aims to build up relations with the countries surrounding the European Union. Needless to say, the developments in Ukraine are also an important indicator of that Policy’s success. The presidential elections on 31 October and the second round a few weeks after that play a central role in those developments. In simplified terms, the choice is between the present course of a semi-democratic regime on the one hand and the European course of the democratic opposition on the other. The government, President Kuchma, with the oligarchs supporting him behind the scenes, and the Russian President Putin who yesterday started a visit to the Ukraine lasting several days, support their own candidate, Prime Minister Yanukovych. Despite a number of official reforms, the latter does not have a good reputation as regards freedom of the press, freedom of opinion and the guaranteeing of an open and fair democratic process. In the run-up to the elections, countless incidents have been reported, including, as the most striking of all, the mysterious illness of the most important opposition candidate, Mr Yushchenko. We have grave concerns about this. Nevertheless, as Commissioner Verheugen already stated, we welcome the fact that there is a true election battle being fought in that country, and we also hope that those campaigns persist.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, it remains to be seen whether the elections will receive the full approval of the international observers, our own and that of the OSCE. I endorse Commissioner Verheugen’s appeal to those observers, urging them to take their weighty responsibilities very seriously indeed. After all, the declarations that are made at the end of such an election often have a significant impact on relations between the European Union and the relevant country. We would therefore urge the Ukrainian authorities, in the last days before the first round of those presidential elections, to ensure that all candidates have equal access to the media, to repair what damage can be repaired and to commit to a fair campaign in the second round – which will, of course, be the most important – so that the Ukrainian population can make up their own minds.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine has expressed a desire for still closer cooperation with the European institutions, and for stronger relations with the European Union. The ties with the European Union can be strengthened only if Ukraine demonstrates that it takes its own democracy seriously, because a disruption in the democratic process in those elections could greatly encumber relations between the European Union and Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, however, like to draw your attention to several new and, in my opinion, novel aspects that have emerged during this particular campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is the appearance of fictional candidates in lists of candidates. Twenty-three candidates are running for president of Ukraine, but in reality only a few are genuinely doing so. Most of the others are registered in exactly the same way, but their participation in the election campaign is limited to a statement that although they are standing for election, the better candidate is in fact someone quite other. In addition, their representatives in electoral committees are in practice representatives of an entirely different candidate.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect which has recently become apparent, and which could pose a risk, although the risk may have abated somewhat at present, is the large number of electoral constituencies outside Ukraine. These have been set up because of the large Ukrainian minority living in Russia. According to statistics, this minority numbers several million. The electoral constituencies on Russian territory will be exclusively under the control of candidates, at least officially. They will be beyond any kind of international control, and the number of votes cast there could influence the outcome of the election.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a third aspect to this electoral campaign, namely Russia’s very strong support for one of the candidates. Russia reacts sharply with accusations of interference in the affairs of other countries to any criticism of the way in which the electoral campaign in Belarus and in other countries is conducted, for example, yet in the case at hand it has absolutely no inhibitions. An additional threat emerging is that the situation might be resolved by force. I recently returned from a visit to Ukraine, during which I met a number of people, and concerns of this nature are frequently voiced in the country. We need to be aware that such a threat could emerge. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It really is a decision for the Ukrainian people. Yet, as many other Members of this House have noted before me, we await this weekend and this electoral process with concern, as it is becoming apparent that the campaign is being fought on unfair terms, and with no holds barred. President Kuchma is cracking the whip for his preferred candidate, and forcing state officials and television channels into line to support him.</p>
<p class="contents">We support Mr Wiersma in his call for an end to be put to this and for a fair electoral process to be given a chance. I concur with the Presidency’s demands and share its regret that local election observers could not be deployed, as during the last elections this proved to be a key factor in ensuring that the public viewed the elections as democratic. An extremely high turnout has made clear the country’s potential as a democracy , and it is therefore crucial that measures are taken to prevent any undesirable developments, as well as to ensure that these elections are conducted in a genuinely democratic fashion. I have confidence in the people of Ukraine, but I also call on the Presidency and the Commission to ensure that support for democratic structures and, above all, for civil society is accorded a central role in the action plan, and is given higher priority than economic development, as the development of democracy in Ukraine still stands on shaky ground, and must be consolidated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has a common border with three of them, which of course gives rise to social and economic links, and, when overall relations with it are considered, it also wields powerful influence. In addition, it plays a significant role in relation to Moldova, a country where Ukraine’s involvement is necessary. Having spent six years of my life in Ukraine and having known the country for over 30 years, I can tell you that it is currently following a path which leads quite clearly to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be rather more restrained in our demands for tremendous speed and transformation, as some things simply take time. As previous speakers have observed, it is of course the case that some doubts always remain; for example, Russia’s support for a certain candidate can be said to present a problem. Yet a problem is also presented by Mr Blair’s support for Mr Bush in the USA. It is nothing new for there to be talk of checking certain votes cast by voters living abroad; indeed, a large number of Americans are allowed to vote in Germany. It is always assumed in advance that there is an enormous risk that the democratic rules of play will not be adhered to in certain countries, whereas no such assumptions are made in the case of others. We are all aware as well that in the last presidential elections in Florida there were heated disputes over popular votes. We should have confidence in Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several international organisations have voiced a great many reservations about the way the campaign was conducted, a fact noted in key comments by previous speakers. It cannot be said that the situation in Ukraine is similar to that in Belarus. That would be a step too far. There is, however, something both countries have in common, namely Russia’s strategic interest. In the course of the electoral campaign in Ukraine, this interest was very apparent at the Sochi summit on 26 July of this year and during President Putin’s later visit.</p>
<p class="contents">We know Russia is interested in maintaining a particular political configuration in Ukraine. The candidate who represents this configuration is the current President, Mr Yanukovich. He enjoys far superior access to the media and more opportunities to communicate with his voters. It is important for us to hold talks on issues relating to Ukraine with Russia, a key partner in such matters, and these talks should be placed on the agenda both of meetings held in the framework of the PCA and those held during the EU-Russia summit. In addition, I should like to make a few comments on Mr Verheugen’s statement. It is true that Ukraine does not yet fully meet the criteria of a democratic state, but we know that membership of the EU is the best incentive for it to fulfil these criteria.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One is the European route and the other the sub-Soviet route. The first involves democratic standards, the rule of law, a market economy and accelerated political integration into the structures of the European Union. The second involves the risk of the present political and economic model becoming entrenched.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures can we take to increase the likelihood that the first route will be taken, and not the second? There is indeed little we can do, but we do have some options currently open to us. It would be possible for us to monitor the voting closely and also the electoral campaign between the first and second rounds of voting in the presidential elections, as the campaign during this period will be at its most dramatic. In addition, of course, we need to react.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the presidential elections, this House should adopt a resolution, and later a report, containing details of what needs to be changed in the EU’s policy on Ukraine. Secondly, we should be prepared to postpone the adoption of an action plan for Ukraine by the European Union, or more specifically by the Commission. The fact that the European Commission did not approve the action plan yesterday is to be welcomed, because a victory for Yushchenko would enable us to take more action, to make Ukraine more generous offers and to take measures to support democratic change in the country. A victory for Yanukovich, in turn, would enable us to adopt the action plan in its current version, and to observe the measures taken by the new president, if this turns out to be Yanukovich, in the first days after his electoral victory. If Yushchenko wins, we must be prepared to free up large amounts of additional funding to support the transformation of Ukraine, and we should send out a clear message now that we are prepared to do so. After the elections we should promptly organise a donors’ conference, similar to the conference in Georgia, or rather on behalf of Georgia, which made it possible for the European Union to take steps to support the transformation of this country. It is vital to bear in mind that a strong, democratic and independent Ukraine is essential to the stability of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have a tendency to perceive everything positively, like the Ukrainian authorities, or negatively, like the opposition. Everything appears to be either good or bad. In Ukraine, however, everything is either partly good or partly bad.</p>
<p class="contents">I will act as chairman of Parliament’s observation mission, and I can assure you that the message we are taking to Ukraine is a positive one. We wish to assist Ukrainians to build democracy and respect certain principles. We are not going there with the intention of supporting anyone. We are going to observe the conduct of the elections. The aim of our visit is to bring European standards to the Ukrainian public.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be borne in mind that the elections in Ukraine will not be the catalyst for a revolution. The mood among the Ukrainian public is not one of expectancy that revolutionary changes will occur. I do not believe that Mr Yushchenko will introduce revolutionary changes if he wins, nor that Mr Yanukovich will become an <span class="italic">alter ego</span> of President Kuchma if he does.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ask ourselves what contemporary Ukraine is actually like. How does it differ from other countries of the former Soviet Union? Speakers in this House have said that a genuine political battle is being fought, and indeed where else is a genuine political battle being fought in this region? A month before the elections in Ukraine we do not know who will be President. In the case of the Russian elections, however, it was a foregone conclusion. The existence of any genuine opposition and any genuine alternative at all in Ukraine is an achievement of the past few years. It is also an achievement for the European Union and the countries that supported the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget, however, that even the victory of an opposition representative would not mean that relations with the European Union could be scaled down. It would simply pose new challenges. Russia’s unprecedented influence is an aspect that must not be overlooked, as this is the first time the latter has exerted its influence on such a scale. We must be patient and consistent in our relations with Ukraine, and for this we also need time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a country that achieved independence a mere 12 years ago. It was under some form of occupation or another for centuries. For centuries too, efforts were made to stamp out the Ukrainian language. It would be impossible for such a country to get back on its feet and become both democratic and European in the Western sense of the word within 12 years. After all, your own countries took centuries to do so. This is something that simply has to be taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the European Union cannot afford to act merely as a passive observer of events in this country, a country that lies on the European Union’s eastern border and has a population of 50 million. It simply cannot afford to do so. Regardless of the outcome of the elections, a clearly defined programme is required. This needs to be a programme to support pro-European forces, pro-democratic forces and democratic processes in Ukraine. It should be targeted at young people, and designed to strengthen the economic dimension and economic progress. It must also be allocated the appropriate funding. I hope the European Union will put forward proposals for such a programme. As Mrs Schroedter said, it must be targeted primarily at the citizens, not at the Ukrainian authorities. We all need a programme of this kind. </p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing worse than someone who looks on indifferently as a small, weak child fails to cope with a difficult situation. I believe we should take more concerted action. It is true that the elections will not be fully democratic, but we should not make future aid dependent on elections and election results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thanks to the members of the European Parliament from the new Member States, and their knowledge and experience of these questions, issues connected with Ukraine have been given special attention even in these first few months of Parliament’s work, emphasising the importance of this new European neighbour state as a strategic partner. In the last few years, a great and powerful democratic opposition has formed in Ukraine, but we can see negative tendencies in the field of media freedom and exploitation of the whole administrative machinery in the hands of the ruling elite. These tendencies pose a threat to the process of democratisation and the fairness of the presidential election.</p>
<p class="contents">The election law is legally correct, but compliance with it is compulsory only for the opposition. What is most alarming, however, is the attitude of the people themselves: everyone knows what is going on, but there are so many violations that society has become accustomed to them, and there are only a few people who think that such a way of doing things is unlawful. What is more, the population is being brainwashed with advertising financed by the oligarchs’ millions. The election law does indeed provide for a ceiling on campaign expenditure, but there is no real control of candidates’ funding and political party finances.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of this election must be clearly and effectively reflected in the decisions of the European Union, not merely of censure or support, but also with respect to concrete strategic and financial issues. Currently an action plan is being developed between the European Union and Ukraine within the framework of our new neighbouring country policy. As a member of the European Parliament, I am in favour of refining the content of the document and signing it only once the election is over, once it is perfectly clear whether the Ukrainian presidential election has been democratic and whether the new government is being formed by democratic methods.</p>
<p class="contents">We all need neighbours who are democratic and free of corruption, so that entrepreneurs can earn greater profits in a freely competitive environment, and our people can sleep more soundly, in the knowledge that Ukraine has not put on the snarling bearskin of its big Russian neighbour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The media launch constant attacks on the opposition candidate, Mr Yushchenko, who is not allowed to appear on state radio and television. Rallies held by the opposition are disrupted by hecklers and journalists are intimidated. That is not the worst of it, however. The young Ukrainian democracy would be able to cope with such trials, but it cannot cope if those seeking to destroy it receive support from outside, namely from Russia. President Putin is quite clearly backing Mr Yanukovich. His current visit to Kiev, during the final days of the election campaign, is an obvious interference in Ukraine’s domestic affairs. It is reminiscent of a Tsar’s visit to a subordinate province. In addition, the announcement that 45 electoral committees are to be set up for Ukrainians living in Russia casts doubt on the credibility of the election results. Yet Ukraine is no exception. Russia also remains indifferent to the Belarussian regime’s brutal violations of democracy, as well as to the repeated calls by this House and by the Council of Europe to search for political solutions to the bloody conflict in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">Poland has always shown staunch support for Ukraine’s ambitions to join the Western community of European nations, and will continue to do so. The simple truth is that Ukraine is a state of strategic importance for Western Europe, both from an economic and security point of view and in terms of geopolitical balance in Europe. If the European Commission has no doubts as to the legitimacy of recommending Turkey, a ‘yes’ for Ukraine can only be a matter of time. We should make every effort to reduce this time to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">Our first step should be to say a clear ‘no’ to Russia. I therefore call on this House to ensure that the issue of elections in Ukraine is not passed over by the Member States during the upcoming summit between the European Union and Russia on 11 November. I would also call for every effort to be made during the next two weeks, which are crucial for Ukraine, to prevent Russia taking any action to strengthen autocratic tendencies in its neighbours. This is my appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Verheugen. We must not tolerate the creation of a new iron curtain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, as it appears that the ballot box battle will require two rounds, it is of great importance that Europe should keep a careful watch on this Ukrainian electoral contest during the so-called interim period of 31 October to 21 November 2004, and I would emphatically call on the European institutions to do just that. In addition, the European Union should not place all the emphasis on who leaves the arena as victor, but also on how the battle is fought. If this is done in an unlawful manner, I would expect the Council and Commission to send a clear signal in the direction of Kiev. Although Ukraine’s international isolation may not be in the interest of the Union’s Member States, a ‘business as usual’ attitude is out of the question if that happens.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish with a pressing question. How does the Council view the obvious interference of the Russian President in these Ukrainian presidential elections? After all, this intervention undoubtedly affects the EU Member States’ external interests, not to mention Ukraine’s national independence and its citizens’ political freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me talk specifically about the election process and EU activities concerning the election, because a lot of Members made remarks about that. As I said, we follow the elections very closely. The basis for our opinion on the process will be the report of the OSCE Election Observation Mission. The EU provides about half of the observers for this mission. On a national basis, several Member States provide funding to NGOs that want to contribute to a free and fair election process. In any case, the EU will not remain quiet once the first round of the elections has been completed. We will issue a declaration clearly expressing our opinion about the election process.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members – Mr Tannock and Mr Wiersma – spoke of the possible poisoning of the opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko. We are worried by these reports, but I do not want to speculate about what happened. I am just happy that he is alive and able to continue campaigning, thus maintaining the broad field of candidates from which the Ukrainian people can choose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad that this afternoon has proven this prediction to be true, even if I do not agree with everything that has been said before this House, in particular by the Polish Members. I do, however, welcome the fact that the representatives from our new Member States have taken advantage of this opportunity to highlight their region’s specific problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken the floor one last time in order to counter the impression that we are ‘neutral’ observers of events in Ukraine. This is not the case, and the fact that the country is important to us means that we are extremely active in it. Our activities relate precisely to the promotion of civil society for which Mrs Schroedter called, and indeed we have achieved a number of successes in this field. It is by no means the case that the picture we have to paint is an entirely negative one. It appeared to me that, on the whole, our views on this debate coincide fully with regard both to what we want and how we will achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">The real issue at stake here is the connection between political reform in Ukraine and the prospect of it acceding to the EU. Would a clear prospect of membership in the EU help democratic forces in Ukraine to take the upper hand? My answer to this is a definite ‘yes’, I am absolutely sure that a genuinely convincing prospect of EU membership for Ukraine would help. That is precisely the reason why, together with the action plan, we have offered Ukraine a policy in which the action plan only acts as a start, with the policy being made up of various successive steps bringing us ever closer together. During talks with President Kuchma I have always deliberately left open the issue of where this policy will ultimately lead, and it has been Ukraine itself which has said that it believes that it will one day lead to the European Union. I do not believe that we should reject such an ambition on Ukraine’s part.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final comment, I do not entirely agree with some of the things that have been said in this House this afternoon, for example that we should have more sympathy for democratic deficiencies in Ukraine; after all, the country has a hard time of it, as it is a young democracy, which has been independent for only 12 years. If you will forgive my saying so, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have also only been independent for 12 years, and yet we demanded that these three countries meet our political and democratic standards in full. They were able to do so, even though their past was as difficult as that of Ukraine. I am in favour of us adopting a similarly demanding approach towards Ukraine, and of us telling the democratic forces in the country what we expect of them. I do not, however, believe that the comparison made in this House this afternoon between Ukraine and a small child is an appropriate one. A small child can be taken by the hand, or occasionally given a smack, if needs be. Neither of these actions can be taken in the case of Ukraine, and in both cases the metaphor is inappropriate. Ukraine is not a small child, it is a thoroughly self-confident, important and adult country, and I believe that we can very well demand of this country that it should also behave like an adult. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
