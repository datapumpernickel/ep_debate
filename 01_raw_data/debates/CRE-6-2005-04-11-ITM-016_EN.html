Our proposal has two main elements. The first aims to set common minimal standards as regards certain procedural rights applying to criminal proceedings throughout the European Union. The intention is to promote compliance as a consistent standard, rather than to duplicate the ECHR. The areas where common minimal standards are proposed at this first stage are: firstly, access to legal advice both before and during trial; secondly, access to interpretation and translation free of charge; thirdly, ensuring that appropriate attention is given to persons who are not capable of understanding or following the proceedings; and fifthly, the right for foreign suspects to communicate with consular authorities, and a letter of rights notifying the suspected person of their rights in writing.</p>
<p class="contents">A decision was taken to draw up proposals relating to these five rights initially, because they are of particular importance in the context of mutual recognition. It is not the intention to suggest that these five rights are more important than others, simply that they are of more immediate relevance to mutual recognition. In seeking to enhance fair trial rights generally, this framework decision will have the effect of ensuring a reasonable level of protection to foreign suspects and defendants.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, mutual recognition can only operate effectively in a spirit of confidence. This proposal for a framework decision will strengthen the mutual trust that Member States have in each other’s criminal justice systems. It is important not only to have trust in the integrity of one’s partner’s rules, but also to trust that these rules are correctly applied. That is why a monitoring mechanism is proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Buitenweg (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, that we are, today, at last, debating this report on minimum standards for criminal procedural law that must apply across the European Union is something in which I take great pride. My group voted against the European Arrest Warrant back in 2001, one of the reasons being that no provision had been made for the rights of suspects who, thanks to this new regulation, could be handed over to other EU Member States so much more easily. We are now in a position to end the political battle that was waged then, because we are in any event united in our opinion that the procedural rights of suspects are a necessary addition to the European Arrest Warrant. Many Members have very closely examined this topic and I will have to thank Mr Costa for his proposals from afar. I should also like to thank all other fellow Members very much for the excellent cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest, my work has been made easier because the Commission has done an excellent job. It put together many ideas, consulted certain people, and presented the results in a Green Paper, on which the previous chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Mollar, wrote a favourable report. I have taken his observations as a basis for my report.</p>
<p class="contents">Since criminals do not keep to national boundaries, tracing them must transcend these too. That is on the understanding, however, that the rule of law is observed across Europe. This report is not only about the rights of suspects, it is also about the effective combating of crime. After all, if Member States distrust each other, they will be disinclined to hand over their own subjects to each other without any hesitation. This is exemplified by the British and Dutch plane spotters who, as you will remember, were arrested in Greece some years ago. Despite the storm of protest this unleashed among Dutch and British politicians and citizens, the European Arrest Warrant was adopted by the same politicians in the same month of December, as a result of which, from then on, all the plane spotters had to be extradited to Greece. The question is, however, whether this will actually be done if there is so much protest against it. That is why I think that in order to combat crime effectively, real trust is needed between Member States, and trust requires clear agreements about the rights of suspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, as the Commissioner has already stated, many rights are already regulated by the ECHR, but they are conceived as principles of justice and have to be fleshed out in the different Member States. The Commission proposal is much more specific. In addition, the rights will be more visible and easier to enforce. The fact that the ECHR’s workload will be reduced comes, then, as a welcome fringe benefit. This Commission proposal does, as the Commissioner has already stated, confer additional rights; a suspect is entitled to legal assistance during the entire criminal justice procedure, to an interpreter and to a translator. The authorities are required to inform suspects of their rights. I agree with the broad thrust of the Commission proposal, but it is evident that this is a first step and that additional framework decisions will be needed, for example on the admissibility of evidence, bail and on methods of investigation. I hope that the Commissioner will hurry things along in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has specified that a number of things in the Commission proposal must be formulated more precisely. Accordingly, it is stipulated that no one should be without a lawyer for longer than 24 hours, that no hearing should take place if a suspect has not received any legal assistance and that there is an independent body where clients can take their complaints about their lawyers. For the rest, it is important that not only governments, but also the lawyers and organisations involved, should be asked to assess compliance and for their assessments to be subsequently published, because only transparency will truly promote trust.</p>
<p class="contents">One last word about recital 8, because I know that that is a crucial paragraph to many Members. There appear to be a few Member States that are keen to retain the option of not applying these fundamental rights of suspects to citizens suspected of committing serious and complex forms of crime, in particular terrorism. This is an area of concern to me, in any case as a member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. As rapporteur, I should like to see a compromise being struck, but I personally take the view that Member States will be far less inclined to extradite people to other Member States if they fear that the minimum rights, the minimum standards, are not being respected. I should like to add that it is also a matter of principle that minimum standards apply to everyone by definition. When Mr Mollar, a leading Christian Democrat, was rapporteur on this subject, he never, under any circumstances, put the case for exceptions being made to the minimum standards. What is at issue at present is whether the report should be adopted at all if this exception is not broad enough. I hope that we will as yet meet halfway during tomorrow’s vote, because I am convinced that citizens’ rights deserve the support of this entire House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the Commissioner stated a moment ago, with this proposal, the Commission intends to eliminate any potential discrepancies between procedural safeguards that apply to suspects in Member States. There is no doubt that this proposal has many benefits, some of which I would like to outline briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Buitenweg, the rapporteur, has already mentioned, there is no denying that this framework decision, thanks to the codification of minimum standards, can, and indeed will, make a useful contribution to the level of judicial protection within the European Union. Secondly, there is no denying that this framework decision can have a positive bearing on the mutual trust in each other’s criminal justice systems, something that is all the more important in the light of the enlarged European Union. Finally, the framework decision is less far-reaching, and therefore more realistic, than the Green Paper, and it is a good thing that the framework decision does, for once, give expression to the protective function of criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also question marks, though, around subsidiarity, about which there is indeed doubt. The EU Treaty contains no explicit legal base for criminal court procedures, although it does provide one for the harmonisation of criminal law itself. Moreover, this proposal contains basic standards that are already enshrined in the ECHR.</p>
<p class="contents">From this angle, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is positive, but not naïve –hence both positive and critical – about this proposal. We have to say that this proposal, despite its obvious benefits, will lead to much additional bureaucracy. According to calculations done in my own country, the Netherlands, the Commission proposal will cost at least some EUR 40 million per annum to cover the cost of translation, the storage of visual material and the assessment of the new system. The Commission has voted to add many extra aspects, and so, for my small country, and also for other Member States, that amount will increase still further. Even so, I would say on behalf of my group that the benefits outweigh the extra costs, because suspects have to be protected effectively wherever they are. The Commission has made it very clear, though, that this far-reaching proposal should not affect national legislation of the different Member States that is designed to combat terrorism. That is why we could not accept Mrs Buitenweg’s amendment to delete this. She subsequently tabled a compromise, a first compromise, under Amendment 4: ‘Provided that they do not alter the essential substance of the provisions laid down in this Framework Decision and are in line with the ECHR and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, Member States may adapt those provisions...’. Even so, various Member States, including Spain, France, Great Britain, will get into difficulty with their current systems to combat terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am finishing off with the sound compromise I struck with the rapporteur under Amendment 51, in which reference is made to the rights of the ECHR, and I am happy with that. I would urge everyone here in this House to support that amendment, rather than Amendment 4, for the sake of wide support for the report, because I am not only considering the need for the report to be widely supported, but also the Socialists, the Socialist Governments in Spain and in Great Britain. Do not get your own Member States into trouble. If Amendment 51 survives the vote and Amendment 4 does not, then the majority in the PPE-DE Group will be supporting the Buitenweg report. If not, then we believe, unfortunately, that this report is being used to jeopardise the national fight against terrorism at the moment, in which case we will have to refrain from approving the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should, in fact, have undertaken a minimal harmonisation of procedural rights as a parallel move accompanying the creation of the European arrest warrant.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting this report, we are affirming that the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice entails not only the adoption of measures to combat crime but also the establishment of rights. In spite of a significant convergence of procedures in Europe, differences still persist. It is therefore imperative to establish common rules which guarantee the assistance of a lawyer and the right to interpretation services as well as protection, particularly of the most vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">The main key to the establishment of a genuine European area of security and justice lies in the protection and promotion of the fundamental rights of European citizens. We are demonstrating our will to uphold this political vision of an area of freedom, security and justice by strengthening the Commission’s proposal, which establishes these minimal guarantees of individual rights in criminal proceedings. We also want to guarantee the right to the assistance of a lawyer within 24 hours and full briefing of suspects, who should be informed of the charges against them and of the rights available to them in a notification written in a language they understand. Lastly, we must certify the competence of the interpretation services, which is why we are proposing their enrolment in a national register of interpreters.</p>
<p class="contents">While special attention must be devoted to terrorist crimes – barbaric crimes – the war on terrorism nevertheless remains inextricably linked to the protection of fundamental rights in our democracies. Although it may be necessary to create special provisions for suspects in connection with investigations into terrorist acts, the rights of each individual must still be respected. The establishment of a genuine European area of justice is a priority. Improved judicial cooperation and mutual recognition depend on the harmonisation of rights and procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ALDE Group welcomes Mrs Buitenweg’s report on the proposal for a Council framework decision on criminal judicial cooperation. Procedural safeguards are an indispensable supplement in an area where cooperation between Member States’ judicial and law enforcement agencies is ever closer.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that while the mutual recognition of decisions necessitates trust between Member States, it is equally important that suspects affected enjoy equivalent rights. I must admit that as a new Member of this Parliament it was quite frightening to hear that in the European Union this was not the case in the past. But it is now satisfactorily regulated that suspects have the same rights throughout Europe; so I am very happy that this framework decision is now on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALDE Group had certain ideas in relation to this proposal. First of all we proposed establishing a register of specialised qualified interpreters and an interpretation hotline. We wanted to guarantee the rights of disabled people and psychological assistance. We wanted the Letter of Rights to be made accessible to the disabled, the inclusion of victims’ rights and the setting-up of an independent body of experienced, independent and properly remunerated lawyers. We are very happy that the rapporteur has taken most of these ideas on board.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very good outcome and that is why we support the rapporteur’s original line. We aim to give equal rights to suspects regardless of the type of suspicion they are under. We aim for equal protection and for harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am very satisfied that the majority of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs supported our amendments, which were aimed at giving equal rights to the disabled and clarified the obligations as regards lawyers and interpreters.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Buitenweg, the ALDE Group will support you and your report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They inevitably face numerous problems and cannot but come up against many obstacles: the legal system is different from what it is at home. Those, moreover, who find themselves accused while not speaking the language of the country in question are quite simply lost. I myself had a particularly vivid experience of this sort of thing a number of years ago; it was in Genoa at the time of the major demonstrations against the G8 Summit. Countless young people were first beaten up by the police in an unbelievably brutal fashion, only to end up shortly afterwards in Italian prisons, helpless and – in some cases – deprived of their rights for days on end. The right to a fair trial, enshrined in Article 6 of the ECHR, turned out in this instance to lack any cutting edge. Action on this by the EU is overdue. What happened then must not happen again anywhere. The obligation to extradite contained in the European arrest warrant must, once and for all, be balanced by clearly defined rights for the accused; in the EU, common minimum standards for rights in criminal proceedings must be laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">I, too, join in thanking the rapporteur and can state on behalf of our Group that we back her report, which contains numerous important amendments that are vitally significant to securing the rights of the accused. It goes without saying that people charged with criminal offences must be informed of their rights in a language with which they are familiar; it is equally self-evident that this must be done in writing. The right to legal representation must be guaranteed, as must the right to make use of the services of an interpreter. The report’s demands for the mandatory translation of all documents and for the accused’s partner to be informed as a matter of course are equally significant. I hope that a majority in this House will endorse the report tomorrow.</p>

However, only the naive would fail to recognise it as part of a jigsaw for an integrated European criminal justice system, leading ultimately to the subservience of our national systems, not least in the vital area of how we should be free to tackle terrorism. As the Committee on Legal Affairs has commented, the proposal should be considered as a point of departure rather than of arrival.</p>
<p class="contents">If the concern is to guarantee minimum human rights, then the apparatus already exists under the European Convention on Human Rights at its Court in this city. It is clear, however, that the EU's ambition is to garner that role to itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say, as a British citizen and, indeed, as a lawyer, that the savage experience of several British citizens abroad buttresses my view that we have little to gain but much to lose from extensive criminal justice integration. The scandalous treatment of Dinesh Sakaria in Sweden, the spectacle made of the British plane-spotters in Greece, and the appalling conviction of Kevin Sweeney in the Netherlands convinces UK citizens that they are best served by maintaining the procedures and bulwarks of their common-law-based system rather than ever being tempted to trade it in for the flawed continental model.</p>
<p class="contents">If these things can happen – and they have happened – with these countries supposedly adhering to the European Convention on Human Rights, then moving the coordination from the Council of Europe to the European Commission will contribute nothing to the effective guarantee of individual rights in real terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not question that. I am sure that we all believe in justice: justice for suspected criminals and justice for the people we represent; and human rights for suspected criminals but also human rights for all our constituents. However, we must not be naive: these proposals and the way in which they are being promoted by some in this House give all suspected criminals the same procedural safeguards. But a terrorist is not the same, for instance, as a burglar, and must be handled differently.</p>
<p class="contents">We are experiencing an international crisis and we can allow nothing to undermine our fight against terrorism and those that perpetrate it.

<p class="contents">This proposal does little to help us in our work or indeed to help those innocent people, especially at a time when our efforts should be directed primarily to helping the law enforcement agencies of our various countries, rather than tying their hands behind their backs.

They are in fact based on a fundamental principle concerning the procedural safeguards that are to be harmonised and offered to all those charged in criminal proceedings throughout the European Union: if criminal proceedings are organised at a European scale, then citizens’ rights should also be guaranteed at that level. It is an important principle because it increases mutual trust among the various legal systems, without which there can be no cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Frattini has pointed out, they are minimum but absolutely essential procedural rights: the presence of a legal advisor at all stages of the proceedings, translation of all documents, assistance from an interpreter, and so forth. If these rights were not guaranteed, we would run the risk of seeing unfair or arbitrary trials.</p>
<p class="contents">Then comes the rub: the issue of exceptions, or the possibility – called for by some of my fellow Members – for the Member States not to apply these guarantees to particularly serious forms of crime such as terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group rejects such a solution. The compromise reached in Amendment 4 to recital 8 recognises it, that is, the need for a legal and ethical threshold that the Member States must never cross, not even to combat terrorism: it is a question of human rights, the International Convention on Human Rights and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore consider the argument put forward by a fellow Member regarding the high costs that this reform would generate to be rather ignoble. It is a concern too far, in part because it is very difficult to put a financial value on protecting human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to do more in the fight against terrorism, but without suppressing the rights of those under investigation and those who have been charged. We cannot accept a two-track system as unfortunately prevails in the United States with, for instance, the Guantánamo affair and the changes to the US judicial system, because Europe’s legal culture and the memory of all that Cesare Beccaria represented for that legal culture mean that one cannot, I believe, announce the end of <span class="italic">habeas corpus</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, terrorism is above all a patent violation of human rights; it would therefore be a paradox for us to want to combat it ourselves by violating the civil rights of those charged or under investigation in such proceedings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself have followed the cases both of a British citizen in Sweden and of a Swedish citizen in Greece, both of whose right to have the proceedings interpreted in their own languages was not complied with. In the case of the Swede, Calle Jonsson, his family was forced to sell their house and borrow EUR 50 000 in order to meet the costs of interpretation. That is obviously not in any way acceptable. At the same time, there is the whole of the great European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. There is detailed case law from the Court in Strasbourg. The dimension that we in the European Parliament and the European Union need to bring to the matter is that concerned with observing the resultant rules – an area to which this Parliament, the Commission and the Council can contribute. When I listened earlier to Luxembourg’s representative, I was very concerned, as I think it important that the Council’s representative should, in all situations, speak up for full human rights and the right to a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the rapporteur has done a really excellent job. A lot remains to be done when it comes to access to defence lawyers, legal translation and minimum standards generally, as well as to the protection of suspects in trials.</p>
<p class="contents">No one should be in any doubt that not all suspects go on to be convicted. The court proceedings should separate the innocent from the guilty, which means ensuring that there is adequate support in that connection. Today’s debate and the decisions we shall take in Parliament will not be enough. Instead, further measures will be required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was – and still is – the view taken by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. As the rapporteur, right up to the vote in the relevant committee, persisted in maintaining the view that the framework decision – in contrast to what the Council proposed – should also apply to persons charged with terrorist offences, my group voted against the report in committee. Mrs Buitenweg has worked very hard over the past weeks to put together a compromise proposal capable of being endorsed by all the groups. I am very glad that she did so and wish to thank her for her efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking as I do on its behalf, I can say that the PPE-DE Group will support Mrs Buitenweg’s report, subject to the condition that the plenary votes to reject the former amendment to recital 8 and instead votes by a majority to endorse the new proposal from the Group of the Greens. What this means is that the provisions proposed will not tend to hamper those special measures included in national legislation, and currently in force, in order to combat certain serious and complex forms of crime, terrorism in particular. To this is added the requirement that the measures to which I refer must be in line with the European Convention on Human Rights and with the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell the Members of the Socialist Group that it follows that these boundaries are not being transgressed, and that the compromise proposal does all that they have required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is absolutely indispensable that we go still further today and ensure that the extradition system applies, without loss of respect for individual rights, to all suspects, including those suspected of crimes relating to terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we need a corrective mechanism for any cases where a national judicial system does not meet the minimum standards. This type of measure would serve to give more substance to the right to a fair trial, a principle enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. As was said a short time ago, such a mechanism would be an essential and long-overdue complement to the European arrest warrant.</p>
