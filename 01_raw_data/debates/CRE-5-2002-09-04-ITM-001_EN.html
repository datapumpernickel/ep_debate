The debate occurs at a time when growing international attention is being paid to Iraq, and the situation is one about which practically all the media are speculating on a daily basis, this morning too, as we have no doubt all seen.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to emphasise that the EU and the countries of Europe do not have any quarrel with the Iraqi people. Historically, Iraq has contributed to the region in many ways, and the Iraqi refugees who at present live in Europe mostly make positive contributions to the countries in which they live.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1990, the Iraqi regime chose, however, to invade the small defenceless neighbouring country of Kuwait. A broad coalition of countries from all around the world stood shoulder to shoulder in repelling this aggression.</p>
<p class="contents">After the international community, headed by the United States, had liberated Kuwait, Iraq agreed to a ceasefire involving a list of conditions aimed at ending the war over Kuwait. Iraq agreed, among other things, to give up all its weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles. As soon as the UN is able to confirm that Iraq has complied with its obligations to destroy existing stocks of weapons of mass destruction and to stop developing new weapons of this kind, it will be possible to lift the sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Iraqi regime has chosen over the last 12 years not to cooperate fully in phasing out the country’s weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1991, the UN Security Council set up its first commission of inquiry, UNSCOM (United Nations Special Commission), which was offered completely unacceptable working conditions by the Iraqi regime, culminating in the regime’s refusal, in 1998, to give UNSCOM further access to Iraqi territory. Through Resolution 1284 of December 1999, the Security Council set up a new supervisory committee, UNMOVIC (United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Committee) to replace UNSCOM. UNMOVIC too, however, was refused permission by the Iraqi authorities to enter Iraq under conditions that would enable it to carry out its tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has made a sustained effort to convince the Iraqi regime to allow the weapons inspectors to fulfil their task so that Iraq is able to comply with the ceasefire conditions laid down more than ten years ago. So far, these efforts have been fruitless. Iraq continues to make new demands and to lay down further conditions and it still refuses to give the weapons inspectors free and unconditional access.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic and social situation in Iraq has become worse and worse since the Gulf War. Infant mortality in central and southern Iraq is at present twice as high as in the period before the Gulf War. Malnutrition is generally more severe. The school system suffers from a lack of materials, and the infrastructure and water and sewage systems are in urgent need of renovation and development. Iraq has gone from being a relatively wealthy country enjoying economic growth to being a country with a shrinking economy and a humanitarian situation of critical proportions. The suffering particularly affects the weakest groups – women, children and the poor – together with those groups that do not support Saddam Hussein’s regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Very significant humanitarian aid is therefore being provided to Iraq. The EU’s emergency aid programme, ECHO, is the biggest single donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq, but the UN system, the International Red Cross and associated donors are also active in the humanitarian sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">To counteract the consequences of the sanctions for the civilian population, the Oil for Food’ programme has been set up, allowing Iraq to supplement its own production of food and medicine with imports funded from the country’s oil income. The Security Council proposed the ‘Oil for Food’ programme as long ago as 1991 but, because of reluctance and delay on the part of Iraq, the programme was not implemented until December 1996. The UN revised the ‘Oil for Food’ programme by means of Security Council Resolution 1409 of 14 May 2002. Income from the ‘Oil for Food’ programme is to be used for food and for medicine and other health sector resources, as well as for materials and supplies for civilian purposes in Iraq, including equipment for maintaining the oil sector. Under the revised ‘Oil for Food’ programme, most goods can be exported to Iraq without any problem, at the same time as there being tighter controls on goods that may be used for producing weapons, including weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN Security Council is dealing with the international community’s position on the Iraq issue. The UN Secretary-General has been in contact with Iraq’s Foreign Minister on a number of occasions this year in efforts to end the present deadlock. The latest contact took place yesterday. These efforts have not yet produced practical results, however.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s position is clear and was most recently expressed in a declaration by the Presidency<span class="bold"> </span>on behalf of the EU on 20 May 2002, stating that:</p>
<p class="contents">'The European Union welcomes the meetings between the Iraqi foreign minister and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, aimed at finding a diplomatic solution to the question of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, through full implementation of the Security Council Resolutions and compliance by Iraq with its disarmament obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union reaffirms its attachment to the unconditional observance of the United Nations Security Council Resolutions. It calls on Iraq to comply with the Resolutions without delay, in particular by agreeing to the return of inspectors to Iraq in accordance with Resolution 1284.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union unreservedly supports all efforts on the part of the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union welcomes the Security Council’s adoption of Resolution 1409 of 14 May 2002 which significantly eases the United Nations sanctions on Iraq. The new ‘Oil for Food’ programme will allow Iraq to import civilian goods more freely, while maintaining strict control on dual use goods. Such control remains necessary owing to the continuing concern of the international community regarding the potential use of these goods in mass-destruction or conventional weapons programmes. The European Union calls upon Iraq to cooperate fully with this new sanctions regime, which should help improve the humanitarian situation and above all benefit the Iraqi people.'</p>
<p class="contents">There has been much speculation in the international press during the summer about a possible and imminent American attack on Iraq. The American President has said that the United States wants to see a change of regime in Iraq. That is something quite specific. The President has also said that it will consult its European allies and partners. That is something we are convinced will happen, if the occasion should arise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="photoframe_blue"><tr><td><img alt="MPphoto" src="/doceo/data/img/photo_generic.gif" align="right" width="50" height="63" /></td></tr></table> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I do not simply want to repeat or parrot what the Minister has just said in his comprehensive speech about what has led up to the present situation. So I will discard some of my remarks that would otherwise have been rather repetitive, which should allow even more honourable Members to take part in this exceptionally important and, I think in terms of procedure, almost unique debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few weeks Iraq has figured more and more prominently, as the Minister just said, on the international agenda. The situation appears to be evolving day by day. What is plain, whatever else may be doubtful, is that the risk of a very grave new crisis is increasing. Many important voices have been raised, not least in Washington, about how to deal with Iraq and with the problems linked to its possession and development of weapons of mass destruction. Positions have been expressed by many key players, including European governments. I note from this morning's papers what was said only yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background of this tumult of speeches and articles, I would like today simply to concentrate on the things we know with certainty and on which we should all be able to agree.</p>
<p class="contents">First, as pointed out by Baroness Nicholson’s excellent overview of the present situation in Iraq, which we discussed in this Chamber last May – and I agree, incidentally, with everything the Minister said about our concern for the people of Iraq – we can have no doubt about the evil nature of the regime led by Saddam Hussein. That was made manifest in the excellent report that we discussed in May, albeit, I have to say, with slightly fewer people in attendance than is the case this morning. Terrible events have occurred throughout the 23 years of his rule: wars, aggression and brutal internal repression, including the use of chemical weapons against his own people. There is, in his country, a total absence of basic human and civil rights and I have no doubt that the Iraqi people would be better served by new and different leadership. Indeed, I would be surprised if anybody thought that they are best served by this leadership, not just the Iraqi people, but the Middle East region and indeed the whole world. His is not the only regime that the world would be better off without – there are a lot of others as well – but it is certainly as high on the list as any.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, following the departure of UN inspectors in 1998, a UN Security Council Resolution, No 1284, which the minister referred to, was adopted in December 1999, establishing a new arms inspection entity, UNMOVIC, and setting out what Iraq has to do to have UN sanctions lifted. Notably, it had to cooperate with the inspectors 'in all respects'. This means that Iraq should give full unrestricted access to UNMOVIC inspectors to any site, area, equipment and installation at any moment without any conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet Iraq never complied with this Security Council Resolution – just as it failed to cooperate with the UN throughout the 1990s – there were nine Security Council Resolutions – either refusing entry to UN inspectors, or imposing unacceptable conditions on their operations. This House has always been absolutely clear about the importance of the UN in securing better global governance of our troubled planet and I do not think that you can exempt Iraq from those considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the UNSCOM report of January 1999, there are legitimate suspicions that the Iraqi regime is developing weapons of mass destruction. It is not the Commissioner for External Relations who is saying this, UNSCOM is saying it. At this point in time, no clear evidence has emerged, although it should be noted that the Iraqi Government has not facilitated the task of the UNSCOM inspectors to gather evidence about this. Whenever I think about this issue, one question crops up again and again. If the Iraqi regime has nothing to hide, why do they bar access to the UN-mandated inspectors? It is not an unreasonable question to ask.</p>
<p class="contents">I think two conclusions stand out clearly, from whatever point people come to this argument and this debate, which is going to cause a great deal of passionate discussion in the next few weeks and months.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we must continue to press for full Iraqi compliance with the UN resolutions. Is there anybody in Parliament who disagrees with that? Good!</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have a consensus. The situation may not quite exist in other countries yet, but at least we can begin in this Parliament with a consensus on that point. The EU Presidency declaration of 20 May reaffirms European Union support for United Nations Security Resolution No 1284 and unhindered access for UNMOVIC inspectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we must recognise that efforts to force Iraqi compliance are more likely to succeed if they are backed by a coalition of concerned parties as broad and effective as that which was put together with great diplomatic finesse in 1991 and which helped to secure the expulsion of Iraqi armed forces from Kuwait after the unprovoked invasion of that country. We should also be looking for as broad an international coalition to secure UN compliance as possible. Again, that seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable proposition.</p>
<p class="contents">We must all respect the authority of the United Nations and of international law. The Security Council has charted the way forward in dealing with this intensely difficult problem and every nation should act within the framework of the decisions and resolutions issued by the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the plight of Iraq’s population – and this was a subject that we certainly discussed at some length on the basis of the honourable Member's report back in May – has highlighted the difficulty of dealing with a regime which is as ruthless as it is reckless. Since the Gulf War in 1991 the EC has been the major donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq. We have contributed over EUR 270 million. Over the last three years we have provided assistance of some EUR 10 million annually. In 2002 we shall provide around EUR 13 million. Yet the impact of our help is reduced by the limitations placed upon it by Saddam Hussein’s regime.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we strongly welcomed UNSC Resolution No 1409, to which the Minister referred last May and which introduced so-called 'smart sanctions' intended to limit Saddam Hussein’s ability to develop weapons of mass destruction while also limiting his ability to inflict hardship on his own population.</p>
<p class="contents">Meeting at Elsinore last weekend, Europe’s Foreign Ministers called for full implementation of the UN resolutions and a resumption of inspections without excuses, without prevarication, without 'ifs' or 'buts'. That is obviously the best way to proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a couple of personal remarks. I hope that, as the debate on how to achieve these shared objectives continues in the coming weeks, it will shed light as well as generate heat. We need to consider how we can best limit the production and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to look at how we can continue successfully the international campaign against terrorism on as broad a front as possible. We have to promote the end of violence in the Middle East, the restoration of a peace process and the establishment of a Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel. That is what Foreign Minister Møller in the office of presidency is trying to do this week in the Middle East, taking to the region a roadmap which suggests extremely convincingly what Europe thinks is the way to get back to peace talks and to get away from violence.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to prevent a gulf opening up between the democracies of Europe and North America and the Islamic World. We have – and this may not be popular everywhere these remarks are heard – to encourage the development of participative democracy, civil society and the rule of law in all countries, including those which comprise the Arab World. We have to think constructively about what can and should justify intervention by the international community in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. We have to think equally constructively about whether the global rule book that has by and large governed our affairs for the last 50 years is still valid or whether it requires some changes, how it can be reinforced and strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that on all these issues, which are going to shape the sort of world we live in for the next decades, Europe’s voice should be heard.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to offer one last thought: it is perhaps ironic that the debate on these far-reaching issues at the beginning of a new century is triggered by the question of how we should deal with a dictator whose rule exemplifies much of what was worst in the last century. I just wish I were as certain about some of the answers to these questions as are many of those whose voices are currently raised so loud.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, the reason for this debate here and the debate in the international community is Saddam Hussein's dictatorial and criminal regime. The focus of evil is in Iraq, not in the United States. As both the President-in-Office and the Commissioner have already pointed out, Saddam Hussein already has a history of using weapons of mass destruction against his own people and against Iraq's neighbours. He invaded Kuwait. If he is still stockpiling and producing weapons of mass destruction, that is a threat both to the Middle East and to the international community as a whole. Anyone who wants to prevent a war must prevent Saddam Hussein from being able to use biological, chemical or nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">The way Saddam Hussein is flouting international law is quite unacceptable. He is obliged to permit unconditional and unfettered checks by UN arms inspectors in Iraq. That is what we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats are calling for. Saddam Hussein must comply with the demands of the United Nations. That is why we must maintain pressure on this Iraqi dictator. If we in Europe are not united, he will exploit that. That is why it is unacceptable – and I am saying that very calmly – for the Federal Chancellor of Germany to talk about a German approach to this issue. That will only encourage Saddam Hussein and weaken Europe's unity and solidarity. We in the European Union will only have any influence if we act jointly. There can be only one European approach.</p>
<p class="contents">America's President Bush has promised the allies close consultation. We call on our American friends to share all the information they have with their European allies. The use of force can only be justified if all other means fail. The United Nations should have a monopoly when it comes to making decisions and taking action. Military means should only be used if all other means fail, but even in that case the following questions need to be answered.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question is whether the coalition against terror that President Bush so impressively assembled after the events of 11 September will survive.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is what the plan for the Middle East is after that. I can only emphatically support what Commissioner Patten said when he told us that we need a peace plan between Israel and Palestine, we need a Palestinian state and an Israeli state that can peacefully coexist.</p>
<p class="contents">The third question is what the consequences are. What consequences would military action have for our relations with the Arab and Islamic world, with whom we want to coexist in partnership and – if possible – in friendship? I know just how important an answer to this question is at the moment, because I have just visited Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Qatar.</p>
<p class="contents">These questions need to be answered, and on all of them we need to establish a joint position with the United States. People are also wrestling with these questions in America – it is not as if there is only the position of Vice-President Cheney and the position of the Secretary of Defence, Mr Rumsfeld, there is also the position of the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, the position of the former Secretary of State, James Baker, and that of the former Security Advisor to the President's father, Brent Scowcroft. That is why there is absolutely no reason for anti-Americanism in this debate, because exactly the same debate is going on in America as here in Europe. What is important is for the United States and the European Union ultimately to establish a joint position.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to request and call upon our American friends to resist the temptation of unilateralism and not to act alone. This does not just relate to Iraq, it also relates to how we deal with the International Criminal Court. I also call on all parties, on all the governments of the European Union, not to take unilateral action, but to follow the lead of the European Union as a whole. I also call on our American friends to consistently act in unison with Europe on other issues, such as Kyoto, just as in the present case with Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the impression that our American friends see their relations with Europe more in terms of their bilateral relations with France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and other states, than in terms of seeing the European Union as a single entity. President Bush made an important speech to the Bundestag in Berlin. We can agree with nearly everything he said, but he did not mention the concept of the European Union once in that speech! That demonstrates how important it is to strengthen our dialogue with the US Government.</p>
<p class="contents">I would very much welcome it if in the foreseeable future we could also invite the US President to address this House, because if my memory serves me correctly, the last US President to address the European Parliament was President Reagan in 1986. All these things would help to strengthen our relations with America, with our American partners and friends. We need to step up our dialogue with America. We need to act together to avert the threats posed by Saddam Hussein, and above all we in Europe, the Member States of the European Union, and the European Union itself need to act together and in unison. I say that because if we are not united, Europe cannot hope to have any influence. That is why the top priority is for us to act jointly on the world stage through the European Union.</p>

Mr Haarder, I was going to congratulate you on your application of the Spartan rules of European Parliament terseness as a representative of the Council, but you have taken them to the extreme by omitting to tell us what happened in Elsinore.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, therefore, to ask you what Mr Patten asked the Members of this Parliament: is the Council unanimous? Do you agree with the account of the Elsinore meeting given by the Vice-President of the Commission? These questions are very important for this debate. I say this because we have observed a verbal escalation on the part of the President of the United States over the summer, which, on this highly sensitive subject, comprises obvious risks.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we need to distinguish between two subjects: one is our judgment of Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq. There is no defence for this cruel, tyrannical dictatorship, which does not hesitate to use genocide against its own people, through the suppression of both individuals and groups.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also, however, take account of something else. You mentioned long-term sanctions. These are counterproductive. Similarly, we must take into account that we in Europe have managed to overcome the nationalism that did us so much harm in the past. Here, too, President Mitterrand used to say that nationalism is war. We Europeans have overcome it, but the Arab world is in a different cultural dimension, and nationalist sentiment, pride and confrontation, where necessary, make sense. We must therefore pay close attention to what President Mubarak said, which is that unilateral intervention without the support of the United Nations would certainly have a devastating effect throughout the Middle East. Our progress in resolving the conflict is therefore extremely important and there I believe the Danish Presidency has made an important proposal with regard to the creation of the Palestinian State. It would be useful if the Presidency explained this to us. We must take this into careful consideration if we are to avoid being accused of applying double standards in this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the philosophy of the current American Government, I believe that Bush junior should pay greater attention to what his father did 10 years ago, for one reason: President Bush senior achieved a very broad coalition and acted in accordance with the United Nations mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to talk about the debate underway in the United States, but it is odd, and it has already been said, that here civilians seem for the first time to be launching a military coup against the military forces, since those who have had military responsibilities, including in this field, are the most cautious when it comes to dealing with this issue. Let us hope that all this remains a purely verbal escalation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to our relations with the United States, I think it would be useful for President Bush to come here, but we must also talk to the US Congress. About this, about the International Criminal Court and compliance with the application of WTO Panel decisions and resolutions on such important subjects as the Foreign Sales Act. Although these are not the subjects of today’s debate, it is important for us to talk to the US Congress, as our interlocutor.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Iraq – and I am anxious to hear your explanations – my group endorse the position voted by Parliament on 16 May 2002, four days before the Council adopted it. We think that peace and stability in the region, in a region as fraught as the Middle East, can only be ensured within the framework of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope your explanation on the position reached at Elsinore will be along these lines. We think it is very important to maintain humanitarian aid and we hope that the United Nations, under the leadership of Kofi Annan, will be able to make Iraq comply with its international agreements and allow inspectors back into the country. We believe this is the best way forward.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein poses a real threat. He has used weapons of mass destruction in the past to oppress his own people and in seeking to draw Israel into a wider Middle East war. The international community has a responsibility to stop Iraq developing weapons of mass destruction. Yet the consequences of war are potentially so serious that, for my group, it should be only a last resort.</p>
<p class="contents">Avoiding war does not mean letting Saddam Hussein off the hook. Those who urge America not to launch a pre-emptive strike against Iraq are not appeasers, as Donald Rumsfeld implies when he compares George W. Bush to Winston Churchill. To my mind that comparison is more absurd than Dan Quayle comparing himself to John F. Kennedy. If I may paraphrase Senator Lloyd Benson I would say 'Donald, George W. Bush ain't no Winston Churchill'! The real lesson of history is this: Churchill correctly identified the Nazi threat at an early stage but when he acted it was not unilaterally and pre-emptively. He drew a line in the sand. He acted with moral authority and international backing when that line was crossed. Churchill did not bomb Berlin and try to overthrow the Nazi regime based on his suspicions of Hitler; he acted in concert with his allies when it was clear that he had right on his side. For the ELDR Group the issue today is about getting United Nations weapons inspectors back into Iraq, not about George W. Bush settling an old family score with Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents">The Iraqi Government must comply with UN resolutions and must let weapons inspectors back in unconditionally. Once in, those inspectors must be allowed to go wherever they want, whenever they want. Only if Iraq refuses to readmit inspectors, if it unreasonably obstructs their work or if those inspectors find evidence of Iraq developing weapons of mass destruction would the international community be justified in taking further action. European governments must make clear their support for UN-backed military action in those circumstances. If it comes to war it must be the international community that acts together, not the United States unilaterally. A UN resolution needs to be approved setting a deadline for Iraqi compliance. A broad international coalition must be built and must include Arab countries if we are to convince world opinion that we are not seeking a clash of civilisations. Frankly, as the Commissioner said, our task would be a lot easier if the US showed the same focus on resolving the crisis in the Middle East, as it does on removing Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to think seriously about how to rebuild stability in the region after any strike. The international coalition, including America, must commit resources to nation-building. Unless we rebuild its economy and society and help to develop viable political institutions, an Iraq devastated by war would risk imploding and posing an even greater danger to the stability of the region.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot postpone the debate much longer by claiming that no decisions are imminent. I would say this to the President-in-Office of the Council: Mr Haarder, it is no good saying the European Union's position is clear while referring to a statement of 20 May. The Union's position is as clear as mud. If it were clear, Ambassador Burghardt in Washington would not lament how Member States are jealously guarding their own access to the American Administration rather than acting as a common front.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as at the UN Summit in Johannesburg, the European Union will have influence only if it acts as a United States of Europe. That is your job. Consensus needs to be built about how to tackle the threat, evidence of weapons of mass destruction needs to be published and – most importantly of all – any strike needs to be backed by international law and the moral authority of the international community. The world cannot afford the instability which would come from a unilateral and pre-emptive military adventure in Iraq.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Haarder, I find it rather striking and not just an academic question that just now you only mentioned the war against Kuwait. Why did you not mention that war against Iran, which involved a far greater number of deaths? I think the answer is obvious: the war against Iran was a war which at the time suited the West very well. It was the West that armed Hussein and even paved the way for him to have chemical weapons. The war against Kuwait was fought for this dictator's own reasons. If I say that this is not an academic issue, I say that that because we are seeking difficult answers in a very, very complicated situation. If we want to get to the roots of war and aggression we need to ask ourselves how such situations arise in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another point of view. Hussein is an unsavoury dictator whose military position has now been clearly undermined. There is very little to choose between him and some of our allies in the war on terror. In Iran we have a regime that uses torture and has nuclear arms, and a nuclear arms strategy little different from that of the United States. Quite remarkable! Last week President Bush was virtually paying court to Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the representative of one of the most reactionary regimes on this planet. Surely it weakens the credibility of our human rights policy and of our security policy if such people are our allies?</p>
<p class="contents">I anticipate that my group will conclude that anyone who really wants to guarantee democracy, human rights and security cannot call for a war to secure them, and can certainly not indulge in hypocritical power politics that demonstrate the absurdity of our stated objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the key issue for my group. We are unreservedly against this war, come what may. However, I welcome the fact that – whatever the underlying motives may be – there has been very wide-ranging criticism indeed in this House of these preparations for war. That is far more important.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the most recent Council of Foreign Ministers, I would like to say that I have come to respect you very much here in this Parliament, but what I have heard from you today demonstrates to me that you are totally trapped in your current position. That is unsatisfactory as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a common European policy in this area would be valuable in its own right in view of the dangers of the present situation. I agree with Mr Poettering on that – a policy of this kind is urgently needed. But where is it? I believe that we are facing a serious crisis as regards the Common Foreign and Security Policy in what is a vitally important international relations situation. However, this community of interest cannot just be arbitrary. I think that it involves alternatives to the US approach, to a unilateralism that I find ever more threatening, and which I think is in any case counterproductive for the United States. So, as far as I am concerned, putting forward an alternative is anything but anti-American.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe not only that this war should be unreservedly rejected but also that the inhumane and politically counterproductive embargo should be lifted, with the exception of arms exports, so that Iraq's exclusion from democratic development can be lessened. Thirdly, the UN inspectors should go back, but on the basis of the existing mandate. My fourth point is that we need multilateral cooperative relations and not unilateralism. And my fifth point is that we finally need to return to disarmament. You cannot say that you are willing to go to war to force others to disarm and at the same time rearm yourself without expecting weapons of mass destruction to proliferate.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Let there be no misunderstanding, ladies and gentlemen, I am not talking about the position of the British Prime Minister. I am talking about the person who articulates, and can influence, public opinion in Europe. I therefore beg to differ with the cynics who claim that it makes no difference what we say here in the European Parliament, or what the Commission or the Council says, because the Americans will do what they want anyway. Of course, the Americans do as they please, but fortunately for us, the Americans themselves have not yet worked out exactly what that is. There are prominent politicians – and we have heard them all – who very much mind what Europe and the EU think in this respect. The majority of the Americans do not want the United States to go to war on its own. This provides the European Union with a unique opportunity of very much being able to influence the debate in the United States and that in the United Nations. We do, however, need to know what we do not want to happen and what we want to happen as an alternative to preventive attacks, which my group emphatically denounces. I should like to mention a number of key points which the European Union, the Council and the Commission should, in my view, make at all the forums that matter, and I have complete faith in Mr Patten's ability to do a much better job than Mr Blair.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, as everyone has already mentioned, we should bring maximum pressure to bear in order to get weapons inspectors admitted to Iraq, with complete freedom of action to trace and destroy what they find.</p>
<p class="contents">Next are the much-debated smart sanctions. Admittedly, the current system is an improvement on that of a couple of years ago, but even this system of sanctions is still too hard on the population and too soft on the regime. I wish that Europe and the United States were a little more resourceful in coming up with sanctions that hit the regime and spare the population as much as possible. There is a great deal to be done in this area, and Europe should invest some of its resourcefulness in this. If Saddam is to go – and this is what we want; in fact, my group has been insisting on this since the late Eighties when the Americans, the British and French were still supplying him with weapons – this is not only possible by means of intervention from outside, however necessary that may be, but also by providing Iraq with an alternative. This means that we, the European Union, must support the development of a civil society and also the Iraqi opposition, which is currently too dispersed and too divided. If not, there will be chaos and no democratic alternative after the attacks and after Saddam's departure.</p>
<p class="contents">As has, fortunately, been said by various group chairmen, the road to Baghdad does not only go via the United Nations, it also goes via Jerusalem. Without any progress in the relations between Israel and the Palestinians, there is no chance whatsoever of the Arab world supporting whatever action from the European Union. Europe can very much influence the debate on what should happen to remove Saddam if it speaks with one voice and has an alternative to hand. I repeat that preventive attacks are not a normal course of action in foreign policy. What is normal is pressure from the United Nations, sanctions and the provision of an alternative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Personally, I would like to take up two or three points from this morning’s debate and I would like to make a point of my own. Firstly, I will make my point: common foreign and security policy does not exist at European Union level and, for the moment, we have little or no influence. For the time being, only the governments of the European Union are in a position to intervene in order to try to make the United States see sense. I notice, however, and I am not alone, that there is currently no unanimity. I note in particular that the United Kingdom is systematically aligning itself with the United States, which consequently considerably undermines any initiatives we might be called upon to take.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I will take up the points from this morning. I would first like to mention what Commissioner Patten said, which is that if we wish to avoid potential disaster, it is absolutely crucial to promote a very broad alliance so that action by the United States could only be taken within the framework of the decisions of the United Nations and the Security Council. Secondly, it is vital to try to acknowledge and take account of the position of Arab countries. The United States does not know a great deal about Muslim countries and Muslim reactions, and our fellow Member Mr Barón Crespo reminded us, just a moment ago, of what Mr Mubarak said. There is no doubt that unilateral action determined by the United States, outside the framework of the decisions of the United Nations Security Council, with complete disregard for the domestic situation of Arab countries, would lead to disaster. President Mubarak said himself, and I believe he is right, that in this situation, no Arab state leaders would be able to contain the outburst of feeling in their own countries. It is obvious that we in Europe are directly affected by what could happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add another point: if you still doubt the will of the United States to take action, just watch CNN and you will be transfixed, because the people of the United States are being systematically conditioned everyday. I believe that the decision to take action has been made. It is therefore high time the governments of the European Union did something to make the United States see sense, otherwise we will face unimaginable and potentially tragic consequences.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Belder (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I welcome this timely debate on Iraq, because the potential threat that is emanating from the current regime in Mesopotamia causes me great concern. This threat is the culmination of two worrying trends. First of all, Iraq has been boycotting the UN's inspection of its military materiel for nearly four years. This particularly applies to banned weapons of mass destruction. Secondly, President Saddam Hussein's regime is strongly suspected of maintaining close links with Islamic terrorist groups. This suspicion dates back to the 1993 bomb attack on the World Trade Centre in New York. Since 11 September of last year, this suspicion has, politically speaking, become more topical than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current confusion about the West's attitude towards Iraq, I should like to ask the Council a few questions and make some suggestions at the same time. Why does the EU, with or without the US, not prescribe a clear deadline within which Baghdad must allow the actual and unconditional resumption of the UN weapons inspections? I would, however, add that desired inspections of this kind will not rule out the danger of biological weapons arsenals. After all, Saddam Hussein is a completely heartless man, and weapons that are easy to conceal are right up his street.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, why does the EU not visibly step up the political pressure on Saddam by entering into talks with the Iraqi opposition? In the final analysis, this is exactly what is being done by the Russian Federation, which is, after all, a country that has so far been on more than just speaking terms with Iraq. In short, I urge Europe to actively look for a political alternative to Saddam's 'republic of terror'.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would ask the Council to launch initiatives for an in-depth summit with the US administration right away. The topic of this meeting should be a joint position on Iraq's persistent, destabilising international role. The launch of a European peace proposal for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is simply incompatible with tolerating a sponsor of Palestinian terror. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a danger against which the United States, under the Bush administration, has decided to take a stand, adopting a position which, although erroneous<span class="bold">,</span> is quite clear, quite cut and dried. If there are alternatives – and we must do everything in our power to ensure that there are – they must be developed vigorously and resolutely. In other words, Europe, the European Union, must be the vehicle, the place, the centre where alternatives to conflict are developed: the alternatives of international law, the alternatives of the UN, the alternatives provided by what is known as multilateralism. These alternatives must be developed with determination and must not be a smokescreen to hide ambiguities or conceal a policy which is directly or indirectly benefiting Saddam Hussein. As the European Union, as the Union which has fought so hard to set up the International Criminal Court and other instruments imposing and promoting the rule of law and democracy, we must, of course, think back to Churchill’s Europe and consider what has been said in this Chamber today, but we must also make every endeavour to prevent Europe regressing to the situation under Chamberlain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that we can well do without leaders such as Saddam Hussein. It is worth remembering, however, who it was who helped promote him to high office. It was the same country which now wants to take the lead in bringing him down, namely the United States. Yesterday’s friends are tomorrow’s enemies. How long is this to continue? In the fight against terrorism, we have now become friends with the mullahs of Iran who still to this very day permit the stoning of women. We are friends with the House of Saud, where democracy is a completely unknown concept. These are today’s friends. Are they also tomorrow’s enemies, however?</p>
<p class="contents">What would be the consequences of a possible attack on Iraq? I know that the American Congress has discussed this in detail, but where is the discussion in Parliament not only of our views and opinions concerning the United States and Saddam Hussein but also of the consequences for the whole region of a possible attack upon Iraq? It is already a very unstable area we are talking about. I think the European Parliament should be involved in getting such an inquiry under way.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I should like to ask whether there is agreement in the Council on the policy in relation to Iraq. I should like to know, for example, whether the Danish Presidency is sticking to its own traditional policy, to the effect that we do not say anything until we are asked, irrespective of the fact that the Danish Defence Minister is of the view that we should ideally attack Iraq right now. Is the Danish Presidency in favour of a common policy on this issue? Is there agreement about the policy, and does this include demands for a UN mandate and for clear evidence of Saddam Hussein’s possible involvement in the attack on the World Trade Centre or collaboration with al-Qa’ida? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has come at an opportune time. To a large extent the problem we face in Iraq is the unfinished business of the Gulf War. We have to recognise that before we begin.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Watson referred to the previous President Bush and the fact that to some extent the most recent President Bush maybe hopes to resolve some of his father's failures.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is, and we have got to face it, Saddam Hussein has effectively made fools out of the international community ever since that time. Time and time again he has led them forward by the nose and time and time again they have allowed him to get away with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, the United Nations has done sterling work but with no success for weapons inspection to date. I welcome Mr Blair's statement this morning, whatever it means. No doubt he will not be able to tell us everything but perhaps he could throw some light on the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed to protect the free world. Yes, Saddam Hussein has ruled Iraq with an iron fist, he is an evil dictator. We must ensure that Iraq is approached in a multilateral way. There must be no unilateral approach. I believe there must be a wide-ranging international coalition supported by the United Nations resolution. This is not a resolution for doing nothing, as many Americans would say, but assures widespread support for that action and much of it has been outlined here this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">We must engage Congress as Mr Barón Crespo said, but I have to tell this House in my experience Congress is thinking of the November 5 elections and is not all that much engaged or wanting to engage in discussions with the European Parliament.

Saddam Hussein's regime, which we all regard as dictatorial, is being denounced by the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Party of European Socialists alike. For the past 23 years, he has systematically killed his own people and the leaders of his Stalinist regime. Moreover, we denounce the US's unilateral action as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we have noticed that Europe is still not speaking with one voice to a sufficient degree. We would, in fact, urge the Council to take an active part in this debate in the United States now, because it is clear that there are different currents in the US. What we could do with right now is a display of commitment to the United States that is not anti-America but pro-America by taking part in that debate now. But that requires that we speak with one voice and take a clear stand. I would like to say to the Security Council that this is not, therefore, a licence to launch into unilateral action. We need the UN Security Council if we want to exert pressure on Iraq to reinstate the weapons inspections. This also means that if we ultimately want to act and threaten with violence, we must have proof. This proof must be clear and public. This also means that we must at the same time be prepared to act smartly. Mr Lagendijk of the Group of the Greens used the term 'smart sanctions' which are, of course, a reality. By using them, we can hit Iraq and its leadership harder and help the population at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">What Commissioner Patten said here this morning is crucial. It could be very detrimental if we unilaterally adopted the same stance in the Middle East, but we can also use this stance to enlist support for a new peace initiative along with the US. It is essential that the Council take action in order to decide on the two-state solution. Peace in the Middle East now, by addressing the issue of Palestine and Israel, is the key. There is a real downside, of which President Mubarak has warned us, in fact, namely that we may head in the wrong direction. Europe is playing a pivotal role. Instead of neglecting this role, we must take action now. I would ask for your support in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was striking how unanimous our group was, and Mr Hans-Gert Poettering's outline fits in perfectly with this debate. I should like to underline three points.</p>
<p class="contents">We have established that Saddam Hussein is without a doubt one of the most dangerous people of our time, with his chemical and biological weapons, which apparently he is also willing to use. After all, he did exactly that against his own people. We have also established that if an intervention proves necessary – but a number of conditions will need to be met first – this can never be done without UN support. This is truly what our group unanimously believes. Thirdly – and this is an appeal to the Commissioner and the Minister – Europe must speak with one voice and must join forces. If this ever proved necessary, then surely now is the time.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have a few questions that relate to what Mr Van den Berg said a moment ago. It appears that Europe does not have all the information that the Americans have. In my view, if Europe is to receive support and resources, it is extremely important for all this information to be available, particularly also to the political forums and parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is one of concern. In all the comments that we make in this matter, we should also consider the situation of Israel. If we treat the entire Arab World in the same way, this could rebound on Israel in a big way. We must therefore, as a matter of key importance, also get the Arab world behind us in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a strategy must be developed in order to boost support in Europe, for not all citizens, by a long chalk, are convinced of the need for intervention. For this strategy, we need a European plan, and I think that Mr Patten and the Minister will need to play an important role in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At any moment the current low-intensity aerial defence of southern and northern Iraq – which has been carried out at considerable personal risk by pilots from the USA, originally from France, and also from the UK, to whom I pay tribute as they have saved countless lives – may be stepped up to considerably heavier military action, which I believe will have support from a wide number of countries which are at present silent about their opinions. The EU voice must be heard. We must no longer stand on the sidelines, wringing our hands and repeating like a hopeless prayer 'Iraq must comply with UN conventions and the weapons inspectors must go in' because this leopard will not change his spots.</p>
<p class="contents">We have ample evidence of the use of weapons of mass destruction. I have first-hand personal evidence of the use of such weapons: chemical warfare against the southern Iraqi people in the late 1990s. I have talked to the victims who stumbled choking from clouds of yellow smoke that must have been mustard gas. We have evidence first hand of the destruction of the environment, the water, the degradation of life in the marshes of the deep south, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk in Johannesburg about the need to bring water to millions more people, yet we have allowed Saddam Hussein to take away the water from over half a million Iraqi people. We have stood silent. We have first-hand evidence of that. We have been overflying the south since 1994.</p>
<p class="contents">On human rights and genocide: as Max van der Stoel said when he was human rights reporter on Iraq for the United Nations: 'Genocide has been carried out against the Marsh Arabs and the Iraqi people'. We have evidence of that; I personally have had evidence at first hand.</p>
<p class="contents">On weapons of mass destruction: surely our quarrel is not precisely about having weapons of mass destruction – quite a number of countries sadly have such weapons – it is what you do with them that counts. We have the continuing threats of Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait and Iran. I have seen the mined borders and the tanks just over the borders from Iran. We have that evidence available.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do? We can set up the Office of Inquiry for Human Rights Violations that was recommended in our report, which the Commissioner so kindly referred to just now. We had a full house – an 85% majority for the vote on that report. I call upon the Commissioner and the Council of Ministers to set up that office today.</p>

In the first instance we need to engage with the United States at every level. We need to engage with the Americans on a country-to-country, a union-to-union, a party-to-party, a committee-to-committee basis, at whatever level we can, not only in relation to Iraq, but in relation to the extremely dangerous unilateralist philosophy they are currently developing in regard to so many areas of world concern.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not ignore the fact that the current attempt to undermine the International Criminal Court has implications far wider than simply excluding American forces engaged in international conflicts. It is a direct challenge to the European Union and is part of the attempt by the United States to establish superiority in every region throughout the world. The only response that the European Union and its Member States can make to this and to the current attempts by the United States to generate a war psychology in relation to Iraq is to stand together. I know it is difficult and there are differences between the Member States on this, but there is a much wider concern for the future which has to be borne in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">I was quite impressed by the Commissioner's speech in which he identified the need for reform of our international law in relation to how, when and who should intervene in other states. It is a matter which is coming to the fore more and more, particularly now that the Cold War is over and the dust is settling. However, as far as our experience with the International Criminal Court is concerned, it is not yet opportune to start dismantling the current protections that exist under the United Nations Charter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What a pity it is that other countries have not joined in enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq over the last ten years, something which has been referred to already. Responsibility has been borne by the United States, by the United Kingdom and in the early days by France.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the sort of allied coming together that we should be seeing. It seems to me that there is too much speculation about the nature of some sort of attack on Iraq while our concern should really be the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime being in possession of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a dereliction of duty by any of our governments if they were aware of a threat to our security and chose to do nothing about it. We must take effective action against Iraq and it is most important that we show allied solidarity. Perceptions are absolutely vital here and it would be fatal if Saddam Hussein misread the intentions of the West, of the European Union and of other allies and if he thought that he was able to create divisions among those allies. We must send a very strong signal to Saddam Hussein that we stand together on this. This is a signal of solidarity. If there are any differences among allies it is time for those differences to be sorted out behind closed doors and not in public discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to send the right message. We started to misread the intentions of Saddam Hussein in early 1990. We almost made a mistake then. We regarded him as a rational man, we rather thought that he would not invade Kuwait at that time. In fact he is an irrational leader in control of very dangerous weapons. We must show the solidarity to take the necessary action to remove those weapons from his hands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can we respond to international threats by using international law and the mechanisms it provides? Even if these mechanisms are in need of reform, as Commissioner Patten has said, they still exist and they could be implemented in their present form. We believe that when it comes to dealing with international threats from states like Iraq – and there is no need for me to repeat what kind of threats we could be talking about – the only way to implement international law is through the United Nations. The alternative is to respond to these threats on a unilateral basis, which is the approach currently being adopted by the US. Mr Poettering is quite right in saying that there is an urgent need for this process to be completed, because there is also an internal debate, although a consensus is evidently starting to emerge around President Bush.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that needs to be answered next is where Europe stands on this. The answer is that we do not support unilateralism, as we have already heard, as Commissioner Patten asked how we could stabilise the international coalition against terror. We will certainly not stabilise it if the United States undermines it by adopting a unilateral approach. That is where there is a really great danger, because what we are actually fighting – and I would like to remind Mr Van Orden that Mr<span class="bold"> </span>Brie has already referred to this – is the Iraqi Government, which has been so heavily criticised here, yet where did they get the technology that has enabled them to constitute such an enormous threat today? From the United States – in the days when Iraq was still an ally in the battle against Islamic fundamentalism in Iran, which also demonstrates that the governing Baath Party in Iraq is not an Islamic fundamentalist party. We all know that the Muslim Brotherhoods that are persecuted in Iraq have been granted political asylum in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I only wanted to remind you about that to make it clear how complicated and dangerous unilateralism is in practice. That is why, Mr Van Orden, we in Europe are united in saying 'no' to unilateralism and 'yes' to the implementation of international law.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mr Barón Crespo that no one knows better than the armed forces, both here and in the United States, that the use of force to prevent this crisis can never be clean. There is no such thing as a clean war. Despite progress in technology, man does not yet have the means to kill all evil people at the touch of a button, if only because it is impossible to separate the good people from the bad.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, war or the use of armed force may be a lesser evil. In that case, all political and diplomatic avenues must have been thoroughly explored with a view to achieving the political objective otherwise to be pursued through the use of such force. That is why we fully endorse the Union’s current approach which is to maintain pressure on Saddam Hussein to allow weapons inspectors to return to do their work. Secondly, if this decision is taken, it must have a chance of achieving its aim, yet it has been made very clear to us that the objective now is to overturn the regime of Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two questions being raised here. The first concerns the assessment of the threat. Mr Poettering and Mrs Maij-Weggen emphasised that we are eagerly awaiting the details promised by the British Prime Minister, which should arrive in the next few minutes. Commissioner Patten said in his speech that he doubted whether any evidence at all would be available. It is very important that we have this evidence. Secondly, we must have a chance of winning. In Afghanistan, we were sure that the Afghan people themselves were ready to bring down the Taliban regime. Is there any chance, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Iraqi people will help, in the event of military action, to topple the regime? That is a genuine question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Blair made it clear yesterday that he will support the US in a war on Iraq, without waiting until other options have been explored and without seeking a fresh UN Security Council resolution. In a press conference yesterday, he implicitly backed the principle of pre-emptive action on Iraq, saying that the simple restoration of weapons inspectors into Iraq may not be sufficient to avert war.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot enforce international law by breaking international law. A war on Iraq in these circumstances would be immoral, illegal, dangerous and wrong. Much has been said about the importance of the EU having a common front and a common voice and I agree with that. In that case I urge the Commission, the Council and all other EU Heads of State to do all they can to help us restrain their fellow EU Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Saddam Hussein still possesses huge quantities of biological and chemical weapons and three years ago he attempted to buy weapons-grade uranium from Serbia. He has been negotiating with North Korea to acquire ballistic missile technology. Therefore he clearly poses a global threat to oil supplies, and, were he to become a nuclear power, could hold the whole world to ransom.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also be morally consistent. Nobody in this House asked for UN resolutions to attack Milosevic's Serbia, and human rights violations alone were deemed sufficient. Surely Saddam Hussein's violations of the rights of the Kurds whom he has gassed, the Marsh Arabs and the Shias whom he has tortured and killed, and the Israelis, where he has paid the families of suicide bombers to kill innocent victims, are much worse than any of Milosevic's crimes, – not to mention the British and the Americans whom he has sworn revenge against for our participation in the Gulf War.</p>
<p class="contents">I remain sceptical about neighbouring countries' concerns about military intervention, as some fear democracy in Iraq and others giving the Kurds autonomy in the north. I welcome foreign minister de Palacio's support yesterday for the British and American position. I also hope that China and Russia will not veto any requests in the UN Security Council for further resolutions on this matter, should America so request.</p>

It seems to me that in the course of the ten-metre journey from here to where you are sitting now you have been struck dumb. You have not told us what happened in Elsinore, but instead you repeated what the Spanish Presidency achieved in this area in May. I suppose that is better than nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on Commissioner Patten's two questions. I can assure you, Mr Patten, that we are all in favour of observing UN resolutions. However, the United Nations is not an organisation where you can pick and choose – we have to comply with the United Nations Charter and we also have to comply with international law. The United Nations Charter stipulates the cases in which military means are possible and permissible, and the procedure is also laid down. The UN Charter does not make any provision for a pre-emptive war or for a war to remove an undesirable government, and we cannot ignore that. Anyone who wages such a war in spite of this is himself an aggressor and is himself in breach of international law.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question was about the broad coalition. On that point, I can assure you that that should in fact be the European Union's sole objective. But we are not the ones who have split the broad coalition; no, it has been undermined by American unilateralism. My question to you is: how can we re-establish this unity, this broad coalition?</p>

His regime is evil. His deeds are evil. We have seen what he can do to his people, and we fear what he might do to the wider world. He is <span class="italic">totally</span> defying the international community. As Commissioner Patten said, the world would be a much better place without Saddam Hussein and with a different regime in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Achieving this, however, is easier said than done. Furthermore, it is fraught with enormous complications and very, very great risks. Even the Pentagon has reservations about a possible attack. We must, of course, use all diplomatic and political means in order to get Saddam Hussein to comply with UN resolutions and allow the inspectors in and in order to solve this issue. There must of course be evidence, to which we all have access, of the existence of weapons of mass destruction and possible collaboration with al-Qa’ida. The EU must, naturally, stick together and insist that any attack must be subject to a UN Security Council decision.</p>
<p class="contents">What happens, however, if we fail to find a political and diplomatic solution, if Saddam Hussein continues to defy the international community, if we do obtain proof, and if we manage to get a common decision in the Security Council? What discussions have been taking place in the Council? What forward planning has there been? I do not mean military planning. Rather, I am wondering what preparations have been made to support the forces of democracy, the Iraqi opposition and the Kurds in northern Iraq and to look after our relations with the wider world. I am absolutely convinced that these issues were discussed in Elsinore, and I would therefore be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council could say something about them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If they wish to wage war on undemocratic regimes in the Middle East, they must wage war on Saudi Arabia. If they wish to wage war on regimes which do not respect the United Nations’ resolutions, they must wage war on Israel. If they wish to wage war on countries which have acquired weapons of mass destruction, they must wage war on India, Pakistan, China and North Korea, which have – of this we are certain – atomic weapons. If they wish to wage war on countries which serve as a breeding ground for terrorists, they must destroy London and Hamburg. This is the reality of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am obviously being ironic, because the reason for this military action is clearly not Saddam Hussein’s regime, which is an authoritarian regime, of course, but also a secular regime which respects the right of Christians and of women. This military action is about weapons of mass destruction. So far, we have not yet been given any evidence whatsoever that they exist in a country that is dying on its feet, where light bulbs can no longer be found, where there is no lead for schoolchildren’s pencils because these are made of graphite and where even a number of UN observers condemned the role that they were being made to play.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end with an anecdote: three years ago, my brother, a Catholic priest, visited Iraq. Whilst there, he was almost killed by a bomb and, in truth, he does not know if this was an American or British bomb. One might well ask which international law allows Iraq – which, it is true, was defeated and which, as a result of its defeat, agreed to visits by UN inspectors for many years – to be bombed on a daily basis and to continue to suffer from sanctions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is the international community, not the dictator, which will be blamed for the impact of the embargo on Iraq, we must be quite clear about that. I do not feel there is any division here, as has already been said, as regards condemnation of Saddam Hussein and his regime. However, the repeated announcements of unilateral action by the United States – which were not the invention of the international press but have been repeated on several occasions by the President himself – are having two, extremely negative consequences: on the one hand, the interests and fate of the dictator are becoming linked to those of his people once again – you saw, even yesterday, Saddam Hussein’s declarations, 'we will resist, we will win' – and, on the other, there is a build up of opposition to this action.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the European Union must pursue the path of international law, the path of the United Nations, resolutely, and that a much, much clearer link must be established between the readmission of the UNSCOM and the end of the embargo on the Iraqi people, for this will enable us to start to dialogue with the people of Iraq. Otherwise it will be extremely difficult to make any impact on Saddam Hussein. Moreover, the West’s task is hardly to replace Saddam with an <span class="italic">ayatollah</span>, for example. We must introduce democracy into this and other Arab countries, and I believe that, if Europe genuinely believes in this position and is united, then it will be able to make a contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is naïve to believe that we can put the United States under an obligation. The United States does not act in order to achieve world domination. It acts only because we are exposed to the threat of a development worse than war. If Europe cannot decide, the United States will hopefully act alone. It is as if we have forgotten that it was the United States that rescued Europe in the First and Second World Wars and that saved us from Communist takeover. It is naïve to believe that the United States would act without evidence. The United States would not make large sacrifices if there were less risky alternatives. Prime Minister Tony Blair stated clearly yesterday that they had evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is Tony Blair’s and the United Kingdom’s position we should emulate, and I would call upon the Presidency to work towards a situation in which the EU is united in rallying to the cause of combating dictatorship. We should not of course be infringing international law by toppling a vicious dictatorship which is threatening its own people and world security, and the approach based on the UN model has of course been fully tried and tested. The weapons inspectors were turfed out, so what is the point of bringing them back? Saddam Hussein has been given every warning, but he is quite clearly unreceptive to our demands, and we are merely signalling our own weakness. Our duty towards the people of Europe is to stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States in this fight against a dictatorship that is threatening world security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When some Members of this House, Mr Van Orden and Mr Tannock, talk about solidarity, they chiefly mean solidarity with the United States. For me it chiefly means solidarity within Europe. That is why I am concerned that the United Kingdom, but also Spain and Italy, are going down a path that suggests that this solidarity could be undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">What particularly concerns me is the yawning gap between the United States' and Europe's conceptions of international world order. The US seems to be increasingly drawn to a theory that international agreements and organisations have, as it were, a merely substitutional role. For the major powers at least, it seems that national sovereignty and a national view of the world have top priority. I have great difficulty with the US view that they can decide when to support an international organisation, be it 'just' the United Nations or the International Criminal Court, and when they themselves should act and when they can carry out pre-emptive strikes, and whereby they can define the danger and make decisions on deployment without consulting the international authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I also have a big problem with the idea that the President of the United States can read a book over the summer that says that you should not trust the military, because the military will hesitate and always see the risk of failure, and that the sign of a true politician is that he distrusts the military. Given that the same author, Elliot Cohen, believes that we did not drop enough bombs on Yugoslavia, any country that listens to advisers like that really worries me.</p>

What do they want to do with Iraq, what can they do with Iraq? How can we resolve the problem with Iran on the one hand and with the Kurds on the other? We know nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the predominance of powerlessness, which arises from the absolute division and the complete heterogeneity of opinions were expressed here. I also feel that we should reflect on the fact that we are not in the middle of a moral or sentimental debate, but a political debate. A political debate is based on two pillars: force and law, on the understanding that force must be subject to law and that there is a place where law must be exercised, and that is the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed premature, I feel, in view of the discussion which has just taken place, to think the European Union might have a seat at the United Nations, because one wonders what opinion it would express there. That said, there are members of the European Union that have a seat at the United Nations, and the European Union could perhaps reflect on finding a solution to the current debate. Clearly, the United Nations must be involved, clearly, the permanent members of the Security Council which belong to the European Union must adopt a position. Which position must they adopt? Which mandate can be given to them, providing that a mandate is possible in this situation? In any case, what position will the countries of the European Union – those that are also members of the UN Security Council – adopt if the latter is invoked? This is the real question which, at the same time, sets out the limit of this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For my part, I firmly believe that a country must be built on the rule of law, and this applies nationally and internationally. <span class="italic">All </span>countries must comply with international law, including Iraq <span class="italic">and </span>– lest we forget – the US. All countries must comply with this legislation, and they have no right to take liberties that are not provided for in legislation that has been enacted jointly.</p>
<p class="contents">In answer to Commissioner Patten’s question regarding the way forward, I believe the key issue is to bolster our relations with the Arab world and to get it to put pressure on Saddam Hussein. There must be a better alternative to making enemies for ourselves in the Arab world. Naturally we must demand that the weapons inspectors be allowed back unhindered. We want peace in the Middle East. We want a Palestinian State. That goes without saying.</p>
<p class="contents">The sanctions currently in place against Iraq, and which have been in place for 12 years, have brought enormous suffering to the Iraqi people. According to the UN’s own figures, one and a half million people, including 600 000 children, have died as a direct consequence. Moreover, the country has been subject to low intensity bombing for several years. This has <span class="italic">strengthened </span>Saddam Hussein’s brutal dictatorship instead of weakening it.</p>
<p class="contents">A war such as that currently being prepared will, of course, undermine world peace and security. The EU must therefore speak with <span class="italic">one </span>voice, and a strong one at that. It is the prerogative of the <span class="italic">Iraqi </span>people to establish their own democratic regime; this cannot be achieved with bombs. International law and the UN Charter must be respected, and the EU must state unequivocally that the international community has a duty to solve conflicts peacefully. 'Yes' to weapons inspectors, but 'No' to war against Iraq! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, for this to succeed, for example getting inspectors into Iraq, means Saddam Hussein honouring his obligations. That needs to be made crystal clear. We cannot allow him to act as judge and jury here. There needs to be broad agreement that Saddam Hussein must go. But this can only succeed if various viewpoints are taken on board. Unlike Mr Sakellariou, I believe that pre-emptive wars are acceptable. However, they are only acceptable if there is evidence of immediate danger and proof that there is a greater risk than without a pre-emptive war. Such evidence is not forthcoming at present and we can therefore see no justification for war.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor has proper consideration been given to whether starting such a war and terminating Saddam Hussein's regime would not lead to changes in other parts of the Islamic world involving far greater risks than allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power. Destroying the coalition against terror and establishing fundamentalist regimes in the ‘moderate’ Arab countries could have very negative consequences, particularly for us in Europe. This needs to be weighed in the balance if we wish to succeed. For example, we also need to consider what the direct consequences of such a military conflict would be for Iraq's minorities, given what Saddam Hussein has done to the Kurds or other population groups in the south of his country in given situations. This all needs to be taken into account in weighing up the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We Europeans, however, can only drive forward this process of weighing up the situation if we have a common view. That is a prerequisite. Neither Mr Blair's position on one side nor Mr Schröder's position on the other is very helpful in trying to reach such a common stance. I believe that the only way to stop the Americans going ahead unilaterally is by means of such a united approach. There is a debate raging about this even in America itself. If the US is aware that we in Europe are presenting a united front on this issue, it will be possible to get certain points accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 11 September, approaches have been adopted that may be understandable but are nevertheless dangerous. Since the events of 11 September, Article 5 of the NATO Treaty has been discussed but not implemented, because implementing it would have meant that we in Europe were involved in joint strategic planning and decision-making. So we Europeans have to ask ourselves this fundamental question: Can we position ourselves as partners and take part in the decision-making process, or we will just be ordered into action when the decision has been made and a war is imminent? This also has fundamental implications for future transatlantic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament should endeavour to support the Council and the Commission in pursuing this common policy approach, because that is the best way of both getting rid of Saddam Hussein and avoiding a war.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Keyser (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, on the eve of the anniversary of 11 September, Europe must, more than ever, speak with a single voice and defend peace. Europe must firmly tell the world once again that the fight against terrorism, which it supports unreservedly, cannot involve war and that a so-called preventative war against Iraq would, on the contrary, sacrifice a nation, would cause unrest in the Middle East, and would have no guaranteed outcome. Europe is faced with an historic opportunity to speak with a single voice and to distance itself from the policy of the axis of evil that the United States is trying to impose whether we like it or not.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report of 16 May on Iraq, the European Parliament called, in particular, for the UN to play a crucial role in seeking a regional, political and peaceful settlement, and for Europe to adopt a common position on the issue at last. These words have been almost completely disregarded. Once again, Europe is divided on which strategy it should follow. Baghdad is wavering over whether to open its doors to UNMOVIC inspectors and the Iraqi people are continuing to mourn the victims of an inhuman embargo which has failed to destabilise the regime of Saddam Hussein, whilst President Bush is mounting his crusade of good, blatantly breaching international law in doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">What game are we playing? That is why I shall avoid beating around the bush and ask the Commission and the Council the questions that are on everyone’s lips today. What guarantees can Europe offer Iraq that the UNMOVIC inspections will be carried out fairly, that they will have a time limit and that they will ultimately lead to the lifting of economic sanctions? In other words, that these inspections will not, as before the 1998 crisis, be infiltrated by US intelligence officers taking notes on locations to bomb in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what guarantees can Europe give Baghdad that, once it has been proven that its arsenal has been dismantled or it has been verified that there are no weapons of mass destruction, America will not immediately attack, once they can see that the regime is not armed? Although Europe is seeking to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we all know that the United States want the regime overturned. Is this indeed Europe’s mission to seek to overturn regimes? There are certainly other regimes that we would like to see overturned!</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what would Europe’s reaction be if an attack against Iraq were carried out without the backing of the UN? A war against Iraq would not be fair, appropriate, or effective. It would not be fair because, without the green light from the UN, it would be an affront to international law. It would not be clean because, as Mr Morillon has said, there is no such thing as a clean war, not to mention the fact that it would be an experimental war in new weapons, which would harm the Iraqi population. It would not be effective because, in terms of the fight against terrorism, and Afghanistan is proof of this, bombs are of no use. Osama bin Laden is still at large and Saddam Hussein will, in all probability, remain at large.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, when I hear Mr Van Orden speak I am afraid, as I was when I heard Mr Blair speak yesterday, I have just one message, based on the words of the Count of Auteroche at the battle of Fontenoy: if the English wish to support our American friends, they can fire first, but they cannot count on us to support them! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since the end of the Gulf War, our strategy has been one of containment and deterrence.

To win a war against terror across borders, we need to build a consensus across borders.

It is evident that the unstated assumption by the European authorities – with the remarkable exception of the German Republic – is that war is, by now, a certainty. Never mind that there is no scrap of evidence that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction, even nuclear weapons, never mind that Mr Blair has again postponed the publication of his own private dossier on the matter. There is no doubt that, as with Enron's creative accounting, the CIA are working on creative evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Confronted with such an imminent disaster for humankind, the Council and the Commission are taking the wrong – although expected – stand. As the French newspaper <span class="italic">le Figaro</span> puts it, 'confronted with American intransigence Europe excels again in its inclination to compromise'. Compromise in this case is offered by the figleaf of the United Nations, a figleaf that in this specific case covers much more than has been covered by UNSCOM and UNMOVIC. Unfettered, unconditional, intrusive access by United Nations inspectors, let us say Anglo-American inspectors, to every site in Iraq – something which Mr Rumsfeld himself expects to be rejected out of hand by the infamous Baghdad dictator. After that only one alternative: war.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, what we have heard today from Mr Haarder and Commissioner Patten confirms our belief that there is a growing gap between the people of Europe and these governing bodies, a gap which this war will enlarge with deleterious consequences for the future of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The condemnation of the dictator Saddam Hussein appears unanimous. Are we not forgetting, though, that in the eyes of some Muslims and even of huge groups of them, he is considered a hero? This is a major problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, how far does this unanimity extend? Are we convinced that the resumption of weapons inspections will bring any closer the solutions we want? Do we think that these should be unconditional? Do we think we should set an ultimatum? Should this ultimatum be set by the UN? And what conclusions will we draw if nothing, or something, is found?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, all these scenarios should be thought through beforehand. Is the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq a necessary or satisfactory reason to start a war? Or will we then want to enter into negotiations concerning their dismantling? Who will provide proof of the existence of these weapons of mass destruction? Some of our fellow MEPs are already saying that this proof is there because he had them before. On the other hand, a number of weapons are reported to have been destroyed during the second Gulf War. Are people in the EU agreed on the interests that are really at stake in the Middle East, on this region's stability, on the risk that the Gulf States are running? Not that they are models of democracy, but what will happen to them? What happens if a prior solution is not reached for Israel and Palestine? Are we getting any nearer to a solution?</p>
<p class="contents">Is it the EU's intention to avoid a war against Iraq only in the short term? Is the aim to bring down Saddam Hussein? Or would we much rather broker peace in the Middle East, as the Palestinian issue lies at the heart of the problem? Should we not express our aspiration to defend human rights and democracy so that partnerships can be forged in future? In my view, the solution we need is long-term.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to know whether the EU will take an initiative to let the UN play a prominent role in the Middle East once again? Apparently, this question was not even raised in Elsinore. Are the two European countries on the Security Council, namely the United Kingdom and France, on the same wavelength? Probably not, for the signs are there for everyone to see.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a few more questions, but time is running out. However, I should like to finish with one final question. Is it right for Denmark to give itself one month to find a compromise which is also acceptable to the Americans if we establish that the European themselves are still struggling with so many problems? How many subscribe to Mr Schröder's opinion? Not only are we, along with Mr Schröder, saying 'no' to war now; we also want Europe to have the objective of establishing stable and lasting peace in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also want to say that George Orwell would find it difficult to create characters like Rumsfeld, Cheney and Ashcroft.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important to ask ourselves what precisely do we mean by weapons of mass destruction. Are we talking about Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Cambodia, or even Korea, where I served in the American Army? What precisely is our definition, and what are they and where are they?</p>
<p class="contents">A unilateral attack on Iraq would be moral madness. The 22 million Iraqi people have already suffered enormous pain and loss. They are now threatened with a full-scale invasion by a so-called Christian power, resulting in countless dead. It will be seen for what it surely will be: a crusade by the West against Islam. We are told that Israel will use nuclear weapons in certain circumstances. Yet we have no evidence, as has been constantly repeated in this House this morning, that Iraq has weapons of the kind referred to by the hawks in the American Government. US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, is proclaiming that Iraq is giving refuge to al-Qa'ida terrorists. Nobody but a fantasist would suggest such a thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Another bombing of Iraq would be mass murder. The American Government talks about saving civilisation – a 200-year-old civilisation or a 5000-year-old civilisation? One has to really ask the question: who is the American Government really out to save? The American Government could be boosting the armaments or the oil industries at home or it could be geared towards the re-election prospects of President George Bush, à la Margaret Thatcher. We will certainly see a rise in Islamic fundamentalism and individual attacks on Western targets will continue unabated, even on a freelance basis, should this war take place.</p>

Unfortunately, in the same way as the efforts of The Hague were scuppered in 1905 by the First World War, the efforts of the League of Nations were scuppered by the ‘Imperial’ and not the ‘National’; the Imperial Hitler Socialism and, more specifically, its preventative wars, particularly in the Sudeten region. In 1948, we had to start again from scratch. That was the task of the UN founders and of the UN Charter, which now forms the backbone of any international order.</p>
<p class="contents">In our book, war is banned. War is only permitted in specific cases, framed by stringent rules which assume, on the one hand, the support of the Security Council and, on the other hand, the monitoring of military operations by a major multinational State, itself placed under the authority of the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We are brushing all that aside today<span class="bold">. </span>We are completely brushing aside international law. This is an enormous breach of the law. We are now in the middle of a discussion to determine whether we shall condemn a State which is, led by its own President, contravening international law, whereas Europe should quite simply condemn it, not simply out of pity – and I did indeed say pity, speaking as a Christian – for a nation, which has, for ten years, been suffering genuine martyrdom and upon which we are turning our backs because it reminds us of our own powerlessness, but we must, above all, think of the very concept of law, with which Europe has become synonymous for centuries. It is this concept that the United States is now disregarding, thus opening the door to new acts of barbarism.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Watson is right: the Council’s position does not surprise us because, as illustrated so well by Mr Pasqua earlier, there is no more of a common foreign and security policy than a common policy in Europe. Our positions will never be similar, but Europe should, at the very least, remember that it has become synonymous, as has France, with the concept of law and this is much to its credit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In doing so, they are violating the United Nations’ Charter, international law and, more generally speaking, people’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the end of the Gulf War, America and Britain have, in fact, never called a halt to their air attacks on Iraq and have caused, by imposing sanctions – a genuine crime against humanity – the poverty and death of civilian populations and, according to the UN, the death of more than one million children. It is surprising that, although a number of countries, including the allies of the United States are dictatorships, Iraq, a Muslim country that is secular and tolerant towards religions and minorities – the Deputy Prime Minister is Christian and three government ministers are Kurds – is their number one target. It is also surprising that these western superpowers, paragons of democratic virtues, are preparing so cynically to breach the peace.</p>
<p class="contents">You are against the death penalty for murderers, but the British and the Americans are going to murder thousands of Iraqis and their children. This preventative war is unacceptable and you are well aware that real reasons are immoral; in fact, this war is essentially for electoral purposes and to protect oil supplies.</p>

It is a difficult matter we are debating, but it is also a very simple matter. I have very deliberately confined myself to the crux of the matter, namely that the EU wishes to put maximum pressure on the dictator, Saddam Hussein to get him to comply with the UN resolution and the conditions to which he himself has agreed. That is not a weak but, on the contrary, a strong position. Everything we say and do must put maximum pressure upon Saddam Hussein. Strong and combined international pressure of this kind is the only thing that can induce him to respond. I would therefore thank you for all the reflections that have contributed to this agreement to put such pressure upon Saddam, and I would ask you to appreciate that, because of the need to do this, I am neither able nor willing to adopt positions on all contingencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure both Mr Barón Crespo and others that what Mr Patten said was, in every detail, in accordance with what is the common EU position, confirmed once again in Elsinore at the weekend. It was an informal meeting with no new decisions taken, but I can readily divulge that there was support for maintaining the existing policy and for the importance of broad consultation on the part of the United States, including consultation with Arab states. There was agreement about the inspectors now having to be given the opportunity of entering Iraq and there was concern about the weapons of mass destruction that not only the United States but also UNSCOM have reasons for suspecting are being produced and that may be a deadly danger to peace in the Middle East and in the rest of the world. The EU supports the UN’s efforts. A regime such as Saddam Hussein’s can only be expected to be prepared to comply with its obligations if there is strong and combined pressure from the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to Baroness Nicholson and Mrs Napoletano that the Council fully supports Parliament’s desire that everyone who has committed war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity should be held to account for their actions. That also applies of course to those responsible for the Iraqi regime’s many crimes, and it is something for which preparations must be made in time. In connection with this, I should like to say that I am able to confirm what Mrs Maes said, to the effect that the Danish Presidency has set a deadline of a month for a dialogue with the United States on the International Criminal Court. I am able to confirm that this is what was at issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barón Crespo would have liked me to report on the EU’s latest efforts to help solve the Middle East conflict. I cannot give a detailed answer to his request but, like Mr Patten, I am able to inform you that my colleague, Mr Møller, is in the Middle East right now to present a proposal from the EU for a practical timetable or ‘road map’ for establishing a legitimate Palestinian state by June 2005. We are confident that there is broad support for this initiative, which can contribute significantly to further progress in the positive process which the Quartet has succeeded in setting in motion and in which we must place all our hopes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I think that it is probably true that I have had the honour, and always the pleasure, of replying to more debates in this Parliament than any other Commissioner in the last three years, such is Parliament's welcome interest in external affairs. For me this has been one of the most interesting and important debates.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no business of mine how Parliament conducts its affairs, but if one of the reasons for the interest and informed passion of this debate has been the formula which you have applied on this occasion, that which I think you call 'catching-the-eye', then I, for one, very much welcome it. I think that there are more people in the Chamber than normal. If Parliament does not mind me making the point, in my experience we have had the rather more unusual spectacle of people waiting to hear other people's speeches. I am even delighted to discover that one or two people have come back into the Chamber to hear the winding-up speeches which is a particular and rare pleasure. So speaking for my humble self, in the expectation that I will have rather a lot more debates to reply to in the next couple of years – unless Parliament focuses its interest entirely on domestic affairs – I found this an extremely welcome breakthrough.</p>
<p class="contents">I was asked one specific question, and another rhetorical question to which I will return. General Morillon asked the specific question of what we know about the attitude of the people of Iraq to their own regime, what we know about their ambitions and aspirations. The sad truth is that we know damn all because they have not had the opportunity to express their views for all too long. Indeed, the expression of free opinions in Iraq has led to people being shot, tortured and stuck in jail. I look forward to the day when we will know rather more about the aspirations of the people of Iraq but I have my doubts as to whether, in a free election, Saddam Hussein would sweep back with a plurality of the votes.</p>
<p class="contents">I should confess to a personal prejudice at this point. I have never regarded enthusiasm as a huge attribute in the discussion of foreign policy. I think enthusiasm does not always go well with the discussion of difficult foreign policy issues and I have always preferred foreign ministers who are prepared to sit under the tree for a bit and think what needs to be done first, rather than those who tear around trying to change the world. I find myself signed up enthusiastically to the famous dictum of Talleyrand <span class="italic">'surtout pas trop de zèle'</span>. Reading so many articles over the last summer on Iraq and so many speeches, I have sometimes wished that I believed in the veracity and wisdom of anything I say as fervently as some people seem to believe in the veracity and wisdom of everything they say.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that we have seen a parade of certainties sometimes based on obfuscation. I know very few people, for example, who seriously contend that Saddam Hussein is not in possession of any weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said earlier, if he is without any weapons of mass destruction, then what is the problem about letting inspectors in? When we are asked to define weapons of mass destruction, I suspect it is a question which could be put with some benefit to the Kurds in Iraq or to the people who live in the marshes in the south of Iraq, who could explain what chemical weapons do to your lungs. Those would be very good replies. Some of the certainties are also based on evasions and, from time to time, on a lack of willingness to enunciate clear, consistent and defensible principles.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to refer to a number of questions that we need to face up to. They go right to the heart of the issue of compliance with the United Nations and the whole issue of the justification for military action – an issue which was widely debated during the campaign in Kosovo and a question which goes to the heart of the matter we have debated on many occasions in this Chamber – the so-called clash of civilisations.</p>
<p class="contents">My first question is what happens if Iraq continues to defy existing UN resolutions? Do we simply shrug our shoulders? Secondly, what happens if we go back to the United Nations Security Council, get a new resolution and Saddam Hussein defies that? What do we do then? Do we simply wring our hands? Thirdly, what happens if we give Saddam Hussein an ultimatum and he defies it? What do we do? Write a letter to <span class="italic">Le Monde</span>, sign a petition? There have been several references – not all of them as laudatory as Mr Alastair Campbell might have liked – to the press conference which the Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland gave in his constituency yesterday. The honourable Member Mr Lagendijk, for example, referred to what he said.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me quote one thing which Mr Blair said yesterday: the UN had to be a way of dealing with it – i.e. the problem caused by Iraq – not a way of avoiding dealing with it. While I am not a paid-up member of New Labour, that is a pretty good point and one which we simply cannot duck.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth question concerns a point which Dr Kissinger has often reminded us of. Since the Treaty of Westphalia and the end of the Thirty Years War, international law, itself sometimes a rather nebulous concept, has been based on, among other principles, the principle that one state should not intervene in the affairs of another and certainly should not intervene militarily. Is that an entirely adequate principle of international law today? We saw the debate begun a couple of years ago by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, about whether humanitarian intervention was sometimes justified, for example when a sovereign government could be accused of assaulting the interests and the liberties and the rights of its own people.</p>
<p class="contents">Is intervention in the affairs of another sovereign state justified by its possession of weapons of mass destruction? Can you turn that into an acceptable principle? Does it depend entirely on context? Does it depend on the nature of the regime? Does it depend on the stated intentions of the regime? Does it depend on the scale of threat represented by that regime? Whatever else you say, clearly if you are arguing along those lines you will need to present a good deal of evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of justifying intervention, there is the point which Dr Kissinger argued very explicitly in a recent article in <span class="italic">The New York Times</span>. He argues that terrorism raises an entirely new issue for nation states. Today, he argues, one nation state can be faced with a threat from another nation state operating through non-state actors. In other words, the argument is that intervention could be justified where a nation state appears to be using terrorist organisations to threaten another nation state. At the very least I imagine all of us would argue that military intervention in a sovereign state demands a clear and well-argued justification.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are all issues which will be very near the heart of foreign and security policy debates in the next decade or longer. They are issues on which we in the European Union, not least because of our tradition of the rule of law, not least because of the other principles in which we believe, should have clear and unequivocal opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">The final question is: if the present government in Iraq is replaced as a result of military intervention, will that make the politics of the region more moderate or will it make the politics of the region more extreme?</p>
<p class="contents">All those are questions which we cannot duck. They are all questions to which we will have to find our own answers over the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish with this thought. There has been a lot of reference to our relationship with the United States. I very much hope that we can work together with the United States – Europe and the United States – over the coming months to deal with an undoubted threat to world peace and to international stability. We on our side may from time to time sound to Americans as though we are speaking with a rather self-serving condescension in arguing that United States leadership should be based on as broad a moral consensus as possible, referring to the Truman doctrine and the Marshall Plan, which helped to secure our futures, our prosperity, our freedom in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">But we in Europe, if we are to pull on our end of the rope, have to face up to one or two rather difficult issues ourselves. We must avoid wishful thinking and we must avoid ducking the difficult questions which I have addressed during these remarks today. I am sure this will not be the last time we debate this issue. I hope we can clarify our responses to some of those questions in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
