<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Theato (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, protection of the Community's financial interests is a concept that the citizen out there finds difficult to understand. But it is of deep concern to him, as someone who pays his taxes, that his money should be used for the development and extension of a united Europe and that it should not be misused or employed for the purposes of fraud or other kinds of criminal activity. He has every right to demand that the European institutions to which he entrusts his money will handle it carefully and that, should frauds be committed, these will be detected and punished. The message we must get across is that we are using every available means to justify the citizen's trust.</p>
<p class="contents">The means to hand have, though, been blunt weapons to date, and there has been increased leakage from the Community budget due to criminal practices – figures show it as having doubled to over EUR 2 billion in the past year. The percentage of undetected crime, may well, by the way, be even higher. Despite better detection of fraud, judicial cooperation across frontiers is limping along, far behind multinational organised crime. The Council, the Commission and Parliament have been lamenting this situation for years, but little or nothing has as yet been done about it. The agreement on protection of the Community's financial interests, signed in Cannes all of six years ago, and the protocols appended to it, have still not been ratified by all the Member States and are therefore not in force. Despite all the appeals and resolutions by Parliament, and several summit declarations by the Council, there is still no common European legal area to protect the Community budget, indeed, not even an unambiguous definition of the concept of fraud against Community funds. Still less are any investigations carried out or punitive sentences handed down, which must be in equal measure effective, proportionate and deterrent.</p>
<p class="contents">This blockade situation has now seen the Commission produce a proposal for a directive which recalls elements of the 1995 agreement and incorporates parts of them in the protocols, a proposal which, incidentally, Parliament had already made before the 1995 Summit. The Commission, rightly, bases its proposal upon Article 280(4) of the Treaty of Amsterdam under which the Community is obliged to play an active part in protecting its funds. This should circumvent the sterile debate about allocation to the first or third pillar of the Treaty, particularly as the Treaty of Nice affirms that the protection of the Community's finances belongs in the first pillar. So we should not lose ourselves in legal analyses, but send a clear signal. For us, the criminal-law protection of European funds against criminal misuse is a serious matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome the Commission's proposal for the harmonisation of national legislation. It can, though, only be a first step towards the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office to protect Community financial interests, something that was called for at the IGC for the Treaty of Nice but was not, unfortunately, actually discussed. Mrs Schreyer, we are waiting impatiently for the Green Paper from the Commission on this subject. It would have been a good thing if we had already had this Green Paper together with the proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make good this deficiency, the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control call for the next revision of the Treaties to include the establishment of a European State Prosecutor's Office, on the <span class="italic">corpus juris</span> model and appertaining to the first pillar. The course must be set for this as early as the Laeken Summit. The Committee on Budgetary Control proposes, as an intermediate step without amending the Treaty, the establishment of an internal financial prosecutor in accordance with the three-phase model in the second report of the Committee of Wise Men.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, we welcome the Commission's proposal, but call for an effective instrument, that is to say, a regulation rather than a directive. Why? Directives commit the Member States to objectives, whilst regulations prescribe the instruments they are to use to achieve those objectives. The proposal for a directive is meant to insert into the criminal law of all the Member States a standard definition of offences such as fraud, corruption, money-laundering etc. to the detriment of the Community Budget. There is no doubt that a regulation is the legal instrument to be preferred in order to avoid new confusion of the sort that there has been in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly invite Parliament, the Commission and the Council to now go down this necessary political road together. I ask you to adopt my report, on which no amendments have been tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just so we can put this beyond dispute for once: for the taxpayer, it is essentially irrelevant whether it is a question of fraud or irregularity; the money has been improperly spent. Now, one can, of course, argue about whether more fraud is actually being committed or whether it is being cleared up more effectively, or whether there are more irregularities. I tend to think it is probably a combination of these. The Commissioner may well think differently, but we cannot go so far as to say that having discovered 100% irregularities means that we have had the best way of combating fraud, because then we will not have any budget left.</p>
<p class="contents">In my position – and perhaps the Commissioner responsible was herself once a Member of this House in a past life – and in this situation, one asks oneself what would happen in a business if the management presented figures like these one year. Here, we are always coming up against the fact that people say we are among the best administrations. We are striving to be that. I think that what would happen would be something quite different from what the Commission expects from us as an action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The actual point of my report is that I believe we should just consider where this road might take us. Mrs Theato has already mentioned one possibility, and an important one at that, which we will not be able to avoid if we want to make changes. We must address the issue of a European State Prosecutor, and do it without excuses about amendments to the Treaty. The possibilities are already there in the Treaties. Your opposition to it, Mrs Schreyer, is your own business, but we will not carry on standing idly before our taxpayers and tell them that we just cannot do anything. That is not what we have a Commission for. The Commission is there to act, and of that I would remind you, Mrs Schreyer.</p>
<p class="contents">In exactly the same way, we must give greater priority to the protection of the EU's financial interests in the applicant countries. There were, and are, proposals on this which amount to saying that we will, at some point, have to let our anti-fraud unit be active in an advisory capacity, which we know already. As the example of Slovakia has shown, the point at issue is not the acceding countries, but the continuing inability of this Commission to get a proper grip on the problematic aspects of enlargement, so that our fellow citizens might get the idea that enlargement has been prepared for in such a way, including financially, that they can happily say yes to it. The Commission bears great responsibility in this respect. Madam Commissioner, I am inclined to think that, when one has to submit those sorts of figures and turn them into something tangible, one has to seize every available opportunity to improve matters.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is on an issue on which it would be good if we could seize the opportunity for common action. It has to do with a question that I will raise now. Mrs Schreyer, the plan is to appoint Mr Alberto Perduca as Director of the operational department of OLAF, the anti-fraud office. His qualifications as a public prosecutor, his experience in combating the mafia, and also his experience at an international level make him the ideal man for the job. Unfortunately, his appointment has been blocked for months now by the new Italian government. Perhaps, Mrs Schreyer, you might tell us what the Commission has done about this to date. Would personal intervention by the President of the Commission not be necessary in this case? Has this, as is to be hoped, already taken place? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1995 the Member States jointly signed a convention under which, in order to safeguard Community interests and finances, the Member States make fraud against Community finances a punishable offence. Subsequently, further protocols were signed also specifying corruption and the laundering of money derived from fraud against Community finances as criminal offences.</p>
<p class="contents">There is actually nothing wrong with this convention and the protocols except that they have not all been ratified yet and therefore they are still not in force. I do not deny that in the year 2000 there was some movement in the direction of ratification. Whenever I have met with finance ministers I have constantly repeated my request that they be ratified, but the speed is determined by the slowest. The protocol that makes money laundering a crime has so far been ratified by only seven Member States. So you can see how long it would take if we were to wait for the process to be completed. We cannot accept that; that is why we have put forward the proposal for a directive that converts the main content of the protocol and the convention into a directive; this has already been discussed in Parliament on a number of occasions and has repeatedly been called for by the President himself.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you, Mrs Theato, and, of course, the committee as a whole, for joining us in saying that things have gone far enough and we are now going to use Community law and not rely on the convention, the third pillar instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgetary Control has tabled many amendments that were voted on in the Committee. The Commission shares the objective and concern expressed by many of these. But the Commission believes the present proposal for a directive is not in legal terms the right place for the vast majority of the amendments. I must therefore ask you not to take the proposal for a directive as some kind of tree on which to hang many wishes, concerns and suggestions, correct as these may be. That is especially the case with the European Public Prosecutor. Again a word on that, Mr Bösch. Of course, the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. In our clear analysis Article 280 does not, as it appears in the Treaty, lend itself to that, not even the ‘little’ public prosecutor, to use that term again.</p>
<p class="contents">In our estimation, and other people do share this view, there is no basis in law for the OLAF Supervisory Committee. Neither would it be possible to choose the instrument of the regulation, because the proposal as you now have it provides, for example, for the European Court of Justice to have an investigating judge. But the duties of the Court of Justice and its judicial functions are laid down in detail in the Treaty. It is, therefore, not possible to use a regulation to institutionalise a new investigating judge. That, too, requires an amendment to the Treaty. But we shall be presenting the Green Paper in a few weeks’ time, as Mrs Theato has mentioned. The Green Paper will, of course, initiate a wide-ranging discussion. I am sure that, as protagonists of this proposal, you will take this discussion to the experts and to the Member States, so that we do not have a repeat of the situation we had in Nice, where there were only reservations and no agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, there is no legal basis for some of the other amendments, either. Provisions concerning cooperation between the national criminal prosecution authorities would be incompatible with Article 280 of the Treaty since they are concerned with the application of the Member States’ criminal law and their administration of criminal justice. Neither can the Commission go along with the suggestion of converting the directive into a regulation, since the Community cannot, at present, create law that is directly applicable in the Member States. I understand your concern and in view of the present situation I, of course, also support the call for your wish to be met swiftly, but we are a long way from a situation where the European Community can create directly applicable law. I am sure that this would really not meet with the agreement of the national parliaments either.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is able to agree without reservation to Amendment No 2 and No 11. They underline, once again, how important the introduction of the new Article 280 is for protecting the Community’s financial interests. Amendment No 27, which provides for custodial sentences, possibly leading to extradition, is essential for effectively fighting economic crime, and the Commission would also like to agree to the first sentences of Amendment No 3 and No 7 if these should be voted on separately tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to explicitly say that the proposals for extending the list of offences for the protection of financial interests are very worthy of note and, in my opinion, very much worthy of consideration, namely that market-rigging and abuse of office should be included. It is really more a question here of the strategy to be adopted. The Commission’s proposed strategy is to adopt the wording of the convention, more or less, as it stands and to present the Member States with a situation where they have already agreed to this very text and there is, therefore, now no reason to convert it into another instrument that sets a clear time for its transposition.</p>
<p class="contents">That is one of the legislative measures the Commission is putting forward to protect the Community’s financial interests. The Commission has listed the proposals we put forward in the year 2000 in the fraud prevention report, for example the proposal to amend the money laundering directive, the proposal to prevent counterfeiting of the euro or measures to combat product piracy. That is all part of preventing fraud, after all.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s report also contains 50 pages listing the measures taken by the Member States to protect Community finances in the years 1999 and 2000. It starts with Belgium extending its customs administration’s powers to a twelve mile zone outside coastal waters and includes, for example, the creation of a central control information system by Denmark’s customs and tax administration and an increase in staff at Spain’s general inspectorates for agricultural expenditure in the regions. The United Kingdom has, for example, set up a coordination point for general investigations involving the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Structural Funds, the rapporteur, you, Mr Bösch, has included the Court of Auditors’ highly critical report, which highlights the differences between the Member States in the application of the regulation that irregularities in the implementation of the Structural Funds must be reported. I can assure you that I share your criticism and that of the Court of Auditors. We are, therefore, working very hard with the Member States to get a more uniform and above all a more thorough implementation of this reporting regulation. And this is beginning to bear fruit. I really must reiterate: even if we will probably continue to differ on the interpretation, in earlier years, transposition was extremely hesitant. We have found that it took ages for an irregularity to be reported. It is now <span class="italic">de facto</span> better, but that, of course, also means that more irregularities are being reported. It is like police statistics. Is it a good thing or a bad thing when the number of cases the police detect rises or falls?</p>
<p class="contents">I really must therefore ask you not to discredit those Member States that take their reporting of irregularities seriously and make frequent reports as required by the Regulation by saying they are the ‘strongholds’, because it is a difficult instrument. There is, as it were, a negative incentive: the more irregularities are reported, the more information we naturally have on the basis of which to make financial corrections. We cannot do without this mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the rapporteur, I agree with you, Mr Bösch, that we must make the statistics more meaningful so we can see which are the new reports and which were already in the statistics before. Above all, we must look at what has been the result of the reports, what measures have been taken. OLAF is working on it, the Directorate-General for the Budget is working on it, the Directorate-General for the Regions is working on it, but it is a laborious business. I am sure we will not have the success we are actually looking for next year either, but we will see that they are becoming more meaningful, as it were, sector by sector. It also depends on cooperation with the Member States, and OLAF is working closely with the so-called COCOLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">I can inform you, however, that every suspected case of fraud, especially in the Structural Funds, is passed on to OLAF. The most common irregularities with the Structural Funds are concerned with cases where, for example, the Member States approve projects after the period for support has actually finished. Irregularities also appear, in particular, because other Community policies are not followed. One quite frequent irregularity is that projects have been approved without an environmental impact assessment being made first. A lot of money is spent on infrastructures, and that is a very common error, as I said. If you now ask what damage results, that is, of course, difficult to say. There is no financial damage, but there may be environmental damage because the environmental impact assessment was not carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the financial corrections, another important point, we shall have tighter rules for the new support period. In the report, you have now called for all irregularities affecting financial corrections and the Structural Funds reported in the period from 1995 to 2000 to be listed individually by 15 December. We do not have that information available and will not have it available so quickly. The Commission can promise that we will now try to get this information direct for the new irregularity reports in a way that makes the reports meaningful so that we can see which irregularities result in financial loss.</p>
<p class="contents">How is the protection of financial interests directive likely to be treated in the Council? Unfortunately, some Member States have already taken quite a clear stance against this directive on grounds of legal dogma. You have mentioned this. All the Member States say in the Council, yes, of course, we must do something about this, but then they argue no, that is something that belongs in the third pillar, not in the first pillar. I would like to see the justice ministers who argue in this way, doing so in a public debate. Nobody would understand it. And the population will not accept them saying they can do nothing because one thing is the first pillar but another is the third pillar and the Community can only take action in the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear that the protection of Community interests requires Community instruments, and I am very pleased and very grateful to you that the European Parliament and the Commission are pulling in the same direction here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has certainly been the case as far as the protection of the Community’s financial interests is concerned. Parliament, notably its Committee on Budgetary Control, has indeed taken risks. We should pay tribute to the determination shown by Mrs Theato who chairs that Committee and is one of the rapporteurs. Whatever is achieved in this field will be largely due to her efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I must admit that along with many other Members I share the Commission’s concern. We need to work towards creating an area of justice, but we must do so in a responsible manner. Throughout the whole process of the construction of Europe, the forces attempting to hinder it have consistently taken advantage of the mistakes made by more enthusiastic individuals when they lose sight of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am bringing a critical note into today’s debate. I do not wish to argue against the concept of a European Public Prosecutor, but I am concerned about laying down the details of the necessary statute. It is indeed a transitional statute but a statute nonetheless. The House needs to give due consideration to this office. Not only should the Committee on Budgetary Control give it due consideration, but so should the House itself. Such consideration should also involve dialogue with other institutions, notably the Commission. Not until that has taken place will we be in a position to move forward together and present a proposal consistent with the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies, in my view, to the Commissioner’s comments on the rapporteur’s idea of resorting to a regulation in place of a directive. That is not within Parliament’s competence. It falls within the competence of our societies and of states governed by the rule of law. Only in very specific circumstances may direct obligations be imposed on citizens from a Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I have ventured to voice some criticism here today, Mr President. I am, however, full of admiration for the work completed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have been tireless workers on fighting fraud in the European Union since they were appointed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is a problem. According to the Commission report, there has been a doubling of fraud, in particular, of the revenue collected over the year 2000. That is of great concern but we must put it into context and remember that much of this is due to Member States not taking fraud seriously. They are not collecting the money that is due to the European Union, for example, from cigarette smuggling and the money that we could get through taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are also not taking fraud seriously because we still have four Member States who have not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests which means that nobody can move on in terms of fighting fraud. As regards the Structural Funds, 40% of the money is spent in the Member States and the data we have, in terms of following up where that money is spent, is unreliable. This situation is quite pathetic.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we do when we find fraud? We pass a file onto OLAF who do the investigation and then it sits on a shelf because nobody prosecutes. This is a real problem. Who is going to take responsibility for prosecution? Only two people have ever been prosecuted by OLAF and this is a green light to fraudsters in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ask if people are against the European Public Prosecutor, then what alternative do they want to see? We are asking a little bit too much in this report by asking for a regulation. But we also know that about half the Member States are against this and there is a possibility of losing an opportunity to have a European fraud prosecutor for the EU financial interests. We may be asking for too much too fast and I am concerned about that, but I respect the Members for really trying to push the boat out on this fraud issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that they have both worked hard on this topic from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">I should first of all like to turn my attention to the Bösch report. As the Liberal Group, we have tabled a few amendments to this report, to the effect that we consider mid-2002 somewhat premature as a firm deadline for a public prosecutor. In order to avoid any misunderstandings, we are clearly in favour of a public prosecutor, but mid-2002 is slightly too early.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, more attention should be devoted to the future Member States in Central and Eastern Europe and we would therefore ask the Court of Auditors to issue a report on this as soon as possible, thus enabling us to assess whether these countries are also capable of managing their financial affairs effectively before they accede. Furthermore, OLAF must obviously work closely together with similar organisations in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to make our position clear on the Theato report: we are in support of a public prosecutor, but the lion’s share of the amendments that have been adopted in committee, in most cases by one majority vote, go too far in our view.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, we prefer a directive to a regulation. We want to avoid a confrontation course with the Council: the line of the Commission is preferable to the abundance of detail in the various amendments. If these amendments were to be adopted at this stage, we ought to revisit them in the Committee on Budgetary Control, for we believe that, at this stage, matters of this kind should attract the greatest possible consensus and that the decision should not be made by a narrow majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And I have very little hope that this will change, especially in the matter of the European Financial Public Prosecutor. A Green Paper is all the Commission has planned for the remaining years of its term of office. Your much-vaunted Commission reform programme lacks the crucial safety net. Those who abuse their freedoms must be capable of being brought to account. Your first duty ought to have been to clear up the old cases and call those responsible to account. Instead, you are hiding behind a hesitant judiciary in Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">To prevent this sad truth from becoming so evident, you are following a policy of concealing information from Parliament, which you now want to get expressly embodied in the Financial Regulation. You are claiming for yourself the right to decide whether informing Parliament about a procedure is in the European Union’s interest or not. I would like to have seen you when you were a member of the State Parliament in Berlin, Mrs Schreyer, if the Governing Mayor had told you it was not in the city’s interest to inform you about certain things. That is precisely how you are presuming to treat the European Parliament today and you clearly fail to appreciate that in so doing you weaken not only this Parliament but, ultimately, also the Commission of which you are part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
