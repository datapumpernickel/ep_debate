We deplore the fact that as many as 80 people were killed and hundreds were injured in the violent clashes in El Alto, La Paz and other cities and I take this opportunity to express my condolences to the families concerned. We firmly hope that the persons responsible for the deaths and injuries will not go unpunished. We regret the chain of events which led to the resignation last Friday of the democratically elected former President González Sánchez de Lozada. I nevertheless welcome the orderly transition which has resulted in former Vice-President Carlos Mesa Gisbert assuming the presidency of the Republic of Bolivia in compliance with the provisions of its constitution. My colleague, Chris Patten, made a statement on Monday wishing President Mesa every success at what we surely all agree is a particularly critical moment in Bolivia's history.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has called upon all Bolivians to work together in an open and constructive spirit to find consensual solutions to the many challenges facing their country. We are fully committed to assisting the Bolivian authorities during the period of transition. Recent events have underlined the need to take steps to ensure the effective participation of Bolivia's citizens in democratic and constitutional governance. In this context, the Commission is ready to devote resources, building on its long tradition of cooperation with Bolivia, to support concrete measures which can improve the capacity of key actors to prevent and manage conflict in this very complex and divided country.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the escalating crisis during the last month, the Commission was already very concerned indeed about the potential for further outbreaks of serious and violent political conflict in Bolivia following the events of 12 and 13 February 2003, when the police rioted in response to the former president's budget proposals and the subsequent clashes left 33 people dead and nearly 200 wounded. Making use of its rapid reaction mechanism, the Commission initiated a conflict assessment mission, which completed its field work at the end of June 2003. As a result we are considering drawing on the rapid reaction mechanism budget line, up to EUR 1 million, and are examining ideas and proposals for concrete short-term measures in the field of conflict prevention and management, which we hope to discuss in the very near future in close coordination with the new government of President Carlos Mesa.</p>
<p class="contents">We are particularly interested in supporting measures which could strengthen the capacity of the Congress and Senate to respond effectively to the many and often conflicting demands of Bolivian citizens before they become unmanageable and spill over into further episodes of violent conflict. The Commission also intends to explore with the new government the possibility of re-orienting a limited part of those funds which have not yet been committed from our country strategy paper envelope for 2000-2006 towards a longer term programme with an explicit conflict prevention focus. The recent events and their dramatic dénouement prove the need for the European Union to continue strengthening its long-standing partnership with Bolivia, to promote respect and trust for democratic principles, to assist with desperately needed economic recovery and to support Bolivia's efforts to alleviate poverty and stamp out social exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, in view of the grave events which have taken place in Bolivia, I believe nothing could be more dangerous than to take a simplistic and demagogic view of them, since this would lead us to make serious errors in our interpretation of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in order to approach this problem in a correct manner, we should work on the basis of two premises: firstly, the situation of horrendous inequality, social exclusion and poverty. Let us not forget that Bolivia is the poorest country in South America, with an imperfect, incomplete democracy, which is far from being the effective and functional democracy it should be, and neither must we forget, Mr President, the long tradition of military coups in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">These factors, amongst others, create a very fertile breeding ground for the emergence of populism based on social frustration, which has been very well described by such a widely respected person as the writer – and one time politician – Mario Vargas Llosa, following the frustrated privatisations in the Peruvian city of Arequipa.</p>
<p class="contents">What is certainly the case – as Vargas Llosa also tells us – is that a sort of re-emergence of populism is taking place, as a result of the failure of certain reforms for opening up the markets and for privatisation, in some cases presented falsely as neo-liberal, and the only alternative is the old nationalist and Statist model of development with a domestic focus, to which – together with dictatorships – these countries owe much of their marginalisation and misery.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe it is important, Mr President, that we are able to distinguish, because many believe a war is being waged on corruption and in favour of justice when, in reality, a battle may be breaking out in favour of more backwardness and poverty. That is what happened in Arequipa and, although the two cases are not exactly the same, there are consequences from this Peruvian phenomenon which could perhaps explain, or be applied or extrapolated within the context of Bolivia’s experience.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two worrying elements to the situation: one of them is the three months that the leader of the opposition and coca-grower, Evo Morales, has given them to resolve the situation in the country, and the other is the holding of a referendum on privatisation and the sale of gas.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union, as the Commissioner quite rightly said, must appeal for moderation and good sense, so that a constructive dialogue between all the parties may be initiated in order to generate a climate of trust and understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe, Mr President, that we must reiterate our firm and decisive support for the democratic system, for the Rule of Law and for constitutional order and also express our condolences – as the Commission has done – to the people and the Government of the Republic of Bolivia, for the loss of human lives.</p>
<p class="contents">In the compromise resolution we also call for this Parliament to send a delegation to the Republic of Bolivia to analyse the situation on the ground and stress the need to increase efforts aimed at the physical, political, social and economic reconstruction of the country in order to make it governable.</p>
<p class="contents">We take a positive view of the efforts announced by the Commission, but we believe that these efforts must be increased since the mobilisation of a sum of EUR one million is entirely insufficient, given the poverty afflicting that country and we believe that the funds requested by this Parliament, and included in the European Union’s budget for 2004, in order to create a regional solidarity fund, could be a very useful instrument for dealing with crises such as the one which is regrettably unfolding in Bolivia at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This statement said, amongst other things, that the European Council reiterated its support for the democratically-elected government of Bolivia in its efforts to find a peaceful and constitutional solution to the current crisis and added that the European Council called on the political, social and economic forces in Bolivia to renounce violence and begin a responsible and constructive dialogue with the Bolivian Government.</p>
<p class="contents">This was said at a time when, as Commissioner Vitorino himself has acknowledged, the Bolivian Government had been responsible for the deaths of more than eighty citizens and for injuries to hundreds of people and material damage to their property. At that time I was ashamed to read that the European Union, together with the US Government, was one of the few sources of support left to the President who acted in such an irresponsible way, after having tried to appropriate the country’s scant natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The question I would ask the Presidency, represented by the Commission at the moment, and I am not sure whether it will be able to answer, is what kind of information the European Council had when adopting this statement, given that on that same day, before it had been possible to translate the Council’s statement into Spanish, the President of Bolivia was delivering his letter of resignation to the Bolivian National Congress. What type of representation do we have? Is there no communication between the Commission and the Council? Did the Commission not know what was happening? What kind of information was there? How could the Council have adopted this statement without the support of the Commission? In other words, we cannot act in such an irresponsible manner, because in this case the European Union has made a fool of itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It has made a fool of itself before the public and – I repeat – I was ashamed to read in the newspapers that we were supporting this statement, together with the United States. But the Americans behaved more intelligently, because, when they saw that things were going badly, before 17 October, they told Sánchez de Lozada to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I apologise for taking such a critical tone, but I really feel hugely indignant at the moment, because it is not acceptable for our Union to be supporting this type of policy. I would like to add that I agree with Mr Salafranca that this is a time to stay calm, to support the new Bolivian Government, to do everything possible to ensure that this government succeeds, and I would like to thank the Commissioner for the information he has given me on emergency aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, I do not believe that the emergency aid will be enough. Bolivia is the poorest country in South America. Millions of country people are living in misery. The situation is truly horrendous and I believe that that country needs a very particular form of help, and we should avoid repeating past mistakes. We must not rob these poor people of the only natural resource remaining to them, having first taken silver from Bolivia and then tin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent conflict in Bolivia therefore reveals all the aspects characterising this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible to establish a direct link between the abusive and unacceptable intervention of the United States, with its interference in the last electoral campaign in favour of Sánchez de Lozada and against Evo Morales, and the subsequent shameful delivery of Bolivian gas to the Americans, bringing the poorest country in America even closer to ruin.</p>
<p class="contents">Our joint resolution attempts to intervene positively, strengthening democracy, defending the right of people to their own energy resources and condemning the use of excessive violence on the part of the previous government against demonstrators. Our group also criticises the Council for those statements – which Mr Medina has also mentioned – and proposes three amendments which we believe improve the joint text itself. Firstly, it demands that the President, who has resigned, answer to Bolivian justice for crimes he may have committed during his mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we believe that the European Union and its Member States should act in a coordinated way within international financial institutions in order to resolve the serious problem of Bolivia’s external debt.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that we should call on the authorities to provide information for the families of people who have ‘disappeared’ and to quickly release those who have been unlawfully arrested.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we believe that we should call on the Organisation of American States to take measures to protect the lives of the social leaders who have been threatened, such as Evo Morales. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
