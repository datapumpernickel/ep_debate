<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Madam President, I should like to thank the European Parliament for the great efforts it has made to approve, on time, two directives which are vital for the completion of a single financial market, namely the directive on financial instrument markets and the Transparency Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with pleasure that I take this opportunity to thank the two rapporteurs. I should like to ask your indulgence, Mr Skinner, but ladies first, as you know. I should like to thank Mrs Villiers for her report. Without her efforts and openness we would not have been able to achieve this consensual and balanced result. I should also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Randzio-Plath, who succeeded in reconciling divergent positions among political parties and national approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that the compromise package that will be voted on shortly improves both on the Commission proposal and on the common position. The Commission can accept the compromise package in its entirety, that is Amendments Nos 54 to 82; in consequence the Commission rejects all other amendments. The scope of the pre-trade transparency obligation is now clearer, in particular with regard to the transactions to which this obligation applies. Other technical amendments – for example those concerning derivatives – provide useful clarifications without changing the orientation of the Commission proposal. The Commission is grateful that the compromise package does not include amendments on other political issues that had been fiercely debated in the Council; reopening those issues would have put adoption of the directive in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">The final text will be a significant step forward in the integration of European financial markets. For the first time we have been able to agree a common market regulatory framework that will put our market at the forefront in terms of flexibility, innovation and investor protection. It deserves the support of a strong absolute majority vote of Members of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the transparency directive and the report by Mr Skinner. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and thank, yet again, Mrs Villiers and also Mr Huhne, the shadow rapporteurs in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as well as Mr Lehne of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, for their contributions and close cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is ready to accept the compromise package as agreed with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, but will reject all other amendments. I shall hand out a detailed list with the Commission’s position to the European Parliament after this debate.<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p class="contents">On the interim management statement for share issuers, we agree on the compromise that has been tabled. The Commission will now monitor carefully how the agreed solution works in practice. The compromise package also comprises transitional arrangements for those third-country bond issuers in respect of bonds already admitted to trading on a European-regulated market before 1 January 2005. Some Member States – but not all – will make use of such arrangements in 2006, i.e. the date by which the directive should be transposed. I invite the national regulators of those Member States to do their best to ensure continuity for such bond issuers, pending the completion of the assessment of the equivalence between international accounting standards and third-country accounting standards at European level. It is in our interest that we make our capital markets as attractive as possible to non-EU issuers.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, if you decide to adopt the compromise package tabled before you, one of the final initiatives of the financial services action plan will have been completed in record time, with only a year having passed since the Commission made its proposal. Adoption after a single reading would be a major achievement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Skinner (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, it was very useful to hear that statement from the Commissioner. It will go quite a long way in sending the right signals in addition to many already issued in the bond markets and the markets in general. Commissioner, you are right to say that today's report on transparency obligations is a central plank of the financial services action plan. It brings certainty to the financial markets and underlines the process by which companies must inform investors. There was much debate amongst the various stakeholders, sometimes leaving us quite confused and with the outcome looking slightly opaque, but I believe we have here the correct blend and a very useful piece of legislation we can push ahead with.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some issues which ought to be underlined. The first is that despite the original plan we will no longer have a mandatory approach to quarterly reporting. That is clear. Parliament was absolutely right in rejecting it and also clearly right in supporting a compromise which regularises and standardises detailed explanations, but does not allow for the mandatory approach already foreseen.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for this approach is that we wish to forestall any short-termism and we wish to balance this against the need for any costs. I particularly hope that this will settle a lot of issues and that we will not see a repeat in German courtrooms of what we are seeing at the moment in discussions between certain companies and certain bourses.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the type of accounting methodology we need and the necessary reconciliation with third country issuers is dealt here as well. The agreement reached between Parliament, presidency and the Commission to pursue a reconciliation mechanism is absolutely vital. We must therefore not drag our feet on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I also mention the ten-year grandfather clause contained in Article 26 which refers to half-annual reporting. This too, Commissioner, is contentious, and that is why Article 29 contains another reference to a review of this legislation within five years of its full entry into force. Hard facts have been difficult to ascertain in this short period. We need to watch this very closely and I am glad you used the words 'watch very closely' as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament welcomes a decision to bring forward urgently legislation in the company law action plan forcing all senior managers to reveal their compensation packages to investors at some time in the very near future. We will be pressing this cause very much. We regard it as something which could have been here, but we let it pass since you are going to bring it in later. We will, however, be watching very closely indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, there is a great expectation that the Council will be as good as its word – as will the Commission – in supporting the voluntary initiative to make transparent all payments made by companies in the extractive industries to all governments. In Angola, 25% of the state's income – some USD 1.7 billion – disappears every year. The majority of this money derives from the extraction of oil, and because of the way the money is paid and reported, little is truly known of the corruption. Frankly, it is hidden because it is illicit and it goes to the very top of government.</p>
<p class="contents">The oil companies meeting in Canada next week and the governments of the European Union and the institutions dealing with good financial governance need to force the pace on this issue. They need to change what is going on. Investors need to know and companies should not gamble with their reputations. Moreover, those who steal from their own countrymen should be stopped. For example, post-war Angola's need for money is tragic for thousands of poverty-stricken families. Infant mortality, health in general and education are still priorities in this region, and yet basic greed still thwarts solid progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Calling on these companies to be transparent now would be a cornerstone in good governance and openness. In five years' time Parliament will judge progress made in this legislation and it will be looking to see that it is balanced by the approach of the Commission and other institutions in encouraging this progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank all the services involved in this report, particularly Margaret Cazalet in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, my own Group secretariat, Annabel Garner-Boulay, the presidency, the Commission, along with my colleagues both in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for the great help they have given in drawing up a very balanced report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Villiers (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, I would like first to speak on the transparency directive on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, which supports this package from the presidency. We believe that quarterly reporting is dead. The changes we have seen on quarterly reporting have been very welcome. I am not sure that we need the publication of the statement contained in the compromise, but I do not see that as a particular problem, so it is an acceptable part of the compromise package. Mandatory quarterly reporting would have been extremely damaging and costly and would not have yielded real benefits in terms of transparency for investors.</p>
<p class="contents">The transparency package also has vital clarifications on custodians and asset managers and sensible provisions on dissemination of information: ensuring fast dissemination across Europe, but allowing Member States the option if they want to require publication in a newspaper. I am particularly pleased with the result on bonds in relation to third country issuers. Many of their problems have been solved and I am pleased that elements of my amendment that looked at annual reporting and the issue of equivalence for third country issuers have been taken on board in the presidency package.</p>
<p class="contents">On the ISD, I would like to thank a number of people: Mrs Cazalet from the Secretariat, my assistant Sarah McCarthy, the PSE Shadow George Katiforis, who has given me a tremendous amount of help, and Mr Karas, the coordinator of the PPE-DE Group, who has operated in a very fair manner on this very difficult dossier. I will be voting for the presidency package. I would urge other Members to do the same. I am concerned about it, however: there are many aspects of it which I think are unsatisfactory, but there is no doubt that it is much better than the common position, which is why I propose to support it.</p>
<p class="contents">There are positive points in the package as will be agreed tomorrow. Execution-only services and direct-offer products will be permitted to continue under this directive. The framework for those products is more complex than I would like, but execution-only business can continue. I would welcome it if the Commissioner would confirm very clearly today that the new Investment Services Directive – ISD-2 – will not prevent people from using the execution-only services and direct offer products that they find so valuable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that the Council has rejected PPE-DE amendments on country of origin. But, having said that, removing most of the powers of host countries is very welcome and will contribute to cross-border trade. We are left with an unnecessarily complex framework for branches, but we are moving a step closer towards proper home country control and country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the inclusion of investment advice in ISD-2. It will plug the gaps that exist in some countries where advice is not properly regulated. This has an impact across Europe, because these services from poorly regulated countries could be sold right across Europe under the e-Commerce Directive. It is vital that we plug those gaps and give investors a proper conduct of business rule and advice protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think investors will find welcome protection with the best-execution rule. I am pleased that many of the elements of the European Parliament's first reading amendments are included in the best execution provisions, and particularly a proportionate and pragmatic approach on best execution which recognises that while it is an objective standard, it is not an absolute standard. I also welcome an extensive framework of post-trade transparency, which will enable the markets to work better and provide welcome investor protection.</p>
<p class="contents">On customer classification, I hope that ISD-2 is an improvement on ISD-1, where there was insufficient distinction between retail and wholesale investors. It is vital that we have a proper distinction, because each needs a completely different regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Welcome technical clarifications on commodity derivatives have also been included, which will give the ISD framework the ability to adapt to innovation in the future in the commodities and derivatives markets, ensuring that new derivatives can be included in the framework in the future and thus providing more investor protection and greater legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">On Article 27 and the concentration rule, after what was frankly a disastrous result in Ecofin, this has been something of a damage limitation exercise for Parliament. Speaking from a United Kingdom perspective, I think it is regrettable that Mr Boateng, the Minister representing the United Kingdom in that instance, was not able to get a better result. In our second reading in the European Parliament, we have succeeded in repairing some of that damage, but it was always going to be difficult to recover from what was an extremely difficult vote in Ecofin last year. While we have taken some steps forward, we have also taken some steps back. To that extent, ISD-2 is a missed opportunity. I fully supported the Commission's proposal to abolish concentration rules, but to a significant degree that attempt has been undermined by what has now been agreed on Article 27. It is a great relief that the threat of companies being required to quote for millions of euros' worth of shares has been averted. The move to standard market size from block size is very welcome and there are other important clarifications, for example, allowing firms better protection against multiple hits.</p>
<p class="contents">But I still do not believe that we have got the best balance in terms of liquidity and competition. My aspiration was to produce a text which had effective transparency requirements and ensured good price formation without imposing regulatory burdens which were so heavy as to produce a concentration rule by the back door, and to damage liquidity provision.</p>
<p class="contents">I will support the presidency package but I do not think it has got the balance right. The text still covers too many firms and too much business within the definition of systematic internaliser, possibly jeopardising a range of over-the-counter and traditional wholesale trading. It still leaves firms with significant regulatory burdens if they wish to compete with exchanges, and it is ironic that this piece of legislation is actively forcing firms to take on trading risk which the Basel II framework is telling them to limit. Article 27 will in many ways make it more difficult for firms to compete with exchanges, which means that sadly investors will not get all the benefits of a wide range of choice of services and reduced transaction costs that would come with a fully competitive market. I am sorry that we had such resistance to more competition from certain members of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that this directive is implemented in a sensible way, both by the Commission, by CESR – 'Caesar' – and by the regulatory authorities in each country. If it is regulated in a sensible way, it will yield dividends in terms of increased competition. I would appeal to the Commission to ensure that it is implemented sensibly because that is the only way we will achieve real gains in terms of competition and liquidity for investors across Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the compromise proposal that has now been arrived at for consideration at first reading is a good one, and that, as a whole, it deals well with the basic objections that this House expressed to the Commission’s original proposal. We in this House have succeeded in avoiding a whole range of rules that would – if I may say so – have been superfluous and costly. Let me give as just one example the requirement for quarterly reporting, which would – as Mr Skinner said – have cost businesses a great deal, while yielding little. This directive is, after all, meant to prevent things happening in the way they did with Parmalat, Enron, WorldCom and other companies, all of which duly filed quarterly reports, and we can see what the end result was – so let us not burden business with unproductive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market attached significance to coherence and conformity with the directive on electronic commercial registers, in which we incorporated an option clause on publication media, enabling the Member States, depending on their own traditions, to make provision for the publication of required information in media other than the Internet. We have managed to get this rule incorporated in this directive too, thus, I believe, ensuring that two directives with similar subject-matter can – as we believe is essential – be handled in the same way by the legislators in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is satisfied with the solution that has been found to the question of debt securities. What came out of the deliberations in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs tended to make us rather concerned that we could be put at a disadvantage in negotiations with the Americans when it comes to implementing IAS. I believe that the rule that has now been devised on limiting ‘grandfathering’, avoids that, and that our negotiating position is no worse; we are simply making it more difficult for those who are already in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">All things considered, I am happy with this outcome and thank my fellow rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs most warmly for their cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The second thing I want to say is that both directives are triumphs for this House and for the parliamentary codecision procedure. Thirdly, both directives, as they stand at present, have made substantial changes to the Commission draft and to the Common Position and have brought them more into line with this House’s point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the transparency directive, reference has already been made to the fact that the mandatory introduction of quarterly reports, as proposed by the Commission, for companies listed on EU stock exchanges is now off the agenda, and quite rightly too. The transparency requirements in the case of loans have been vastly improved. The wording on the publication of company information that has now been agreed on ensures that Member States can require their own companies to publish information in printed form. The requirement that information be disseminated simultaneously has been done away with.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing I can say about the investment services directive is that I would have been happier if Article 27 had specified a minimum account size, or if Recital 49 had been deleted, but it is important that the report has enabled us to steer a middle course between the various national interests, the European interests of the internal market, and our egoisms, and on that I warmly congratulate Mrs Villiers, the rapporteur. Thanks to her, three states that are highly important to the financial market – the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden – are now on board, although they did not initially endorse the Common Position, and participants in the market can now avail themselves of a better directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a matter with huge technical and political difficulties and, without her tremendous diligence, I doubt that we could have reached a conclusion. That is why I should like to congratulate her on all her hard work.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we are arriving today at a final conclusion represents an achievement by Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and demonstrates that delays in legislation, when they occur, are not due to Parliament’s negligence. The purpose of the directive on investment services, about which, as shadow rapporteur, I should like to say more, is to revive the European passport for businesses in the financial sector. Of course, the European passport is not a new institution, but it had languished due to the difficulties created by the differences in the national legislation of the Member States in the cross-border activities of companies and, by extension of course, in the free movement of capital in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The new directive proposes measures for homogenous and harmonised protection of investors, especially small investors, in the various Member States. It also proposes terms of equal competition between the stock exchanges and investment companies. This issue is one of the most thorny and complicated we have to address, because we face new phenomena on the market here, with entire stock exchanges being converted to private companies and entire private companies operating as sort of mini-stock exchanges and clearing huge numbers of transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have reached a compromise on this very difficult issue which, like all compromises, is not to everyone’s absolute satisfaction, but it was necessary in order for us to move forward. Implementation and experience will certainly bring problems and shortcomings to light and in a few years’ time I am certain that we shall need a new directive which, one hopes, will be another step towards combating national barriers and creating the truly pan-European capital market needed in order to develop the European economy. This is also in keeping with the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists supports the agreement reached with the Council on the directive on investment services and, of course, it also supports the report on the harmonisation of transparency requirements for financial services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also thank Commissioner Bolkestein for these two important parts of the financial services action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">We can now create a common financial market within the EU. That is incredibly important and, just as Mr Katiforis says, it provides the opportunity for economic growth, continued competition and more job opportunities in line with the Lisbon process, which is proving far too slow. If we are to be able to achieve our objectives, it is important for investors and consumers to be able to rely upon the financial markets and their players. People have lost confidence in them because there have, unfortunately, been many scandals in recent years. We must therefore create credible regulations that are neither too ponderous and bureaucratic nor, however, too lightweight.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the directive on investment services and regulated markets is concerned, the rapporteur has done some exceptional work. I think that Mrs Villiers has shown a special ability to achieve reasonable and understandable compromises. I should like to say that she has been a very good European. It is the view of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party that the committee’s amendments do a good job of balancing the requirements of investor choice and investor protection, as well as creating rules for soundly operating financial markets within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that Mr Huhne and I might have gone further, but we can live with the compromises. They provide the opportunity for continued competition between different trade centres. The amendments also mean the disappearance of what are termed the concentration rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a few words about Mr Skinner’s report. I myself have had difficulty with the committee’s wanting to delete the Commission’s proposals concerning mandatory quarterly reporting. Those countries that have introduced such reporting think that it operates well. That is also the view of the Stockholm stock exchange. One market player I talked with considered that those who could not account for their companies’ results and give their views on their companies’ futures each quarter had no place on the stock exchange. Now, there is a sensible compromise which, at a pinch, can be lived with: half-yearly reporting with a possible review of the directive within five years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not turn my nose up but all the same I want to say that we are agreeing to a change without being too sure where it will lead us.</p>
<p class="contents">Removing the order concentration rule from the areas in which it still exists means allowing competition between three systems. Will the conditions for competition be fair? It is clear that companies established in the City, and mainly US companies, have done a lot to promote their own interests. The risk is that they will capture a major share of the European market, to the detriment of other actors, and that they will thus exercise significant control over the financial resources of the various Member States of the Union. The Council and the Commissioner have, however, ensured a degree of balance and have not exempted companies from the transparency obligations. They can still avoid these obligations if transactions involve above-average amounts. I am told that small countries and even some large countries are still controlling the national market share, but I doubt that this division will be viable and we do not know what strategies the various actors, including the stock markets, will adopt. Are the conditions of general interest well established? Can we deter the abuse and insider trading that internationalisation allows to flourish or, in any event, <span class="italic">can</span> allow to flourish and can we ensure a high-quality price formation process? This appears unlikely. For example, the volume of above-average transactions that will be exempt from pre-trade transparency requirements might account for 50% of the total for the most liquid shares on the Paris stock exchange.</p>
<p class="contents">Our successors will thus have to supervise the implementation of a directive that is essential and complex but which lacks clear balance. We would advise them to be as vigilant as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the directive on the transparency obligations, we have ended up with an overall compromise that is the result of good work. I will, nonetheless, state some reservations. What is most positive is clearly the rejection of the obligation to provide quarterly accounts. Equally positive is the fact that the law of the country of origin will not apply as far as of issuer liability is concerned. On the contrary, our demands concerning complete information about the size of a company’s finances and about the social and economic impact, were rejected by the Council and postponed until a later directive, as were, furthermore, our demands concerning information on the remuneration of company directors. I believe that this is a mistake. The most serious issue, however – and this is neither the fault of the rapporteur nor of the directive – is that the quality of information essentially depends on accounting standards and that the situation in this area is extremely serious. When the European institutions gave full power to the International Account Standards board and gave a commitment to apply these rules as of 2005, I think that they made a very serious mistake. Estimating the basic value of companies, banks and insurance companies mainly according to the market price – deemed to be ‘fair value’ in the prevailing climate – is a source of bias and fundamental insecurity. I therefore suggest that we act very firmly against any illegitimate compromise on Rules 39 and 42 and that the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (Efrag) and its resources are strengthened as a matter of urgency and, if necessary, the 2005 deadline is put back. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over and above the collective relief that we feel, however, some of my fellow Members and I would like to continue to ask questions about the Investment Services Directive. This is a system, the impact of which few of us have assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are legislating for tomorrow, with the aim of avoiding financial difficulties and imbalances, and in the hope that the system that we implement will provide the best means of ensuring the financing of our economies as a whole, and not just of the financial sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask myself the question: do we finally have a compromise that will allow for the solid and transparent harmonisation of our financial markets? Have we really given ourselves the means to avoid the shocks and scandals that we hope to avoid on the European stock markets in order to allow our economy to safeguard everyone’s interests? We are opening up the monopoly of the regulated markets and we can hope that this new competition will provide access to cheaper products and will lead to more liquid markets and, therefore, to the best use being made of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The original compromise, the only one to work – which consisted of opening everything to the market whilst guaranteeing the smooth functioning of the market through greater transparency – was not fully observed and that was the aim of the discussion has taken place to date.</p>
<p class="contents">We have known for a long time that the markets need the best possible financial information in order to function, so that there is optimum price formation and so that actors have access to the same indicators, if we want decisions to be rational. From this point of view, I regret the fact that our Parliament has not been able, in conjunction with the Council, of going further in defining the size of the market and that we allowed, on this issue too, a key point in negotiation and which provided balance in the text to be left to our experts and for the next stage of the regulatory process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The compromise proposal, as adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, creates, in my view, another problem. Indeed, the amendment refers to officially designated mechanisms for the central storage of regulated information. Needless to say, I have nothing against a central storage facility for price-sensitive information, but I wonder whether such facilities should be officially designated on a national basis. In my opinion, this will open the floodgates to creating, or retaining, monopolies in the field of the dissemination of information. As I see it, the forming of monopolies is completely at odds with the directive's objective, particularly the removal of national barriers in terms of transparency requirements and the improvement of efficiency, openness and integrity of the European capital market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For a start, I am glad that the acceptance of the directives in this form means that two directives that are significant in terms of the Financial Services Action Plan have been adopted before this Parliament has run its course. It is important that we have managed, in the life of this Parliament, before the elections, and before enlargement, to lay the foundation stone of an integrated financial market that will add to Europe’s appeal, all the more so in comparison with the US.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I am glad that we have got this far, primarily largely thanks to Parliament, along with the Commission. The compromises and guidelines arrived at by Parliament at first reading demonstrated the goodwill of everyone concerned, among whom I would particularly single out Mrs Villiers, who succeeded, by means of a dialogue that disregarded party and national divisions, in finding a way forward that ended up being acceptable to the Member States. I regret the way in which the Member States repeatedly showed, right to the end, how little they are willing and able to pursue a shared objective. One of the things the investment services directive is about is more competition between the systems, which differ within the EU. This is about more competition, along with transparency, pricing, and protection for consumers. If we are to build Europe, the Heads of State or Government must come to realise that this cannot be a matter of one system prevailing over another. On one side there are the big investment banks; on the other, the smaller banks, the savings banks and cooperative banks. I think we in this House have done a good job, both in terms of its substance and of the time it has taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say something brief about the transparency directive, namely that I am glad – although I take a rather different line from the Commission on this – that we have not got the rules on quarterly reporting that had been proposed, which I believe would have added little value in relation to the extra effort and additional bureaucracy. I therefore believe that adopting these two directives this week, and within the life of this Parliament, will add up to a good piece of work on our part for Europe as a financial marketplace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am talking mainly about the Transparency Directive and the criticism concerning mandatory quarterly reporting. Whilst I can settle for the compromise that is now before us, what I do regret is that reports are not subject to more requirements in terms of content. I have made three proposals to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The first had to do with the provision of information about management salaries and bonuses in annual reports. The Commission has meanwhile announced that it intends to table a separate proposal on this, so that was a successful action.</p>
<p class="contents">The second was about the reporting of payments to governments, specifically by extractive industries. This was the wish of NGOs – like the publish-what-you-pay-campaign – as well as the well-intentioned elements among those companies themselves. These companies are happy to abide by an obligation and, as a consequence, competitors that do not yet report these payments or bribes on a voluntary basis would no longer be able to engage in unfair competition. A recommendation to that effect has now been included in a recital to the directive. That is a partial success that deserves to be followed up.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point was the reporting, in a verifiable and readily understood format, of what companies claim to do by way of socially responsible business management. Unfortunately, this point has not yet been included in the text, but I would nevertheless like to bring it to your attention once again. This is not, therefore, about forcing companies to do business in a socially responsible manner, but the moment a company boasts about all the good things it does, that should appear transparently and clearly in a verified report, as happens with financial conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">I am reasonably satisfied with the ISD Directive. From the outset, I have attempted to build a bridge between the opposing views and interests, and have used my own touchstone in the process. In-house matching by large banks, which breaks the monopoly of the stock exchange, is, from my vantage point, positive and can, under the conditions that we are now stipulating in the compromise, offer additional opportunities for investors and for entrepreneurs who need capital. The compromise has become neither a purely English City directive nor a stock exchange directive, which, on account of the theoretical abolition of the concentration rule would nevertheless lead to a <span class="italic">de facto</span> monopoly of the stock exchange. This middle way has resulted in the proposals I tabled at first reading being adopted. I think that with regard to supervision, additional provisions by the Council have been included, which I also welcome. In that respect too, therefore, this directive has been given the green light. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As our rapporteur has rightly said, this compromise has failed to achieve its basic aim. Specifically, the directive should set down Community rules applicable in all the Member States, in order to create equal conditions for the various actors and to allow banks and other financial institutions to enter into competition with stock markets and offer their customers the ability to internalise. As you know, France, Italy, Spain and Belgium do not currently authorise these sales outside of stock markets. The factor that brought France and Italy around to the common position was that financial institutions have to make their quotes public before the transaction and must keep to a fixed price. As you know, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden and Finland rejected this common position. I would also like to state that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs rejected it, by adopting Mrs Villiers’ report in February. At least the compromise reached continues to partially respect Parliament’s opinion by limiting the price transparency obligation to sales of securities that are smaller in volume than the standard market size.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, the compromise that has been submitted to us is a poor compromise, but, with a heavy heart, I will nevertheless vote in favour of it for two reasons. Firstly, because of the risk of going back to the common position – which is even worse and would damage the financial sector even more – and, secondly, to avoid having to go into conciliation with a new Parliament that is less well-informed in this field. In particular, I deplore the position of the socialists and above all of their coordinator, Mr Goebbels, who have done nothing to ensure that the position championed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is adopted at second reading, when this would have been much more beneficial for consumers and for investment firms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ettl (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, the proposal for a directive on transparency requirements is a very important part of the Financial Services Action Plan and is meant to harmonise the transparency requirements for securities and for those who issue them. In implementing the directive, not only the Commission, but also, of course, the national supervisors, will have a major role. If we are to have an internal market, the information on offer to purchasers of securities must be comparable and reliable, and issuers of securities must not be put at any disadvantage. We must therefore be guided by the principles enumerated in Recital 26a.</p>
<p class="contents">A well-developed capital market needs credibility, which itself demands an increasing degree of transparency, all of which, taken together, enable national economies to compete better. It is no coincidence that those Member States that have high levels of share capitalisation, and whose stock exchanges enjoy high levels of turnover in relation to the gross national product, also enjoy more growth and have less unemployment. So it is that in Finland and the Netherlands – as you, Commissioner, know better than any of us – stock exchange turnover has multiplied since 1995; ten times over in one and six times over in the other. A study recently published in Austria demonstrates that there is also a significant positive correlation between share capitalisation and stock trading on the one hand and, on the other, the amount spent in a national economy on research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">In all these complex economic interactions, confidence and information play a major role. In Austria, for example, the stock exchange legislation requires the most important companies, which are quoted on the Stock Exchange, to report on a quarterly basis, and so it is possible and practical, given the current state of the internal market, for there to be an upgrading to quarterly reporting at national level without any further obligations being imposed.

It is also meant to promote investment in Europe’s financial markets. I support it insofar as it aims to do these things, but it has been necessary, on a number of occasions, to adjust its course. Most of my amendments were accepted, and Mr Skinner was amenable to compromise, so we were able to improve the Commission draft at crucial points. One of them, to take an example, was Article 6, which dealt with quarterly reports. If they are to function properly, financial markets need reliable information on companies, but what investors value is the quality of the information rather than the frequency with which it is supplied. Neither in terms of costs nor of resources are small- and medium-sized enterprises able to cope with quarterly reporting. I am pleased to say that we have together been able to delete Article 6.</p>
<p class="contents">A second example is the medium whereby issuers disseminate information. In Article 17, the Commission insisted that company information should be published only on the Internet and that notifications should be sent out only by email. We can see from the example of this House how we are constantly deluged with emails, and the appalling amount of junk data that we have; are investors supposed to work their way through that sort of thing in order to get at the quality information? I think it would be utterly impossible. We have improved matters by including print media, which are the form of publication used by companies quoted on stock exchanges. Not only have we been able to ensure the inclusion of such print media in Article 17, but we have also succeeded in deleting the clause that imposed exclusive use of the Internet. I am glad that we have been able to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Skinner’s report is a balanced one and we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs quite rightly adopted it by a large majority. I have advised my group, that of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to give it overall support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was also possible to achieve this result thanks to the valuable work carried out by the rapporteur Mrs Villiers, who has already been praised by Members, and who was capable of listening to different points of view and drawing up a solution that was sound and could be agreed upon.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, negotiations with the Council were difficult at times but I believe that the compromise, on which we will be called upon to vote tomorrow, includes the important requests – or at least some of them – that were put forward by Parliament. The compromise succeeded in taking account of the procedures, characteristics and individual practices of the economic and financial systems in the different Member States – I am thinking, for example, about the case of Italy – without, however, making excessive concessions to the protectionist allures of some of the systems or to those who would have wanted to see a single model implemented. The solution upon which we will vote tomorrow will, moreover, offer new possibilities to investors in those countries that had, instead, opted for the market concentration rule.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of competition between trading systems, which should offer alternatives to regulated markets, was readily agreed to. The liberalisation of trading activities on listed financial instruments and the promotion of greater operational decentralisation will reduce the obstacles to entry for service and trading providers, which will lead to a reduction of the operational costs and an improvement in the quality of services. Competition will, therefore, encourage innovation and efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Madam President, I announce that the radical Members of the Lista Bonino will vote in favour of this compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I should like to reassure Mrs Villiers on one point: I can confirm that the new Article 19 will allow the execution-only business to go on under conditions that will now be harmonised at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs van den Berg mentioned two points. In agreement with her, I should like to say that the compromise acknowledges that investors must be provided with better information on executive remuneration. The topic is currently under review, as Mrs van den Berg quite rightly said, in the context of the action plan on modernising company law and enhancing corporate governance, an action plan dated 21 May 2003. I think Mrs van den Berg would agree with that. In addition, a push will be given to the movement that favours more transparency on what the extractive industries pay to governments. Whilst maintaining a voluntary approach, the compromise gives a clear signal to Member States to encourage more transparency from issuers in their annual reports and within the framework of current international initiatives, such as those taken by the World Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to a point raised by Mr Mann and Mr Skinner concerning the way in which information should be disseminated in Europe. A reasonable compromise has been found. The compromise is neutral as regards the use of any technology, thus neither excluding newspapers nor electronic means. Furthermore, it would be made clear in a recital that a home Member State may always request publication of regulated information via newspapers, in addition to other measures of dissemination.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come back to a matter raised again by Mrs Villiers, and also Mrs Berès who, unfortunately, has left the Chamber. In reply I should like to say that, obviously, during the implementation of the ISD the Commission will make every effort to find a balanced solution. To that end, CESR, the Member States and parliaments will be fully associated.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the whole process of adopting implementing rules will be fully transparent. All market participants will have the opportunity to make known their views.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would regret it very much if Mrs Lulling were to vote in favour <span class="italic">avec la mort dans l'âme.</span> After all, we cannot really allow that, so I hope that she will reconsider and will vote <span class="italic">avec une certaine joie dans l'âme</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
