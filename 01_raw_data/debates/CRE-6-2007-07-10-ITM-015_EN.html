<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Willi Piecyk (PSE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in its maritime policy the European Parliament is entering uncharted waters. Five committees worked on the report, and achieved respectable results. I would like to begin by extending my heartfelt thanks to my co-rapporteurs MrHassi, Mr Stevenson, Mr Chatzimarkakis and Mr Matsis for their collaboration. My thanks also to the members of my staff, Mrs Jordan and Mrs Schramm – as well as the stagaire Jan, who did some good research work – for without staff this report would have been practically impossible to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let us just get an idea of the position as regards maritime policy: 90% of the European Union’s external and 40% of its internal trade is carried by sea. 40% of Europe’s GDP is generated in coastal areas. About two-thirds of all Europeans prefer holidaying by the sea, and coastal tourism in 2004 earned EUR 72 billion in revenue. But coastal tourism presupposes clean seas. This makes it clear that it is necessary – indeed, it is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> – that the EU not only formulate, but implement an integrated maritime policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to the Commission’s great credit that with this Green Paper it has brought maritime policy on to the European agenda. However, the paper is frequently vague and descriptive, rather than specific. After a year of consultations, what we need is fewer conferences and more measures, more concrete political actions, as Goethe said, ‘A truce to words, mere empty sound, let deeds at length appear, my friends!</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, if tomorrow we approve the report, the Commission – and of course the Member States – will have plenty of work on their hands. My staff have done the calculations: the draft report contains 80 recommendations for the Commission and the Council. If we draw these together broadly, there will still be 33 bundles of measures which we expect the Council and the Commission to implement in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I would like to focus on a few important areas, such as shipping. We expect the Council to approve seven legislative measures on maritime safety without delay: state port inspections, emergency moorings, liability after accidents, amongst others – and these are addressed to the Portuguese Presidency alone. There is a peculiar anachronism in that Europe still views short-haul voyages as international trade. For this reason, coasting must finally be integrated into the single market. On the issue of motorways of the sea, since the adoption of the trans-European networks in 2004, we have not made an inch of progress. The Commission must appoint a coordinator for this to finally get things moving.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating climate change: although marine transport is comparatively the most eco-friendly means of transport, it is not squeaky clean: it contributes to 4% of world CO2 emissions, and also produces large quantities of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. I am certain that emissions trading in shipping is something we will have to face up to. An even more important issue, though, is to drastically reduce marine emissions and at the same time to use renewable energy like wind and solar power on vessels. This also provides European shipbuilding and its suppliers with huge potential for growth. And, by far not least important, LeaderSHIP 2015 is about the future competitiveness of the entire industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Maritime climate policy also involves our, wherever possible, providing vessels in port with power from the land, which also involves implementing the Commission’s long overdue action plan on promoting offshore wind energy.</p>
<p class="contents">And on the matter of employment: if the maritime sector complains that young people are unwilling to embark on maritime careers, we should ask ourselves, how actively were these careers promoted in the past? For this reason we need an education campaign. It is also right and proper, though, that those employed on vessels should not be second-class employees.</p>
<p class="contents">About marine pollution: 100% of waste from vessels must be removed in port. Illegal discharges of oil must be combated. At the same time, however, because 80% of marine pollution is caused by waste originating on land, we need a concrete action plan form the Commission to provide aid for this.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of marine research: in the European Union we have excellent institutes, but they are not linked with each other. For this reason we need a blanket organisation, a European marine science consortium, with strong backing from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, far be it from me to moralise, but it is an indisputable fact that the sea does not need us, but we need it. And this being the case, we need a good, integrated European marine policy. For that reason we will measure every Council Presidency by the progress it makes in marine policy.</p>

<p class="contents">Today, two years after our work started and one year since the launch of the Green Paper, we are no longer only talking of what is possible. We are talking of what can become a reality. On 30 June we ended the consultation process. Thousands of stakeholders throughout Europe have taken an active part in the process expressing overwhelming support for this project. Parliament has been very active in the run-up to this debate. Let me express my thanks and appreciation at the outset to the rapporteur, Willi Piecyk, for having coordinated the keen interest of the various committees and having produced this impressive report. I would also like to thank the rapporteurs of the various active committees for their invaluable input as well as the other MEPs who were particularly supportive of the maritime policy project. We are especially happy with the holistic cross-sectoral nature of the opinion of Parliament. The common understanding reflected in the report is a good basis for the future functioning of a holistic and integrated maritime policy for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The contents of the report are indeed impressively vast and we are grateful for such a substantial number of suggestions. We welcome the fact that Parliament points out that in the area of maritime affairs, speedy progress must be made on the legislative proposals which are now before the Council and which relate both to the safety of maritime transport and to the protection and preservation of the marine environment. The goals of our future maritime policy will indeed need to see a proper implementation of this legislation by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 2008 preliminary draft budget the Commission has also asked for credits to undertake preparatory actions which aim to start implementing of some actions foreseen under the new maritime policy and we hope that Parliament will support these requests.</p>
<p class="contents">We are prepared in particular to work in areas such as the integration of surveillance systems for activities on the sea, the setting-up of a network on data relating to the seas and oceans and on the exchange of best practices in maritime industries and services through the promotion of maritime clusters in 2008. We are convinced that such projects will yield substantial benefits in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to some specific elements raised in the report, let me make some general comments. The Commission welcomes the call by Parliament to ensure that the environmental dimension is clearly reflected in the proposals we will be making in October and is committed to paying particular attention to climate change. In this regard the Commission is analysing the contributions of all stakeholders which deal with emissions trading and shipping, renewable forms of energy such as wind and solar power for ships, land-based power supply for ships in ports, offshore wind energy, ship dismantling and others. All these will have a positive contribution to make with respect to climate change and broader environmental considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said on many occasions, the marine environmental protection strategy remains at the core of the maritime policy and constitutes its environmental pillar. They will mutually reinforce one another.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also welcomes the recognition underlined in the report of the importance of maritime transport to the European economy. Efforts at simplification and better regulation remain a top priority for the Commission. Maritime transport presents one of the least environmentally damaging modes of transport. Bearing this in mind, efforts should be stepped up to improve the track record even further.</p>
<p class="contents">Maritime transport is also important beyond reasons of sustainability as it contributes to further the integration of our common internal market and is crucial for Europe’s external trade in this era of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic importance of the maritime sectors for the European Union and the success of a number of national and regional clusters are well known. The concertation on EU maritime policy has demonstrated a keen interest of all those involved to strengthen and encourage the development of maritime clusters across the European Union. The Commission has committed itself to promoting best practice and interlinkages for maritime clusters in both national and regional contexts through mapping Europe’s maritime clusters and analysing their potential cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the points raised in the report on research and innovation, the Commission believes that excellence in maritime research and technology is essential to develop the vast potential of sea resources in a sustainable manner. It will constitute a fundamental basis to achieve integration and to enhance synergies in the different maritime sectors. This is why marine research and technology was recognised as a cross-cutting priority in the Seventh Research Framework Programme that will be addressed with particular attention.</p>
<p class="contents">We recognise the importance of tourism as a driver for sustainable growth in coastal and maritime areas. At the same time, coastal and maritime tourism can be used as a tool to foster the preservation of cultural, historical and environmental features of our maritime space.</p>
<p class="contents">A communication is planned for 2007 and it will set out an agenda for a sustainable and competitive European tourism. It will be based on the report that collected the reactions of all European tourist stakeholders and will point to possible new initiatives at EU level, including on coastal and maritime tourism, which could usefully complement Member States’ initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the positive attitude of the report towards the need to ensure sustainability in the field of fisheries. We have taken a number of initiatives in order to increase the number of marine protected areas and to develop policies in favour of longer-term approaches to fisheries management.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission has already made proposals for the progressive elimination of discards. Within the context of the October package, the Commission will also adopt proposals aimed at combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries and measures on destructive fishing practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to social aspects, let me say that we fully share the concerns of Parliament regarding the scarcity of experts and well-trained professionals facing the maritime industry and will look with great interest at the suggestions made in the report for specialised training courses aimed at providing a broad understanding of the ecosystem-based approach to sea and oceans management.</p>
<p class="contents">We also share Parliament’s opinion that the exclusion of seafarers from social directives should be reviewed. With regard to social rules for seafarers, let me underline the importance of the ongoing work between the social partners on integrating the consolidated ILO Convention on Working Conditions for Seafarers into Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point concerning governance: it is clear from our consultations with Member States and stakeholders that closer coordination between all sectoral policies and all levels of governance is required if we are to make a success of maritime policy. I therefore find the position of Parliament on this issue both timely and relevant. In addition, we recognise that the exchange and stimulation of best practice in integrated maritime policy making needs to be backed by platforms that support the exchange of experience and information on best practice. To this end, we intend to organise annual conferences which will bring together relevant actors from regions, Member States and at EU level, including stakeholders in all relevant areas. This exercise will also contribute to raising the visibility of the maritime sectors in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, in order to build on the momentum gained during the consultation process, we aim to put forward an ambitious maritime policy package on 10 October and present it for further consultation with Parliament and the Council. The package will translate the vision of a new EU maritime policy into reality. It will include a communication on the consultation process that will show how broad and extensive it has been and that will highlight the close and constructive engagement we have had with our interlocutors, and a second communication that will propose a European maritime policy and action plan. The policy will focus on Europe’s maritime reality, on the importance of an integrated approach to maritime affairs and on our vision for the policy and its principles. It will aim to promote and develop the sustainable use of the oceans and seas, delivering a high quality of life across the regions, providing transparency and raising the visibility of maritime Europe, strengthening Europe’s maritime international leadership role and, last but not least, reaching for Europe’s full knowledge and innovation potential in maritime affairs. The action plan will indicate our intention as regards how to implement a maritime policy through the identification of the actions and the subjects for a proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, may I once again congratulate Parliament and the rapporteurs concerned for their excellent work. We look forward to continuing our close dialogue with you in the months ahead in the interest of laying the foundations for a more integrated European maritime policy for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important for us to realise that economic exploitation of the sea also relies on the sea being clean and the existence of healthy marine ecosystems. For that reason it is important to integrate the environmental viewpoint with all decisions taken on the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the short-sighted practice of overfishing has resulted in the collapse of many fish stocks, and it is also the main reason why marine biodiversity has declined. Fish stocks cannot recover unless the amount of pollution into the sea from the land and the volume of industrial chemicals and agricultural fertilisers, which cause eutrophication, are cut. This is especially important in enclosed areas of sea like the Baltic. As the rapporteur said, it is also important to reduce emissions from shipping, as that is one of the main sources of emissions which are contaminating the air we breathe.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change too means more than just rising sea levels: it also means acidification of the sea, which will have a drastic impact on all marine ecosystems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Never before have I experienced such excellent cooperation, and I congratulate him on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commission for producing this report and for its integrated approach. It is high time. As Europeans – and this I say from the perspective of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – we have a lot to offer in the field of marine policy. We are market leaders in the maritime clusters, we top the world league with our shipyards, 40% of merchant fleets are in European hands, and around 35% of marine equipment is supplied from the EU. Another thing we are good at is research. Blue biotechnology is a technology of the future for obtaining energy from the sea, and the outlook for reducing CO2 emissions is also good.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately we do not speak with one voice. It is therefore good that we have made this start. The package that you want to finalise, Commissioner, is something we are expecting with great anticipation. The world is watching us because it expects something from us.

What the Fisheries Committee set out to do was to produce a maritime strategy designed to develop protection, enhance our marine heritage and encourage the sustainable exploitation of our seas and oceans, but I think – to repeat what the Commissioner said – without effectively tackling the fundamental causes of climate change now, the whole EU maritime policy could be rendered worthless.</p>
<p class="contents">A sustainable fishing industry helps to meet this criterion and thus if fishing does not take its rightful place at the core of the EU’s maritime strategy then these needs will be met by products caught by people using methods and in places over which we have no control at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of this streamlining of management cannot be understated. This would bring benefits to everybody and to the environment as a whole. The ‘polluter pays’ principle is currently a rule which is not adhered to in the EU maritime sector. Companies who pollute the sea should contribute to an EU-wide fund geared toward fisheries restocking and environmental conservation.</p>
<p class="contents">The fisheries report also points out the significance of improving the image of the fisheries sector, calling for more resources devoted to research and education aimed at improving knowledge and skills.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the Commission that the network of marine protected areas across EU waters should be extended and a system of integrated coastal zone management set up to ensure that we put a stop to the wanton degradation of habitats and sharp decline in biodiversity which have been all too commonplace in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to the action plan in the autumn from the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has known how to listen, how to reconcile differing points of view and, above all, how to uphold an holistic, constructive vision of maritime strategy. That is also the vision that I have upheld as the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes to show that, with a balanced approach, it is possible to develop the economy and safeguard the environment, and that a fragmented view of the seas and oceans has neither reach nor ambition. The sea, which is the site of globalisation <span class="italic">par excellence</span>, is of pivotal importance for us Europeans. Since the growth of world trade will lead to increased maritime transport and the consequent development of several sea-based economies, it is to our advantage to think on a European scale, but in our view that does not mean a single common policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is a strategic approach that takes advantage of the potential for cooperation among the 27 Member States. Such cooperation must take account of the costs of combating illegal immigration, pollution, drug trafficking and smuggling and of the struggle to keep Europe’s territory secure. It must be intelligent cooperation that will benefit the marine environment, in the interests both of environmentalists and of those who put the economy first.</p>
<p class="contents">Pollution is a threat to nature, but it is equally a danger to the economic benefits that we can draw from the seas and oceans. Balance must therefore be the keyword, and not the extremist attitude that prevents economic development or the unbridled exploitation that destroys resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus it is essential that we should see the potential of the seas and oceans within a context of investment in research and development, while also preserving traditions. If we want to modernise our economy, we have to fund networks of scientists, promote knowledge sharing, lead the way with new economies and new industries, and also invest heavily in the tourist potential of Europe’s coastline, which is an asset of incomparable richness and diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Madam President, I hope that from tomorrow we shall be able to sail a true course towards drawing up and implementing worthwhile proposals concerning Europe’s maritime policy; indeed, we have already heard Commissioner Borg express such an intention here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must also point out six fundamental concerns that must be taken into account when the European maritime policy is put into practice: current and future legislation must be integrated into a single framework; management must also be integrated within the context of maritime planning, with all existing interests being taken into consideration; the sea must be incorporated into existing environmental legislation, complying specifically with international conventions, such as the OSPAR Convention; marine ecosystems-based management must be put into practice; the development of fishing communities must be promoted through the same approach that has been successfully used in rural areas; and an integrated framework must be created for monitoring and implementing maritime legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European maritime policy must not repeat the errors of the common fisheries policy, which created a dysfunction between the intention of the policies and their beneficiaries on the one hand, and the costs of implementing and monitoring them on the other. In a region such as the Azores, the cost of implementing the Marine Strategy Directive, for example, amounts to many million euro. In our opinion, Europe’s actions in this field must be integrated from a financial point of view as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Furthermore, three-quarters of the Earth’s surface is covered with the water of our seas and oceans and there is a constant cycle of transfers of water from the oceans to the atmosphere, from the atmosphere to the Earth, and finally it returns to the sea via the rivers. We therefore have a duty to pay the greatest possible attention to the sustainability of the marine environment, particularly given that for some time alarm bells have been ringing throughout the world with regard to the deterioration of the environment, in general, and climate change in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that in all institutions — both Community institutions and State, regional and local institutions — and also in the private field, measures that improve water quality must be adopted quickly. In this regard, we wish to express our concern at the long timetable that appears in the proposal for a directive on a marine strategy. We believe that, just like when we talk about atmospheric pollution and the hole in the ozone layer, we do not have much time left to act and reverse the current trend. Unless we do so as soon as possible, I fear that the damage will be irreversible.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore proposed that the timetable for drawing up the action plans within the new marine strategy be adapted urgently, bringing them into line with other important Union programmes, such as those funded by FEDER, the Cohesion Fund and also the agricultural policy, since there are also agricultural activities that lead to waste being dumped in the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that we need more accurate information concerning what happens in the seas and oceans. We are in favour of better coordination and connection amongst all of the European marine research institutes, promoting either a network or a European consortium and creating a maritime database that is accessible to all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">We must improve training and information at all levels and disseminate best practices in relation to control and pollution. With regard to this aspect, I would insist once again on something that I have been saying for years, which is that we need to make it obligatory to install devices in ships – devices that have already been invented – for controlling the emptying and cleaning of tanks and bilge, in the form of black boxes that cannot be tampered with, which will be the best method for preventing deliberate dumping, though I still believe that this must be complemented with satellite monitoring and inspection.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget about the professional fishermen, who represent a significant group of the population whose way of life must be safeguarded for the future, preventing coastal and island areas from becoming depopulated or invaded by uncontrolled development.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we propose that the ‘polluter pays’ principle also be applied to the marine sector and that a Community fund be created for the repopulation and conservation of marine flora and fauna, based on contributions from all industrial, energy, tourist, leisure and all other kinds of activities that pollute our seas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Scotland is energy rich with oil and gas reserves and offshore wind and wave generation potential. Scotland is well placed to develop further maritime transport hub facilities. Scotland has excellent marine research facilities which can contribute to a better understanding of marine environment issues, and, in spite of the CFP, Scotland still has a high proportion of the EU’s fishing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of an EU maritime strategy is to be welcomed but it must not signal a shift towards EU waters being regarded as a common resource with no particular attachment to individual maritime nations.

<p class="contents">I should like to make a comment with regard to port development. It is important for ports to develop their assets within the prescribed preconditions, allowing them to make a vital contribution to the prosperity of citizens. As I see it, Europe should hold back when it comes to influencing this development, both spatially and economically. The Member States are responsible for shaping their ports, and the market will ensure the effective handling of cargo flows.

Excessive regulation, stifling controls and witless directives would, I fear, result. Indeed, even on fisheries, what I read in this report is a blueprint for driving more fishermen out of employment under the guise of even further restricting effort under a so-called ‘precautionary approach’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why the integrated approach of this Green Paper is so important. It should, however, be practical and workable, so that we do not overshoot the mark.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the rapporteur’s view that care for the environment and sustainability are important. Whilst I should also like to congratulate him on his report, I have to say that it was a very tough one on account of the procedure of closer cooperation. We have now ended up with an extensive document containing 147 paragraphs. What I think is relevant and regret is that the importance of maritime transport has, to some extent, become secondary to new measures, particularly given the fact that maritime transport is so important for the sake of sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">We already have a host of rules and regulations to provide for safety or environmentally friendly transport, but when it comes to the transposition and enforcement by the Member States, things are still in a very bad shape. I should really like to urge the Commission to turn the implementation and enforcement of existing legislation into a priority. The European Union should also have more coordinating powers and, if necessary, be able to enforce compliance. At the end of 2006, the Commission was supposed to produce a study into the feasibility of a European coastguard. It is now mid-2007, and we still have not seen anything yet, unfortunately. I should really like to urge the Commission to treat this with the necessary urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should call the Member States to account in respect of spatial planning and coastline management, provided, though, that the Member States in question bear their own responsibility for this. Local, regional and national politicians also feel responsible for the sustainability and safeguarding of these zones and, precisely where land is concerned, the principle of subsidiarity should apply in my view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the end it is a complete, balanced report which takes into account the economic, environmental and social dimension of this future maritime policy. As regards social matters, it underlines the importance of professional training and career prospects, as well as the pressing need for Member States to rapidly sign and ratify the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions relating to maritime employment. Such a requirement is vital if we do not want European expertise in this field to disappear. As for the rest, the ball is in the court of the Commission and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the latter, the reform of the European Union budget from 2008 should give them the opportunity to show that they take these issues seriously. As for the Commission, its task will be the coordination of this maritime policy. It is about a huge work site where the lack of any solid line could quickly lead to chaos. That is why I think that the idea of a Commissioner with responsibility for maritime policy, who has a sufficient mandate to arbitrate when necessary, deserves to be considered. Of course, solidity should not mean rigidity. Also, to give the flexibility necessary for the implementation of the initiatives that will be decided in the context of this future maritime policy I think that it would be appropriate for the regions to be closely associated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nowhere is the need for better teamwork between the EU, national governments and regional and local authorities clearer than specifically in the case of the Baltic Sea. We need a more closely coordinated strategy for saving the environment and fisheries and for obtaining sustainable and efficient development of maritime transport in constructive cooperation with land transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The Baltic Sea is one of the world’s most polluted seas, and the Commission should therefore develop its own EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region. With regard to the ports, we need, if we are to develop maritime transport, to put our faith in building and extending ports and port areas and in road and rail connections with the ports. The new EU strategy should therefore include a port strategy that gives ports the ability to develop in step with market development and demand.

<p class="contents">Marea Neagră şi Marea Mediterană reprezintă două zone de maximă importanţă pentru politica de vecinătate a Uniunii. Dezvoltarea portuară, comerţul, industria costieră, cercetarea, pescuitul şi turismul sunt elemente integrate atât politicii de vecinătate cât şi celei maritime. Reţelele de transport maritim, politicile regionale de mediu şi canalele de transport pentru resurse energetice sunt, de asemenea, incluse în planurile de acţiune ale ambelor politici.

<p class="contents">Politica maritimă trebuie să iniţieze şi să aplice măsuri în cadrul subiectelor menţionate pentru asigura o dezvoltare convergentă atât a statelor membre cât şi a statelor riverane incluse în politica de vecinătate. O politică maritimă europeană viabilă trebuie să asigure cooperarea între statele vecine şi între acestea şi Uniune, şi să aibă capacitatea de a dirija problematicele din cadrul structurilor regionale a căror activitate s-a dovedit utilă până în prezent.

<p class="contents">In my speech, I should just like to discuss two points very briefly. The first relates to energy, of which the sea is an infinite source. Wind energy should be given particular mention in this connection, as it has great potential, a potential that must be harnessed. How can it be harnessed? Europe needs powerful incentive systems to induce investors to take the risk of investing in offshore wind energy. Coordination is needed if we are to create these preconditions, which is why I explicitly welcome the report’s call for the Commission to present an action plan for the development of wind energy. This wind energy action plan will also enable us to meet the target, decided at the Spring Summit, of covering 20% of primary energy needs by renewable energy by 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the fact that the report provides for the installation of an intelligent network infrastructure. This will be the only way of meeting the target of 50 GW of installed offshore power by 2020 proposed in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns climate change and shipping. Climate change will have a considerable impact on the seas and oceans, and therefore waterborne modes of transport, too, must be included in emissions trading. The legislative procedure for including air transport is currently at first reading in Parliament. Given that shipping generates far more greenhouse-gas emissions than air transport, I support the rapporteur’s call for the inclusion of shipping in the emissions trading system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an extraordinary wealth for Europe – it has approximately 68 000 km of coastline in its territory, which is double what the United States has and three times what Russia has. In the past this dimension and the issues deriving from it have been disregarded. The drafting of the Green Paper represents a turning point in terms of building a new maritime policy based on this enormous asset, which has unique and unexplored possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context the Piecyk report – on which I congratulate my fellow Member – makes an important contribution: I particularly endorse the attention paid to environmental aspects. Our coastlines are, in fact, especially vulnerable areas, where the effect of climate change and intensive resource use is more evident. In view of this emergency, we need to adopt approaches based on protection and respect, to ensure that the sea can continue to be a resource for the people who live in coastal areas. In my view, the Piecyk report needs to be supplemented by further proposals, presented in the form of amendments, which clarify the scope of this important initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, a European policy for the sea must be furnished with appropriate resources, like other policies. The negotiations on the next financial framework must therefore take into account the objectives identified in the Green Paper on the sea. In the same way, it is advisable for the Commissioner for Maritime Affairs to retain this role, and for his portfolio not to be restricted to fisheries issues alone.</p>

Something needs to be done about both problems.</p>

<p class="contents">The Baltic is the world’s most vulnerable sea.

Europe is at present focusing on a new vision for our seas, which undoubtedly have great potential. We would all agree that the sea is of vital importance to the European Union and, over the years, it has become a major subject of political debates. It is a well-known fact that this kind of discussion is essential if we want to adopt a more holistic approach to our maritime vision. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioners responsible for policies related to the sea, in particular the Maltese Commissioner, Mr Borg, drew up a document on the future of the Union’s maritime policy. The publication of this Green Paper launched extensive consultations on the prospects for a successful maritime policy, which was adopted by the Commission. The aim was to agree on how to implement maritime policies while at the same maintaining constantly sustainable synergy between one sector and another. This new maritime policy will help improve the standard of living of those countries close to the coast, and in such a way that it reflects regional development policy. A policy of this type will not only increase competition but will also protect the environment, as well as respond to challenges such as immigration and climate change. We can ensure that these challenges are successfully met, and indeed it is our duty to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Expectations are great, but we must not forget that the opportunities to accept these challenges are just as great. I should like to call on all Europeans to seize these opportunities. I should like to conclude by stating that cooperation at European level is clearly necessary in order to move forward.

As mentioned in the report, the isolated, sectoral policies that we have at the moment are not equal to the challenges that this new century poses in terms of a maritime policy, and we have to equip the European Union with an integrated vision that provides comprehensive solutions across the board. We need solutions to enhance the quality of life in coastal areas, to create infrastructure and develop the transport sector, to conserve the sea bed and marine resources, and to establish partnerships and centres of excellence aiming at the sustainable management of the oceans and seas in the EU-27. The seas need to be protected and promoted through a common, shared approach, in that we must encourage and guarantee sustainable tourism, a balanced fisheries policy, a more environmentally friendly maritime transport sector, and informed, effective preservation of this vital resource, the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change, pollution, urban pressure in coastal areas and untreated waters draining into our seas are all topics that deserve our special attention, examination and common concern, so as to ensure that a healthy marine ecosystem is maintained. It is essential to ally these concerns with innovation and the new energy resources that we can extract from the seas through wave energy, and with the creation of centres of excellence dedicated to the study of the oceans.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end, we need to bring the sea, the culture of the sea and education about the sea closer to European citizens and to bring them back to their origins. The island regions, which by their very nature are linked to the seas, must be involved, but we urgently need to try to blend maritime factors into the reality of coastal regions in continental Europe, which are <span class="italic">par excellence</span> and by tradition ...</p>

Therefore, the establishment of a research network on marine tropical biodiversity, Net-Biome, a project financed under the sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development (FPRD) and grouping together the seven outermost regions (OR) and some Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs), constitutes an important advance in the field of sustainable marine management and research and development in the tropical marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The outermost regions are confronted by hazards such as tsunamis, cyclones and, of course, global warming, so many cataclysms that weaken the environment and the seabed. You have, besides, been a victim of one of these hazards, Commissioner, as you had to abandon a trip to Réunion last March because of cyclone Gemede. The experience of the outermost regions, in terms of disaster prevention and reduction of the vulnerability of coastal zones, must bring considerable added value to our common reflection. Furthermore the question of balance between tourism and respect for the marine environment is asked more than elsewhere in the outermost regions so that this sector of activity allows sustainable development in these regions where tourism is one of the prime sources of revenue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of consistency between the different European policies arises in the field of fishing, because our regions must strengthen safety at sea and make jobs in fishing more attractive, whereas the current policy seeks to limit the power and number of boats, including in our regions where the level of resources does not justify it.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the current reflection will result in the emergence of a consistent overall European maritime policy, in which the outermost regions will see themselves recognised as in a special role, on a level with the detailed knowledge of the sea that they possess. Finally, I should like to finish by thanking Willi Piecyk for his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With 700 km of low-lying coastline, major ports at Great Yarmouth, Ipswich, Felixstowe, Harwich and Tilbury, areas of outstanding natural beauty in north Norfolk and on the Stour and Orwell estuaries, for us it is a practical, not a theoretical, ambition to create a better relationship between people and the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to build on the EU-funded centre promoting renewable energy in Lowestoft – due to open this year – where my region’s potential for offshore wind development could meet 25% of the United Kingdom’s electricity needs and make a major contribution towards European targets to cut carbon emissions. We need to recognise that rising sea levels – 40 cm by 2050 in the East of England – mean that current plans for coastline protection against erosion and flooding are no more than a sticking plaster for our region and for Europe. Devastating floods across East Anglia in 1953 killed 307 people, and today nearly half a million properties are at risk. We have to do more.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the maritime strategy must support economic development in maritime regions. We suffer from peripherality. In my region, King’s Lynn, Clacton-on-Sea, Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock are amongst the top 10% in terms of multiple deprivation in the UK. In port development, tourism and regeneration, we have to make the concept of sustainable development a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My contributions concerned improved management and sustainable exploitation of marine resources; enhancement of coastal regions through careful organisation of the coastline and specific measures for developing a broader coastal policy; support for environmentally friendly forms of maritime transport, including through the development of an effective European port strategy consistent with the nature of European ports; support for marine research, particularly in the areas of medicine, energy and marine resources in general; promotion of social rights, in line with International Labour Organization standards, to ensure that they are kept in the spotlight; and, lastly, vocational training in the maritime sector for workers both at sea and on land, and an assurance that tourism, one of the main economic activities associated with the seas and oceans, is duly taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I hail from a region with a deeply rooted maritime tradition. Overfishing of the seas and the bankruptcy of several shipyards has led to an unemployment rate of up to 20%. Nevertheless, shipbuilding is now taking place again. Instead of fish processing, biotechnology is the order of the day. Wind farms are being increasingly located offshore. Climate research is taking pride of place. This is the result of major investment, not only in research and innovation, but also in training. We must do more to promote training in maritime occupations, in order to create good, sustainable jobs. The growth potential for the next five years alone is estimated at approximately 15%, and I am pleased that Mr Piecyk’s report, unlike the Commission Green Paper, makes this a clear priority.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would appeal to all my fellow Members to support the amendment tabled by my group that seeks to put an end to the continued treatment of seafarers as second-class workers.

<p class="contents">Let me state clearly that the aim of our work on maritime policy is to unlock the potential that exists in the sustainable use of our oceans and seas. We are looking for the first time at this maritime space in an integrated and holistic manner and we seek to build on where we see the added value. Let me underline that this is certainly not an exercise in centralisation of powers but one which seeks to provide an incentive for coordination and to involve stakeholders much more than they are involved today.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, this is the beginning of the process and not the end. There will be opportunities to continue to develop our positions on a number of points raised. Let me just repeat that a maritime policy cannot be a one-size-fits-all policy. The specificities of the different seas around the European Union have to be properly factored in.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just say a word on the regional aspects. Clearly, we view the regional dimension as the key factor in our exercise and the ultra-peripheral dimension is undoubtedly focal.
