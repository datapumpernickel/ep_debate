<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Angelilli (UEN), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Reding, ladies and gentlemen, this report on the possibility of establishing parental control of television broadcasting in order to protect minors tackles an issue which is extremely important and topical, all the more so when we consider the growing number of television programmes on offer and the increasingly wide and increasingly uncontrolled distribution of the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">To this I would add two further observations: on the one hand, the number of minors with direct access to televisions and computers is constantly increasing and, on the other, there is a worrying increase in the broadcasting of violent images – portraying all possible types of violence – both in television programmes and over the Internet. For example, last week in Italy, a racket trafficking paedophile pornography via the Internet was uncovered. This discovery was then broadcast on the television network. However, some of the images taken from the sites investigated were also shown, causing great consternation amongst the citizens over the unscrupulous use of such pictures, which are or were certainly inappropriate and harmful for the minors who were watching television at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the report, as you are aware, the European Commission is preparing a report on the implementation of the 'Television without frontiers' directive, to be published in the next few months. Guidelines and considerations on the protection of minors must be included in this report in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that Article 22, Paragraph 2 of the directive explicitly specifies that all the Member States must take appropriate measures to ensure that broadcasts by television broadcasters do not include any programmes which might impair the physical, mental or moral development of minors, in particular programmes that contain pornography or gratuitous violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are all aware that, in practice, this is certainly not a simple undertaking. However, in the light of these considerations, our task is to define the objectives which we can reasonably expect to achieve in order to be able to establish genuine, reliable protection for minors.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must identify all the technological systems in order to be able to manage in an informed manner the increase in the broadcasting via television or Internet of material which could be considered harmful to the psychological development of minors: I refer, in particular, to filtering systems and programme classification systems. However, we must also take into account the introduction of the digital system, which will facilitate the use and broadcasting of such programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must specify that, in addition to the technological control systems which I have mentioned, a further two elements are essential to prepare the ground, so to speak. Firstly, we must promote the development at national level of information and awareness-raising policies targeting families and the world of education in general. Secondly, we must encourage producers to take responsibility for the quality of television programmes and broadcasters to take responsibility for broadcasting procedures for these programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, we cannot attempt to harmonise legislation on the protection of minors in that, under the principle of subsidiarity, each Member State is sovereign in this matter, but also because cultural and moral concepts and therefore views on these issues differ widely from country to country: for example, there are differences in the definition of who exactly is a minor and the definition of violence, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">However, having said this, if we are to produce more than empty words to protect children we do need to provide clear recommendations on the protection of minors in the media context.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to summarise the proposals made in this report which I feel are most important and most viable in practical terms: firstly, the setting up of an group of experts consisting of high-level individuals appointed by the Member States to contribute to the definition of common criteria for the protection of minors in the media context; secondly, the establishment by all the operators in the sector of a code of self-regulation in respect of the protection of minors; thirdly, the possibility of promoting filtering systems and making them available for use on both television programmes and the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying that, in accordance with the vote which took place in committee, I cannot accept Amendments Nos 1 and 4 tabled by the liberal group or Amendments Nos 5 and 6 tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, whereas I welcome Amendments Nos 2 and 3 tabled by the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But at a time when we not only have a surplus of audiovisual offerings but also excess consumption of these offerings, we cannot retreat behind the word subsidiarity. As politicians, we simply have a responsibility, in all the areas in which we act, to protect young people from that surplus. At a time when we are witnessing so much violence, hatred and intolerance in all our countries, we surely have to ask ourselves where it is coming from. Now, I cannot say: it all comes from television. But no doubt much of it can be traced back to the excessive consumption of these television offerings, some of which incite to hatred and intolerance, including intolerance towards other nationalities. So we must give serious thought to how we can check this. We have a responsibility towards minors!</p>
<p class="contents">Subsidiarity is to be welcomed. And we want to preserve it; but I beg you, let us not hide behind it. It is our job to do something, and indeed we have already tried to introduce this kind of protection of minors with our first “Television without frontiers” directive. I am thinking now of Mr Hoppenstedt, who fought for the V chip. But what can we achieve with that kind of technological barrier? Not much; children usually know how to handle it better than adults, which means we really must think very seriously about how to remedy this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not intend to replace anyone who is doing a good job at national level, but we do want to introduce common criteria and minimum requirements at Community level and propose rules that help people effectively to implement measures to protect minors in their country.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course I also think that we are not in a position, either as politicians or as technicians, to tackle this problem on our own. Far more important than all this, of course, is the role of the teachers and the parents, and handling this medium correctly. Television and the Internet have to be learned and, of course, also taught. So what we are doing today is just a small part of the job that society as a whole has to perform. I believe we must bring up our children to enjoy this medium in the right way and to get parents to encourage their children to watch suitable programmes and disregard the less suitable ones. That is why we should do both, do our job as politicians and urge society to do its bit. Unfortunately, I cannot endorse the Liberals’ demands. I find them too liberal and not really geared to the interests of the minorities we are considering here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Junker (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Pack, how much television violence can a child tolerate? The question is not nearly as easy to answer as some people think. And that is one of the findings that has come out of the highly commendable “Study on Parental Control of Television Broadcasting” that is the subject of the Commission communication. Despite an impressive number of international studies, there is still no clear evidence of any direct link between violence and media consumption. Someone may commit a particular act under the influence of an image seen on the media, but that does not mean that the cause of that act is also to be found in the media image. That is a most important finding, for we must not overshoot the mark in our legitimate concern for the well-being of children and young people and, in particular, we must not mistake the real causes of the sad reality of youth violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Youth violence is the result of a build-up of several factors, such as experiencing violence in the family, suffering serious social disadvantages, having poor chances for the future because of lack of education, which leads to frustration, which in turn finds its outlet in violence. That fits in with the experience I myself have gleaned during ten years of voluntary jury service at a number of juvenile courts. Technical measures to control television offerings cannot resolve these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, however, the vast majority of children and young people grow up in an environment free of all these types of problem. That is the best youth protection there can possibly be. Here we see parents who are committed to passing on their own moral values and life experiences to their children. As a rule these are rooted in a particular cultural, social and societal background. Systems of parental control must therefore also leave room for individual action on a pluralist basis. That is also what the Commission is seeking to do, with reference to the findings of the study. Basically, the report we are to vote on here also supports that approach. At the same time, of course, no-one disputes that media images can influence moral values.</p>
<p class="contents">But we must make it equally clear that even if we place our confidence in a differentiated supply of filter systems, that in no way takes away from broadcaster responsibility. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has therefore called in so many words for the programme and provider responsibility to be established. That is and remains mainly the task of Member State legislation, although it certainly does not preclude a consensual agreement on certain basic values in a dialogue with all concerned at European level. Finally, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport also considered it important to urge the Commission to extend all youth protection measures to multimedia offerings of all kinds, since images of violence and other harmful content are certainly no longer confined to conventional television. Europe’s children have been surfing the Internet for a long time now, and they are doing so more and more.</p>
<p class="contents">It is more important for the children and their parents to learn to use the media properly than to introduce legal restrictions and electronic filters. That is an educational and social task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are concerned here with the proximity principle. The EU is facing a number of challenges – enlargement towards the East, the intergovernmental conference and the Treaty in Nice. These questions are at the top of the agenda. The problems relating to democracy and to the EU’s closeness to the people are other crucial issues. It is a question of the EU’s political legitimacy in the eyes of the people – and time is rather pressing. I believe that solving these problems is a prerequisite for the success of the European project as a whole. In his splendid major speech yesterday, President of the Commission Romano Prodi mentioned that, for the sake of the EU’s political legitimacy in the future, it will be necessary to produce a list of those subjects the EU is to deal with and those which the Member States are to deal with. I entirely agree with the President of the Commission about the need to prepare such a list along the lines of a constitution, and I am quite clear about the fact that the subsidiarity principle must be reinforced and that the EU must therefore refrain from making policy on the wide range of areas in which the political problems are not of a cross-border nature. The EU should stick to the key political issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In so far as the President of the Commission has had any ideas about which areas belong where, I hope that he shares my view that issues of parental control of children’s television viewing do not belong on the EU’s agenda. On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have therefore tabled a number of amendments, the purpose of which is to limit the effects of this report in so far as it may be adopted. Allow me finally to emphasise that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is also concerned about the increase in the number of TV programmes containing sex and violence. We are also convinced that these programmes are in no way of benefit to viewers and certainly not to children. But, all other things being equal, I think it is the job of parents to prevent their children from seeing that sort of thing at home. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be good for the world to be able to see your imposing figure presiding over the House, and a live television programme broadcast at this time of day showing our alluring Commissioner would be just the thing. But there are no television cameras here. We are not being filmed.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, as the previous speakers have said, our televisions show scenes of violence and rampant sex, some of which feed money into the State coffers through the infamous advertisements publicising sex chat lines, and yet we, the European Union, ban the sale of toys containing phthalates – and rightly so for they are dangerous if children put them in their mouths. It is not enough to leave parents to keep watch over their children: we ban the toys! That is what we do. And why, in this case, then, do we not just ban all programmes which are harmful to us all? Oh, no. In this case, we leave parents to keep an eye on their children. But consider how often are parents at home, how often they have to go out. We should also ban mobile phones, the WAP phones we hear so much about, which all the youngsters will soon be carrying about town, putting their lives at risk from traffic because they are watching television programmes and absorbed in material from all the different States of the European Union displayed on their mobile phones.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, therefore, agree with the words of the Liberal Member who has just spoken. I am afraid that the heavens and the satellites will soon be raining signals from all over the Union down on all our States. And it is therefore important for a European directive to be adopted to prevent the transmission of harmful material. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Information from all over the world and from every sphere of knowledge is delivered to the home in record time and our children can communicate all around the world on an everyday basis. At the same time, a huge selection of different entertainment programmes is available to them, usually without any controls.</p>
<p class="contents">Aside from all the positive aspects, we must not disregard the negative side-effects of this ease of access. Children are being faced day by day with a growing wave of media brutality and violence, which is simply too much for them, especially because no limits are imposed on these offerings. So all those concerned, starting with the children, via the parents, the teachers, the countries, the European Union and, beyond them, the suppliers and producers must come to grips with this question and learn how to deal with these offerings and their effects.</p>
<p class="contents">The public must be made more aware of the effects of this constantly growing wave of violence and support measures must be taken. Parents are in particular need of help here, and in the following form: parameters to protect minors in the media context throughout the European Union, the introduction of filter systems available at low cost, legislation to protect minors and assumption of responsibility by the media, enterprises and private and public-sector providers.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures must not be restricted to television but must apply to all accessible media. The candidate countries must of course also be integrated in this process even at this stage. Since the media market is a matter of supply and demand, i.e., a question of hard business, the providers pay no attention to the consequences of various offerings. All that counts is the ratings. So we must introduce protective mechanisms that are impossible, or at least not easy, to circumvent.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe programmes that help reduce and overcome violence and aggression should also be on offer. No doubt they could not be marketed so spectacularly and would therefore produce lower ratings, but in return they could make a considerable contribution to damage limitation and to combating the adverse effects. We are responsible for ensuring that our young people can shape a future society in which violence and aggression are not presented as hip or cool or as examples to be copied but as deeply reprehensible. We have to match up to that responsibility by adopting the appropriate directives and providing the necessary support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ries (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one Sunday evening a fortnight ago in the South of France, Johan, aged 17, and Robert, aged 16, murdered their childhood friend, Romain, with a firearm and a baseball bat, for no reason or motive, just like on TV. Arrested very soon afterwards, they told the police, “It’s funny, they don’t get caught that easily on the telly.” They also said that they wanted to see what it was like to kill someone in real life. This occurred not far away and not very long ago. It happened on 17 September, close to home, in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no question of simplifying matters or engaging in generalisations, even if we do have a limited time for speaking in the European Parliament, but there are a great many examples. It may be remembered that, a few years ago, Oliver Stone’s film, ‘Natural Born Killers’, generated the same controversy by giving rise to copycat crimes by youngsters in the United States and France. So when I hear some people stating in debates in committee that there is nothing to prove that television violence in all its forms may have a harmful influence upon children, I am, to put it mildly, surprised.</p>
<p class="contents">We are often alarmed at the television programmes our children watch. The on-screen violence of all kinds to which children are subjected, whether it be on television or through the computer, has short-, medium- and long-term consequences. The purpose of this report is to help us, as parents and grandparents, to protect minors and to provide us with a tool enabling us to make better, informed choices for our children. Just how is that an attack on the principle of subsidiarity? The audiovisual media continue to be the exclusive domain of the Member States. At no point does the report suggest potential harmonisation. At the very most, the talk is of tentative convergence. With regard to the protection of minors in the media context, the definition of common criteria is therefore, of necessity, minimal, given the cultural, moral and social variations in our Member States. Establishing minimum criteria is the very least the European Union can do for its children.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also support the rapporteur when she explains the need to make sure that all families are guaranteed the right to an affordable filtering system. That being said, these devices must not, and cannot, exonerate broadcasters and educators from fulfilling their responsibilities. Children will very quickly learn to manipulate these filtering systems better than ourselves. Legislators – and I have almost finished speaking now – cannot regulate everything, but they must occasionally remind everyone what their rights and duties are. I believe that that is what we are doing today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I should like to thank both the European Parliament and its rapporteur for the important work which has been done on this issue. I remember that, when the V-chip was discussed in this House, I was among the MEPs who banged their fists on the table and demanded that parents have the opportunity to exercise supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the view expressed in the report that cooperation between Member States and the Commission is essential if minors are to be better protected over the next few years. This does not mean harmonisation. No one wants this, no one has talked about it and no one intends to implement it. The idea is to draw up minimum rules. I am the last person to attack subsidiarity. I defend it, because it is essential. Subsidiarity must serve some purpose, however, and not act as a screen. I am convinced that, when it comes to protecting young people, we are in prime position of responsibility, and I am also convinced that there are ethical considerations more important than the strictly legalistic ones.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the introduction of a self-regulation code, it should be noted, particularly in terms of the technical aspects, that, in a number of Member States, broadcasters have already introduced coding systems for television sets to enable parents to cut off the power. The Commission is also consulting the Digital Videobroadcasting Group, or DVB, about the technical aspects of systems for protecting minors, particularly digital filters. Like Parliament, the Commission also thinks that each family ought to have access to these filtering devices at affordable prices. As you know, however, no effective systems are yet to be found where television is concerned. However, filters are available to the public for use with the Internet, and this should speed up the development of similar filters for television, especially digital ones. In short, when more programmes are put on the market, parents will have the technical means of preventing their children from watching certain broadcasts.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not, however, forget the ethical and legal aspects. The problem is certainly not to be solved at the touch of a button or just by pulling a plug. As has been said in this House, journalists, programme makers and broadcasters are also responsible. I should like to remind you that the Commission has adopted an action plan designed to promote safer Internet use and also to make users more aware of the problem. I think too that, even if this public awareness campaign relates to the Internet, it will also have a knock-on effect on television programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, as Parliament acknowledges, that the Member States do not share the same ideas about what minors should or should not be permitted to see. The report considers there to be good reason for aiming at progressive convergence, even if it is premature at this stage to define the criteria involved in such convergence. Although I do not think it is feasible to adopt uniform criteria, I think it is our responsibility to arrive at some classification of the contents of television programmes, while leaving parents the option of deciding whether the programmes may or may not be watched by minors.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say something in response to the contents of a national television channel which showed offensive pictures on the pretext of providing information. Let me tell you that, in journalism, there has always been an ethical code and a system of self-regulation for applying this code, and this has operated quite well, I have to say. There are always exceptions, when things go wrong, but exceptions are precisely what they are and all the more shocking for being so. In my opinion, the profession has to be made more responsible so that it takes responsibility itself for the content of broadcasts and for what will and will not be shown. I myself was a professional journalist for twenty years. I will tell you something: journalists cannot write and show everything they know about or are aware of, or divulge all the information they have, because it may do a lot of harm to third parties.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report, Parliament also invites the Commission to encourage the creation of a think tank with the job of drawing up a memorandum containing the basic legal principles applied in the Member States for the purpose of protecting minors in the media context. The Commission will respond to this invitation because, as you know, we are due to table the ‘Television without frontiers’ directive again in 2002, with a view to testing the water. I think it will be very important, in that context, to launch a broad debate on our society’s responsibility where the media are concerned. When I say society’s responsibility, I am thinking not only of European governments but also of political responsibility at national level, the responsibility of media practitioners and the responsibility of parents and of society in general.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very aware of the remarks made about education, about training in the interpretation of images and about making younger people more aware of the need to approach the media in a critical frame of mind and not to watch any old thing, at any time and in any way. I would also say that the industry has already devised an international system of self-regulation called the Internet Content Rating Association, in which the Commission participates. Consideration could be given to encouraging the creation of a similar initiative covering audiovisual content. Your thoughts on this matter would be welcome, as they would be in the context of ‘television without frontiers’.</p>
<p class="contents">Where, finally, the protection of minors is concerned, I should like to point out that there is a Council Recommendation of 24 September on promoting national frameworks designed to ensure comparable and effective levels of protection of minors and of human dignity. There are plans for the Commission to prepare a report for Parliament and the Council on the measures taken by the Member States to apply this recommendation. The objective of such a study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach proposed, an approach based on the principles of self-regulation, and my officials have just set the work in motion and have sent a questionnaire out to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is certain, I think. The problem will not be solved through technical, technological or other such measures. It is society as a whole which has to assume responsibility. We are in the process of assuming our own share of responsibility. Let others assume theirs and, believe me, I shall call for everyone to play their part in applying a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
