I also hope that the European Union can give its stamp of approval, for it is up to Europe to put an end to this phenomenon. I do not want to discuss child labour in general, as we are all against this. Despite all previous agreements, conventions and codes of conduct, during this Football World Cup too, use was once again made of products which had been manufactured – under licence – by children, in an unacceptable manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to the World Cup that, in 2006, will take place in Germany. I cannot imagine that the Commission and the Council would accept that children would once again be used for manufacturing products for this World Cup which will take place on European soil. I therefore expect from FIFA – the customer of industry – and from the European Commission not only a commitment in terms of effort but also a commitment in terms of result in the run-up to the World Cup in 2006. In this way, we can be certain that, in future, children only touch a football to play and to have fun with. This is also why we need to call for alternatives for these children who now have to work, not least in the interest of the developing countries. They too must fight these practices. They need to ensure that these children can learn and work – work at school, that is – and that they receive education. Why? Because these children are the economic future of the developing countries. This is why I think, and hope, that this resolution will find widespread support, certainly with a view to the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in the shadow of this event, thousands of children use their valuable time every day making the balls used in football matches. These children are deprived of any chance to acquire a better education at school or play with other children their own age. Child labour and the inhumane working conditions which adults making footballs also work under are, unfortunately, still standard practice, despite the agreements concluded by the International Football Federation with companies which make sporting goods.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the report by the India Committee of the Netherlands tellingly entitled "The Dark Side of Football", Pakistan is the biggest producer of footballs in the world, followed by India. In just one area of India, the Punjab, about 10 000 children aged between 6 and 12 sit stitching footballs, while about 15 000 children work in the area of Sialkot in Pakistan. These balls, which are hand stitched by children for a few cents, are the same designer and FIFA endorsed footballs which are sold in sports shops in the west for tens of dollars.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the efforts of both international organisations and the sports companies themselves to introduce programmes and control systems to combat this awful practice, production has shifted to small villages where either there is no policing or the children work at home rather than in factories. Similarly, according to the London Times, numerous children have been found making footballs for famous multinational companies.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on international organisations, sports companies and governments to use the World Cup, which has been dedicated to children, as an opportunity to work together and adopt a reliable system for checking if labour regulations are being complied with. Because child labour is neither a hobby nor a game, I hope both FIFA and the industry will take the lead and make football a truly fair game for everyone. We need to send out a message today that adults should be given work and children should be sent to school. Adults at work, children in school. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Three reports were presented at the press conference of Global March Against Child Labour in New Delhi last month. They furnish the proof that child labour is still the order of the day in the production of sports equipment. For example, according to a report from the Dutch National India Working Group, the number of children working in the Indian production of sports equipment full-time has hardly fallen over the past four years. This despite an inspection scheme introduced by FIFA. Other reports of a similar kind denounce the situation in Pakistan and China. Admittedly, FIFA demonstrated its good will in 1996 by concluding an agreement with the international trade union on the code of conduct to banish child labour and poor working conditions. However, this code has not been implemented to date, and the reports I mentioned earlier show that we are still a long way off the set goal. Hence the express appeal to FIFA to speed up the implementation of this code.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that child labour is a complex matter. Our campaign should not only be confined to calling FIFA and the manufacturers to task over this in an overbearing manner. The production of sports equipment is certainly not the only, and not even the most important, sector in which children work. In order to tackle the problem at the roots, cooperation is required between industry, civil society, as well as the governments and international organisations involved. After all, we need to look for alternatives where labour, education, income and education are concerned. The countries involved must be reminded of their duty to monitor existing rules effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to underline that this resolution should not be considered as a targeted attack on one specific form of child abuse, or aimed at one specific sector in industry and one product. However, the World Cup is an illustration of the extreme contrasts in our world. Between the fit and healthy children who copy the World Cup on the streets in the richer world and the children on the Indian Subcontinent who stitch together leather footballs in sweatshops all day long. In this way, the World Cup 2002 forms a starting point to remind everyone – manufacturers, governments, international organisation and the public – of their own responsibilities. This is why I warmly support this urgent procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The truth is that there are agreements, there are declarations, there is the FIFA Code, there are mechanisms banning child labour. But child labour among children as young as 10 years old, as my colleagues have said, is increasing every year. Child labour has other serious connotations: for example, it decreases salaries in the regions in which thousands of children work, takes work away from adults, causes poverty in families and, above all, deprives children of the right to education, which they should have from birth.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent data indicates that there are thousands of children in India and Pakistan, aged 10 or under, who are working to produce balls, and we believe that in the European Union’s talks in the World Trade Organization and in bilateral talks with each of the countries mentioned, one of our fundamental requirements should be that child labour should end. But, as one of my colleagues has already said, it is not enough just to demand that child labour be ended, but alternatives have to be offered to the families in order for them to survive. And of course monitoring and surveillance systems have to be put in place in order to ensure that it no longer happens, and it would be good if, as the World Cup is now being played, giving rise to so much passion, including in this House, we could say at the next World Cup in 2006 that child labour no longer existed, if not across the world, at least in part of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two hundred and fifty million children are regarded by their parents as an investment in their whole family's survival. They are exposed to the heaviest physical burdens from an early age, thus being robbed of a carefree childhood. Not only are they put to work as cheap labour in plantations, quarries and mines, but they are also exploited by the manufacturers of sports goods.</p>
<p class="contents">Now of all times, when the World Cup is on in Japan and South Korea, it should not be forgotten that many footballs are made by children. As long ago as 1998, FIFA undertook to outlaw the use of child labour in the production of officially licensed products, but the world's richest and most important football association has now had to admit that it cannot guarantee this. The PPE-DE group, like all the other groups, condemns every form of child labour. FIFA and the sports goods manufacturers must at last introduce a code of conduct and then monitor the way it is implemented, if this deplorable state of affairs is to be brought to an end. Industry and organisations should work together with governments, as Mrs Martens and others of our fellow-Members have just emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the ILO must check that these working guidelines are consistently adhered to. One step in the right direction is the ‘Red Card for Child Labour’ campaign started during the African championships in January this year. We call on FIFA, national teams and the sports goods manufacturers to do everything possible to make the 2004 European Championships in Portugal the first international football tournament free of child labour. Over and above that, I agree with the ladies who spoke before me that the fight against the causes of child labour – poverty, poor education and inadequate training – has to be stepped up.</p>

Pictures of malnourished third world children forced to work day in day out occasionally make the headlines. In today's world, this sort of situation is unforgivable. </p>
<p class="contents">However, we have to ask if and to what extent we contribute towards it. According to World Labour Organisation sources, some 211 million children aged between 5 and 14 work instead of attending school. In Asia, Africa and South America, western multinationals use small children for various types of hard work, such as picking tobacco, bananas and cotton, making rugs or stitching footballs and sports clothing in intolerable conditions, often working for more than twelve hours at a time. </p>
<p class="contents">Despite all the action taken by international organisations to combat child labour, the results are most discouraging, which is why, Mr President, we have to use all our power and influence to put an end to this shameful practice. We need to find a way to stop companies from moving their operations to countries where cheap labour means child labour. I propose that the relevant parliamentary committees draft an own initiative report on this issue and that more funds be made available to the international programmes of the ILO to combat child labour. </p>
<p class="contents">Children, Mr President, are the most important members of society and they need special protection because the future belongs to them. I only hope that today's debate and the resolution which follow it will be effective this time.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the Commission shares the concerns expressed about the use of child labour in the football industry. It condemns all forms of child exploitation, as well as the worst forms of child labour. It supports the calls on FIFA and the sporting goods companies to make sure that no children are employed in the production of FIFA licensed sportswear and footballs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not had any contact so far with FIFA on this issue. It is ready to support NGOs which work with local partners for the elimination of child labour. It has already financed several initiatives to combat child labour, especially in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that assistance for and protection of vulnerable children should be seen in the wider context of poverty eradication and therefore in the framework of the Community framework development cooperation. Children are an important focal group in the Community's external aid, particularly in sectoral policies such as education and health.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community is committed to applying the ILO core labour standards and has agreed to implement those standards in the framework of bilateral and multilateral agreements with developing countries. A good example is Article 50 of the Cotonou Convention. In that article the Community and the ACP countries have reaffirmed their commitment to ILO core labour standards, including the fight against the worst forms of child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community is increasing its support to universal and compulsory primary education in all developing countries as part of its commitments to the "education for all" framework and the millennium development goals for education and gender equality. It sees this as one of the most efficient means currently at its disposal for rescuing children from the vicious circle of exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">Assistance for, and protection of, children is channelled through a number of Commission programmes, including the European initiative for human rights and democracy. The promotion of children's rights was one of the priorities for funding in 2001 and will be mainstreamed in funding for the period 2002 to 2004. Furthermore, the Commission has also made children a cross-cutting priority for humanitarian assistance. In its communication on the promotion of core labour standards and social governance, the Commission presented a comprehensive strategy proposing actions at European and international level. This should, in the medium term, ensure better implementation of the ILO core labour standards through institutional support and capacity building and trading in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards trade, in December 2001 the Council adopted a revised GSP scheme by which additional trade preferences are granted to countries that respect core labour standards. This includes an improved social incentive scheme and extends the base for withdrawal of GSPs to cover serious infringements of all ILO core conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission played an active role in the UN General Assembly special session on children. In this context, the EU considers a rights-based approach as fundamental to the promotion of the interest of children, given that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most ratified international treaty in the world and provides an already agreed normative framework. The plan of action agreed at this special session contains strong elements aimed at combating child labour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
