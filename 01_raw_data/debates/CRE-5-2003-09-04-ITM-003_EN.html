<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Perry, Roy (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I will start by saying that the Television without Frontiers Directive is one of the successes of the European Union and has undoubtedly helped European television. However, we also have to recognise that the television industry in Europe at the present time is not without difficulties. I am thinking of issues like restricted advertising revenues, and a significant number of companies are currently facing financial difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">The industry today is greatly different from 1997, when the Directive was last revised, and barely recognisable from the TV industry of 1989, when the Directive was adopted. In 1989 there were just 47 television channels in the whole of Europe. Today that figure is 2000. TV is an important industry, with turnover estimated at EUR 62 billion per annum. The role of the EU must be to help encourage the industry and in no sense to restrict it.</p>
<p class="contents">TV is now facing important technological changes: there is more satellite TV, digital TV, convergence with the Internet and new advertising techniques, such as split-screen advertising. The directive, however, is beginning to creak, and revision cannot be put off indefinitely. Indeed, a thorough review is becoming urgent.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate the Commission's careful approach and congratulate the Commissioner on her careful and extensive consultation. However, we need to take care: too long a delay in revising the directive will impede progress in the industry. We should not move away from the fundamental principles of the present directive which relies largely on self-regulation and is not too prescriptive. We should no more seek to control what people watch than we would seek to control what books they might wish to buy in a bookshop. Therefore, I am clear that overzealous use of quotas and too detailed definitions would be wrong. Above all, we should only seek to regulate and influence at a European level that which is of transeuropean concern.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are European issues we need to address. For instance, events of major importance need to remain free to air, and there is a case for a short European list of such events. There was a real risk that last year's World Cup would not be freely available in all our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am as keen as any colleague to encourage European content in television, although primarily that could be helped by the 'MEDIA Plus' Programme. I also urge the Commission to look at ways to ensure that channels like Euronews and Arte flourish and develop. They help create a European television identity and help our citizens to appreciate and understand the European dimension in their lives. Euronews in particular is a very effective means of allowing European and world citizens to get a European perspective on current affairs, rather than an exclusively national or American view.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also urge the Commission to find means to protect the diversity of ownership of television and to guard against undue concentration of ownership. Plurality of media ownership is important for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report I touch on two particular issues which may be seen as minor but are important. First, the needs of viewers with sensory impairments: these fellow citizens wish, and have the right, to enjoy television. I hope the Commission will conduct the study called for as soon as possible to enable us to get best practice for subtitling, sign language and audio description in television broadcasts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to raise the issue of those European citizens – often retirees but not only – who move to a place in the sun. Spain, Greece, Portugal, Italy and France are indeed wonderful and hospitable countries, but for those people from the north of Europe it is nice to watch television programmes from their own country and even to watch their own country play in a football match. Many people do this by skirting around the law by watching via satellite broadcasters from their own country. They often ignore the terms of their contracts or even use pirate technology. Perhaps that is not a big problem, but, as sensible legislators, we ought to be able to frame sensible laws that allow citizens to lead their lives within the law and not in a grey market.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I thank the Commissioner for her commitment to Europe's television. I urge her to heed this report and to come forward as soon as possible with practical proposals to revise the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 6 January, the Commission adopted the fourth report on the application of the Directive and a work programme for its revision incorporating a public consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">What did we note in this report on the application of the Directive? Firstly, we noted that the Directive is operating relatively well. Nevertheless, recent technological developments call for more detailed reflection. The aim of the public consultation was to enable the Commission to assess the need to update or adjust the Directive and the report and today’s debate will help us in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of its work programme, the Commission organised two series of public hearings, in April and June, and interested parties were invited to participate in public debates by responding to specific questions and forwarding their responses to us. We received 160 written contributions, which are all available on the Commission’s website with the exception of a few whose authors asked for them to be kept confidential. Based on the analysis of the results of this consultation, the Commission plans to submit to Parliament and the Council at the end of 2003 or beginning of 2004 a communication on the future of audiovisual policy, which will be accompanied by proposals if appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the challenges of the revision is to take account of technological innovations. I am thinking in this respect of the Council’s 1998 Recommendation on the Protection of Minors and Human Dignity and Audiovisual and Information Services, which is the first legal instrument to cover the content of audiovisual services on the Internet. After the break, the Commission intends to publish a second report on the implementation of the Recommendation based on a questionnaire that was sent to the Member States. The aim of this report is to ascertain the progress made, to make it possible to make a direct comparison and to include the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Perry raises several questions in his report, to which I would like to respond, without prejudice, of course, to the consultations under way. The first relates to the scope of the Directive, referred to in paragraphs 7 to 12. Mr Perry calls for the definition of audiovisual content to be extended to take account of media convergence. However, as long as television broadcasting services continue to enjoy unequal importance and impact in our societies, it would be difficult to reach consensus on the concept of content without frontiers. This was also borne out by the consultation. In addition, while information society services are at an early stage in their development I feel that it would be inappropriate at the current stage of negotiations to subject them to the more detailed approach of the Directive. The very first thing that must be done therefore is to ascertain whether the Directive provides the appropriate regulatory framework for the coming years or whether it needs to be adjusted, and this will be verified in the communication.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the working group of national regulators, mentioned in paragraph 19, the Commission held a meeting with the regulators in March and the next meeting is due to be held on 14 October. Some Member States do not, however, see the need for an additional committee and have already expressed concern that this committee may duplicate work already being done. I am not in favour of the systematic participation of public and private broadcasters; I prefer a system of ad hoc invitations like the one we are using at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to self-regulation and co-regulation – paragraph 20 of the report – I agree with the rapporteur that greater emphasis should be placed on co-regulation. As a result, in the working documents we have specifically raised this question and I think that we will be able to make some progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to move on to paragraph 28 concerning channels that have a pan-European dimension. I do not think that it is up to the Commission to take the initiative in this field. Indeed, given the disappointing results of a study on the possibilities of using digital platforms for thematic channels, it would be difficult for the Commission to finance any new studies on this subject. Having said that, we are going to contribute indirectly to the creation of pan-European channels by establishing a favourable regulatory framework and by supporting the creation and broadcast of European audiovisual works.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the question of television for disabled people – paragraph 34 – we must not forget that the Directive deals essentially with the aspects linked to content and the issue of disabled persons is therefore not formally covered in the report on the application of the Directive as it does not fall within its scope. It is up to the Member States to apply the principle of subsidiarity in this area. Nevertheless, access to television services for disabled people is very important. My services have received many contributions regarding these pertinent issues and all of these can be found on the Commission’s website. The website also contains the contributions from associations representing disabled people. In order to make some progress in this area, we plan to organise a round table on 21 October in association with the Royal National Institute for Deaf People and the Royal National Institute for the Blind in the United Kingdom and to invite the Member States to attend and to report on the situation at national level. We are therefore going to continue in this way, and I must also point out that the Information Society DG has set up a working group that has been christened ‘Inclusive Communications’. This aspect is thus being taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards media concentration, discussed in paragraphs 36 to 42, I support the idea in the Perry report that pluralism is an important element in safeguarding democracy. This idea is fully reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I would also like to stress that one of the topics covered by the May 2003 Green Paper on Services of General Interest relates precisely to the protection of pluralism. All interested parties are invited to submit their comments by 15 September. The Commission will determine its future policy on the basis of the conclusions of this consultation process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will not be able to comment on all of the changes to the Directive today because we have not yet received all of the written contributions. We receive new contributions every day and I would like to allow my colleagues to complete their analysis before informing you of them by way of the communication on audiovisual policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We cooperated with the rapporteur, Mr Perry, and I am in the happy position of saying that we have taken a common approach. The Commission needs to pay particular attention to Mr Perry’s individual proposals if we are to take another step forward on the interconnected problems linked to the whole of the audiovisual sector. This year’s report has a factor of additional interest compared with previous reports, because it proposes in its annex a programme of work which makes provision for dialogue to develop with the individual national agencies, such as radio and television organisations, independent regulatory authorities etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective is to reform the directive so that it can monitor rapid technological progress, but it also has other individual objectives. All these objectives mean that a difficult job awaits the Commission and it must convince us of how it is going to work in order for all the necessary adjustments to come about.</p>
<p class="contents">Another conclusion on which we more or less agree is the dual role of the audiovisual media. They are an economic commodity, which is why they are linked to the issue of competition, to the knowledge society being promoted by the Lisbon policy. Full coordination is therefore needed here. At the same time, they are a cultural commodity and their promotion needs to take account, on the one hand, of the public interest, such as protecting minors and safeguarding cultural diversity; on the other hand, however, they must take horizontal account of the European interest, which is to safeguard the European identity against non-European standards, especially American standards. We need to realise here that the danger from the commercial deficit on the audiovisual media market in comparison with the corresponding American products is directly linked to the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue has started. It may be public. I would say, however, that it needs greater publicity and greater visibility. In view of all this, the reform of the Television without Frontiers directive must be one of the most serious concerns of all three institutions of the European Union because, over and above clarifying disputed concepts, such as independent producers etc., we need to guarantee the availability of digital options to a wide public and promote the cohesion of the policy of the audiovisual industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that he usually deals with difficult issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the substantial cultural and economic challenges the Television without Frontiers Directive presents for each of the Member States of the Union and the candidate countries. That is why we support the Commission, which had the quite right and sensible idea of seeking the opinion of each Member State before taking any decisions on the revision.</p>
<p class="contents">Specific improvements to the Directive are no doubt necessary to take account of technological developments, but we must ensure that these adjustments are not premature. In fact, if we look objectively at the situation of the audiovisual market, we can see that the national markets are adapting bit by bit to the new technologies. Thus, the recent technological developments have not really disrupted the audiovisual landscape, which continues to be dominated to a large extent by traditional television. Future changes to the Directive must under no circumstances disrupt its content. A revision calling into question the cultural objectives on which the Member States had reached agreement, under the pretext of extending the scope of the Directive to include all broadcasting formats, would in reality change completely the initial aims of the Directive, that is, the defence and promotion of cultural diversity. The main provisions of this Directive must not be called into question. The key principles must continue to form the foundation of the Community’s audiovisual policy: the promotion, movement and broadcast of European works within Europe; the production and broadcast of works by independent producers; the existence of broadcast quotas for television services; the guarantee of protection of minors; and measures to combat excessive advertising.</p>
<p class="contents">The Television without Frontiers Directive has proved its worth as a legal instrument and is now being applied satisfactorily. Its revision can only be justified if it makes genuine improvements to certain elements such as the worrying issue of media concentration, which obviously undermines pluralism. The Directive must continue to be a useful tool in promoting cultural diversity and must not become a legal instrument providing solely for the promotion of commercial channels where we would see, for example, continuous advertising with disregard for the works broadcast. Over and above the economic and financial issues, which are clearly vital, is the simple question of our cultures, our identities and the values in which we believe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the directive will have to be revised if its objectives for the future are to be achieved. My Group takes the view that the Commission is too hesitant in this respect. What is in fact at stake is the safeguarding of cultural diversity, a wide range of opinions and pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst democratic opinion today is, in essence, shaped by television, this is no longer only the traditional television with analogue transmission. More and more, we have digitalisation to cope with. I was recently at the International Broadcasting Exhibition in Berlin, where I could see very well how consumer habits in this area are changing, and that nowadays the technical means of transmission can no longer be decisive when it comes to deciding which is the right way to draft laws for a media service.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be clear, however, that we need to establish a system of graduated regulation, and this is where there will be new demands placed on future legislation. Not every media service is of major importance in publicity terms, so the determinative criterion for the future must be the extent to which a media service is useful for publicity purposes and in what sense it is not. If I might put it rather loosely, it is on that basis that legislation can be drafted with varying degrees of rigour.</p>
<p class="contents">Much will also be demanded of the rules that will have to be laid down, not only, to be sure, under the television directive, but also in parallel with it, in order to counteract the accumulation of economic power, which becomes media power and, eventually, also political power. We are dealing here with a development that makes it plain that bounds must be set at European level to contain media concentration, which does indeed endanger pluralism. As we can see from the example of Italy, national legal resources are not, in any case, sufficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an important directive, and thanks to the Commission's regular reports, we are gaining a clear insight into its functioning, which enables us to prepare well-considered proposals for a possible revision in future. I do have some remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, given the current increase in media convergence, both in the present Member States and in the acceding countries, we must continue to hammer away at pluriformity, both in the public broadcasting corporations and in the private stations. This is crucial to my group, and I assume my fellow Liberal will also stress this in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, sound criteria are needed to protect minors from aggressive TV commercials. In fact, with regard to television programmes too, it is important for children to be able to make informed choices and for their parents to be able to help them in this. My group is a great believer in self-regulation, which gives me an opportunity to stand up for the Dutch system, ‘<span class="italic">Kijkwijze</span>’, which enables parents and children to make informed choices by means of pictograms.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say how pleased I am by the wide support given to my proposal for a pan-European children's network. It is a good way of distributing European productions for children on a larger scale, since it combines broadcasting licence-holders from the Member States and candidate countries. Excellent children's films have been made in Europe. If we now see that in my country, the national production of quality films has enjoyed an enormous boost, which is what I read the morning of the day we returned from the film festival in Venice, that the proportion of Dutch films among those seen by cinema audiences has increased by some 6%, and especially audiences composed of young people, due to an innovative approach whose key aim is to show producers that they are making films for a certain audience – an audience-specific approach, in other words – then I can only be optimistic about the preservation of our cultural diversity in the media, and there is certainly a place for television without frontiers, and, needless to say, for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue is a difficult one and is undergoing constant change. I must thank Mr Perry for his work, and yet I am unsure whether or not this Directive needs to be revised. This has been stated clearly both by those working in the industry and by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This current issue comes up against the problem of definition and apprehension raised by the transfer of images, the development and acceleration of which we have not yet managed to control.</p>
<p class="contents">What worries me is the absence of a definition of a ‘work’. The Television without Frontiers Directive provides a negative definition. We know what it is not. It is not information, it is not advertising, it is not this, it is not that. It is produced by X or made by Y. I, myself, would prefer – and I believe that some of those working in the industry would also prefer – to know what it is. That would perhaps make it easier to settle the ongoing debate in France and other European countries on reality television. The problem is defining the scope of audiovisual works. Some works are very easy to define, such as documentaries and films, but not all are. I do not know how to define reality television and this is a serious concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point raised by this debate is the movement of works. The movement of works and artists is a recurring problem in the field of culture, as I highlighted in the report on the performing arts. In the context of Television without Frontiers, it is magnified as a result of concentration and the non-national nature of the sector. How can we promote non-national works in each of our countries? We will have to give our opinion on this fundamental problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Perry, you paid a great deal of attention in your report to the question of media concentration, which can prevent the movement of non-national works. I am very pleased that you stress this point as, in my view, it is vitally important and something we must look at very seriously indeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we talk about European works, for example, we include completely ridiculous talk shows, under the pretext that they are European productions. Until we have the courage to define what a work is – and that is where Mrs Fraisse is right – in other words, what it is that we want to protect, our television services will be unable to protect European production and European works in Europe for want of the appropriate instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as regards concentration, the problem is very simple. If we do not define what we cannot democratically accept in Europe, there will be more and more concentration and non-European forces will dominate the market. For both these reasons, I believe that the European Union must have the courage to define what a work is and to define what should be the limit, democratically, between political power and the power of the media. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I and Mr Volcic have tabled some amendments to the excellent, and I repeat, excellent, report by Mr Perry, regarding an issue which you have all touched upon, media concentration and, therefore, pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened with great interest to what Commissioner Reding had to say in defence of pluralism as an essential value. We cannot, however, close our eyes to the fact that, throughout the western world today, market forces, if left to themselves, almost always lead to serious, dangerous phenomena of concentration and that only a political measure can lay down the rules for a liberal society, the essential basis of which is pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, therefore, facing a major political battle on this issue, taking place in the US, where there is a deadlock between Congress and the authority, and in Europe with the grave problems in England that have thrust themselves upon our attention and the problems in Italy that many of you are aware of. I do not want you to think, however, that the amendments tabled by Mr Volcic, and myself urging Parliament and the Commission to adopt a measure, a directive, in line with what was, moreover, approved by Parliament in November, were dictated solely by Italian issues. There is truly a much greater, much wider issue here that affects the whole of Europe: it is an issue of civilisation. If we want to be a Community based on liberal principals, then this is one of the first issues we need to regulate, in a spirit of freedom and respect for all opinions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that content is no longer dependent only on the medium of television, but, in the same way, on many other technological media, and if we want to maintain diversity, we have to find ways whereby we can achieve common rules in this area, which do justice to the various demands, albeit in a slightly different procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two issues I would like to address, and the first is media pluralism. This Parliament has very emphatically spoken out, most recently on 10 November 2002, in favour of greater support for, and underpinning of, media diversity in Europe and against unhindered media concentration. I would press upon the Commission the urgent need to do what this vote by Parliament demands of it and put before us the pieces of work that we have asked for. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats cannot, however, endorse Amendment No 10, which was tabled today, as it refers exclusively to one instrument, the directive, and because we will achieve a result in this area only if we balance, in an appropriate and proper way, the competences of the Member States and those of the European Union. Considerations of media pluralism therefore demand the solution that we called for in our resolution in November.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to address is the protection of young people. New technologies require that children and young people be protected in the same way as is provided for in the television directive. Let us therefore work together towards a new system and new ways of self-regulation with minimum standards accepted by all. I wish the Commission much success as it travels down this road. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must unreservedly guarantee basic principles such as the requirement that the cultural diversity of the media be protected in order to maintain freedom of expression, diversity of opinion and pluralism, creativity and the right to free access to information. Public broadcasters must perform their educational function, by which I mean that the quota for the transmission of European programmes and works by independent producers could be increased. This is an aspiration with which I wish to associate myself. There must, however, be clear, workable and manageable definitions of what is meant by European works and independent producers.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the requirement that levels of media concentration be monitored as being the most important. We have examples of media power and political power being concentrated in one pair of hands. I believe this cannot be conducive to democracy, and so this is a vitally important area of concern. We will no doubt have to work towards a directive founded on our demands in the 20 November resolution, and, if all these things come together, I hope that we will be able to do all that media diversity in the European Union requires of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, media concentration jeopardises freedom of conscience and is a grave injury to human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">In its Green Paper of 21 May 2003, the Commission calls for specific measures to be looked at once again to actively protect pluralism; in its Recommendation of 28 January 2003, the Council expressed the same concern; in its Resolution of 20 November and the two reports by Mr Sylla and Mr Perry, Parliament said likewise.

Above all, moreover, it wishes to promote the development of the European audiovisual industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European audiovisual industry must above all be an industry of quality. As a mother of two small children, I naturally look for children's programmes and cartoons – with a view to finding programmes which do not injure their sensibilities and which are not prejudicial to minors – and I often find that these programmes or cartoons intended for small children are much more violent than anything even I would like to see. I often remember how, as a child, I heard adults talking about how they believed that cartoons such as Bambi or Pinocchio were not suitable for us, but now that kind of thing is by far the most ethical programme we can find.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want a society free of violence, which is what we all aspire to, we must invest in it. Investing in it means investing in children and young people, who are the future of the European Union. I believe that showing them violence on a daily basis is not the best way to do so. I would therefore insist that the European audiovisual industry must be of high quality, strictly controlled and, above all, must be suited to its intended audience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would say to the Commissioner that we are now in the 52nd month of this Parliament and more conferences and discussions simply intended to spin out time until the end of the Parliament are not good enough.</p>
