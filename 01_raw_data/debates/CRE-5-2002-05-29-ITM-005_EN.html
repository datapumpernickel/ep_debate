<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to present to you today the proposal for the reform of the common fisheries policy which we decided yesterday in committee should be presented to the Fisheries Council and Parliament. It is not an exaggeration or mere rhetoric to say that only far-reaching reform will guarantee our fishermen and our fish stocks a future. The current fisheries policy is not sustainable and is therefore doomed to fail. More and more stocks are threatened by collapse. Fishing capacity is going up, not down. Controls and sanctions are uneven and therefore unfair. It is costing more and more to land fewer and fewer fish. Economic opportunities for fishermen are deteriorating and, despite higher public subsidies, many have to give up their trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I have often been asked how it can have come to this. My answer is, because the system we have is wrong, which is why we need to change the system rather than trying to treat the symptoms. The future fisheries policy needs clear objectives. The outcome of the reform must be a new fisheries policy which ensures sustainable development ecologically, economically and socially. We need responsible fisheries and aquaculture which allow a healthy marine ecosystem. We need to build a successful and competitive sector which also serves the consumer. We must ensure that those who are particularly dependent on fisheries have a fair economic framework within which to work.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to apply the principles of new governance within the new fisheries policy by guaranteeing openness and transparency in our measures, involving the sector itself, setting clear responsibilities, developing swift decision-making procedures and guaranteeing coherence with other policies. The best way of illustrating the extent of the reform is to compare current policy with future policy. Until now, the December Council has decided on TACs and quotas from one year to the next and year after year scientific recommendations have been watered down by compromise. What is more, the existing system has not been effective in preventing illegal catches and excessive by-catches of juvenile fish. We have predicated stock management and stock management controls on quotas, instead of establishing a clear and direct relationship between scientific assessment of the stocks and allowable fishing effort, which is so much easier to oversee.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been operating a fleet policy, the objectives of which have not brought about any noticeable reduction in capacity and the measures under which have been completely cancelled out by promoting vessel construction, instead of establishing a link between the stocks that suffer most from capacity pressure and the reductions needed in order to be able to give individual fishermen a reasonable level of fishing effort.</p>
<p class="contents">We have contributed to the current race between ever more efficient ships for fewer and fewer fish, with the result that income has declined, despite increasing prices for fish, and with the result that some 66 000 jobs have already been lost between 1991 and 1998. We boosted this trend by using financial support primarily to buy new, more efficient ships instead of on measures which would have encouraged the people concerned to do things differently. Finally, thanks to a system of widely varying controls and sanctions, what we have done, instead of making sure there was a level playing field is to create a climate of mistrust, so that today every fisherman thinks he is worse off than fishermen in neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we want to create a new coherent system which steers its own way towards the objectives set, rather than sucking them into a vortex. We have taken as our starting point the stocks in the sea which are generally fished in common. We shall have them scientifically assessed and shall draw up multiannual stock recovery and stock management plans as and where necessary. From these we shall be able to establish the level of fishing effort each of these stocks can tolerate and what technical measures need to be applied. In other words, in future we shall set ever smaller annual TACs and quotas and then determine how many boats may fish for how many days in certain zones and what nets they will be allowed to use.</p>
<p class="contents">This system is also much easier to control using VMS and can also be adapted year on year, depending on how stocks evolve. In places where there is overcapacity, fishermen who can no longer use their vessel to full capacity will have to ask themselves if it is more worthwhile for them to carry on fishing, leave the sector, have their vessel scrapped and retire or get retrained.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, though, stop using subsidies to entice fishermen into new investments without providing an economic environment which can sustain them. Instead, we want to use public funds to help give those leaving the sector a positive future, which will also improve opportunities for the vessel owners who remain in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to finance this concept, we need first and foremost to reprogramme the existing structural programmes. The Member States can no longer hide behind the argument that we would have to wait until 2006. Current regulations already provide the facility for reprogramming. We propose to use the funds previously used to export ships and for joint ventures for scrapping and, instead of supporting vessel renewal and creating artificial competition, to use the EUR 450 million for social measures. As far as we are concerned, it is vital that this money be spent on social measures in future because, according to our initial calculations, around 7 000 jobs a year could be scrapped due to restricted fishing efforts, in addition to the other jobs which will be lost this year anyway, one reason being the increasingly modern and less labour intensive techniques being used in the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if necessary, additional new funds will be made available for scrapping and for social assistance. That is the main difference. As I said, without reforms, 8 000 jobs a year have been lost over the last few years. Around EUR 100 million has been earmarked over the entire term of the current structural programme for social measures to secure these jobs. EUR 800 million have been marked for vessel renewal. We really do need to focus more on people and ensure this extra money is used for their good, not for new ships!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The result of all these efforts will be a smaller but more competitive fleet, the fishing effort of which will be much better adapted to the resources available. The fleet will also be healthier economically and less dependent on aid. In order to strengthen uniform monitoring of fisheries, we intend to establish a common fisheries control structure. We intend to coordinate national and EU control activities and to combine the funds earmarked for the purpose. After all, fishermen do not just fish within the borders of their own country, so why should inspectors be restricted to their own territorial waters? Inspections – be they in the Bay of Biscay or in the Channel – will be carried out in future by teams of inspectors from several Member States. But common inspections also require harmonised sanctions. Member States who do not respect the common rules will face quota reductions, fishing effort reductions or cuts to their FIFG funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware that the sector will at first be wary of some aspects of this approach. We cannot hold this against them, because those who are directly affected by the fisheries policy have traditionally been excluded from any decision-making. So, here too, we must find a new approach and make the sector our first and most important policy adviser. To achieve this, all our decisions must be transparent and understandable, so that fishermen no longer feel they are in 'Animal Farm', where everyone is equal but some are more equal than others.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to promote dialogue at international level, especially between the European Union and the countries with which we have fisheries agreements. Our strategy for worldwide fisheries includes an action plan to combat illegal fishing, better assessment of the stocks available to EU ships outside EU waters and an integrated policy concept for partnerships in fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in summary, our first reform package contains our future objectives and our reform proposals on stock conservation, on integrating environmental objectives into fisheries policy, on fleet policy, on fisheries inspections and on combating illegal fishing. We shall soon come forward with further proposals and reports on the conservation of stocks in the Mediterranean, fishing outside EU waters, monitoring of fisheries, aquaculture, the integration of economic factors into fisheries policy and the restructuring of the fleet in coastal areas. According to our timetable, we should be ready to start implementing measures by 1 January 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">If we have the courage to take responsible decisions, there is hope: hope for sustainable fisheries, for balanced ecosystems, for greater independence for the sector and for economic and social stability in our coastal regions, which is why I call on you to do everything you can for fisheries reform. You can certainly count on my total commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Now a brief word, if I may, on various articles which appeared in today's press, stating that Vice-President Palacio Vallelersundi disagrees with the fisheries reform. A number of other articles have also been published along the same lines. To my mind, this is regrettable. I should like to make it clear that it is perfectly normal for a Commissioner to write to a colleague in the run up to a decision, although the choice of words in this letter was unfortunate. I should like to make one thing clear: if we are going to talk about provocation, then the only provocation, to my mind, is not being in a position to overhaul the fisheries sector! So let us keep to the business of reform in hand, so that this sector and the people working in it can be assured of a future.</p>

Of course, radical reform of the CFP was long overdue and the Commission is to be congratulated on producing a dynamic first package of proposals, particularly in view of the concerted effort to derail the reforms, which we were speaking about at the beginning of this meeting, and the attendant storm of controversy that this clumsy bullying tactic created.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the proposals to make permanent the 6 and 12-mile zones which are essential safeguards for fisheries. I am delighted to see significant devolution of management and conservation controls to the Member States within these zones. Indeed, devolution of management is a core feature of these CFP reform proposals. The creation of regional advisory councils involving fishermen, scientists, representatives of the aquaculture sector, marine ecologists and even the recreational angling sector, together with regional politicians represents a breakthrough in stakeholder involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">I applaud the bravery of the Commission in demanding an immediate end to the bizarre spectacle of subsidising modernisation and new building of vessels in some Member States, while subsidising the scrapping of vessels in others. We all know that there are far too many fishermen chasing too few fish. We all know the EU fleet capacity must be cut. We must therefore insist that all public aid be switched from modernisation and restructuring and new building to scrapping.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as regards overall capacity reduction in the EU fleet there is great concern about the Commission's figures. According to my calculations, on a country-by-country basis, the northern Member States who have fished primarily in the North Sea, the Baltic and the Atlantic will suffer a 21.3% cut in gross tonnage. Meanwhile, the southern Member States who fish in the Mediterranean, the Adriatic and the Bay of Biscay will experience only a 9.2% cut in gross tonnage.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking individual examples, the UK will be required to scrap 23.1%, Belgium 25.3%, Denmark 27.3% and Sweden will face a staggering loss of 49.7% of her gross tonnage. Meanwhile, Spain, with by far the largest fleet in the EU, escapes with only a 9.4% cut and Italy with the second largest fleet only suffers a cut of 7.3%.</p>
<p class="contents">People are wondering if the Commission has bowed to bullying pressure from Spain. We will closely scrutinise these figures in the committee. The Commissioner said that we do not want to go down the road of everyone being equal, but some people being more equal than others – that seems to be exactly the road we are going down with these proposed cuts.</p>

This is traditional practice in a democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall take advantage of this occasion to say, Mr President, after listening to the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries of this Parliament, that I have very little confidence in his neutrality when it comes to carrying out an impartial investigation, after what he has said, because the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries has to represent Parliament’s interests as a whole, and not make his own calculations on what could concern one country or another.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If you will allow me, Mr President, I should like to say that we are facing a problem with regard to the reform of the common fisheries policy, but there is also a constitutional problem apparent: in the Council, a President-in-Office of the Council saying that he gives instructions to the Commission; in the Commission, a very clear, public and well-known division, which we found out about from the press. The Commission made the decision yesterday without appearing before Parliament, yet revealed all to the press. The only way we have of finding out about such matters is by buying newspapers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am going to ask just one question of the Commissioner, based on the fact that Parliament has an enormous responsibility in trying to defend the interests of all Europeans, starting with fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that this report does not discuss economic and social cohesion; it does not talk about the social fabric in coastal areas, which are also European; it does not talk about sustainable development; it does not include aquiculture, and does not talk about consumers, who also have rights, and furthermore, we all agree with doctors when they tell us that, to improve our diet, we need to eat more fish.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, the only question I would like to ask the Commissioner is the following: why not apply all those principles he claims to defend in the reform of the common agricultural policy to the reform of fisheries? If we say that this is multi-dimensional, that it has to defend citizens, the landscape, the culture and all those aspects that shape European life, why should this be defended in agriculture but not in fisheries?</p>

In its resolution on the green paper, Parliament asked for a policy that would strike a balance between the needs of environmental sustainability and of fisheries as a socio-economic sector. Indeed, the very future of that sector depends on our commitment today to the conservation of stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree that there is an urgent need to reduce fishing effort, and that this has to be effected in part by a reduction of capacity. It must, however, be done in an equitable manner, as well as in a way that reflects the actual state of the different stocks. Nor can we expect sustainability to be achieved through decommissioning alone. We need a clear picture of the other measures that are planned towards this end and how they will combine to bring it about.</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly, the promised long-term approach, setting multi-annual catch targets, will be a major improvement and help to solve the problem of discards. The proposals also bring good news, not just for juvenile fish but for other vulnerable species such as dolphins, sea birds and sharks.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome too the intention to bring about better enforcement of the rules and the action planned to fight illegal fishing and ensure sustainable fisheries beyond EU waters. The retention of the 6 to 12 mile limit will assist in development of conservation measures and do much to protect the coastal fishing on which many of our fragile communities depend. Confirmation from the Commissioner that the new regulation on these limits will definitively be in place by 1 January 2003 would be of great comfort.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that the establishment of regional advisory panels will do much to encourage responsible conservation measures, although the role of such councils needs some clarification. We understand that the withdrawal of public aid for fleet modernisation and renewal will not be acceptable to everyone, but we believe that it is only logical in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the exception for safety is again welcome provided it is indeed for safety alone. We are particularly glad that the monies will be converted into a substantial social package to ameliorate the effects of the measures on the livelihoods of those currently engaged in fishing. It has always been a matter of concern that decommissioning measures do nothing to assist the crews of fishing vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">If we get things right, we shall sustain both fish and fishers to harvest them. If not, we may have neither and future generations may find it very hard to forgive us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The accent on conservation and sustainability must of course be central to the CFP. Multi-species and multi-annual management is welcome. Efforts to create a level playing field in enforcement are welcome. Technical conservation measures and their development are welcome. Of course, fleet capacity needs to be brought more in line with available resources. I take it that the Commissioner can confirm today that recent efforts in certain areas will be taken into account in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the 6 and 12 mile limit retention, but beyond 12 miles I have some very serious concerns about the wording of the documents in relation to access to waters and resources and in relation to relative stability. Is the Commission saying that equal access will bring equal access to fishing opportunities in our waters? Is the document really saying that relative stability keys will be perennially open for review? Does the Commission envisage additional Member States gaining quota in areas where they have none at the moment – for example, in the North Sea?</p>
<p class="contents">The wording of the document in that particular chapter points towards relative instability rather than the stability which was intended. There is at least a possibility that the otherwise good intentions of the conservation proposals in the document could well be undermined. So I am looking for major and clear assurances of intent in that area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is undeniable that some fishing-grounds are in a difficult situation, but it is surprising that the Commission can find no solution other than to dismantle the fisheries sector and related jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is surprising that so little attention has been paid to technical measures for regenerating stocks and that industrial fishing should have been exempted from fleet reduction measures. It would seem that industrial fleets fishing indiscriminately for huge quantities of fish to feed animals have no effect on marine resources, while fishing to feed human beings, which generates employment and has greater added value, is what depletes the fishing-grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has tried to give this biased, partisan proposal an ecological gloss. It is surprising that greater fleet reduction is being imposed on countries which have fulfilled the obligations of the MAGPs without imposing additional obligations on those which have not fulfilled them, or have even increased their fleet capacity – and I shall not name names. Forget that structural actions are planned up until the year 2006. It is surprising that the Commission dares to withdraw the public aid granted for the modernisation of vessels agreed on at the Berlin Council. The real problem is a social one. The Commission proposal will result in the loss of a tremendous number of jobs in areas dependent on fishing, which are on the periphery of the European Union and have a high level of unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must be aware that it should have made balanced proposals, that the fisheries policy is unlikely to progress under this measure, as it is unlikely to enter into force and meanwhile, Commissioner, we shall continue to waste valuable time that could be used to solve the problems of the fishing sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gallagher (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, I had hoped that the extra time taken by the Commission to fine-tune the proposals would have resulted in documents which would fully reflect the concerns raised by this House when we adopted our opinion earlier this year. I had hoped that they would pay particular attention to the social and economic implications for those regions on the periphery of the Union. These areas are heavily dependent on fishing, as by and large there is no alternative source of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to say that I have been disappointed with what the Commission has produced after its long deliberations at many levels. Instead of carefully crafted measures which would address the real problems affecting the fishing industry, the Commission has delivered what can only be described as a blunt instrument which, if adopted, would fail to protect fish stocks or to address the issue of fishing effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland fully meets the legal commitments under the multi-annual guidance programmes. Our fishing fleets keep within the legally imposed TACs and quotas on fleet sizes. In this context, it is totally unacceptable for the Commission to put forward proposals that would penalise all countries for the sins of a few. I do not have time to refer to the sins of those greedy countries, the Member States from other parts of the Union that try to exploit the fishing resources in areas far from home.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals underline an 8.5% reduction in fishing fleet. This is being somewhat economical with the facts. It may be a reduction of 8.5% in the fishing fleet but it is a reduction of at least 18% in capacity. The Commission's proposals to forbid all state aid for the upgrading of the fleet is nothing short of irresponsible. The essence of fleet renewal policy is to improve the safety and living conditions on board ships, not to improve the capacity or the effectiveness. Failure to do this would be a dereliction of duty and we must insist on the right of Member States to continue the policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I am extremely disappointed that the Commission have not reinstated the policy prior to December 2001 – that was the safety capacity clause. How can the Commission claim to advocate a safer working environment for fishermen and crew members while at the same time penalising the owners of the vessels who want to carry out measures to improve safety on board? In simple terms, if you want to put a whaleback on a vessel to protect the crew and create a safer environment, you are now penalised. The Commission must take this into consideration and be much more reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that these Commission proposals are just that. It is fortunate that the watchdogs of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament will be there to protect fish stocks and also, but equally as importantly, to protect the interests of fishermen from areas, where, as I said at the outset, there is no alternative source of employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Council Regulation No 3760/92 established the framework upon which the CFP rests. Of course, at its core is equal access to Community waters which was derogated until 1 January 2003. Only at this point will the CFP fully come into force. So what we are actually seeing here is the final stage of implementation of the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">After 30 years of meddling by the Commission and in-fighting by Member States, what we now have is a world-class ecological disaster and the near destruction of many parts of the British fishing industry. This itself is graphic testimony to the abject failure of the measures thus far implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">But instead of new measures to deal with it all, what we are now seeing is a complete contradiction. Bound by treaty obligations to afford equal access, which effectively means allowing the Spanish fleet into the rest of British waters, against that, we see: relative stability. Relative stability is based on track record; equal access is based on fleet tonnages. They are in fact opposite things. They cannot exist side by side. That crucial point alone demonstrates that these proposals are a political fudge.</p>
<p class="contents">Not surprisingly, therefore, Mr Fischler's colleague, Mrs De Palacio, has expressed global reserve on every aspect of the proposed reform and I share that global reserve. Nothing that the Commissioner has offered addresses the fundamental flaw and that is that it is a common policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The only fisheries policies that have been successful around the world are those that are managed exclusively by sovereign nation states. Thus, the only real option is to abolish the CFP. Politics and fishing just do not mix. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, due to the almost total failure of previous policies, I am of the opinion that control of fishing activities should be better returned to the elected governments of Member States with the return of control over their former national territorial waters.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals are unfairly weighted against United Kingdom fishermen with a reduction in tonnage of 29% compared to 20% for France, 12% for Spain and 2% for Greece. Fish stocks are a truly natural resource and should be renewable for all time. With regard to land-based food chains, we have to sow and breed as well as harvest and process. With fish, we merely hunt them down. We must not allow ourselves to fish selfishly or to hunt them down to extinction. It would be an act of cynicism for Member States to dilute these proposals further. We not only need friends of fishing; but more importantly, we need friends of fish.</p>
<p class="contents">This is probably the last opportunity for European countries to show a clear determination to deal with these chances effectively.

They do not want to share, and are using the excuse of environmental fundamentalism which puts fish before human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we are in favour of conserving stocks, more so than you, as your proposals do not prioritise radical scientific reform, which has to be the very basis of the system, you relegate it to second place, to a second package. Big mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, you allow the scandalous squandering of over a million tonnes of fish which one Member State destroys each year to convert into animal feed without asking how this affects the food chain of the species. That is not conservationism. You promise us studies, but we have had a fisheries policy for twenty years and you are still promising us studies. This is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to divide up all available resources scientifically and update the level of dependency of the European regions, which is another thing you have failed to do. You have admitted that the studies are incomplete. A reform of this calibre cannot be tackled with incomplete studies of the extent of the dependency of the regions. Some fishing grounds are being reserved solely for certain States. Boats are being scrapped as if starting from scratch, as if some States had not already scrapped fifty per cent of their fleet while others have increased theirs. The reform goes against the social cohesion policy laid down until the year 2006, preventing economic operators from continuing with the activities they had planned in Objective 1 regions. They are not asking you for more money, Mr Fischler, but rather to carry on fishing. They want to continue to fish, they can continue and the European Union needs them to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to foreign policy, Mr Fischler, you have broken your promise to Parliament that your reform would give equal treatment to shipbuilders and the northern agreements and shipowners and the southern agreements. You have not done this. You have restricted commercial agreements with third parties and outlawed mixed companies, thereby undermining the global position of the European fleet, increasing the vulnerability of our industry and making us more dependent on imports. This is a political error of the first order, an error on a scale never before seen in fisheries policy, and if we do not change this and make the sector more European, you will be sounding the death knell of an entire economic and social sector of strategic importance to the European Union.</p>

The fishermen are complaining that the Commission has not included their opinions in its proposal for a reform, nor has it included the opinions of Parliament on this matter, given in January this year. What is more, this proposal was adopted yesterday by the members of the Commission by simple majority in the absence of four Commissioners, and with no guarantee that it has the necessary qualified majority in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is acting outside the sector. A French shipowner told me less than ten minutes ago that the Commission hears but does not listen. Any reform of a basic policy such as fisheries must, in order to be credible, ensure the survival of the sector and an improvement in the living and working conditions of those concerned. The Commission proposals are far from seeking a balance between conservation of stocks, the efficiency of the fleet, maintaining jobs and economic activity in fishing regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does take account of the well-intentioned concerns of environmentalist groups, but puts them before those of the fishing world itself and shamelessly sacrifices basic principles of the European Union, such as economic and social cohesion, in regions that are heavily dependent on fishing, all of which are Objective 1 regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as socialists, call for the sustainable management of stocks, but we believe that this can only take place if the fishermen are involved. With this plan, stocks will have been replenished within ten years so that Europeans can look at them in a display case, and we shall all be eating imported fish.</p>
<p class="contents">The twenty-eight thousand jobs that you are already saying will be lost are only the tip of the iceberg. Fishing generates many more jobs, directly and indirectly, which are not counted in the document presented by the Commissioner. His proposal goes beyond fishing. It concerns a neoliberal reform to scrap boats, which clears the way for a CFP that is neither Community-minded, as it turns its back on European solidarity and increases the North-South divide, nor is it political, as the Commission refuses to exercise its powers, and nor does it have the interests of fisheries at heart as it condemns the sector it is meant to protect, and in particular coastal fishermen, to extinction.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, Commissioner, will therefore work in Parliament and the Committee on Fisheries as of today, the day on which we have seen the texts, together with the sector, together with the other groups represented in Parliament, listening to anyone who wants to talk to us to work towards a reform that is gradual, that is established by consensus and that is properly financed, because we believe that a sector of the vital strategic importance of fishing in the European Union cannot be condemned to die out.</p>

Concerning control and enforcement, I share your view about international uniform control on a level playing field. </p>
<p class="contents">I have a few critical comments to make. First of all, it is beyond me why the Commission wants to allow EU countries to fish for ‘free’ species in the North Sea without any restrictions. That is just asking for trouble. What is required here is a balance. Secondly, you claim that, in principle, the polluter pays. This is indeed stated in the document and is also correct, but we must, however, not lose touch with the facts or reality. We must not get fishermen to foot the bill for natural phenomena. Next I would like to turn my attention to the multi-annual programme: I have no objections to it, as long as we remember the lessons from the past. I would urge you to use effective assessments and minimise red tape. </p>

For far too long the EU has sent its distant water fishing vessels to scour the oceans off Africa and other areas where they can cause immense harm to fish stocks and to local artisanal fishing communities. We have to clean up our own house without transferring our problems to those who are economically worse off than ourselves and who are desperate for any money they can get.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischler has stated that the EU must work for sustainable fishing wherever EU fleets operate and we shall hold him to that goal. In relation to the over-capacity of EU fleets, I would like to ask the Commission how it feels about the announcement by the Irish Government yesterday for a EUR 56 million investment package for EU vessels? This conflicts quite strongly with what the Commission is trying to do. If the Irish Government is allowed to go ahead with this, how would it square with other Member States who could follow suit and do exactly the same? This is at complete odds with what the Commission is trying to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in relation to the whole saga regarding Spain's involvement in recent weeks in the reform of the fisheries policy – and a Spanish minister actually admitting on television that he was ordering his commissioners what do to – this goes completely against the EU's rules. This entire saga needs to be properly and thoroughly investigated because, forgive the pun, as far as I can see, the whole thing is very fishy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Environmental protection is being used as an excuse for a proposal to dramatically cut fishing effort, with measures designed to reduce the level of catches and to reward the decommissioning of fishing vessels, without taking proper account of the specific circumstances and needs of each country. It is being overlooked, for example, that Portugal is the Member State that has already far exceeded the objectives for reducing fishing effort, while maintaining an ageing fleet – around 40% of its vessels are over 25 years old – and which has the lowest average yield in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, what the Commission is promising is more incentives for decommissioning fishing vessels, with 287 in Portugal or a reduction of around 12 thousand tonnes in gross tonnage, whereas what Portugal needed was to increase support for modernising its fleet with a view to supplying a population which is the biggest per capita consumer of fish in the European Union, which also makes Portugal a very attractive market for multinationals. But this is not in the interest of Portugal's population or of workers in the strategic fisheries sector, which is now under such enormous threat. We are therefore rejecting the proposal and proposing that there should be a wholesale review of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This plan is, first and foremost, characteristic of a dreadful supranational approach, demonstrating an off-hand technocratic arrogance that could spell – following a broad consultation of professionals for the sake of appearances – the condemnation pure and simple of an industry due to the widespread abusive use of deficient and questionable technical assessments, that are both incomplete, biased and often misleading. I refer you to the cases of anchovy and black pollack in the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">This plan is absurd and contradictory: although it claims to conserve fish stocks, it actually condemns one of the most restrictive and cautious fishing industries in terms of conserving fish stocks, to the advantage of third country fleets, which show the least respect for conservation, and which will be called on, if we support Mr Fischler, to supply, almost single-handedly, Europe’s booming fish market. This plan is dangerous because it is unworkable. It is based on a key concept, namely fishing effort, which cannot be measured by any reliable indicator or statistical instrument – and you are aware of this, Commissioner Fischler. Lastly, the plan reflects the growing contradictions within the Union and the danger of adopting uniform solutions for European industries. What gives those Member States that have sacrificed their coastal fishing for the sake of industrial fishing, the right to prevent those that wish to preserve coastal fishing as a fundamental element of their identity and land management from doing so?</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need the powerful forces within our Member States to come together, we need genuine action from those who support fishing, to call for the Council to condemn unequivocally, on 11 June, the new CFP proposed by Mr Fischler and to demand an ambitious plan in its place. This plan must be the exact opposite of the Commission’s assumptions: which are the unsubstantiated prediction of a disastrous future for fish stocks and the refusal to take into account the fact that other factors apart from fishing affect these stocks. By recognising our lack of knowledge regarding fish stocks, which was in fact admitted in the Commission’s Green Paper, this voluntary plan must provide for considerable development of independent research at the Commission and close cooperation between professionals and scientists. We can thus refine the quota system and make the destruction of new vessels unnecessary. This plan must also include the essential element of fleet modernisation, which fishermen themselves are not in a position to undertake. Public aid is therefore necessary and legitimate if we wish to avoid further accidents caused by ageing vessels. Like the agriculture plan, this plan, Mr President, must provide for the ‘setting-up of young fishermen’ and ‘traceability’ from the fisherman to the consumer. This is the only way to preserve coastal fishing which is of great importance to many Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This official support – I trust you are indeed supporting the reform, Mr Galeote – would be most welcome from all the honourable Members. Unfortunately, the fishing boat appears to have no one at the helm and there is a storm brewing, and not just in the Committee on Fisheries, unfortunately! Perhaps in future every Member of this House could explain exactly which hat they are wearing when they address us.</p>

<p class="contents">I was in the Spanish port of Vigo just yesterday. A few people said, 'Keep up the good work, girl!', but there are widely differing views on the matter there. Alarm bells are going off in all directions. I hope that everyone speaking on fisheries here today and tomorrow is up for integration.

I am also pleased to see that little has been changed from the original objectives of reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing common fisheries policy has failed to achieve its objectives. It fails to provide an adequate living for many fishermen and, at the same time, it fails to conserve fish stocks for present and future generations. We have to make hard choices. In the new CFP, we must cut the existing EU fleet; however the EU should not make a blanket cut but take into account the different sizes of the EU national fleets.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the Scottish fleet has already shrunk in recent years to a more sustainable size. We must see an end to the subsidising of boat-building and put this money into helping fishermen who are coming out of the industry to find new employment. We must see the retention of the 6 and 12-mile limits as proposed by the Commission – most Member States agree that these act as a safeguard for coastal regions especially dependent on fishing – with much closer involvement of the fishing industry via the new regional advisory councils in the development and operation of fisheries management measures. We must seriously examine the problem of discards and we need improved inspection and enforcement standards across the Community and an equalising of these standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need better agreement on fishing in developing countries' waters, based on sound science to prevent over-exploitation of stocks. I look forward to the next six months. The sooner we get a conclusion, the better. Time is short, but if the will is there I am confident we can have a CFP fit for this century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 1986, the fishing fleet of the peninsula has been reduced by half and if the new measures are finally implemented, the days of the Basque fishermen will be numbered.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on the advice of scientists and seamen, the Commission should clarify first the scale of the impact on fish stocks from industrial and rural pollution, nuclear waste and tanker shipwrecks. For that, more time is needed.

This is the kind of language I can identify with. He also indicated that the fisheries policy must aim to strike a balance between economic, ecological and social conditions. But what is crucial is that there will not be a fisheries policy at all if there are little or no fish stocks. </p>
<p class="contents">Some stocks have experienced a dramatic decline. We must acknowledge this, and this means that measures must be taken. The multi-annual guidance programme has failed. Given the current situation, we cannot continue to grant premiums for new constructions in the shipbuilding industry. I subscribe to this approach and this clear stance. </p>
<p class="contents">I also subscribe to the Commissioner’s view that quota control must be stricter. This is the Achilles’ heel of the European fisheries policy. This control must be stricter, and I hope that we can sum up the courage as a Parliament to tighten this control by making sufficient financial means available for this purpose. I also hope that we can summon the courage to implement the fisheries policy by considering each fish stock situation individually and tailoring our fleet and quota policy to these accordingly. We should call an end to cattle-market-style wheeling and dealing among Member States with regard to the way in which the quota is handled from year to year, and I applaud the fact that we might be moving towards a multi-annual system for quotas. </p>
<p class="contents">I do believe that painful measures should go hand in hand with adequate financing measures. It is not acceptable for one Member State to support the social programme by means of co-financing and not the other. Ideally, when implementing these measures, I would like to see co-financing abandoned and replaced by direct financing by the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">I have another critical comment in this regard. It is insufficiently clear to what extent Member States with no access to the North Sea and no quota at present will have this in future. Surely it would make no sense if a number of Member States around the North Sea were to be heavily affected by the shrinking fishing fleet, while other Member States were given access. This does not add up. You cannot turn the tap off at one location, only to open it at another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot accept a purely predatory attitude as if we were still living in prehistoric times but hunting with twenty-first century technology. There is no longer any reason for fishing to continue as a predatory activity. Nevertheless, the reform process has got off to a bad start, Commissioner Fischler, it has got bogged down in polemics and started off rather farcically, to put it mildly. Which means that it is already mortally wounded, which is a shame. It is attracting the opposition of those it is intended to help, who are up in arms.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform process needs objectivity and a calm and pedagogical approach, not the climate of guerrilla warfare that has broken out. Furthermore, this reform is too brutal and is being attacked by those it affects. It is an unbalanced reform which keeps the fishing industry of some countries intact. It is an unfair reform because it does not take into account on the one hand those who have flouted the rules and on the other those who have respected the policies established up to now in this field. It is a reform without any particularly rigorous scientific basis. That is what everyone is saying.

Most of the governments have not given a reaction to these proposals, which aim to sustain fisheries in the future. Now that we can see stocks are being exhausted – between one and two thirds of hake, cod and whiting have disappeared – we now have our backs to the wall. We must therefore thoroughly reform the instrument, which must become less aggressive and more selective, to avoid, in particular, by-catches which sometimes make up 80% of a haul, including juvenile fish.</p>
<p class="contents">Each Member State will apply this European directive, which has been drawn up in the general interest, in the way it considers best. Instead of quite devastating industrial fishing practices, we, the Greens, are calling for coastal fishing that is more capable of safeguarding jobs. Considerably greater sums than those currently allocated to cover the social compensation of this policy will certainly need to be made available. We are not in favour of taking blind administrative steps. These must be determined in conjunction with the Regional Advisory Councils proposed by the Commission, made up of professionals, labour experts, scientists and civil societies that can adapt them to the specific problems on the ground. This should enable us not only to salvage something from this situation but, more importantly, to provide the fishing industry with a new impetus and the sustainable development that is essential to our economic as well as human stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first criticism I have of the Commission proposal is that it does not take account of the diverse make-up of the European Union's fishing fleet: some countries’ fleets consist mainly of large vessels used for industrial fishing and other countries which have predominantly small vessels. In Portugal, 90% of the present fishing fleet consists of vessels less than 12 metres long used for small-scale coastal fishing. As around 40% of these vessels are over 25 years old, the overwhelming majority of our fishermen will be unable to modernise and make their activity viable unless they receive support from the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">My second major criticism is about a fundamental issue that affects all these proposals, and which relates to the way in which the various countries have complied with the objectives laid down in the multiannual guidance programmes, the MAGPs. There are some countries that have complied with these objectives, and there are others, as with Portugal, which have even exceeded those objectives by 30%, whilst there are others still that have not only failed to comply with their objectives but have even increased the capacity of their fleet. Furthermore, I would like to remind you that since Portugal joined the European Union in 1986, the Portuguese fleet has been reduced by 45% and total catches cut by 50%. Given these figures, I do not think it is fair to ask us to make further sacrifices when there are countries that have increased their fleets. So because the Commission's proposals do not take account of this recent history, they not only involve robbing Peter to pay Paul, but worse still they reward those who have flouted the rules in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Commissioner, I would like to say that it is a mistake to try to rush a reform, because that is always a recipe for disaster. The issue of the sustainability of resources is very serious, but it should not be used as an excuse for doing things hastily and giving insufficient weight to human and social aspects, and above all imposing an unfair balance. Nothing has been said about fishmeal, the ultra-peripheral regions or illegal fishing. And I hope that the reactions to the Commission's proposals will mean that aspects that have not been examined will now be reconsidered, leading to a more balanced reform covering all aspects of the problem. That is why we need to wait a little longer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In your proposals, and quite apart from the many positive aspects that they contain – I am thinking in particular of the areas of control and sanctions, on which everyone seems to agree – there are two points that we see as essential which have not been taken into account. The first point is the reference to total allowable catches, the infamous TACs, and the question of quotas, which should remain the cornerstone of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I would like to highlight, one that has not been taken into account, one that has almost been disregarded, is that of economic and social cohesion in this sector and the consequences for local employment, both direct and indirect employment. The only social measures envisaged are retirement or hypothetical retraining plans. Nothing is envisaged for the youngest generations, to train them, to improve working conditions, and therefore to provide investments in safety on vessels. It is unacceptable to propose the protection of species, fish in this case, as the sole criterion in formulating a policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the guarantee of sustainability, in any area, is the result of a balance between economic objectives and environmental objectives, of course, but also between social objectives. For a Community policy, a common policy, to be understood and accepted, it must be based on a comprehensive approach, which is not so in the case of the proposals that you are making today for fisheries. I feel that more needs to be said on the subject of the social objectives, including the danger of consigning the social objectives to European Union policies which are now a basic cause of mistrust and, at worst, rejection, of Europe on the part of the citizens. The impact of the measures on regions dependant on fisheries has not been taken into sufficient account and the proposals you have laid before us today will have to be reviewed to eliminate this imbalance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Do you know where Barbate is, or Isla Cristina? Do you know where Ayamonte, Almería or Motril are? Do you know anything about Andalusia other than the bitterness of its green olives?</p>
<p class="contents">Without wanting to be harsh, Commissioner, you have set a new record in terms of proposals to destroy employment which will be difficult to break.</p>
<p class="contents">Have you or anyone from your team considered that your proposals for reforming the CFP only add to the effect of the failure of the disastrous negotiation with Morocco to renew a traditional fisheries agreement that would prevent the destruction of thousands of small-scale fishing jobs?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you globalised fishing in the south of Europe, and ensured that the place occupied by a small-scale fleet, under an agreement between Morocco and the European Union, which respected biological rest periods and maintained very close control of nets and meshes, should now be taken in these fishing grounds by a fleet which does not respect rest periods, and whose nets are not controlled at all. A proportion of their catches is not landed and they do not generate local employment, as the Community fleet did.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you have presented a proposed CFP which perfectly quantifies the scrappings and the job losses, but leaves it completely unclear what the solutions to alleviating the social and economic problems caused by your proposal are to be. Do you know where the money we need is going to come from? The intention is that we now incorporate unemployed fishermen into the tourism sector. More hotels, more golf courses, Commissioner? Is this what you call sustainable development? Is this what diversifying the economies of the regions means? Do you realise that when you prohibit modernisation you also prohibit the sustainability of fishing, a form of fishing that is more respectful of the environment, of those fishing grounds that fishermen have most interest in respecting?</p>
<p class="contents">Through your proposals you are destroying the only fleet that generates employment and also respects the environment; the small-scale fleet. They also prohibit the creation of mixed undertakings, the only solution which allowed us to resolve the problems resulting from cases such as Morocco. Although we are going to make the scrap merchants richer, I suppose!</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, your proposal will not only affect the traditional employment and culture of peoples you do not know, but it will also considerably increase the cost to consumers of one of the essential ingredients of the Mediterranean diet, a healthy and balanced diet, without cholesterol, which as a result of your proposals we will lose in favour of the junk food which is so popular in the North of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quite apart from the many compliments and congratulations you have received in this House, I do not envy you because, I regret to say, you have come here today to declare the failure of a policy. At least from the human point of view, therefore, you have my heartfelt sympathy.</p>
<p class="contents">How have you declared the failure of the fisheries policy? In a nutshell, you said that we had spent money on reducing the fishing effort, and we see that these funds have, in actual fact, served to increase it; you said that we had spent money on preserving fish stocks, and – on the basis of the figures you have disclosed, although we were not able to see them – fish stocks have become completely impoverished; you said we had spent money on limiting the social impact on this sector in terms of employment, and today you have told us that 66 thousand jobs have been lost and 28 thousand are likely to be lost in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, Commissioner, there is one initial question that has, in any case, to be asked: Why, if these were the results – and these results were plain for you to see – has the Commission so persistently defended this common fisheries policy for so long? This is a very pertinent question.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise and I can see from the proposals you have put forward that an attempt is being made to change this approach, but I will not go into details as we are wont to do on specific proposals for there is no time for that now. I will just make one, very strong recommendation, that I would like the Commission to take into consideration: we must not repeat our past error; we must not see fishermen as the enemies of sustainable development, the enemies of the endeavour to preserve a balance. They are our main allies, they are your main allies. If we – if you, first and foremost – do not involve them in defining the goals and managing the rules we set in place, then no goal will be achievable. Regionalisation is one of the key requirements from this point of view, for our attempt to manage this policy through centralisation has failed.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another subject I care deeply about: the Mediterranean. You have not presented to us today the proposals which had been announced as imminent. When you do so, I will endeavour to understand the situation and to express my opinion and the opinion of my country on that part of fisheries policy too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not like the route we took. However, there was not much we could do about that. We have to accept the present common fisheries policy has ended in failure. We all know that.</p>
<p class="contents">We must come to the conclusion, that our responsibility, as Mr Stevenson has said, is to get down to the substance and work with the Commission and the Council to come forward with a policy that hopefully will be infinitely better than the previous one.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that we are going to give more responsibility to local fishermen closer to the areas in which they work. I want to see real responsibility, and not a minimal consultation because if that is what we end up with it will not work. Yes, we all recognise there has to be a reduction in capacity and we must have a sustainable fishing industry and a fishing fleet at the end of all of this. We must develop a policy that will work.</p>
<p class="contents">For years, the UK Government has totally failed fishermen and the fishing industry. I want the Commissioner to ensure that whatever is brought in is unified throughout the European Union and is financed in a unified way so that no one Member State can pour in more money than another to support their particular industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot deal with every point here today. We might like to do so, but we cannot. We all recognise that the livelihoods of everyone involved in these industries is at stake and I have no doubt that we will all work to try and resolve that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, I would like to put the point to you which I put in committee last week. I asked you to outline the substance of the report that has changed since Mr Smith was dismissed from office. You agreed that you would inform the Committee on Fisheries. Will you stand by that and tell us what substantial changes have been made to the report since Mr Smith was dismissed? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It now proposes that this failure should be paid for by the sector, not the whole sector, but rather the fishermen of the Mediterranean countries, who fish for human consumption, not for the manufacture of meal, who have made the greatest sacrifices in recent years by constantly reducing their fleet and who are now bearing the cost of this proposal. A cost, by the way, which your colleague responsible for the budget wants nothing to do with. So where are you going to get the EUR 240 million you need to incentivise the scrappings between 2003 and 2006? Are you going to get them from the Structural Funds?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you of a figure produced by your own services. Between 1996 and 2000, Spain, for example, was obliged to reduce its fleet by 88 000 tonnes, and during that same period, Denmark, for example, increased its fleet, thanks to Community aid, by 64 000 tonnes. These figures come from your services.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you intend to reassure the sector by saying that the fishermen of Spain and Portugal, after 17 years of waiting, will have access to the fishing grounds of the North Atlantic? That is guaranteed in the Act of Accession which, so far, the European Commission cannot modify.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner mentioned differences within the Commission, which he described as normal; what is not normal is that there should be such a pronounced geographical division between the three institutions. And since the World Cup is about to start, we could say that the score according to your proposal, Mr Commissioner, is ‘the North 1 – the South 0’, but we are at the beginning of the match and we hope that you will be a fair and unbiased referee. That is the important thing. What are trivial are certain speeches we heard at the beginning of this debate, which put domestic political interests before the future of thousands of families in Galicia or Andalusia, which is quite simply disgraceful, and I regret that the people or person who said that are absent. There is no institutional crisis here, but a personal crisis, a crisis of attitudes, a crisis which suggests that those who speak in this way will be in opposition for many years, to the benefit of everybody and in particular the fishermen of my country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, honoured guests, I have listened very attentively to the debate and should like to comment on a number of important points raised, especially where there are obviously still ambiguities. But before I do, I have a request. I understand full well that parliamentary debate is rooted in polemics. But I think that the verbal radicalism of terms such as 'death sentence' and 'execution' do not become this House.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on you to bring the debate back to basics, because the problems are big enough, without inflating them artificially. I think we should keep sight of what Mrs Langenhagen said: we are not moving towards war! All we want to do is bring about a situation which holds greater promise for the future of our fish stocks and for the future of our fisheries sector than they have experienced over recent years. And we need to work together on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think we should play the old North-South card, Mr Galeote, and say that the score is currently 1 – 0 to the North. I fail to see that. If anything, the starting whistle has only just been blown and we should play as a team and be aware of the fact that we have to prevent these traditional standoffs which have often caused difficulties in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Stevenson quoted a number of figures. You should, in fact, just let the figures speak for themselves and quote figures which are properly backed up. You can read the real numbers of ships per Member State on page 49 of the resource management regulation, Sir.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like us to clarify exactly what we mean by scientific. The purpose of science is not to conduct a mammoth project upstream of the reform and then operate reform management; the purpose of science is to accompany fisheries policy. And that is exactly what our proposals set out to do. Mr Baron Crespo asked why the fisheries policy is not subject to the same rules as the common agricultural policy. Unfortunately, he is no longer here, but could someone please tell him that exactly the same rules apply. The basic principle for the future of both policies is sustainability in all three dimensions and we want to keep it that way.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also wrong to say that we no longer care about the safety of fishermen and the safety of boats. We have made express provision to continue supporting investments in safety equipment on board ships in the future. There is no change here; on the contrary, we want to put heavier assistance in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the important matter of access to fishing grounds. There appear to be a number of misunderstandings or perhaps misinterpretations here. First, the provision which is still contained in the accession agreements of Spain and Portugal is due to run out at the end of this year. When it does, it will guarantee that these two countries no longer have to accept specific restrictions, can no longer be discriminated against and will have access to fishing grounds. But do not forget that access to fishing grounds is not the same as access to fish! When a transitional provision runs out, it means that Community law must be applied without discrimination. And that is what we shall do, no more no less, because we are obliged to do so. It needed no special mention in the reform, because it goes without saying. But we mentioned it nonetheless, just to be clear.</p>
<p class="contents">A further difficulty is that the impression appears to have been created that we want to use our new fleet policy to punish countries which voluntarily did more in the past than they were required to. First, we must not forget that our fleet in Europe is too big and anyone who disputes that is burying their head in the sand.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are sanctions for anyone who fails to comply with the requirements already in force and the law now in force. They are expressly provided for in the proposals. For example, their fisheries effort will be reduced. Countries which have voluntarily done more are at a huge advantage under the new system, because the fisheries effort allocated to the individual Member States in the future can then be allocated to the fleet in a way which makes greater economic sense and will not result in any one particular ship being given enough days at sea to be able to fish sensibly. That is the main difference, which is why it really has paid off for Member States who have not just complied with the requirements of the current law but have even gone beyond them.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no wish to comment further on the calls in various guises for fisheries policy to be renationalised. If you want to shoot yourself in the foot, then go ahead, but I cannot see that this will get us anywhere worth talking of. We need a common fisheries policy, one policy for all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Another subject which appears to keep making everyone hot under the collar is industrial fisheries. It is true that important quantities of fish meal will continue to be produced, but not least so that it can be used as fish food on fish farms. In other words, without fish meal there can be practically no aquaculture and we should not forget that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, industrial fisheries concentrate on species which are of no nutritional value to human beings, meaning there is no competition between industrial fisheries and fisheries for human consumption. Naturally, industrial fisheries will be subject to the same restrictions and the same standards as any other type of fisheries. We really cannot be accused of failing to thoroughly investigate the situation and the development problems of regions which are highly dependent on fisheries in the run up to this reform. We carried out 22 studies on these regions. The results are posted on the Internet for you to read any time you want. They have been for the last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of people getting the impression that we are introducing a sort of scrapping reform. Let us not get carried away here! Our proposals will probably reduce the fleet by 10%. One tenth! So there is no point in carrying on as if every ship were going to disappear! Nevertheless, we have changed one thing and that is that we are implementing these measures in a socially responsible manner by flanking this well-needed reduction with proper social measures. So if you want to accuse us of anything, it should be for our current, not our future policy!</p>
<p class="contents">Another point is the debate on artisanal fisheries and fisheries which use very large, very efficient ships. I really do feel – and I have said as much in the Commission – that we need to take proper account of this difference when we implement the policy. We must also safeguard some sort of future for artisanal fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">If you ask me what Director-General Smidt's departure has changed in the proposals, your question is wrong on two counts. First, Mr Smidt has not departed; he is still the Director-General of the Fisheries DG. Secondly, I can say with a certain degree of pride that the proposals have not substantially changed or been changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Galeote asked where the money will come from for the reform. As I said, some of the money will come from rethinking whether our structural programme for the fisheries sector, as it now stands, is the right programme and from reprogramming. Some of the money will come from the flexibility instrument. Some will be raised during the planned mid-term review. You only have to look at how far the take-up of money under the Structural Funds is behind schedule, namely over EUR 80 billion, to see that EUR 200 million is not going to break the bank.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing stands, however. If we ask ourselves, do we need reform? And Parliament has said that we do on several occasions. If we ask ourselves, do we have stock problems? Can we not keep going with the present resources? If we ask ourselves, should we reduce capacity? If we ask ourselves, do we have a social responsibility? Then we only have to look to the Commission proposal for an unequivocal answer to all these questions.</p>
