The European budget is effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP, especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy, which had already been cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP, the taxable basis for the fourth resource, have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, of course, this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is, but which it refuses to see itself as. This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us. It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources, the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States. This is a long way from offshoots such as the “Community criminal code”, the “European Public Prosecutor” or a European police force, with OLAF. There is as yet no federal European tax.</p>

<p class="contents">In recent years, the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably, increasing the risk of accidents. Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation. It therefore proved necessary, in the context of establishing the internal market, to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention. Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged, quite rightly, to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention, whether road, rail or inland waterway transport is involved. In order to facilitate achieving this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training. This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation, regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport.</p>
<p class="contents">While this represented significant progress at the time, the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem. It therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised, high-level training of safety advisers, but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training, with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different Member Sates.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised. It outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies. Parliament voted in favour of this text. It did, however, table a number of amendments, most of which were adopted in the Council’s common position, particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the ‘specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body’.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to be realistic, I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users, to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then. Essentially, my opinion is as follows: I deplore the fact that, in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods, we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment. I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997. This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999. This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the usual procedure, it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which puts forward standards in this area, and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR), applicable throughout Europe, whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted. Consequently, the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems, rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements, as should have been the case! This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail, except for the fact that a time limit had been decided. Right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals. Until then, there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted, and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards. They may, therefore, continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation, where there are no applicable European standards. They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation.</p>
<p class="contents">In offering this explanation of my vote, therefore, I wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always spent in a manner which maximises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster, I have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national EU funds. I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities. I believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of European Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, we have seen the success of the Leader I and Leader II schemes in Ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of Ireland and within Europe. The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year. The Leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public, private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas. This is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in Ireland. Once again, there is active participation from groups from the private, public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region. During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006, other EU initiatives such as "Equal" and "Urban" will be operating. These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes. They must promote a decentralised, efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities. This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national, European and local funding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to reduce disparities between regions, of course. But more especially because, even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy, it may also be a source of inequality. Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities. It is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model, which we are all in favour of, and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a real political objective, alongside economic and monetary affairs, drawn up in collaboration with Member States, regions and local communities, with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I shall support this report, despite regretting the fact that, for timetabling reasons, the European Parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist Member States, regions and local communities in the programming of Objectives 1, 2 and 3. Moreover, I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schroedter’s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid. It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved, chiefly those involved at a local level, who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems, hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships, which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned. This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid. In order to do so, the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament, associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid. Amended again as such by the Schroedter report, they are a step in the right direction. They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006, but that is another subject. In the meantime, let us support this first step. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although I wholeheartedly support this aim, I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether. In my mind, illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping. We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry, we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans, then we must have a level playing field. Illegal state aid, by contrast, destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, of course, cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate, for example helping companies restructure. In all such cases, however, strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained. Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry, EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law.</p>
<p class="contents">I enthusiastically support the report's proposal to publish a "scoreboard" showing the amount of state aid per Member State. Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed. Member States cannot be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private.</p>
<p class="contents">I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling. Much remains to be done, however, and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity, given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States. Unfortunately, the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament’s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight. </p>
<p class="contents">It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions, of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples. This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion. The truth is though, that the Commission’s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs – with rights – effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity, and supporting the social economy and solidarity. There must also be support for rural development, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas, specifically in the field of social housing, with a view to achieving sustainable urban development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the first place, if administrative procedures are not simplified, it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform, with a view to greater efficiency and concentration. In this respect, the Commission document has shortcomings, as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities, and for their funding, execution and monitoring. SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still “weak operators”, given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds. </p>
<p class="contents">A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time. In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report), the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact,<span class="bold"> </span>it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States, and it published the guidelines back in July 1999, even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties, thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines. This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance. </p>
<p class="contents">In general, the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent. They merely touch on the – nevertheless important – issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to<span class="bold"> </span>verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries. That said, the differing approach adopted in the guidelines, which are not geared to geographical objectives, but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive. While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions, we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows, in practice, a policy of integrated<span class="bold"> </span>interventions, for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary. We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission’s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones – and I stress this once again – which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention. </p>
<p class="contents">The guidelines, as adopted by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance, they are providing a shopping list of possible measures, a shopping list which, as it fails to set priorities in ascending order, could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration. </p>
<p class="contents">We could say that, in this state of affairs, we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and, hence the destruction of the countryside. There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument, which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and, moreover, would accord proper status to local bodies which, being independent, could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly, and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency, concentration and administrative reform. Rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in, by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration. </p>
<p class="contents">It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal, rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs, which are no longer solely connected with agriculture, in the traditional sense – although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity – but also, for instance, in rural tourism, sport and cultural activities, environmental projects, SMEs, services, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">A genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy. The fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need "guidelines". I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities. In conclusion, the document is not particularly satisfactory, and in some aspects is disappointing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, and as the Commission itself states, it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German <span class="italic">Länder</span> in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards. This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union’s per capita GDP level. </p>
<p class="contents">We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions – where it did actually take place – was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area. This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, but no less importantly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur’s proposal that, in future, this type of report should also include, amongst other issues, an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State. The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue. This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, the French members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group feels it cannot approve some of the statements made therein. Paragraph 26, for example, “Draws attention to the special need to consolidate the budget as a prerequisite for the success of economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the Union”. </p>
<p class="contents">At a time when, in order to fulfil the convergence criteria, Member States are forced to undergo a strict budgetary slimming regime, one that would be perfectly justified if they undertook it of their own initiative, the federalists are displaying an astonishing pecuniary gluttony. As an admission of the failure of the cohesion policy and EMU, the lack of results is put down to the lack of money, with everyone competing in eloquence to demand more and more appropriations without anyone asking questions about the effectiveness of the money spent. What can one say about a budgetary procedure which involves setting objectives for expenditure rather than a ceiling on expenditure and trying at all costs to find projects in order to spend the approved appropriations, rather than allocating the appropriations to existing projects? Expenditure becomes an end in itself, evidence of the success of a programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The statistics published by the European Commission in its sixth report do however show, as Mr Berend pointed out, the limitations of the policy being implemented:</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">–</span> The relative weight of the most wealthy regions of the European Union was strengthened between 1986 et 1996, testifying to a concentration of wealth, jobs and activity in certain areas: Hamburg, Brussels, Antwerp, Luxembourg, the Paris region, Darmstadt, Oberbayern, Bremen, Vienna, Karlsruhe and Emilia-Romagna. Quite the opposite of what the rapporteur stated, the establishment of economic and monetary union should exacerbate the exodus of population from the most outlying, the most rural and the least populated regions in favour of the central axes of the Union (the Benelux countries, North West Germany, Northern Italy, the Parisian region, etc).</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">–</span> The poorest regions are gradually making good their underdevelopment. In 1986, the average of the 10 poorest regions amounted to 41% of the overall Community GNP. In 1996 it was 50%. Progress is particularly marked in Portugal and Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">–</span> In fact, if the rich are ever more wealthy and the extremely poor are less poor, then it seems that the middle-range regions, covered by Objective 2, are experiencing an occasionally significant downturn in their GNP, and a worsening of the employment situation. This phenomenon is particularly marked in France: the GNP of the Champagne-Ardennes region, which it is my honour to represent, has gone from 105% to 94% of the Community average, that of the Loire region has dropped from 95% to 91%, and that of the Auvergne from 89% to 83%. This is a generalised tendency, sparing neither the Rhône-Alpes, nor Alsace. It has been confirmed in Sweden and Finland, countries where unemployment has in fact increased to a worrying degree over the last few years, as in many regions of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">It may therefore seem strange that, when the Structural Funds were reformed, Objective 2, dedicated to industrial and rural areas undergoing economic restructuring, should have been sacrificed in favour of Objectives 1 and 3. For the period 1999-2006, the total appropriation for this Objective will be ECU 22.5 billion, a figure more or less identical to that for the period 1994-1999. The rural regions eligible under Objective 5b will be included among the main victims of this situation: in France, 27% of the populations eligible for Structural Funds are going to lose their eligibility at the end of the transition period, a figure which is occasionally much larger in some regions such as the Loire region, Alsace or Lower Normandy, political strongholds of the right-wing that were the victims of the petty political vote chasing of the left-wing coalition government.</p>
<p class="contents">Based as it is on such choices, it is to be doubted whether regional policy can contribute to harmonious regional planning within the Member States of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996. It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration. Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy, moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice, and even aims at having specialised courts. This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, as the rapporteur points out, in the name of competition policy, public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies, with the privatisation of important industries and public companies, as has happened in Portugal, with harmful consequences for the country and its workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it does, at least, make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion. The most remarkable thing, in my view, is the message conveyed by this proposal: that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily, and virtually automatically, requires reform of the centralised system. Admittedly, this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling. Indeed, the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system. Moreover, the von Wogau report, which the European Parliament has just voted on, supports it in so doing. But at the same time, one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended. It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this not, indeed, what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament? The German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because, in their view, it might break up European policy on competition, which is to say, in plain terms, attacking the standardising superstate. Curiously, a number of employers agreed with them, preferring the European “one-stop” system, which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally. Indeed, this is one advantage of the present system. But, on the other hand, the wider view must also be taken, namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may, in the long term, lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account, and this will be of benefit to everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other, which constantly takes the form of layoffs, factory closures, not to mention extensive waste of production capacity. We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power. Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union, despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world: these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridiculous, for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements. This is repulsive most of all in social terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission’s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes. There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still!</p>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, when he spoke about a few instruments which are crucial to achieving the objectives that have been mentioned, the rapporteur did little more than criticise various aspects of state aid and demand the harmonisation of rules concerning the repayment of illegal state aid. This threatens the right of Member States with a weaker and structurally more vulnerable economy to support economic sectors which have suffered as a result of liberalisation and international competition. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the rapporteur ignores the main causes of the distortion of the rules on competition, specifically the growing number of mergers and their consequences for that distortion. Another cause is the turning of public companies into private monopolies, with serious implications for society, specifically for employment and for the cost of public services. Another main cause of distortion to the rules of competition is the abuse of their dominant positions by various cartels which maintain unacceptable practices in social and environmental terms, including the sacking of thousands of workers.</p>

<p class="contents">I am happy with the rapporteur’s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this. There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition. Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union. However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158). Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997, including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector. This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector). This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rapporteur, I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid. The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible. It must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time, which is to say in time for the ninth report. I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid. In order to compensate for this situation, the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous: the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another, with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU. This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment, industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996, the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation. Establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable, even though Article 4(c), of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry. This, indeed, is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is, of course, essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid. It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development, environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings, as stipulated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code. The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or, at least, annually, without the need for reminders.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rapporteur, I am pleased with the Commission report, but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid. Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code. In the interests of equality, there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty. The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002. My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report, and I now await the Commission’s response to our requests and demands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
