It has allowed the income of sheep farmers to fall behind the general levels of income of other sections of the farming community. This widening gap is a serious matter when considering that large areas of the Community are highly dependent on sheep and goat farming.</p>
<p class="contents">The method of calculation of the premium is complicated and statistically suspect. The figures on which the eventual sheep premium is agreed cannot be justified in a satisfactory manner because it requires detailed information of what is happening in the market and that cannot readily be obtained nor easily substantiated.</p>
<p class="contents">Another drawback is that the premium is based on deficiency payments. This is not acceptable to the WTO and is therefore a barrier to negotiations in agricultural issues generally.</p>
<p class="contents">For farmers there is uncertainty over a 12-month period as to what annual premium will be paid eventually. Because of this uncertainty the premium does not allow effective management planning.</p>
<p class="contents">All these drawbacks were recognised by the Commission and are largely reinforced by a study that was carried out prior to the preparation of the proposals which we are now debating. The Commission proposal, in essence, is simpler, less bureaucratic and will be easier to understand. The fundamental difference is that it is based on a fixed annual payment. This is less objectionable to the WTO and therefore will help with the overall agricultural negotiations in which the Commission is involved.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, from the farmers' viewpoint, the premium will be known in advance and this will make farm business decisions easier.</p>
<p class="contents">My discussions in contact with the sheep and goat farmers of the Community confirm that the proposals are broadly acceptable to them. The information that I have from Member States is that it is broadly acceptable to them as well. There is agreement that it is desirable to agree the revision in time for 1 January 2002 so that the benefit to the farming community can come in as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of the Commission's proposals is broadly acceptable to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, though there are differences in emphasis. The committee proposes a premium 50% higher than that put forward by the Commission. The lower premium for milking-sheep and goats is rejected and a higher supplement proposed for sheep and goats in less favoured areas.</p>
<p class="contents">There are strong pressures within the committee that the market organisation should make greater provision for national differences. A number of proposals have been put forward. They cover such matters as extensification, de-stocking and the buy-out of premium rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also proposals which would allow Member States to make additional headage and area payments. These would be based on objective criteria which could cover, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, environmental considerations, tagging and traceability.</p>
<p class="contents">Sheep farming has not made the productivity advances seen in other agricultural sectors. Amendments have been introduced calling for Commission support for increased marketing promotion. Targeting young people to encourage consumption will be important for success.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee recognises that this is an interim stage and looks forward to reports from the Commission on environmental impact, traceability and pasturing techniques. It is anticipated that this will lead to wider reforms in the Agenda 2000 mid-term review.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agriculture Committee looks to the Commission for a positive response to the amendments it has proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were broadly supportive. First of all, it streamlines the policy, making it simpler and much more defensible within the GATT negotiations, thereby providing longer-term security for farmers engaged in sheep and goat farming.</p>
<p class="contents">We proposed an amendment in relation to individual tagging. We did not propose in that way to enter into the area of food safety, or indeed the business of the Committee on Agriculture. We simply wanted to ensure that premiums were paid on sheep and goats that actually existed and that we had a means of ensuring that the animals could be counted and accounted for. Since I am responsible to the Committee on Budgetary Control for animal products, I felt it my duty to insert that amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking for myself, I can say that the Committee on Budgets has its responsibilities. This is largely a neutral proposal by the Commission, but the Committee on Agriculture has its responsibilities to farmers. I support the position it has taken in this respect. I support the Doyle amendment which was passed by the Committee on Agriculture. As regards costs, the Committee on Budgets added approximately EUR 400 million in horizontal cuts that the Council deducted from the budget so we added EUR 400 million this morning. We added another EUR 400 million in relation to animal health measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget this year is 2% more in real terms than we started with last year, and in real terms it is more than 5%, when you consider the outturn. It is my opinion, and the opinion of EPP members in the Committee on Budgets, that there are sufficient funds to meet the request of the Committee on Agriculture: if the Doyle position is accepted by this Parliament and by the Council there are sufficient resources to finance the policy. It will be a shift of money from the rich areas to the poor areas, from the bigger farmers to the smaller farmers. It is a social and regional measure that we could do with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgets. There is money there to support the proposals that were passed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for a EUR 30 fixed rate premium and a EUR 9 supplement premium. There is money there. I appeal to colleagues to support the views of the Agriculture Committee. I fear tonight's vote – on a Thursday night – may be unrepresentative of the large majority decision at the Agriculture Committee on this particular issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community average income of sheep and goat producers is generally amongst the lowest of all sectors, especially in northern Europe where lambs are reared in meat production systems. I quote the words of the Commission: "Unlike beef and other commodities, the Community is deficient in sheepmeat and, under the present regimes, there is a major exodus from sheep production, especially in northern Europe. The beef regime unwittingly also supports this exodus from sheep production as ewes are counted for extensification payment under this regime but are not paid for, thereby encouraging farmers who have the option to decrease their sheep and increase their cattle on a holding to draw down more extensification payments."</p>
<p class="contents">The most cost-effective solution from a common agricultural policy point of view is to ensure that the sheep and goat regimes, together with the impact of the beef regime, encourage as much land as possible to be kept in Europe in sheep production. It is at least four times as expensive to support a livestock unit of beef, compared to that of sheepmeat.</p>
<p class="contents">While beef producers need all the support they are getting, given their present difficulties, it is not in their interest either to have competition generated between dry stock sectors by imbalance in the respective regimes.</p>
<p class="contents">The main proposal for a fixed, single annual premium I fully support, at EUR 30. I fully support it, in place of the unfair, uncertain and – from a WTO perspective – unacceptable present deficiency payment system. We support the flexibility amendments to send a message to the Commission that there is room for different treatment in some Member States in relation to this regime, providing that it does not come from the flat rate payment. We cannot support the identification and traceability amendments because this is a matter for DG V, not because we do not support the principle but because it is for another DG, and for that reason solely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has used its vote, as you quite rightly pointed out, to confirm the principle of a basic deficiency payment, of a rural premium and of a supplementary flexibility premium based on the criteria of produce quality, the environment or financial management. It is also the case that the levels set by our committee will have to be readjusted in plenary if Parliament hopes to influence Council and, therefore, maintain credibility. The Commission recommended a maximum of EUR 28 per head but the Committee on Agriculture raised the amount to EUR 44, which far exceeds the expectations of rearers and could, furthermore, prove difficult to reconcile with the room for manoeuvre provided by the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I have, therefore, retabled two of the rapporteur’s amendments designed respectively to reset the basic premium at EUR 25 per head and the premium for milk herds – ewes or she-goats – at EUR 20. In the ‘meat’ sector, the maximum aid per head would therefore, be EUR 39, which would ensure equal treatment in terms of public premiums per hectare for sheep breeders and milk-cow breeders.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that this is a totally logical approach, because these two types of production often exist side by side in the same regions and areas and even within the same holdings. In terms of the markets, we now have two situations at variance with one another: a surplus of beef and veal and a deficit of sheepmeat. If per-hectare premiums are set at an equivalent level, this could restore the balance of production, with the choices made by producers being influenced by market conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I recommend maintaining a difference between the basic premium for the ‘meat’ sector and the premium for the milk sector because to do otherwise would leave the sheep and goat milk sectors with no future, which nobody wants to see.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that this evening you will support these amendments, which I think are both realistic and responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Farming has taken a blow over the past year in the United Kingdom, and sheep farming, of course, is no exception. Given the fact that 80% of my own nation – Wales – is designated by the EU as less favoured and that sheep farming is the only available method of farming in many part of Wales, this report has far-reaching implications for Wales and its hill and upland farmers, as indeed it has for their European counterparts. I therefore welcome additional financial support for farmers situated in less-favoured areas such as Wales and I urge fellow MEPs to support additional payments for these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Now although this premium will not solve overnight the immediate crisis, we need to get the proposal through as quickly as possible to ensure that the sheep annual premium payments will be in place by January 2002. The original proposal was disappointing, and a lot of hard work has been put in to get the best deal possible for farmers in this regard. Of course, I want to see farmers get the fairest and highest possible premium. However, we have to work within the budget, and this is why I fully support Mr Adam's proposal of EUR 25 and am confident that the Council will consider this proposal as a very viable option given the constraints. Pitching the figure higher than this would lose money to other sectors including rural development. I will be voting against Amendment No 21, as I believe the wording to be too vague, and I would like to see a clause stating that any money put back into the national reserve from a region or country within a Member State should be ring-fenced to ensure the benefit of this fund is maintained for that particular area – that is a very important point.</p>
<p class="contents">We must protect our sheep-farming industry because to lose more farmers from the industry would have a catastrophic effect on the make-up of rural communities where small family farms play such a vital role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur, the Commission, Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and farming organisations are all at one on the need for reform. It is now down to this Parliament and the Council to give meaningful effect to this consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, one important bridge to be crossed if this desired objective is to be achieved. Unless we succeed in reaching a fair consensus on the level of financial support for sheep farming, this attempt at reform will fail and the decline of sheep production will lead to a significant imbalance in the European meat sector, thereby putting greater pressure on the beef sector as farmers switch from one enterprise to another. So, it makes good economic sense to get the balance right now. There will not be another bite at this cherry.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk a lot about the sustainability of European agriculture. To me it means maintaining a reasonable balance between all sectors, including the profitability of each. I do not have to remind the House of the relevance of sheep farming in areas not suited to other agricultural enterprises and the importance, from a rural development perspective, of sustaining farm families in those areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, wish to acknowledge the positive aspects of the Commission proposals, including the findings of the Evaluation Committee report, the simplification of procedures and the introduction of a single premium. Here, however, I differ with the Commission on its method of calculation, based on averaging. This does not fairly reflect the difficulties experienced by the sector over a longer period. During the debate, I tabled a number of amendments. My proposal for a flat rate premium of EUR 32 was not supported; it was based on a fair and thorough evaluation by agricultural economists of the level of support necessary to restore equity to the sector. On behalf of my Group, I then supported proposals for EUR 30 – a figure which I believe is the very minimum necessary to close the gap and help restore profitability to the sector. I ask the House not to deviate from this figure, which can be accommodated within the existing guidelines, and also to support amendments on compensation for extensification, the rural world premium and funding for market developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Like all Members of this House, I am conscious of the budgetary implications of reform. I caution against reform of sheepmeat at the expense of other sectors, particularly beef. Those who take pleasure in pointing out that agriculture takes up almost 50% of the budget should keep in mind that this general support is as much a subsidy to consumers as it is support for the farming community – the people who are expected to guarantee food supply and quality and at the same time maintain the rural environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who believe that agriculture is oversubsidised should take note of the continuing decline in the number of farm families and ask themselves why this is happening. We should note, in my view, with alarm the reluctance of young people to take up farming and ponder the consequences for food security and employment in the agricultural food sector. In evaluating the relevance of agriculture to the European and world economy, you cannot apply the same economic criteria as we apply to other sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is an improvement on the Commission proposals but, for all that, it does not make any significant changes in the sheep and goat farming sector.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, we agree that it is good idea to increase premiums and special aid, which have not risen since 1993 and have since been eroded by inflation. We also agree that it is a good idea to make the conditions for payment of supplementary aid more flexible. However, we do not agree that it is a good idea to maintain the difference between mixed meat and milk production subsidies, which the report justifies on the grounds that mixed production unit holders generate additional income from milk production. This is not comparing like with like because meat production units, which are mainly located in northern countries, are large operations which afford a satisfactory income and profit to their owners, while mixed production units, which are mainly located in the Mediterranean countries, are family-run holdings in the most barren areas which do not afford their owners a viable income, with the result that they are declining year on year and these areas are being abandoned. The headage payments in Greece for each holding have not risen since 1989-1991.</p>
<p class="contents">The report accepts the philosophy of quotas and even tries to add to it with management quotas, despite the fact that the European Union's self-sufficiency in sheep- and goatmeat is around 80%, sheep and goat farms are to be found in the poorest areas of the European Union, where no alternative form of farming is generally possible, and sheep and goat farmers are the poorest social group in the European Union. If we really wanted to provide income support for these regions and for sheep and goat farmers, we would abolish quotas, increase subsidies and provide other additional incentives. This sort of policy would help to reverse the rate of abandonment of mountain and mainly barren areas and, at the same time, make the European Union self-sufficient in sheep- and goatmeat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it is not checked it will have terrible consequences for our economies, our societies and for life in our territories. In the beef and veal sector, despite the mollifying proposals that Commissioner Fischler has put to us – he would have us believe that the crisis is now behind us – we are still in a slump. In my own country, for example, producers can no longer find takers for their animals even at tragically low prices, which no longer cover production costs. Despair is gaining ground. Every day, livestock breeders are being forced out of business in the most tragic way. Waiting patiently for our remaining producers to go out of business would be a suicidal policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, there is a considerable deficit in the European Union’s sheepmeat sector and looking at the average age of livestock breeders, which is increasing, it is not hard to predict that this deficit will increase in coming years. Sheep-farmers’ incomes are amongst the lowest in agriculture, as the Commission itself acknowledges. In the current economic climate, we also see many producers in desperate situations and who are forced to stop farming because their income is insufficient. Apart from the human and social tragedy that this represents, it is also an ecological tragedy because sheep breeding and goat breeding are often the last defence against desertification in regions where farming is difficult. This is why your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development felt that it was crucial to make some slight improvements to the Commission’s proposal for a regulation, in order to simplify, to be able to forecast and to increase aid to a sector that is suffering harshly, whose economic, social and ecological impact is so important and which gives cattle farmers the opportunity to convert, if it is increased sufficiently. The very coherent proposals that have been presented attempt to bring the system of aid for the sheepmeat sector into line with aid for milk-cows, whilst complying with budgetary constraints, because the COM in the sheepmeat sector is relatively cheap due to the number of customers for each producer. These proposals also comply with our international commitments, since the proposed reform aims to separate aid and an income insurance system, which could act as a safety net.</p>
<p class="contents">The sheepmeat sector today needs to be stabilised and supported, otherwise it will disappear from many regions. It requires a reform which is both generous and responsible, and this is what Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture has proposed. I hope that the House will support us and that the Council will listen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, it contains various loopholes and shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the unsatisfactory level of the proposed premium of EUR 21, which continues to reflect the discrimination against the small ruminants sector in favour of large ruminants. The proposal of EUR 30 that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development approved will, therefore, resolve this discrimination. Nevertheless, if this proposal does not have the support of the majority of this House, I will, of course, support any other level that contributes to this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The second shortcoming lies in the continuing discrimination between sheep bred for meat on the one hand and ewes and she-goats on the other, with the latter receiving only 80% of the premium given to meat sheep. The proposals approved by the Committee on Agriculture will also remedy this unfairness, by making all premiums the same.</p>
<p class="contents">The third shortcoming concerns the non-inclusion of flexibility mechanisms that would enable the Member States to make adjustments to national and regional situations. In this sense, the Committee on Agriculture’s amendments, which are intended to create an additional premium in certain situations, will be of enormous benefit to the implementation of the COM and will make the scheme more realistic and more feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission itself acknowledges in the explanatory statement, sheep and goat breeders have the lowest incomes of all meat producers with the additional disadvantage that 80% of the animals eligible for premiums are located in parts of the European Union that are both remote and poor. For this reason, and also because there is a deficit in this sector, which can only meet 80% of domestic consumption, it is becoming very important to make the changes I have just outlined and to increase the supplementary premium for Objective 1 regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope, that the House approves the Commission proposal and that when the Ministers for Agriculture meet in Council, they do their job properly, and accept the positions of this House. Lastly, I wish to pay tribute to Mr Adam, who has been an excellent rapporteur, who has put in a great deal of hard work and whom I thank for his generous support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would ask the Commissioner to make these terminological amendments to this proposal and, Commissioner, you can also do this for all of your other proposals, and please inform your staff that this must be done.

The problem is that the level of the per head premium is clearly low, given that the basic price base has not increased since 1993. Furthermore, although the current system does need to be simplified, we must also take account, as the rapporteur stated, of the fact that sheep and goat breeding is of particular importance to the Community’s least-favoured areas, in which they are concentrated. The prime objective of any reform of this COM must, therefore, be to improve the income of sheep and goat farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must consider the fact that, in recent years, the relative position of sheep and goat farmers has seen a decline. We therefore welcome the per head aid increases to EUR 30 and the additional aid of EUR 9 for the least-favoured regions, because this is a sector whose production is concentrated in poor areas, in which the viability of farms is more precarious, despite the fact that they play a major role in preserving the rural fabric of these regions and, in certain cases, are even the only economically possible activity. Also to be welcomed is the removal of the distinction between sheep bred to produce milk and those bred for their meat and that the same increase is to be applied to goats. I am also happy to support the new aid of EUR 5, given the difficulties that this sector is experiencing, although we must bear in mind the danger of renationalisation that the creation of national packages entails<span class="italic">. </span>I hope, therefore, that the House – and especially the Commission – will respond positively to this report and that some of the main demands of sheep and goat farmers will be met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In all those things Mr Adam has done a good job. But I have to take issue with him in one contentious area which is: what is to be the level of support for sheep farmers?</p>
<p class="contents">I am deeply disappointed that the socialists, the liberals and the nationalists are telling the House that they all intend to vote to cut the recommendation of the Committee on Agriculture by EUR 5 at least in relation to each animal. They put that forward on the basis of the budget, but in the part of the UK that I represent, Wales – just like Mr Wyn who is sadly no longer in his place – we have seen a huge amount of stock slaughtered because of the foot-and-mouth epidemic. We see a crippled industry. We see a situation in which there is no confidence at all in the farming industry today and, as has rightly been said, if you look to an area like Wales, it is no good talking about diversification. It is no good talking about putting money into Community schemes and improving public transport in rural areas. We must ensure greater financial support for sheep farmers who have no economic alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">Today there are sheep farmers in my constituency who are raising questions about whether they should even restock after foot-and-mouth. I say to Mr Adam this his government is not helping them by indicating that the compensation scheme that was previously in place is one that they do not intend to continue with, whilst, at the same time, not saying what they intend to put in its place. That adds to the existing desperation in the countryside. So, yet again, we hear warm words about the industry, but farmers want deeds, and this means supporting the recommendation made by the agricultural industry for the maximum amount of support for our hard-pressed sheep farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We naturally support the idea that the premium should guarantee an income that is acceptable to the producer and my personal opinion is that this income should be the same for producers of both heavy and light lambs, as approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. The market in sheep’s milk is not regulated in the same way as the market in cow’s milk and income from milk is balanced by a lower level of income from meat production, especially in Mediterranean countries where mixed farms that produce wool, milk and meat slaughter these animals at lower weights, once again, largely in accordance with eating habits.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the supplementary premium that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposed and approved, I have to say that the Commission should be very vigilant that this supplementary premium should in no case be used to reduce the linear premium, the headage premium or the premium for rural development. The Commission should understand that Parliament’s Committee wants to see an increase in the premium, comprised of three parts: a headage premium, a premium for rural development and a supplementary premium, in order to be able to help States implement the principle of flexibility. However, I would strongly urge that this introduction is not, at the end of the day, used to achieve a reduction in the headage premium or in the premium for rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say, and the Commissioner is well aware of this, that this sector makes an important contribution to land-use planning and to all the environmental services that we say we are going to defend in this new future common agricultural policy. However, I think that that truly guaranteeing an income in both this COM and this sector that could pay for the non-food services that this type of livestock farming provides throughout the Community would send an important political signal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to listen to the political message from this Parliament, which is asking for an increase in the premium. This premium is much needed, because it has remained unaltered since 1994; in fact, it has stagnated. This is the reason why this is one of the sectors that receives the least aid and is the most discriminated against within the COM at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the proposal from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is reasonable. However, we will not give our support to amendments put forward <span class="italic">a posteriori</span>, because we think that some, such as those put forward by Mr Mulder, should be dealt with in another context, although, it must be said, we are not against what he is saying. Others run counter to what has already been discussed and on which consensus has been reached in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and would, consequently, blur the political message of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission, in its debate with Council, to make the necessary effort to give the sector what it needs. Given that it has already made such an effort when putting forward the proposal, by simplifying the premiums, on the subject of the single premium, and on the possibilities of the Member States managing these premiums, it should make a reasonable budgetary effort – which the Committee on Budgets is not against – so that the objective the sector considers necessary can be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The previous speakers have already given all the reasons why we so much welcome this proposal. I would also like to thank our rapporteur most sincerely for his work.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the revision of the premiums is one of the most important points. The introduction of a fixed rate premium is a major step forward. But I would like to stress that the figure proposed by the Commission is much too small. This premium must also be an incentive for sheep and goat farmers and that means EUR 30 and no less. The premium must also be the same for farmers regardless of whether they produce ewes or milking ewes. A distinction between the two cannot really be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the EUR 9 supplementary premium for ewes and she-goats is particularly justified under the more difficult conditions in the less-favoured areas. Beef and veal and sheep meat prices generally follow the same trends, which means there is no justification for treating the two sectors differently as regards the premium. On the contrary, there is a deficit in sheep meat in Austria and in many other countries of Europe. If we fail to create reasonable conditions and security for this sector, we shall drive sheep and goat farmers into other areas, such as beef and veal, or they will go out of production altogether. Such a policy would be ill-advised.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that sheep and goat farming should not be supported only in areas that have no alternative, but also in those where sheep and goat farming is traditional. I therefore hope, Mr President, that the Commission and Council will follow these sensible proposals from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is perhaps long overdue, but certainly welcome. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report on this very important subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Sheep production is important especially in hill areas, not only because of the environment there and the role it plays in keeping the social fabric of society together, but because it has proven through the centuries to be one of the most important aspects of production in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United Kingdom because of foot-and-mouth, sheep farmers have suffered greatly. I recognise that in Northern Ireland we have had a distinct advantage over our colleagues in the mainland UK, including the prices we have been receiving recently. Our producers have been very lucky. Over recent years, farmers have been getting less for their sheep than they were 15 years ago and they are receiving less support. Is it any wonder that young farmers and sheep farmers are actually leaving the industry? We have to ask ourselves how best we can support them.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make it very clear: I will support the EUR 30 in the amendment in the vote in this House this afternoon. I hope all of you will be here to vote in favour of this amendment because we must give the political leadership this requires. For far too long, the sheep sector has been the poor relation. It has been the poor relation with respect to the milk, beef, tobacco and wine sectors. It has been the poor relation because it has been deemed to lack a strong voice in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Commission in coming forward with this proposal because it will be fairer than the present system. Yes, there will be some budgetary problems but we can get over them. I ask this House for its support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by sincerely thanking you, Mr Adam, for producing the report and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their contributions to the discussions in committee and also for today’s debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very grateful because it is important that we press ahead with this proposal quickly and take a vote on it soon so that it can then hopefully be adopted by the Council as quickly as possible and this reformed market organisation for sheep and goat meat can come into force on 1 January next year and the premiums can then also be paid under this new regime next year.</p>
<p class="contents">As many of you have also emphasised, the most important point of the proposed reform is the replacement of the variable deficiency payments by a fixed-rate form of aid. That has a number of important advantages. This new aid is stable. It can also be calculated in advance. This means that farmers can also plan with certainty. Above all, it is also a lot less bureaucratic because none of the expensive market intelligence on which the deficiency payments are currently based and all the complex calculations involved will any longer be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is also of course much, much easier for sheep and goat farmers to understand. It allows producers to respond correctly to the needs of the respective markets because the support is not affected by changing prices. The Commission proposal also guarantees budget stability and in particular is also more consistent with WTO objectives over all.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there is broad agreement about these principles, as the debate has shown.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn briefly to the most important amendments. Some are concerned with improving the text and are extremely welcome. I would, for example, be very pleased to accept Amendment No 11 because a more precise definition of the terms “producer” and “holding” will help to make the regulation much easier to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also support Amendment No 16, which proposes that premiums be paid not later than 31 March instead of 30 June. That will mean that producers will get their premiums even earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the proposal to change the definition of producer in less-favoured areas, but I think the term could be simplified even more here. The wording of the amendment therefore needs to be made even more precise in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I do not think it is necessary, as proposed in Amendment No 44, to specify the supplementary premium for dykes and salt marshes. They ought to be covered by the rule for less-favoured areas. So I do not really think this amendment is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I also consider Amendments Nos 1, 6, 9, 22, 36 and 37 superfluous or pointless in the context of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments are concerned with the need for a degree of flexibility that would enable Member States to provide additional support for the sector or, more especially, to manage the various Member States’ individual quotas better and more actively.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions that were raised in the discussions in this connection are concerned with a number of aspects and possibilities, ranging from extensification and environmental concerns to the development of quality products, improvement of marketing structures and the creation of producer groups. I would like to say to you in this connection that while I cannot accept the proposed amendments directly, I do understand very clearly the message they are intended to convey. I would therefore like to pursue further the concern that lies behind them in order to find solutions that will take better account of the different requirements of the sector in the individual Member States. But they must be simple solutions. I do not think we should be creating a new bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The same also applies for Amendments Nos 25 to 30 concerning the national financial frameworks, which should also be placed in the context of the proposals for greater flexibility. We must ensure that these framework provisions are also practicable and consistent with the objectives stated in the amendments in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 15 are in fact the ones with the greatest direct effects. They are concerned with the question, discussed here, of increasing the premium to EUR 30 for all producers and increasing the supplementary premium for producers in less-favoured regions to EUR 9. If these proposals were accepted, expenditure would rise to EUR 2.7 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the more moderate amendments, as you termed them, Nos 45 and 46, would still entail additional expenditure amounting to EUR 385 million.</p>
<p class="contents">We based our proposal on the financial framework agreed in Berlin, and I regret that I cannot therefore go along with your suggestions, especially in view of the fact that at virtually every summit the Heads of Government stress the importance and immutability of that financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also reject the suggestion that producers of sheep’s milk and goat’s milk be paid the same aid as farmers who only produce meat.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I was interested to note Amendments Nos 31 and 35 proposing additional premiums in the event of a price crisis. But the draft regulation does already provide for a kind of safety net to come into effect if falls in prices disrupt the market. I cannot therefore agree to those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal in Amendment No 20 that the first 15 sheep livestock units should be disregarded for calculating the stocking density for the beef and veal arrangements refers to a problem that actually belongs not in the context of this regulation but in the context of the market organisation for cattle, and I must therefore reject this proposal in this connection. But I would willingly agree to return to this point in the Midterm Review when we shall be discussing the question of the beef and veal arrangements and how they work.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 5, 7 and 33 are concerned with imports from third countries. Unfortunately, these amendments run counter to our international obligations and cannot therefore be accepted for that reason.</p>
<p class="contents">Traceability is another important aspect. Amendment No 8 proposes that the report on the environmental effects of sheep and goat farming to be prepared by 31 December 2005 should also look into this question. I understand that and fully share your concerns, but I believe that this problem really needs to be solved sooner and that we cannot wait until 31 December 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The first step towards better origin safeguards requires the creation of a reliable marking and registration system. Since such a proposal requires a different basis in law, the proposed amendments are simply outside the scope of this regulation because under this regulation the relevant legal basis would be lacking. But I do think that part of Amendment No 42, which links the granting of premiums to compliance with the marking and registration rules, seems a sensible approach. I shall at any rate put such a proposal before the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 19 is concerned with allowing Member States to show greater flexibility when setting application periods. This question will be settled in the implementing provisions. A Council decision is not therefore required here; it falls within the competence of the Commission. To avoid cases of fraud, however, an efficient marking and registration system ought to be operative for that reason, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank you again for the report and the amendments. In some areas there is a consensus, in some I shall pass your concerns on to the Council even though I cannot formally accept the amendments in their present form, and unfortunately there are also amendments which I am unable to accept because I do not have the authority to approve the funding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
