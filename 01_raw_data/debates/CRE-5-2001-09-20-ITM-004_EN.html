Due to the result of the vote, he chose not to pursue it by introducing it in plenary and I am doing so on behalf of my committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed a Council directive on minimum standards for procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status. The Commission has come forward with proposals for a number of rules on the handling of asylum applications. This is very much a first step towards the common asylum system which the Commission has proposed and which this House has on many occasions supported. These rules cover reception and detention facilities, the content of refugee status and the application process. They designate time limits for applications and appeals and they introduce specific rules for dealing with inadmissible cases.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my honour to present on behalf of the committee a number of amendments to these proposals. We recognise that these amendments are not binding but we hope that they will be considered carefully and taken on board in policy formulation. Our amendments seek to clarify and strengthen the position of asylum seekers. We aim to ensure due respect for the Geneva Convention and its protocols and for the European Convention on Human Rights when dealing with applications for asylum. We aim to secure for asylum seekers the right to remain on the territory of a Member State until their appeal has been decided. We recommend special attention be paid to the cases of applications from women and children who have been particularly vulnerable to abuse and attack in the countries from which they flee. We seek to improve access to legal assistance for those seeking asylum and to emphasise that asylum seekers should not be sent back to places where their lives might be in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">As a general rule, we reject or resist the practice of holding asylum seekers in detention centres. I for one welcome the recent United Kingdom court ruling against the UK government's practice of locking asylum seekers in detention centres, however modern those centres may be. We believe that asylum seekers who are often escaping persecution of the worst kind in their homelands have the right to be treated with dignity when they reach our shores. We understand the pressures on Member States but we reject the creeping tendency we see towards a dilution of the rights of asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the determination of refugee status must remain a legal matter and not a matter of politics or one of political expediency. The health of a society is judged not only by its practices but also by the direction in which its face is set and my committee believes that the Commission's policy is taking us in the right direction even if we seek greater clarity in the rights of some of those to whom it is directed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only a question of our legal and humanitarian obligations but also a question of economic and administrative common sense. The more asylum seekers that a government rejects – perhaps in the hope of courting short-term popular support of the basest nature – the more appeals it will face, the more it will be tied down in lengthy processes which will hit the taxpayer in the pocket. Our amendments seek to ensure not only administrative efficiency but also a humanitarian approach to the position of those on our planet who deserve our support and protection. I hope the House will follow the line that has been put forward by the committee in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These countries, many of them candidate states, are at the sharp end of the refugee problem. Most of them have no experience of refugee and asylum policy. They all lack the financial and human resources to deal competently with applications to stay. The Foreign Affairs Committee also felt it was important to insert a reference to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, as well as the obligation to respect all existing international law commitments. Finally, we have also insisted that the EU's new procedures should aim to contribute to the improvement of international relations by being as clear, transparent and reasoned as possible, so that their interpretation by third countries and their citizens will be facilitated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me explain briefly what I mean. About a year ago, when the Commission submitted its working document, we attempted to reach a compromise on this very difficult and sensitive issue. We agreed that we would distinguish between three specific groups: firstly, asylum seekers; secondly, persons who come to us on a temporary basis from crisis regions; and finally, people who wish to migrate to the Member States in order to make their lives here.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we all recognised that we could only regulate the last pillar, that is, immigration, sensibly by ensuring that the number – I am choosing my words carefully – of unfounded asylum applications can be reduced, at least that we can process them consistently.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that no more than 10% or 15% of the applications submitted are genuinely well-founded and likely to be recognised under the Geneva Convention. This is where the Committee and a majority of its members have made two errors, in my view: firstly, it has abandoned the consensus which we worked so hard to achieve and, secondly, it has done no service at all to genuine applicants who are politically persecuted, because it also treats everyone who enters Germany or another Member State without a well-founded claim in more or less the same way and thus undermines the standing of genuine applicants.</p>
<p class="contents">Expanding the rights of asylum to include new forms of (non-state) persecution, restricting the opportunities of Member States – at least those Member States which have to cope with large influxes – to make effective use of the ‘safe country of origin’ principle, but also the issue of how manifestly unfounded applications should be dealt with – indeed, the entire contents of this report – means that there is longer any way of taking effective action when large numbers of unfounded applications are made.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to you yet again! I know this is a difficult issue. I also know this is a sensitive issue. However, let us try to uphold the details of these common pillars which we discussed a year ago, and where there was plenty of scope to reach a consensus. I hope that the German Social Democrats – who adopt an entirely different tone in their dealings with their Home Affairs Minister in Germany – might change their voting behaviour today. I also hope that we will again find a way of achieving consensus which will enhance the status of those who have genuinely suffered political persecution and seek asylum in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, may I thank Mr Watson on behalf of our committee for bringing this report to plenary. I listened carefully to what Mr Watson and Mr Schmitt just said. Mr Schmitt spoke a lot about unjustified applications and, of course, we need to look at all applications properly. Mr Schmitt said, and I wholeheartedly agree with him, that Member States have to do more to address the root causes that are forcing people to migrate across Europe and across the world, but it is not easy to address the root causes in the countries from where many asylum seekers come. The highest number of asylum seekers in Europe come from Afghanistan, Iran and Sri Lanka and at the moment, as we know only too well, it will not be easy to address quickly the situation in Afghanistan: we watch that situation with some terror.</p>
<p class="contents">Nearer to home, we are affected, at the moment by the lack of a common working asylum system for Europe and the separate issue of a common immigration policy, which will come later. But we see on our television screens, certainly in Britain and France nightly, and colleagues in Spain have a similar problem, the way that the lack of a proper system manifests itself in tragedy. Asylum seekers are desperate people escaping in many cases war, violence and torture. Yes, Mr Schmitt, some of them are just escaping poverty, but we should not knock them for that. We need to give them respect and make certain that they are treated fairly.</p>
<p class="contents">This report calls for high standards for reception of asylum seekers, to recognise that they are not criminals while their cases are being heard. People escaping from the worst situations do not need to be detained in prisons, detention centres and I agree with Mr Watson on this. Those escaping from war and torture do not need to be welcomed by barbed wire and armed guards. They need to have their cases heard properly, they need a fair system and they need a system that puts the individual at the heart of the process. This report goes some way towards that, but it is part of a much wider picture working towards a common European asylum system with a separate immigration system alongside it. I hope that we can get this through as amended and continue the vast amount of work still to be done in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
