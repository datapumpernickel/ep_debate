<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to inform this House of the circumstances surrounding the condition known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, to use the acronym. It can be divided into a number of different questions. What is it? Where does it come from? How does it spread? How can we stop it?</p>
<p class="contents">This syndrome is a respiratory disease that has recently been reported in Asia, North America and Europe. The illness usually begins with a fever, sometimes associated with other symptoms such as chills, headache and body aches. After two to ten days SARS patients may develop a cough that might progress to difficulties in breathing. In 10 to 20% of cases patients will require mechanical ventilation. It is estimated that in 4% of cases SARS proves to be fatal. At present no treatment beyond good intensive and supportive care has been consistently shown to improve the condition of persons with SARS.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the causative agent, the scientists have detected a previously unrecognised virus belonging to the family of coronaviruses in patients with SARS. While the new coronavirus is still the leading hypothesis for the cause of SARS, other viruses are still under investigation as potential causes.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of transmission, the principal way SARS appears to be spread is through respiratory secretions called droplets, namely, when someone with SARS coughs or sneezes droplets into the air and someone else breathes them in. Nevertheless, other ways of transmission cannot be ruled out, such as direct close contact with an infected person. In particular, health-care workers or household members of a SARS patient have been known to be affected. But concern has been raised on other potential ways of transmission.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the origin: recently a WHO investigation team has been authorised by the Chinese Government to travel to Guangdong province. Scientists currently speculate that the SARS virus either jumped to humans from an animal species or mutated into a more virulent form. In its continuing work, the WHO team is expected to visit Foshan City, where the first case of SARS was reported.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of numbers in the European Union, all 15 Member States have reported to the Commission a total of 46 cases - 19 probable and 27 suspected - with no deaths. It is also important to note that there has been no local transmission within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the candidate countries, EFTA and other European countries, 14 countries have reported data, a total of eight cases - three probable and five suspected - with no deaths.</p>
<p class="contents">In the other countries, to date a total of 2396 cases have been reported, including 89 deaths.</p>
<p class="contents">The unknown factors combined with the global spread of this disease have inevitably prompted extensive media attention. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that although SARS is often referred to as a ‘killer pneumonia’, estimates indicate that it kills fewer people than ‘normal’ influenza.</p>
<p class="contents">SARS, however, demonstrates very clearly that we are living in a truly global environment, where the increasing mobility of people also enables diseases to move ever more freely.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the ease and extent of modern travel, an increasing level of preparedness is required across borders to deal with the threat posed by communicable diseases. In the European Union, surveillance and coordination at Community level need to be strengthened to address the threat to public health. I have been stressing this need for some time now, and in the European Convention, the report prepared by Mr Katiforis has recognised this and I hope the Convention will take this up in its discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Communicable Diseases Network started its work three years ago to detect and control communicable diseases in people, irrespective of the cause and means of transmission. This Network serves to survey and investigate the outbreaks. This also involves identifying the cause and defining control measures. The Commission’s role is to coordinate and support these activities.</p>
<p class="contents">This SARS outbreak puts to the test the real capacities of the two pillars of the Network – epidemiological surveillance and early warning. The Network committee has, together with the Commission, defined and put into operation an effective surveillance system. This system picks up all suspected SARS cases and gives a complete and clear picture of developments during the outbreak.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously we have to be cautious, and err on the side of safety. This approach seems to be working: most of the suspected cases turn out to be something else.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this does not give grounds for complacency. The European Union surveillance strategy on SARS is fully connected to the global surveillance coordinated by the World Health Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second element of this strategy is prevention. We must work together to reduce exposure to the disease. Unnecessary travel to affected areas should be discouraged or postponed. Hong Kong and the Guangdong province of China have been identified in this respect by the WHO. This is under constant review and further advice will be issued if the situation in other regions warrants travel restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, all would agree on the importance of health screening on departure from the affected areas and the provision of information to passengers and flight crews.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is playing its role of coordinator, and encouraging common approaches and criteria. During the last three weeks my services have tried to integrate national measures with global ones, through regular meetings, audio-conferences and consultations with the Member States, candidate countries and the WHO.</p>
<p class="contents">SARS, of course, entails other dimensions in addition to public health implications. The SARS outbreak has already made a political and economic impact. Travel advice has had an impact on air travel and tourism in Asia. Now, industry exhibitions and meetings have been postponed and it is predicted that Asia’s economic growth may be affected. Obviously, earlier notifications to the WHO by those affected could have mitigated many of the effects. This is a key lesson for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress that the capacity of the Commission to extend its coordinating and facilitating role any further is currently at its very limit. In the absence of new arrangements to pool the existing expertise we will not be able to go beyond our current efforts. I have referred on many occasions to our plans to strengthen our capacity to deal with communicable diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the most effective way to strengthen Community activities is to set up a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. As many of you will be aware, we are well advanced in the preparation of the enabling legislation which I intend to table in the next couple of months. My proposal will be to establish such a centre by 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The centre will enhance surveillance. It will coordinate and facilitate common responses, and collaborate with Member States, third countries and international organisations, in particular the WHO. It will not replace existing national capacities, but rather hook them up to act as a reference and coordination point both in routine and crisis situations. This will also play an important role in an enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On a multinational level the SARS situation can be said to be under control, but not improving, as had initially been expected. In Europe the situation still appears to be manageable. However, the strict control procedures will have to continue. In the fight to beat this disease it is crucial for anybody who believes they have the symptoms and have travelled in the affected areas to consult their doctor.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not neglect the support that the EU and its Member States can give to the affected countries in their search for the cause and the remedy. There is still an ongoing discussion whether the responsible agent is close to the common cold or coronavirus. We must continue to support the WHO in its endeavours in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I can assure you that the Commission will continue with the Member States, and in close collaboration with the candidate countries and the WHO, to do everything within its powers to defeat the spread of SARS.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to what Mr De Rossa said earlier, I can say that there have been preliminary discussions with the Council to organise a meeting of the Council in the near future to discuss this issue further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I had the honour of acting as rapporteur on public health for the European Union, may I say that it is extremely important that one of the three lines of approach of this programme over the next five years is to develop a rapid response to health hazards.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two or three comments and then I will come back to what the Commissioner said about a centre, which is essential now, if we are to be able to deal efficiently with health hazards. As I am sure you all well know, the mobility which exists today, with millions of people travelling to all corners of the planet, has boosted infectious diseases enormously. We have seen as much in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome. It started in a province of China and there are now cases even in Europe. The second important point is that there are sudden epidemics of new diseases. Over the last twenty years, there have been reports of thirty new infectious diseases, or variations on old diseases caused by mutating viruses, or even the re-emergence of old diseases such as tuberculosis, to give but one example.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, all this calls for constant vigilance, constant monitoring and a response, an organised, coordinated response. Then there is the known resistance to antibiotics which bacteria are developing. Nowadays, you go into hospital to be treated for some illness or other and suddenly the whole hospital is contaminated, sometimes very, very seriously. So these sorts of bacteria, which we cannot treat with antibiotics, are also a hazard and we need research to deal with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one last point: biological terrorism. Biological terrorism, where terrorists use bacteria spores or viruses or some other means, is also a threat that calls for a coordinated and proper response.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to what the Commissioner said earlier, what I have just said bears out the need he mentioned for a centre at European Union level which will have the facilities, a network of laboratories, to study and monitor and coordinate these responses, so that we can investigate diseases quickly and quickly establish both their causes and how to treat them. Consequently, we need to have the courage to promote this centre. A symposium on this centre was held at the European Parliament in November under the aegis of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, attended by thirty of the most eminent epidemiologists. Allow me to read you the conclusion in English, which dates from November, in other words before SARS. It says: </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not believe that they will.</p>
<p class="contents">Having listened attentively to Mr Byrne and Mr Trakatellis, I agree with them, and, whilst much of what they have referred to is of course necessary, what we have done so far is not enough. The European system for the epidemiological monitoring and control of communicable diseases that we already have can only be as good, in terms of quality, reliability and speed, as the national systems, and these differ in every respect. That is why I agree with you that we should set up a scientific research centre. That, though, will be but a drop in the ocean. I am sure that you, Mr Trakatellis, want more research, and equally sure that Mrs Malliori will endorse that, but that is not what we really need.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has hitherto specifically excluded the possibility of harmonising legislation. It is specifically laid down in our system for combating communicable diseases that national legislation will not be harmonised. You stated earlier, Commissioner, that the most important thing now is prevention, that we must, for example, reduce encounters with certain diseases and exposure to them. What about if plague returns to Europe or breaks out again anywhere? What about if polio, infantile paralysis, again becomes widespread? Are we prepared for those eventualities? I can tell you plainly that, no, we are not prepared. An epidemiological system that results, for example, in it being recommended in some countries – but not in others – that one should not travel to certain regions, and in observation being carried out at airports in some European Union countries, but with nothing of the kind being done in others, is no use whatever.</p>
<p class="contents">So I have to tell you, very plainly, that the only thing we have to do – although we all have to agree on it – is to incorporate in the Treaty a competence for health policy. Mr Trakatellis, I would be the first to applaud enthusiastically if you were to get your group to accept that. I have not read any great number of statements on the Convention in which that desire was expressed, and I am quite certain that Mrs Grossetête has not either, but as for you, Mr Poettering – and I see that you are listening – do you say that there has to be a Community competence for health policy? We are eager to find out! It might well not have done so at the highest level, but my group has clearly stated that we want no more centres serving as alibis.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is meant to have proper competences to deal with such problems. What will we be saying to people at next year's European elections? Do we really have equal standards – at least minimum standards – of hygiene, which enable us to fight disease and beat it? You asked, Mr Trakatellis, whether people in hospitals can get even more ill. They can indeed, because we have no comparability between hospitals' standards of hygiene. Is that the European Union that we want our citizens to live in? No! We want not just competition and the internal market, but also social security and health care. So far, we have not achieved them.</p>
<p class="contents">If we now take this case, of SARS, as an example and want to make something of it, we must succeed in gaining a mandatory competence at European Union level for health policy. I ask you, Mr Byrne, as a matter of urgency, to support us in this and bring our need for a Community competence to the ears of the Commission and Mr Prodi – who has always told us that he has an ear open to the soul of the people, something that the examples of the European Food Agency and the Food Safety Authority have brought to our notice.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Byrne, I will support you if, in the forthcoming Budget debates, you demand more personnel and double your budget estimate. When it comes to summoning up the courage to do that, though, you are on your own.</p>

This virus, as we have also said, is spreading at the speed of air travel over the whole planet, in particular in South-East Asia and Canada. Europe so far appears to have been spared, relatively speaking. The Commissioner has given the current figures in the Member States and the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank him for his detailed description of the two-way exchange of information between the WHO and the EU monitoring system.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, what can be said? First of all, I believe there is cause for concern, if we refer to the statements made by a WHO spokesman, who said that this will be complex and could be a very long-term project. In short, the fight against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic seems to be a real race against time for health authorities and researchers all over the world, in particular as far as treatment is concerned. Secondly, we do have grounds for reassuring European citizens, as far as we can, as the Commissioner stated in a press release that only those suffering from the disease are infectious, which facilitates traceability.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, however, it should be stated here that it is impossible not to be disgusted by the Chinese Government’s behaviour, which was both thoughtless and irresponsible. It took the Chinese Minister for Health almost five months after this virus first appeared to make the information public.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I shall return to Europe to end on the most important point. It should be noted here that this new crisis provides yet another argument for the case of those, including the previous speakers and, of course, myself, who want public health in the broadest sense to become a shared competence of the Union. This would be more appropriate now than ever, at a time when we are drawing up our draft Constitution. I am convinced that, in the long run, the crisis will lead to progress in this ‘Europe of Health’ and speed up the project mentioned by the Commission to set up a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control based on the model of the Atlanta CDC by 2005. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we have been able to prepare ourselves. Since the flu epidemic in 1918, which claimed an unprecedentedly large number of lives in Europe, we have known that the composition of the flu virus can constantly change. Preventative vaccination against flu only protects against known and expected forms of flu and not against deviant, new forms. Many epidemics have traditionally developed in central China and then gradually spread across Eurasia towards the West. The only new thing now is that it is not spreading gradually by land but rapidly via air travel from Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
<p class="contents">A few years ago, a flu virus of unknown composition threatened to spread from Hong Kong all over the world. Even then it was assumed that the composition of the virus was partly influenced by a bird disease. What we were able to avert in time then is happening today. People who may be at risk of contracting this disease are not being examined and isolated in time, and travel to the sources of the infection has continued for too long. It would probably not have been possible to prevent this virus from developing, and it would probably not have been possible to prevent it spreading within China to begin with. The fact that cases have been discovered not only in Asia but also in Europe and Canada, however, has everything to do with a policy that is too <span class="italic">laissez faire</span> and too tolerant. Business interests that result in intensive contact with East Asia must be subordinated to the combating and containment of this disease. I would like to ask the Commission to consult with the Member States on restricting air travel and imposing strict quarantine regulations on those entering Europe from infected areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nearly a hundred people have died, and thousands more have been infected. Antibiotics do not work and there are, as yet, no antiviral drugs, so we must be extremely cautious. On 19 March the European network on imported infectious diseases stated that SARS could be transmitted only via direct contact. We do not, however, know that for sure. The precautionary principle must be applied. The pattern in which SARS is spreading raises many questions. It is therefore high time the European Union took action. My group, the Greens, suggests four measures. Firstly, all airlines flying into Europe carrying passengers from China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan and Singapore must have all passengers examined by doctors before they travel to Europe, and if there is any doubt, passengers from these countries must be barred from departing for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European authorities must strongly advise people not to travel from Europe to these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Greek Presidency must call a meeting of the European Ministers of Health very soon for additional consultations on how to tackle SARS.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, as health problems – like environmental problems – do not respect borders, health care must be a European competence, just as the environment is. A European centre for combating infectious diseases is not enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A year and a half ago, I tabled a question to the Commission stressing that such incidents can occur, for viruses, bacteria and toxic substances are used and manipulated throughout the world without our knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">The present viral infection, known as SARS, has caused a veritable wave of panic throughout the world in case it spreads quickly. The fears derive, first and foremost, from the fact that we know little about the infection at present or, at any rate, not enough to be sure that we will all escape infection.</p>
<p class="contents">The source appears to be in the Guadalong province of China, from where the infection spread to the major cities of the Far East: Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Shanghai and Bejing, and then throughout the world, causing infection and death. As you all know, there is not much control in these areas in terms of either hygiene or the use of appropriate drugs to fight these diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not know the causative agent of the viral infection in question. It was probably formed when an animal virus, a coronavirus, mutated. It is thought that a virus escaped when a scientist was manipulating it to create the vaccine or modify it. It appears that the scientist died from the virus.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do know about this syndrome is that infection takes place by – take note – direct transmission but also environmental transmission. The only way of diagnosing the syndrome is as yet symptomatic, for there are no clinical diagnosis kits available. There is no applicable treatment. Infected patients can only be given adjunct treatment, since doctors have not yet identified the active antiviral agents which would be able to fight it. Clearly, since it is not yet possible to identify the causative agent, the people of the European Union and the rest of the world are faced with major difficulties in terms of what action to take, not least in view of a number of major factors which are responsible for the spread of the virus. The source of the spread of the virus appears to be one of the largest financial centres of the Far East, through which large numbers of people and a lot of goods pass: China, a country which has only consented to take part in the exchange of information today – there is no Internet connection between Cuba and China.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, we call upon the Commission to take a number of measures. Firstly, to set up a task force of experts – not<span class="bold"> </span>a body<span class="bold"> </span>or a committee – to monitor the spread of the disease within the EU. When I go into the operating theatre, I choose a deputy and an assistant; I do not want a school. Secondly, to define, together with the WHO, a standard isolation procedure for suspected cases in EU citizens, to be applied in all the Member States, so that the Member States are not all left to decide on their own national procedures. Thirdly, to call upon all the Member States to set up a database of people who have passed through or stayed in the areas at risk in the last three months, monitoring their state of health, so to be able to take prompt action should they prove to be infected. Fourthly, to lay down, together with the WHO, procedures and time frames for quarantining and disinfecting people, animals and goods coming from the areas at risk, thus avoiding different levels of protection being adopted in the different States. Fifthly, to establish an emergency health fund similar to the funds which used to be set up in respect of natural disasters, so that each Member State can equip itself to face this potential epidemic.</p>
<p class="contents">These organisation and information strategies are essential if we are to be able to take immediate, focused action when a vaccine becomes available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Severe acute respiratory syndrome has so far attacked 2 416 people of all ages and has caused 89 deaths, mainly in Asia. Of course, what is important is that the authorities in China, where the epidemic first broke out, have allowed experts from the World Health Organisation, albeit somewhat belatedly, to visit the south of the country and help investigate the factors which cause the disease and how it is transmitted. The speed at which the epidemic is spreading proves how important it is for every case to be reported at once, which is why I believe that the European Commission should exhaust every means at its disposal to persuade third countries to inform all the competent agencies at once and cooperate efficiently, regardless of whether or not they have signed a cooperation agreement with the World Health Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been 46 cases within the European Union, affecting people who have travelled to one of the countries in which the disease is endemic, but so far there have been no reports of any cases of secondary transmission or deaths. I trust that these encouraging factors are due not just to the early warning system, which was a great help in allowing precautions to be taken, but also to the high level of health care in hospitals. Further cooperation between the Member States and the World Health Organisation will allow a continuous two-way flow of information, so that any additional measures considered necessary on the basis of new information can be taken, not that this can be considered adequate. You will understand that I refer purely to the public health aspect of the problem. I will not dwell on the economic repercussions caused by restricting air travel and tourism to high-risk areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, as we have said in the past, the emergence of new threats to public health means that we urgently need to set up systems which can respond promptly, immediately and efficiently to daily dangers and challenges. There are a number of actions which are considered advisable along these lines, in tandem with existing measures. They are:</p>
<p class="contents">- the immediate creation and operation of a European centre to control and monitor infectious diseases, similar to the CDC in the United States. It is important within the framework of this centre to operate a network of laboratories to investigate epidemics and conduct related research;</p>
<p class="contents">- the creation of a team of experts, a task force which could take action in the event of epidemics with natural causes rather than as the result of deliberate action, as has already been set up for biological terrorism and, finally:</p>
<p class="contents">- the provision of appropriations for technical support for the aforementioned actions.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Commissioner, the Greek Presidency is trying to strengthen the legal basis in the field of public health. I trust that this unfortunate situation will make this need clearer and convince those who disagree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Eighty years ago there was a link between major wars, disasters and a pandemic. No one knows at this stage exactly what will be the nature, and the possible spread, of the SARS disease. It appears to be resistant to treatment by antibiotics, to have a variable development and not necessarily to follow the course one would expect in terms of the vulnerability of the patients concerned. Healthy people are succumbing as fast as, or faster than, the very old and the very young.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances you, Commissioner, are now facing for the first time on the human front what you have faced three or four times in terms of animal diseases. Most of us in this House, like Mrs Malliori who has just spoken, will be looking now in this grave crisis for the setting-up of something like a rapid alert system bringing together all the preventive measures which the European Union countries can carry out themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Malliori has just said, if – despite all the tragic possibilities – we can see this as an opportunity to bring closer together in some form of European health centre the process of monitoring and analysing this threat, which is certainly more serious and less known than anything we have seen in recent years, then that at least will mean that some good comes out of this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the analysis of the data from Asia which have come to the Commissioner so far, we now know sufficient about the nature of the outbreak in Guangdong province last year, and the degree to which that may have gone through a cycle of its own which can now be analysed, to have some idea of how the disease should be captured and isolated here in Western Europe. It looks as though there are a number of peculiarities to this disease and I would hope that, being still relatively free from it, we can analyse in depth the cases that have arrived in the European Union. We are better placed than most to turn this into an epidemic which is curable, and not a pandemic which threatens us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission statement and our debate today highlight a very important problem that the whole world – indeed mankind globally – should take an interest in. We should be alert to and aware of the dangers of sudden outbreaks of highly infectious and dangerous diseases which can suddenly spread on a global basis. Given modern transport systems, we should all be aware of the potential problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It can be very difficult – especially in the early stages in remote areas – to identify a dangerous outbreak that has global implications. Nevertheless, we should congratulate the Chinese authorities on cooperating with an international organisation, the WHO, in its investigations into the specific characteristics of the disease and the particular modes of transmission. We look forward to further enhanced cooperation by the Chinese authorities with regard to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">As with all outbreaks of this kind, lessons must be learned. We would call in particular on the Chinese authorities to set an example to the world and hold a full, public and transparent inquiry into the outbreak of this disease and its means of transmission. We hope they will involve fully, where appropriate, international bodies, in particular the WHO, and ensure that the whole world learns lessons from China's experiences in dealing with this incident.</p>
<p class="contents">We can expect to see further incidents of this type in future. Sudden and rapidly spreading epidemics of poorly understood diseases are certain to occur elsewhere and at other times. It is in Europe's interest and the whole world's interest that China shows the world what must be done in these circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall respond to a number of issues which you have raised. Specifically, Mr Whitehead asked me about the need for a rapid response system. We have such a thing in place – the communicable disease network – which does valuable work in this area and has been doing valuable work in response to this particular outbreak of SARS.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in very close contact with the World Health Organization, not just from institution to institution. Since last year, a transfer of experts has taken place, with some WHO people working with us and some of our people working with them. This assists greatly in the transfer of information and knowledge between the institutions. The WHO has a team presently in place in China, carrying out the important work of determining what further needs to be done. I will review all of these issues with Dr Brundtland, the Director-General of the WHO, when I meet her at my next meeting on 6 May.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also particularly appropriate that many of you asked about the extent to which we may need to extend the competences at EU level. I am a little more optimistic about this than some of the speakers in this debate. I have discussed this with a number of Members of this House, and with a number of government ministers, for quite some time now. I am happy to say that this idea has found its way into a number of different fora, not least in the committee chaired by Mr Katiforis in his report that was presented to the Convention some weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">That report contained a number of recommendations, the weight of which was that there should be something in the Treaties creating an extended competence for public health which would provide us with a legal base to bring forward harmonising legislation in the area of public health. As someone said earlier in the debate, we have far greater powers in relation to animal health than to human health. I know that a lot of people in the House are concerned about this. I am also concerned about it. We need to change that. I have raised this matter a number of times at Commission meetings. I am very happy to tell the House that it is Commission policy that we pursue this issue in the Convention. We have already pursued it in Mr Katiforis' committee and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues I am currently working on in my own directorate-general is the shape of a new Article 152, which it would be desirable to include in a new constitutional treaty; this would provide the kind of legal base which, as many of you have argued here this evening, is necessary to establish a sufficient base for harmonising legislation in the area of communicable diseases and other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some cautious optimism that the Convention will take these ideas on board, that they will find their way into a final report and ultimately be discussed in an IGC and, I hope, eventually take their place in the final shape of the Convention that we ultimately put before the people of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
