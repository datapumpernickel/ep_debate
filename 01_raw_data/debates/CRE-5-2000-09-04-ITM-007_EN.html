<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Galeote Quecedo (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I believe that we all agree that in 2000, obviously, the Community already enjoys numerous and fundamental competencies in the external field. The Maastricht reform reflects the aspiration, so often expressed in this House, that Europe should speak with one voice in the international arena.</p>
<p class="contents">With the CFSP, the Union’s external activity takes on a new dimension, definitively going beyond the economic field in order to participate actively in external policy. However, the European Union repeatedly has cause to regret – we have been seeing this recently – that it cannot meet the requirements of external action. Having said this, I wish to begin by saying that the objective of this report is not to seek a further increase in the competencies of the Union in the external field. Those who wish to do that have other debates, in the field of institutional reform, in which to find expression for their aspirations.</p>
<p class="contents">All that we are proposing is to implement measures which will rationalise and improve the way in which the enormous external action of the Community institutions is carried out. We propose basically to make decisive progress in three areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, by improving the training of Community officials intended to be involved in carrying out external actions. The numerous officials in the Commission who deal with external relations, taking on competencies of prime importance, are technical specialists but in general they lack the prior diplomatic training, which is necessary to fulfil their duties. We therefore believe we need to create a Community diplomatic college, which will provide Community officials intended for external action with a good diplomatic and international training.</p>
<p class="contents">To the same end, we believe it is necessary to provide an opportunity to link the national diplomatic corps, whose experience and long tradition are of great value, to our external action, and we therefore propose to implement a ‘bridging’ system between national external services and the Community external service.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we wish to clarify and develop the legal status of the Commission’s current external delegations, their role and their relationship with the various Community institutions. The Commission delegations have seen a dramatic quantitative and qualitative expansion over recent years. Nevertheless, they do not function in the same way and their relationship with other institutions is unclear, since it is not regulated. We therefore propose that the Commission delegations become Community delegations so that their relations with the Council may be closer, through the High Representative of the CFSP, as well as their relations with the European Parliament and its members, thereby guaranteeing greater efficiency and political control of their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and lastly, we intend to improve the coordination between the delegations and the external services of the Member States. We need to promote this type of coordination, in order to prevent confusion and inconsistency, not to mention other deficiencies, which were plain to see at the informal General Affairs Council in Evian last weekend. To this end we propose various mechanisms and, amongst other things, we envisage the possibility of joining together the missions of those Member States that agree to do so with the current Commission delegations, at the appropriate time. Furthermore, this would represent a considerable reduction in costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr President, none of the proposals that have been put forward represent institutional reforms, and even less the ceding of Member States’ sovereignty. We are simply proposing a more effective use of the competencies which have already been granted. We are not setting out to propose conflicting models of Europeanism, but simply to be more efficient. Therefore, the rapporteur cannot support those amendments which would represent profound structural changes to the institutional architecture of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I would like to express my gratitude for the other contributions which, in committee and with tomorrow’s vote in Parliament, greatly enrich the initial proposal. I would ask the various groups to vote in favour of this report and the European Commission to reflect the feelings of this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we look at how the tasks of the European Commission, and, in fact, those of the European Union in general, have developed, then we see that this relates to the new phenomenon of the candidate countries, the old phenomenon of the existence of trading partners and development regions, and the not so new phenomenon of Bosnia and former Yugoslavia. These are areas in which the European Union, and the European Commission in particular, have an abundance of tasks before them.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal of criticism of European effectiveness has to do with the way in which these tasks are organised. The committees we have sent out there appear to echo the call for decentralisation that is often heard in other areas of the European Union too. Decentralisation is needed to make decision-making more effective and also to ensure that when there is no pressing reason for something to be dealt with in Brussels, it can be decided on locally. Naturally this will directly affect the way in which these European missions are assessed. For example, the mandate of the European missions must be widened, which therefore means that they will need more personnel. There have been some very embarrassing discrepancies between the possibilities open to the European missions, and those of the United States, for example. Indeed this found expression in the number of people that could be employed locally through the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s profile could be raised by putting Mr Galeote Quecedo’s plans into practice. We must have real EU embassies that are at least some sort of a match for the United States embassies, especially in areas where it is the European Union that bears most responsibility. Therefore we cannot tolerate having ineffective diplomats <span class="italic">in situ</span>. I believe it behoves the Commissioner to look closely at who is proving effective and who is failing on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that there is contact between the European diplomats out there and the European Parliament. Naturally this must proceed under the supervision of the Commissioner who has responsibility for these affairs. This contact with diplomats appointed as special envoys by the European Parliament is, of course, also something we would heartily recommend. We gladly subscribe to those aspects of Mr Galeote Quecedo’s report that could lead to us speaking with one voice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carrilho (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, this report on a European Parliament initiative highlights an extremely important issue that we are facing, not only in the field of common foreign and security policy but in the context of enlargement of the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of CFSP, notable progress is already being made, particularly in terms of cooperation in the area of defence. A common military force is being created. It would be strange – not to say dangerous – if the European Union did not at the same time strive to improve its common diplomatic instruments. There is no excuse for lagging behind in this area, even if we take the factor of each Member State’s national interest into account as well as the almost purely economic nature of the history of the Community’s institutions between the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Maastricht.</p>
<p class="contents">Diplomacy at the beginning of the twenty-first century has indeed been marked by great events and processes that are giving it much greater scope than it has had in the past. Amongst these I would highlight the globalisation of the international economy and the financial markets. It is no exaggeration to state with all certainty that diplomatic activity is becoming more and more involved in the economic sphere and to say that, in turn, economic interests cannot be protected without diplomatic activity. As is also well known, this situation is being played out against a backdrop in which the positions of the main players on the international political stage are being redefined.</p>
<p class="contents">The aims that provide the market with additional sensitivity or idealism, however, particularly the fight for a project which is able to reconcile the goals of economic development and those of social and political development cannot be reached unless there is a high degree of cooperation between the Member States at all levels, specifically at the diplomatic level.</p>
<p class="contents">What better instrument than diplomacy can there be for promoting objectives of peace and of reconciling national interests? The European Union must provide itself, as this report recommends, with more and better elements of common diplomacy. It is quite clear that, amongst other obstacles, organising matters according to pillars and the fact that the European Union has no legal personality both make it more difficult to achieve this aim and forced this report’s proposals to perform some clever balancing tricks.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we can, at no great financial or organisational cost, contribute to a better use of the diplomatic resources we already have in the European Union, to everyone’s benefit. The wealth and diversity of diplomatic experience in the various countries of Europe is also recognised throughout the world. It would be a mistake to think that any of the proposals put forward in this report could harm processes that are under way in the field of CFSP in general, or in the field of diplomacy in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The underlying aim of this report, as we understand it, following on from several discussions held over a period of months, is to bring together all relevant current experiences and processes and to direct them towards a common goal, which is, by and large, to create a genuine common European diplomatic service.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to say that although one might criticise certain aspects of the report, I have no hesitation in recommending that you adopt it, and I hope that the proposals it contains are given the reception that they deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rather, it is a question of improving the quality of the external service the Community already has and of improving cooperation between that service and the Member States’ external services. There is no doubt that there is a need for improved training of this kind in the majority of Member States, and especially in the applicant countries which will, of course, soon need a sizeable staff of well-trained people. We in the Liberal Group attach importance to the fact that what is at issue here is in-service training and not basic training. By that, I mean providing training to people who are already in service or on the way to joining the service. And we attach great importance to the fact that the training should be open to participants from the national external services so that there is interaction between EU and national diplomats. We have therefore tabled a number of amendments which we hope Parliament can accept. It is debatable whether there is a need for a new institution with its own building and board of management, as well as a heated dispute about where the institution is to be located. We would certainly prefer to support actual activities than just bricks and mortar, but we are able wholeheartedly to support the intention behind the proposal, and we hope that Mr Galeote Quecedo’s reflections will be given careful consideration in the Member States, the Commission and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In particular, I feel that it is a mistake to deny, as Mr Galeote Quecedo has done, that the political aim of his report is the gradual creation of a common diplomacy as the expression of a common policy. This is to ignore the reality that what we have at the moment is a discordant, incoherent chorus of European countries and their 14 thousand or so diplomats, compared to the 3 500 diplomats of the United States. We should simply supplement the 15 diplomatic corps with another, more or less competent corps, made up of European Union officials or, as is the case today precisely in Commissioner Patten’s entourage, national diplomats, possibly including more representatives from some countries than others.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel that the debate on Commissioner Verheugen’s statements indicated extremely clearly that it is not possible for the Union to carry out its external activities in the context of such a lack of cohesion and such frustration caused by the confusion of powers and responsibilities. Commissioner Patten, you have already spoken on this subject, Commissioner Verheugen will also do so, and then each of the Member States will give their opinion. This means that the message we send to the European citizens can only be contradictory.</p>
<p class="contents">The group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will support Amendments Nos 5 and 6 tabled by Mr Dupuis, which introduce the political agenda of a common diplomacy and the proposal to start establishing European Union embassies in those countries where not all the countries of the Union are represented. I hope that others will also support these amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We feel that Mr Galeote Quecedo has carried out a profound, serious and ambitious piece of work, although it is also prudent with regard to current prospects. The joint effort in committee by the various political groups demonstrates that common diplomacy is a concern felt by all of us. In fact, our experience, acquired through visits to different parts of the world, highlights four worrying issues:</p>
<p class="contents">First: the scant and insufficient coordination of the Member States with regard to issues that must be addressed jointly whenever the interests of the European Union are at stake, and the minimal cooperation between the delegations of the European Union. Also, we sometimes fail to exploit the rich diplomatic experience we possess in Europe and often there are worrying confrontations between these various diplomatic services.</p>
<p class="contents">Second: the accidental occurrence of contradictions in interventions by different countries on issues affecting the interests of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Third: the insufficient coordination in the defence of points of view, interests and responsibilities of the European Union in international bodies of a political, economic, cultural nature etc., such as the UN, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organisation, the WHO etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth: we have also noted that the presence of the European Union is weak in relation to its economic importance and also in relation to the significant presence of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe it is important to proceed with the proposal presented in the report and, furthermore, to take more cohesive action, make a greater impact and make greater progress in that direction. Hence the usefulness of the proposal to create a Community diplomatic college and also the importance, which appears in Mr Galeote Quecedo’s report, of the European Parliament playing an important role as trustee of the sovereignty and will of the European citizens in order to give content to this Community diplomacy and also give content to this prospect of constructing a European Union which creates peace, respect for international law and solidarity in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as I said at the beginning, our group will broadly support Mr Galeote Quecedo’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is the real issue here? The real issue is nothing less than providing the European Union, which, by the way, is now simply the Commission, with those final attributes of a sovereign State that was lacking, i.e. a diplomatic service and the prerequisite for establishing it, which is legal personality. Let us be logical about this. The only reason for this college’s existence is to create a common diplomatic service and to do so in a completely transparent way, as outlined in the Galeote Quecedo report.</p>
<p class="contents">If those who back this report achieve their aims, the ‘carving up’ of our nations will thus have reached its logical conclusion, by once again adopting the old Monnet, Schuman and Delors method, which consists of creating a body in the hope that it will get around to creating its own role and content. The truth is, however, that so many preconditions have been left out that people may have the impression that we do not care what anyone thinks. We are creating a diplomatic instrument without even thinking about the essential prerequisite of a common diplomatic policy. This itself presupposes another prerequisite, which is that the common interests of the Member States must be defined. This prerequisite in turn presupposes another, consisting of defining a common link between Europe and the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are only talking about the three main powers, Germany, Great Britain and France, it is impossible to see what points would form the basis of our common interests and diplomatic policy, either on Western Europe’s relationship with the United States or on the role of NATO, subjects on which we are definitely not in agreement nor likely to be, or on the East – and here we have the thorny question of Russia and our relations with the Central European countries in general – or on the South, perhaps significantly less where the South is concerned, particularly in the context of the Mediterranean policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is therefore a fraud, and the worst of all kinds of fraud at that, which is intellectual fraud, unless, that is, we accept that the diplomacy of the main power – the central power – can effectively be foisted on everyone else, which would actually amount to solving the problem. Quite recently, at the UN ‘Women 2000’ conference, our Polish friends were able to see just how flexible common diplomacy really is when they were ordered to fall into line with the position laid down by the Union, or face delays in their country’s application for Membership.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel sure that the experience of our friends in Central Europe in the field of resistance to totalitarianism could prove useful to us some day, and furthermore, an illustration of this form of totalitarianism has been provided recently by the unacceptable quarrel that some people are picking with one of our fellow Members, Daniel Hannan. Let there be no mistake, the idea of common representation at the United Nations is being used to attack the permanent seats held by certain Member States as well as the idea that there could be dissident voices in this world, such as the voice France tries very often to make heard with regard to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, Europe can speak with one voice only if it has nothing to say. This has been proved once again and it has also been proved that this Europe is not simply negating nations as individual nations – it is rejecting and annihilating Europe itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that this is an over-cautious report, and yet it is already raising some people’s hackles. It would have been better to address the crux of the matter and I am sorry that the report has not done this.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of diplomacy is not merely a question of training diplomats and the status of delegations. The issue is of fundamental importance and there is a powerful taboo in this Parliament which we are never prepared to confront: that we have fifteen national diplomatic services, which have been strengthened over years of integration by gradually taking over the competencies of all the national ministries and which have become the real powers, the main power blocking any possible reform of foreign affairs and diplomacy, because it is their power that would ultimately be under threat. They had no trouble delegating and taking the powers of the other ministries to the European level, but when it comes to their own power, it is a different question altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Frassoni pointed out how ridiculous it is to have a situation in which we have 14 000 diplomats, whilst the United States has 3 000, with the cost/quality ratio of which we are fully aware. We must address the issue of the diplomatic services and the issue of external affairs policy with the same approach that we used to achieve economic and monetary union, by establishing a gradual process of communitising external policy and the diplomatic services. Unfortunately, the report does not address these issues. Unfortunately, we are only proposing slight changes, which will just add a new level to the structures that already exist and we are in danger of ending up with bodies that are even more incapable of making the right decisions quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the questions we must answer are these: do we or do we not want to communitise external affairs policy? Do we want to make the same huge mistake that we made by creating the figure of Mr CFSP and by restoring exclusive Community competence for external policy to the Commission or to a Vice-President of the Commission? These are the real questions. I am rather disappointed that the report does not discuss these issues and somewhat surprised that the EPP has adopted this position given that, tomorrow, in another report on the Union’s political priorities, it will probably adopt a more forthright position on the communitisation of external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge our rapporteur and friend, Mr Galeote Quecedo, to perhaps incorporate some of the amendments that have been tabled and to ensure that a process is initiated, that an appeal is made to the Council and that, for once, our Parliament does not fall short of the position of the Council and the Commission, as unfortunately has been the case for the last ten years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only occasionally does the rapporteur display any sense of reality. This is very clearly the case in Recital O, in which he states that “the objective is certainly not to create a single diplomatic service to replace the foreign services of the Member States”. Yet at the same time, the entire document is suffused with the notion of – it would be safe to say, the passionate desire for – a Community diplomatic service for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur rationalises his intention at the very beginning of his report. In his words: “since the 1950s the Community’s external activity has expanded continuously”. Given that the Union’s vacillating behaviour in the Balkans during the recently elapsed decade of the previous century is still fresh in the memory, this robust declaration sounds extremely implausible to my mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point raised by Mr Galeote Quecedo is that of “a lack of coordination” in the foreign policy of the EU Member States, which he believes to be essential to the “visibility and effectiveness” of the CFSP. Does this really amount to nothing more than a coordination problem? As if the divergent national interests of the Member States had already been consigned to the European past! The opposite is true. The CFSP’s self-same lack of efficiency and visibility, as picked up on by the rapporteur, can be directly attributed to the divergent interests of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The tension between fantasy and reality in the report also manifests itself in the proposal to set up a College of European Diplomacy. Just how realistic is it to ask for “adequate funding to be provided in the General Budget” for this project when the current EU delegations are already having to contend with serious personnel shortages due to a lack of funds? Mr Galeote Quecedo makes the same point himself in his explanatory statement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the question I am dying to ask is this: to what extent do the Member States themselves actually share the rapporteur’s views? At the end of the day, there is nothing skilful about spending Community money. On no account does this typically European custom rule out legitimate and extremely useful prior enquiries as to necessity and effectiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mrs Carrilho has pointed out, this is the first own-initiative report which this Parliament is approving in the field of external policy during this parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">It is odd to hear the interventions of certain MEPs who say that they find this report very timid, and of others who feel that it will put an end to the last redoubt of Member States’ sovereignty. I believe that this report represents a move in the right direction. I believe that it limits itself to adhering pragmatically to the Community method and that it clearly demonstrates that joint diplomacy is one of the fundamental aspects of the visibility of the European Union’s external action.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if we can speak today of the European Union as the main economic power, the main industrial power or the main financial power in the world. What we can say, without a shadow of a doubt, is that the European Union is today the main provider of development aid, and this means that the European Commission delegates play a very important role when it comes to representing the Community institutions and, in particular, the Commission. This means that their specific importance in many cases, given the significant quantities they have to distribute, is greater than that of the ambassadors and of the Member States. Therefore, Mr President, it is clear that anything which helps to improve the preparation and knowledge of the Commission officials will be an important element for the European Union’s external action.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has explained the main initiatives contained in his report: the creation of a common diplomatic college, the establishment of procedures for Commission delegates to be received in third countries – an initiative which Mr Patten has accepted in general terms and which I am pleased to see included in this report – and also the drawing up of an annual report on the activity of European Union delegates.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Mr President, that these initiatives will contribute effectively to the creation of a more visible and coherent external policy for European Union action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, if we are to support the Union’s international activities, we need suitable mechanisms, knowledge and skills. Equally clearly, these alone are not enough. We also need policies. In this sense, Mr Galeote Quecedo’s report remains within the limits of procedural rationalisation; it also remains within the framework of certain policies. We often ask the question: which came first, the chicken or the egg? Something of the sort hangs over today’s debate. But we must be clear that there are no vacuums in life. In this sense, moaning and groaning solves nothing in politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said which, the framework to which the Galeote Quecedo report belongs will always dictate the conditions both for rationalising procedures and for the prospects of common diplomacy. In this sense, it moves within the bounds of technocratic rationalisation and goes no further than policy will allow. However we, the citizens of Europe, who are striving for a better future for the people of Europe and of the world as a whole, have to realise that we need to intervene in these matters transcendently. We need to move forward, we need to be guided by the logic of a positive dynamic balance, not a static balance which goes nowhere. In this sense, there have indeed been huge vacuums in the CFSP and we have all acknowledged the fact and seen what is needed in order to put flesh on the bones of this policy, which is instrumental to the political development of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, the report translates the initiative of the European Parliament into a framework, into prospects, action and rationalisation. In any event, if there is anyone here in this House – and I do not think that there is – who believes that Europe has no future, they can express it somewhat differently. But I believe that the people of Europe and the large majority of parties and factions see Europe as a Europe with prospects, a Europe of peace, a Europe of cooperation, a Europe of social cohesion, a Europe of development. And this sort of Europe cannot function if it has no prospect of a common foreign policy and defence and security policy, i.e. if it does not have the corresponding mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, the tiny foundation stone of this structure which the European Parliament is laying today represents a serious starting point and I think that it has created new momentum and better prospects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is quite a lot of double-talk here tonight. On the one hand, people are saying that we are not talking about or aiming for a single diplomatic corps, but it is quite clear that the aim of this whole project is to have EU embassies abroad and to abolish national ones. I am not being nationalistic and saying that I want the Irish Embassy, but there is a certain amount of danger in this, particularly because it is geared towards the common foreign and security policy, which is not in the interest of the developing world or of the peoples that have been persecuted and exploited by Member States of this Union. You only need to look at the number of, for example, British embassies abroad. Britain has twice as many embassies as either France or Germany. It has a huge diplomatic corps which reflects its colonial past. I have grave reservations about the idea of a common European embassy, given that in the past people fleeing persecution in certain countries were able to go into some embassies and seek asylum and get protection.</p>
<p class="contents">What happens if you have a single European diplomatic presence abroad? We abolish national embassies. What would happen then if someone fleeing from persecution were to seek asylum or help from the EU embassy if it did not suit the EU's interests to support him or her?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there are grave dangers in what we are doing. It is interesting to hear some people speaking today about the need for a higher profile and EU embassies to compete with the US. This is all about competition. It is about being able to compete with other superpowers.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not approve of the idea that Europe should create another superpower. To do so would destabilise the global community. Whereas, we should look for more cooperation and less competition. The idea of competing with the US is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">If you look at the report itself, it is geared towards facilitating the common foreign and security policy. Not all Greens and EFA members in our group – the non-federalists – would support Mr Dupuis' amendments, because we believe that they are moving in the same direction and we would have grave reservations about that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In essence, this proposal, tabled no less as a proposal by the European Parliament, which is supposed to represent the people, is intended to deprive Member States of the facility to exercise an independent foreign policy which differs from the choices made by the dominant circles in the European Union, to the detriment of the people. It is basically intended to abolish diplomatic representation of the people, of the Member States, and to replace it with diplomatic representation directed by the managing board of the European Union. This proposal is intended to take all foreign policy matters out of the jurisdiction of national governments, far from any possible democratic control, and away from national parliaments, and is therefore in violation of national constitutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Communist Party of Greece, as you know, is opposed to any further integration of the European Union and to the CFSP and the superpowers of Mr CFSP, the notorious Mr Solana. We are opposed to measures which seek to convert national governments into powerless county councils, which is why we shall be voting against the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Orden (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Outwardly, Mr Galeote Quecedo's report seems very reasonable, but on closer examination, we get a rather different picture. If the proposals were pursued, we would have another building block in the construction of a European State.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many points of detail in the report which are particularly controversial, not least the idea of European Union embassies and the suggestion that the European Union should have "coordinated representation in international bodies such as the UN". The implication of this is that the United Kingdom and France should give up their seats in the Security Council and make way for an EU representative. I am alarmed at the anti-United States rhetoric which we have heard from a number of speakers, and at some of the other outbursts from other Members.</p>
<p class="contents">This is hardly the moment for the Commission to be encouraged to embark on yet another ambitious development of its role. The Commission's external assistance programmes account for nearly EUR 10 billion this year, and the priority task of the Community delegations is to administer these programmes properly and efficiently. Mr Patten has just made reference to this. In his communication on the reform of external assistance, Mr Patten recognised, and I quote, "acute staff shortages have had a direct and negative impact on the speediness and quality of EC aid delivery". He said that there is an urgent need to focus activities on core tasks and that additional staff needs will be concentrated in the area of project and programme implementation, in particular within delegations.</p>
<p class="contents">The clear conclusion is that the most important role of delegations is the administration of external assistance, not to try and run some additional diplomatic tasks. Management personnel is what we need in the delegations. There is no recognition of this in the Galeote Quecedo report. Yes, the Commission needs to recruit a different sort of personnel. Yes, it needs to give them improved, specialist training, but not for some new-fangled diplomatic service, but to get the external assistance programmes on the right footing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I understand it, it was agreed that the EU embassies in third countries and the embassies of the Member States should improve their level of cooperation and coordinate their development programmes, and that there should be far more joint action. Now these are things we have already called for on countless occasions, and so I am delighted that Mr Galeote Quecedo has made a proposal that is very much in line with our wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, last week, I was in Indonesia on a fact-finding mission and all I can say is that the EU delegation out there provided me with outstanding support. When I go on foreign trips, I always ask for a meeting to be arranged which will be attended by all the EU ambassadors, i.e. the ambassadors of the 15 Member States. This occasion was no exception, and a meeting was indeed arranged. And then there are complaints that the joint policy of the EU Member States is not in the limelight enough, and that although people in Indonesia know full well what Japan and the United States are doing there, they do not have a clear enough idea as to what the 15 Member States of the European Union are doing there. If I then ask: ‘how do you coordinate your work, and how do you harmonise your activities, the answer is: ‘that is not something we do’. And I would go so far as to say that people seem to be in great fear of achieving a degree of coordination and harmonisation. That is why I think it is so important that these agreements were reached in Evian, and why I welcome with open arms the fact that an EU college of diplomacy has been proposed. The national diplomats should also be required to attend courses at a college of this kind, so that they understand how to take joint action at European level. There is an urgent need for this. It is not a question of wanting to outdo the United States, or Japan, for example, but what we do need to do is give Europe a much higher profile in third countries. Accordingly, I have a great deal of time for Mr Galeote Quecedo’s report and I truly hope that the Evian proposals come to fruition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important for each individual Member State to retain and extend the opportunities it has for asserting, through its government and embassies, the voice and commitment of its own people on international issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Embassies constitute one of the most essential and most obvious expressions of national sovereignty. History shows how, for example, a country such as Norway fought to conduct its own diplomacy in its struggle for independence from Sweden. By having its own embassy, a country can also provide important services to its citizens when they visit another country. The embassy can provide them with a service in their own language. At the same time, embassies constitute indispensable sources of information and centres of analytical work for the various governments of the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Galeote Quecedo has done a very fine job, but I am sceptical about the following points: recital E concerning the establishment of a professional and permanent community diplomatic service; and recital P in which there is talk of setting up EU embassies in the future. What exactly does this mean, Mr Galeote Quecedo and Commissioner Patten?</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 1 – the setting up of a College of European Diplomacy. In which language is it to operate – in Spanish, English, French or in the languages of all the Member States? Paragraph 12 – in which I think the embassies of the Member States are being told that they are to issue joint statements of their views. Is this not already clear to them under the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is talk of guaranteeing coordinated representation in the EU and other international bodies. Sweden and many other countries have proud traditions in the United Nations. Let us continue along these lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I am taking the floor as someone who until last April was a very ordinary civil servant in the German diplomatic service, and so people might perhaps think that I would be certain to be relatively sceptical about an approach of this kind because it will surely tend to erode the powers of national colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not sceptical, and I should like to warmly congratulate Mr Galeote Quecedo on his report. I am, however, rather surprised at the strange scenarios depicted by some of the honourable members here. What is this really about? Mr Galeote Quecedo actually made this quite clear: there is a remit for the European Union to be represented in third countries and this is about us being represented there better and more professionally within its terms; it is about our people whom we post there being able to work as effectively as possible within their remit.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to offend anybody, but if I imagine let's say a former national civil servant from the Ministry of Agriculture in a Member State coming into the Commission at some point and doing really outstanding work internally, and then being appointed to head perhaps an external delegation or a Commission representation abroad, I think that this person would definitely still gain from learning what national colleagues will have perhaps learnt at a diplomatic college. And I believe that this would allow the person to do their job even more successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, however, I should also like to say that this remit will of course grow in conjunction with powers at European level. In this respect, both the fears expressed by Mr Coûteaux on the one hand, and the hopes expressed by Mr Dupuis on the other, are certainly justified. As the tasks broaden, so the power devolved to these representations will increase, but this is also what we, as a body, have all wanted. Seen from this point of view, it is good if we already start making appropriate preparations now. I believe that the report drafted by Mr Galeote Quecedo is a very good one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I very much welcome the interest that Parliament has shown in the external service, in particular, Mr Galeote Quecedo's report. I want to assure Parliament that we will consider its recommendations very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pay particular tribute to Mr Galeote Quecedo. He deserves considerable respect for the very professional and open-minded way in which he has carried out his work. I can say without any reservation that the Commission has benefited from the report and it is bound to make a permanent impression on the way we run our external service in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is already a subject in which we have been taking a keen interest. I left a special meeting of virtually all our heads of delegation in Brussels early today specifically to be here for this debate. When apologising for my early departure I was able to inform them of the close interest that Parliament takes in these matters. The fact that we called all our heads of delegation to Brussels at this time is a sign of our determination to give a firm lead to the external service and to provide it with the career structure and the leadership that it deserves and needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Members will have seen the communication on the development of the external service that was adopted by the Commission on 18 July. It recommends continuing to rebalance delegation staff between officials and local agents and continuing the regionalisation of our representation in a way that will free up 32 official posts immediately to be redeployed to delegations that need reinforcement. The communication updates the list of priorities for the opening of new delegations and offices. However, even though some of these are urgent priorities, our first concern must be to use available resources to reinforce some of our existing delegations. The communication also describes the measures we are taking to devolve authority from Brussels to delegations in the field, known in jargon as "deconcentration". This is closely linked to our efforts to reform our external assistance programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication makes it clear that what it proposes is only a first step. We intend to continue and to ensure the best use of the resources we have at our disposal on the basis of an evaluation of the workload of each delegation. I want to make this point very clear because it is the backdrop to Mr Galeote Quecedo's report. If we get through our reform proposals and if they are supported by the budgetary authority, in the SCR and the Bureau d'assistance technique combined we will have fewer people managing our external programmes, though we will have more than at present in the SCR. But we will have fewer people in Brussels and more people in the field. That is the balance we should be striking: to have more of the work done on the ground in our delegations. We will be preparing a follow-up communication on the external services in the first half of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me comment specifically on Mr Galeote Quecedo's report. It makes recommendations in three main areas: the training of officials assigned to external relations, the legal status of delegations and coordination with Member States. A number of the points raised by the resolution, for example on regionalisation and on the evaluation of our network of external representations, are already covered in our own communication. The report stresses the role of the Commission and its delegations in the Community's external activities and it is, of course, essential that the Commission's external service be able to continue to contribute properly.</p>
<p class="contents">The first step must be to develop the training of officials in the Commission who deal with external relations. I am delighted that the report puts so much informed stress on that point. We have already made good progress but we need to build on it very fast indeed, particularly given the deconcentration that I have talked about. We should try, as the report suggests, to benefit from the skills and experience of existing training institutions in the Member States. We are already in contact with many of them and we will seek to deepen that relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether it is now time to set up a college of European diplomacy is something that we will have to look at very carefully with Parliament, the Council and others. We will certainly consider that proposal very carefully and it underlines the importance of training – language training, management training, all the other sorts of training that are essential in order to make our delivery of programmes and our representation overseas more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">On the legal status of delegations I should say that although delegations are formally delegations of the Commission they are under clear instructions to give all possible assistance to all the institutions of the European Union and indeed to Member States. I am not convinced of the need to formalise this state of affairs since it exists already.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to complicate procedures further, but again I am open-minded on the issue. We have made it absolutely clear to our delegations that they should regard themselves as working for the High Representative and for the other institutions of the European Union, both when it comes to reporting and when it comes to logistical issues.</p>
<p class="contents">On relations with the Member States, I wholeheartedly endorse the proposal for greater cooperation. This is already our policy and the discussions this weekend at Evian very much concentrated on how best we can achieve that in practice. In our 1998 communication on the external service, we made it clear that any Member State that wished to keep a presence in a third country without maintaining an embassy was welcome to use the Commission's delegations. This has already happened on two occasions: in Sierra Leone by Germany and in Burundi by Austria. There is already a considerable degree of cooperation between Member States' embassies and Commission delegations. There are regular meetings at all levels. Joint reports are produced, either at the request of headquarters, or on the initiative of heads of missions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also supports and, when appropriate, seeks to participate in co-location projects where more than one Member State and/or the Commission agree to occupy premises jointly. We have a programme of secondment of Member States officials and diplomats to our delegations. There are ten in our delegations at the moment, with a few more due in the near future. The restriction on the development of this programme is not lack of will on our part – I want to make that clear – but to some extent a lack of resources and also a certain reluctance on the part of the Member States to respond to our invitation to second diplomats to the delegations.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to underline the importance of coordination. We have to cooperate better without finding ourselves in a situation in which everything we do is second-guessed, not just in Brussels, but in other countries as well.</p>
<p class="contents">All this discussion about coordination and about the future of the external service takes place against the backdrop of a treaty which talks about a common foreign and security policy, not a <span class="italic">single</span> foreign and security policy in a Union of fifteen Member States, each with its own foreign minister. I strongly suspect that we will have fifteen foreign ministers in the European Union for the foreseeable future. But what we have to do is make coordination and cooperation more effective, more meaningful and more professional.</p>
<p class="contents">A final plea. In welcoming this report and in promising active cooperation in following its recommendations I must stress that if the external service is to carry out the role which Parliament wants for it, it must have the resources to do so; that is, not just resources to place officials in third countries but also to ensure that they are properly trained, that they are equipped with the necessary information technology and that they have secure means of communication. Last and by no means least, it is very important that they are provided with adequate physical protection in what is an, often, very dangerous world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
