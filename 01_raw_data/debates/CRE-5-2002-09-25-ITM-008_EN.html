<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hautala (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">– (FI) </span>Mr President, my report concerns the improvement of fuel quality. Everyone will surely recall the directive we drafted in the codecision procedure in 1998, which established quality requirements for diesel fuel and petrol for the first time in the European Union and which has had a decisive part to play in reducing emissions of traffic exhaust. The simultaneous improvements made with regard to engine technology and fuel have inevitably had a part to play in this.</p>
<p class="contents">This time we are faced with the challenge of having to reduce the sulphur content of fuel to very nearly zero for both diesel fuel and normal petrol. Sulphur has proven to be a more strategic component in fuels than was earlier supposed. Petrol or diesel which contains sulphur produces noticeably far more exhaust emissions, and we now face a very specific challenge: the automotive industry and the manufacturers of catalytic converters should design more advanced engines and develop purification technology so that exhaust emissions really can be reduced to a very small fraction of what they were as recently as the early 1990s. This will not be possible unless we remove the sulphur from diesel and petrol.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal now before us aims at the complete removal of sulphur from these fuels by 2009. This is the most crucial decision contained in this report, and represents a compromise between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. If you recall, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission originally proposed that all fuels should be absolutely sulphur-free by 2011. Afterwards, Parliament responded by stating that there was every justification for bringing forward this reform so that it was fully implemented in 2008, and the Council in its common position in fact came very close to the opinion of Parliament. The year 2009 is now our target year, and I think Parliament should accept this date, even though I might perhaps say in this connection that I doubt whether the market will get round to implementing this reform faster than us legislators. Several Member States have realised that a very effective way to purify fuel is to offer small tax concessions in relation to normal fuel, and this practice, which originated in Scandinavia, in Sweden and Finland, has now spread to very many Member States. I would like to make special mention of the United Kingdom, which has actively adopted this tax concession tool and derived good results from it.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is also very much based on the notion that the quality of fuels used in machinery must be improved substantially: the more success we have had in reducing road traffic exhaust emissions through technical improvements, the more attention we have been paying to machinery. Machinery includes tractors and any kind of small but very often extremely noisy machines that are used, for example, in parks to blow leaves. Obviously, all machinery used in the construction sector is included. We could actually say that the biggest controversy still remaining concerns these types of machines and the fuel they use. I can assure you all that the latest research on this subject shows that removing the sulphur from fuels used in machinery as well really is worthwhile economically and in terms of the environment and health. Here I want to refer quite specifically to agricultural producers in Britain, who are frightened by this proposal, thinking it will increase their costs substantially. I can assure you in Britain and elsewhere in Europe and the world generally tractor drivers are exposed to abnormally high levels of toxicity when they sit in their cab and the reason is precisely the poor quality of the fuel being used. With this proposal we are working on the assumption that by 2009 the fuel used in machinery will also be sulphur-free. This is not as drastic as, for example, British agricultural producers have made it look, as already now in half the Member States the same diesel fuel is used as that in vehicles on the highway. It is now a question of extending this requirement throughout the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The report proposes a two-stage approach. Firstly the sulphur content of fuels used in machinery would be reduced to 350 mg per kilogram and then by 2009 the sulphur content would be eliminated totally. This is something that hopefully Parliament will hold to, as, after tomorrow’s vote, I am sure we will very quickly be having talks with the Commission and the Council about where a suitable compromise between Parliament and the Council might lie. I believe we have a good chance of obtaining clear and binding scheduled targets with regard to this issue. Indeed, we are taking into consideration here the fact that at this very moment the Commission is drafting a proposal with regard to fuels used in machinery.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most interesting of all the issues in this report, from the point of view of the various interest groups, has been that concerning the change in the volatility limit for petrol. Mention is also made of vapour pressure. These are very technical matters. However, the question here is that biofuel producers wanted us to alter the vapour pressure of petrol in this proposal so that the use of a biofuel, especially bioethanol, might rapidly increase in the European Union. In my position as rapporteur, I have tried to look into this responsibly and I have acquired as much useful information on the subject as has been available. In my opinion, the compromise we now have in this report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is a fairly optimum one. It grants that if the use of bioethanol increases in the European Union this matter of fuel quality can be examined as a result. That examination would take place in 2005. However, as rapporteur, I have not considered it possible that we could, with any degree of responsibility, alter this property of the fuel in the report at this stage, as certain doubts remain in connection with this about not only exhaust emissions but also the possible adverse effects of these biofuel blends on vehicles and engines.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to draw special attention to the fact that the amendment that alludes to this matter states in the justification section that this process should not be considered to have any adverse effect on vehicles. However, vehicle manufacturers have got in touch with me and said that this is not the case. They think that altering the vapour pressure might cause problems for engines. The proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that we should leave discussion of this issue until the next review of the directive in 2005 is therefore, I believe, a good compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now end my speech and say that we also need sulphur-free fuels because we must be able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from cars. Sulphur-free fuel is absolutely vital for this purpose. For that reason we really must adopt this report tomorrow, hopefully with the largest possible majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will remove the technical barriers that hitherto have prevented us from using the most fuel-efficient vehicles possible. In addition, the use of fuels according to the new requirements in old cars will reduce normal levels of emissions of impurities and improve air quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament in the first reading made its contribution with the amendments it tabled to the notion that the switch to fuel containing 10 milligrams per kilogram should be made more swiftly than was originally sketched out. It is most gratifying that the rapporteur, the committee and the Council seem to be unanimous on many of the points connected with this issue. The Commission is hopeful that the questions that still remain open can be resolved reasonably quickly. Next I would like to look at some key questions the proposed amendments deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">In several amendments it is being proposed that the date from which all diesel fuels on the market must contain no more than 10 milligrams of sulphur per kilogram should now be fixed at 1 January 2009, instead of the date not being confirmed until the end of 2005 when the review has taken place. The Commission would have rather kept to the option contained in the original proposal and the Council common position, which would still have meant the date for diesel fuel would have been confirmed later. However, in view of the consensus reached on establishing the timetable, the Commission is prepared to be flexible in this and accept Amendment No 2 in its entirety and that part of Amendment No 11 that deals with the review in respect of diesel fuel.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question concerns the market coverage of petrol and diesel containing a maximum of 10 milligrams per kilogram between 2005 and 2009. In this respect the Commission is willing to try and draft guidelines on availability criteria in respect of these types of fuel for the first stage, even though this is now shorter than what was originally planned. Consequently, the Commission accepts Amendment Nos 4 and 7.</p>
<p class="contents">Some amendments concern the need to improve and harmonise the quality of fuel used in non-road mobile machinery throughout the Community. It is true that the relative significance of these types of emissions increases as the properties of road vehicle engines improve in environmental terms. Work connected with the next stage of emission norms for diesel engines used in off-road mobile machinery is at present under way and progressing well. When it is concluded at the end of this year the quality of fuel governed by such norms will be determined and a timetable to make this fuel available set. Before that happens the Commission cannot accept Amendment Nos 3, 10 and 13.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would be happy to take a closer look at the question of alternative fuel and biofuels, and particularly the question of requirements relating to the volatility of certain biofuel and petrol blends. Consequently, the Commission in principle accepts Amendment No 12.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the remaining amendments, the Commission cannot accept Amendment Nos 1, 5, 6, 8 and 9 or that section of Amendment No 11 that concerns matters to be included in the review, as the Commission considers the common position has taken them sufficiently into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would finally like to say that Parliament has, for its part, significantly improved the proposal under discussion. I therefore want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Heidi Hautala, for the work she has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We entirely agree with her that it is important for citizens to have access as soon as possible to fuels with a low sulphur content.</p>
<p class="contents">The present directive is a response to the conclusions of the Auto-Oil programmes carried out by the Commission and will allow us to enjoy better air quality, which we are pleased about. It is clear that the objective of this directive is one hundred per cent environmental and everybody therefore welcomes it. However, we must be pragmatic and analyse the circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The production of new sulphur-free fuels will lead to increases in CO2 in the refineries and furthermore those refineries are going to have to make very costly investments in order to produce them. Nevertheless, thanks to technological advances in relation to vehicle engines and catalytic converters, it is possible today to achieve a positive balance in the reduction of CO2 emissions, because those coming from refineries will be less than the reductions in emissions from vehicles using the new fuel. But this will only happen when the marketing of sulphur-free fuels is matched by a sufficient number of vehicles technologically adapted to use this fuel. Current automobiles can perfectly well use the new fuels but without the intended reduction in CO2 emissions. In other words, if the balanced availability and production of the new fuels does not take place alongside a renewal of the vehicles in use, there may be a global increase in emissions, and this would imply significant costs.</p>
<p class="contents">We can oblige companies – by means of a directive – to market fuel with 10 ppm of sulphur, but we cannot oblige consumers to change cars at the same time. We therefore support – and I would ask Parliament to support – the possibility of reviewing in 2005 the period for the full introduction of diesel fuel, especially for agricultural tractors and other non-road vehicles, because, although it is desirable for them to use sulphur-free fuel, the truth is that the pace of renewal for these vehicles is much slower and the volume of fuel consumed is relatively small.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, although this has been mentioned, as rapporteur for the report on the biofuels directive, I am going to refer to volatility, which could affect its application. I am talking about the technical specifications for the fuels used in mixtures. The mixture of bioethanol with gasoline produces an increase in the volatility of the resulting fuel and in countries with hot summers the pressure limits set at around 10% may be exceeded during that season. This seriously harms the competitiveness of those mixtures. But the proposal on biofuels was presented by the Commission after the first reading of this directive on the quality of petrols and we have therefore not had the opportunity to present an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> amendment in this regard for this second reading. I would therefore ask the Commission and the Council, in application of Articles 9 and 10 of Directive 98/70/EC, to propose new specifications and test methods for biofuels and for fuels used by captive fleets.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is urgent to authorise mixture contents greater than 5%. I have also spoken to automobile manufacturers and they assure me that mixtures of 10% are perfectly useable in current engines without any need for change and without harming the engine.</p>
<p class="contents">Biofuels are a good way to improve the air quality in our cities, as well, and, above all, to diversify the sources of energy supply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, the Group of the Greens fully endorses the 13 amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">This whole report would, in fact, have been redundant if four years ago, during the negotiations with the Council, we had been able to persuade the ministers to consider the figures too. The Council of Environmental Ministers, however, proved insufficiently flexible. In those days, the discussion centred on the question whether we should aim for 50 ppm low-sulphur or whether we should aim for less. We now talk about 10 ppm sulphur-free. Sulphur is the poison for catalytic converters, just as lead was the poison for first-generation catalytic converters. We are now talking about an improved generation of catalytic converters that are about to be used. This is therefore regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that it was Germany that got the ball rolling, and I am pleased that we have now reached a satisfactory result. I do have a few questions for the Christian Democrats, because I do not understand why they claim that tractors should be treated differently. Tractors benefit just as much from this clean fuel, which means they produce less pollution. Even old tractors that have not yet been fitted with new catalytic converters stand to gain environmentally.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, true that this new fuel will be somewhat more expensive than the old, polluting fuel. If the problem is that farmers need to pay slightly more, then I, as a member of the Group of the Greens, think that the importance of the issue warrants this. If this is the real problem to the Christian Democrats, they should say so. It would be unfortunate if they abstained from the vote tomorrow, for then we would be unable to achieve the required majority.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for the industry to know at this stage what the exact requirements are without having to wait until 2005. This is why I should like to urge the Christian Democrats to reconsider this report very carefully and then perhaps to be soft-hearted after all and vote along with the entire Committee of the Environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within the next few years, new engines will reduce fuel consumption and improve exhaust cleanliness. Modern sensor technology, like fuel sensors, makes engines much better from an environmental point of view, but the engines will also at the same time be more sensitive to contamination. These environmental improvements will not be possible unless they go hand in hand with improved fuel quality. Cleaner fuels give us the opportunity to make use of all the environmental advantages of new engine technology. Poor fuel technology, on the other hand, can be detrimental to the new generation of engines and harm the technology and engine function. This directive is very urgent, and it constitutes an important step towards a lower level of air pollution and a better environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Before Parliament’s first reading of the draft directive, I prepared 14 amendments with the aim of tightening up the requirements on fuel quality. Most of them were adopted, and I am very happy that, in the common position, the Council accepts the majority of Parliament’s proposals from the first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">A large part of the debate in the second reading was focused on the question of whether all vehicles should be covered by this directive. There is engine technology for mobile machines and tractors, so that they can be covered, like other vehicles, by the Fuel Directive. No exemption is required for so-called sulphur-free diesel. It is a misconception that old engines require sulphur in the fuel and that new engines cannot handle sulphurous fuel. If these vehicles are fully covered by the directive, the environment will be the clear winner. Why, therefore, should we not also take this step? A possible tax reduction could counteract the increased costs resulting from cleaner fuels, for farmers for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s Auto-Oil Programme, together with this Fuel Directive, will have great significance in reducing the negative environmental effects of vehicle traffic. This shows that the EU has strength and competence in important environmental issues and that the use of modern environmental technology is better than a ban. The rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, has taken the matter forwards to a clear improvement, and it is my hope that Parliament will accept the report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report is viewed with extreme concern, regardless of what the rapporteur has said with regard to the United Kingdom. It will have an adverse effect on our agriculture, our farmers and our fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">Where I come from in Northern Ireland the rural community is falling apart. To put any added burden on it at this moment in time is quite wrong. I want to make it very clear from the outset that I, my delegation, and those I represent are totally in favour of improvement to the highest possible standards. I will support those higher standards. But I have a problem when we impose from on high purist-type ideas on those who cannot defend themselves. That is what I oppose.</p>
<p class="contents">I am totally opposed to trying to impose this on off-road vehicles, be they vehicles that are used on farms, or the many other vehicles used in quarries or elsewhere. If we have to, let us set standards somewhere down the road longer-term. Let us work towards that as technology develops, but to sit here and say that we can impose this from this European Parliament is totally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">If you want to know why Europe is unpopular in many areas of the European Union, just look at this type of proposal. What do the people say? They say 'Oh, there is Big Brother Brussels telling us what to do again'. Why do we not use common sense? Why do we not use our own initiative and not have the European Union hurting its own citizens while the rest of the world merely goes on its way destroying the environment? We have seen from Johannesburg and from Kyoto and elsewhere that they do not pay a jot of attention to what we say.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that off-road vehicles account for about 8.5% of the diesel vehicles in the European Union. Commissioner, it is within your and the Council's powers to at least take a balanced position on this and to achieve the aim over a longer term so that we do not hurt a lot of people on the way.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I support. I will certainly be voting against this recommendation tomorrow. I, along with the people I represent, will take great delight in voting against it. I hope it is defeated because then in the longer term you will come back with a proposal that represents the common sense view of everyone in this European Union, and not just those with purist ideals who do not have to face the consequences of imposing their ideals on others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
