<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over recent days we have had too many occasions to take an interest in the problem of safety in air transport. And before dealing with the issue of transatlantic flights, I too would like to express my condolences in relation to the terrible accident involving the Flash Airlines aircraft on 3 January in which 148 people died, the majority of whom were European citizens. I am sure that we all share the feelings of the families involved. But first of all I would like to point out that once again we must wait for the conclusions of the investigation in order to know exactly under what circumstances it took place.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent years, air safety has been one of the main concerns and tasks for the Commission, for myself and for the whole of the Transport Directorate-General. It is a field in which we have made clear progress: we have approved the Directive on the notification of accidents in civil aviation; we have approved the creation of the European Air Safety Agency, which is now operational; we have approved the rules on the certification and maintenance of aircraft which that Agency must apply and we have also made progress on the ‘Single Sky’ initiative, which is an element which must improve safety in the European air sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, these measures are not all relevant – and I do not know whether it is unfortunate – to the case in question. We are talking here about a different case. There was knowledge of certain problems with the aircraft – for example the incidents which took place when it was diverted for technical reasons to Athens airport – and it was natural to imagine that they would have been registered in the database provided for in the directive you approved last year, but it must be said that that directive will not enter into force for a year.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Air Safety Agency, which since 28 September has been operational, its responsibility with regard to national certification competences is restricted to aircraft registered in the Community, in other words, those which have a Community flag, and therefore does not cover aircraft such as those of Flash Airlines. In accordance with the Chicago Convention, it is the flag State – the State in which the aircraft are registered – which is responsible for those aircraft complying with international safety rules, all under the supervision of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the States retain the possibility of checking that third-country aircraft arriving in their territory respect these rules. In order to facilitate this monitoring, in 1996 the States of the Union and certain European third countries created a system for inspecting aircraft and for exchanging the corresponding information, known as SAFA, within the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). The European Commission co-funds this programme and participates in it as an observer.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this programme which has allowed for the exchange of information on the six inspections carried out by France, Germany and Poland following by the Swiss prohibition of the Flash Airlines Boeing 737. Nevertheless, although around 3 000 inspections are carried out each year, nothing guarantees that each State of the Union carries them out and how they are carried out. Furthermore, this system guarantees neither the approval of collective measures nor, above all, the transparency of inspections and measures and, furthermore, lacks sanction mechanisms against States which do not comply with the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that this lack of transparency is prejudicial to the companies which most respect the safety rules and since that respect is not known and the greater quality of the most serious companies is not known, it offers opportunities to those which are less serious. On the other hand, greater transparency would mean that everybody knows where things stand and clearly the passenger, the consumer, could choose, and would naturally choose maximum safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the shortcomings in the current organisation of the inspection system for aircraft. And I would like to point out that, as a consequence of an accident similar to the Flash Airlines accident, which took place in 1996 in Puerto Plata, in the Dominican Republic, on a flight operated by a Turkish charter company on behalf of a German travel agency, the Commission presented a proposed directive in 1997 on the control of third-country aircraft which land at Community airports.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the Commission also presented a modified proposal on this text in January 2002 which essentially took up the 1997 text with corrections which improved on the text and which, furthermore, allowed it to be adopted speedily.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Members are aware, we are currently in the conciliation phase, which I hope will move forward in the coming days, and the Flash Airlines accident demonstrates the extent to which this text is absolutely essential and urgent: firstly, it is clear that the time limit for transposing the directive must be as short as possible – recent events demonstrate this – and that we must not exceed the usual two years for the incorporation of directives into national law. It will be incomprehensible to everybody if following what has just happened there are further delays on the part of the States of the Union on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the annual report to be published by the Commission, I believe that it should be made available to all interested parties. It should provide the necessary data for the choice of air companies by tour operators in order to encourage them to take even more interest in safety issues. Naturally, the data in this report can only reflect the reality at a given time and does not always allow us to draw general conclusions on the safety or lack of safety of an aircraft or aircraft in general of a specific company.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the British initiative to publish a list of companies which may not enter British air space demonstrates that, in any event, transparency is not only possible but that it is going to happen. And the Commission's report must be carried out and drawn up in the light of this aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports Parliament’s proposal that when a measure is adopted by a State of the Union – following an inspection – it should apply to the whole of the Community. In that way, the attitude of the most rigorous state of the Union will become the attitude of the whole of the Union in relation to this type of aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">This accident does not just require an effort and a strengthening of the controls and the transparency of those controls. It also requires that we consider the need for greater discipline amongst tour operators with regard to information for passengers on the airline which is going to carry them and on the choice of that airline.</p>
<p class="contents">It makes no sense that when one buys a package deal all types of information is given on the hotel, meals, and also sometimes sight-seeing trips, offers of supplementary activities etc., but there is usually no information on precisely which airline is going to operate the flight. I have asked the services of the Commission to study this issue, which I believe to be essential, as a matter of priority.</p>
<p class="contents">This dramatic issue, Mr President, however, is not the only element which is going to lead to controversy and concern with regard to safety issues amongst the public in the civil aviation sector, since over Christmas we have all been aware of issues relating to suspensions of flights from European countries to the United States, with the corresponding problems and difficulties faced by all those passengers who had planned to take those flights.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no question that the current situation justifies enhanced and more active cooperation with the American authorities in order to reinforce security aspects in view of the new terrorist risks. However, although we agree with these objectives, we are often faced with measures which are adopted unilaterally and, in this regard, I would like to say that we in the Commission have repeatedly informed the American authorities of the need to hold a dialogue and reach agreement prior to decision-making, which, furthermore, would not only facilitate the implementation of those decisions, but will also produce better results in view of the experience which certain States of the Union have had in this area, for better or for worse.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficult negotiations carried out by Mr Bolkestein on the automatic transfer of personal data to the American authorities also demonstrate that in the end we can find solutions acceptable to both parties, although it takes longer and creates more difficulties. In this regard, I would like to say, on the subject of the transfer of data, that in December I had the opportunity to present the results of these negotiations to the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, together with Mr Vitorino, Mr Patten and Mr Bolkestein.</p>
<p class="contents">As we pointed out at the time, we believe that the results obtained on the transfer and storage of personal data allow the Commission to prepare an adequacy finding, bringing it into line with the Directive on data protection, which will complement an initiative within the ICAO to create an international framework and adequate information for passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be made clear that the recent behaviour of our American friends and partners does not relate to these points. We must point out that the data which has led to certain difficulties were not the data which appear in the ‘Passenger Name Record’ (PNR) and that they are sufficiently detailed to prevent certain types of errors which have been made in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the justification for the cancellation of, for example, Air France and British Airways flights is not demonstrated <span class="italic">a posteriori</span>, however, we must always be cautious in the face of terrorist threats and it is better to be overcautious than to be faced with an attack.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to refer to another issue which has appeared in the media and which causes a degree of concern, and that is the presence of security personnel on board aircraft which fly to the United States, an issue which raises all sorts of problems. Firstly, I would like to point out that this issue is one for the Member States to deal with. The Community has no competence in this area. Secondly, I would like to point out that, regardless of the way the Commission had organised a meeting next 16 January, that is, at the end of this week, of the aviation group in which all the civil aviation directors of the States of the Union participate, this point will be added to the long list of issues on the agenda and will be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will end by saying that what has happened recently demonstrates, firstly, that safety is a central aspect of air transport, and it is essential that we continue to ensure that it is maintained and strengthened. That safety must be dealt with in a global manner and it is not sufficient to talk about guarantees and safety for air companies from our territories, that is, European air companies and aircraft, because third-country aircraft also use our airports and huge numbers of our citizens travel on them. We therefore have to increase their safety and there is a margin to do so and I hope that there is agreement between Parliament and the Council on the issue of the safety of third-country aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say finally that safety issues for preventing problems relating to terrorism in the civil aviation sector must be dealt with from the point of view of seeking the greatest possible safeguards and security for passengers and citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we must not forget that the number of air accidents has decreased over the last 10 years by 45 percent while air traffic has doubled. Nevertheless, since in 2003 there were 576 victims on commercial flights at world level, we must continue working to try to prevent this type of accident and to reduce them even more.</p>

<p class="contents">I wish to point out that the European Parliament has good reason to feel satisfied about the fact that it has been aware of the issue of the safety of air transport for a long time now. Its stand on the question of the European Aviation Safety Agency, the EASA, is evidence of this awareness. We supported this endeavour right from the start and this year we voted in favour of all the items in the budget needed to staff this agency quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, in the Maes report on third country aircraft, which the Commission rightly took the initiative of promoting, Parliament took a strict approach from the outset, and I am delighted that Mrs de Palacio agreed today with the European Parliament's position on our differences with the Council on the conciliation procedure. It is very important, and I hope that the Council will take this on board, for the regulations introduced on this matter to be the right ones and for us to guarantee high safety standards, not just for our aircraft but also for third country aircraft flying to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, as you know, there is the safety issue which arose after the terrorist attack on 11 September. There are still problems here, but unfortunately, despite the talks held from time to time, it has proven impossible to address them correctly. I believe that, on the other side of the Atlantic, despite the fact that I understand their reaction, at the same time there is also an arrogant approach to Europe, an intention to deal with the problems unilaterally. I believe that we shall make it clear to the other side that we want to work together but, at the same time, we want to be on an equal footing with them, and the European Commission can help decidedly in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since early last year, the Americans have been demanding the handing over of passengers’ data before they join a flight; some of this information is of a highly personal nature. The US authorities planned to store this data for fifty years, with it being used not only to combat terrorism and potential dangers associated with it, but also, potentially, being made available to other security agencies as well. The threat was made that, if the airlines did not comply, they would have to pay heavy fines or risk losing their landing rights. Not only in this House did this call forth vehement criticisms, one in particular being that this was illegal, in that it is in flagrant breach of two items of European legislation, namely the Data Protection Directive and the Regulation on the handling of data in flight booking. This, as the Commissioner has said, prompted the Commission to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">Where are we now? The fifty years for which the data was to be stored have now become three and a half. We have managed to get limitations put on what is done with it. The data is to be used only in combating terrorism and crimes connected with it. The rules are to apply for three and a half years in the first instance, after which they are to be renegotiated, and not all the passenger information is to be handed over; the US authorities have, in particular, confirmed that the really personal and sensitive ‘special service information’ and that derived from the ‘special service request’ is to be deleted. Moreover, legal peace has been restored by the requirement for passengers’ prior consent, and the Commission will see to it that it is we who actively transmit the data – which means that we can also filter it – whereas, at present, it is still collected by the Americans; whilst this may well not, unfortunately, meet European data protection standards, it would be unfair to say that we had not achieved a great deal.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by pointing out to the Commissioner that I see the clause about expiry after three and a half years as being significant in the sense that there is always a tension between, on the one hand, the need to intervene in the private sphere and, on the other, the potential needs of internal security. If we are to consider extending this system beyond the three and a half years, it must, in that period, be demonstrated to produce real results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will confine myself to the issue of flight data and the relationship with the United States. I should like to point out that, at present, the United States still receives unfiltered information. Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) 2299/89 and Article 26 of Directive 95/46/EC are still not being complied with. Meanwhile, as the Commissioner did point out, various flights have been cancelled on the basis of unfiltered information and in addition, the United States have asked for permission for the presence of armed security agents on flights. Furthermore, as the Commissioner stated, this last request, in particular, has met with very mixed reactions from various countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, Commissioner, that all of this has not, in any case, resulted in a joint approach and that this is very confusing for passengers and airline companies alike. I therefore take the view that there is still neither adequate protection by the United States nor protection of the interests of air travellers and airline companies. Nor am I convinced that the agreement will offer sufficient guarantees. This is why I reiterate my desire for a permanent solution by means of an international agreement between the United States and Europe, with full involvement from the European Parliament and the US Congress, which would therefore be a weightier formula.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also repeat my proposal with regard to the Commission, on the basis of Article 300(6) of the Treaty of Nice, to ask the ECJ to give advice on this agreement. If you fail to do so, I believe that Parliament itself should take on this responsibility. After all, this is about an international world standard, and we will need to maintain very high standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I still fail to grasp, for example, how these decisions were taken on the basis of elements from the briefing, namely: the wider EU-US relationship, the safety and confidence of air travellers and the cost aspect of airline companies. Even following consultation with a Foreign Affairs Minister, or various Foreign Affairs Ministers, a unilateral decision was taken to cancel flights. How does this relate, for example, to international trade agreements? In general, before we discuss the final agreement, which is in six weeks' time, I should also like to be told in what way cooperation between the European and American security authorities has been achieved. In short, I think that the signals that were given over the past month are an example of precisely how things should not be done, and I therefore hope to receive a clear answer now, or at least in response to my written questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, it is impossible today to determine the causes of this accident and to say who was responsible. I am also aware that air transport is not without risks. No airline is immune from accidents. Having said that, we who carry political responsibility are involved, we have a particular responsibility because this accident has highlighted a number of questions that cannot be avoided. I would like, in the time that is given me, to go over those that seem to me the most important.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question concerns States. Why did two States, France and Switzerland, take different decisions about the condition of aircraft belonging to the same airline? Was it due to inadequate cooperation or inadequate controls? How are the SAFA programmes applied? Important as they are, they are no substitute for thorough technical controls. Information should be automatic and transparent, with mandatory inspection on the slightest suspicion. As things in fact stand, as you said, there are no sanctions for states that fail to carry out inspections. I share Mrs de Palacio’s concern that it should be possible for a particular or reinforced protection measure adopted by one Member State in order to ensure safety to be extended to the whole Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is concerned with the safety consequences of the liberalisation of air transport. As you said, Commissioner, it is a global problem. With the growth of charter flights and low-cost fliers, airlines are engaged in keen competition. Cost cutting is certainly involved, but on what terms is that possible? There is a great temptation to cut back on training, maintenance or staff, and safety is threatened. Does not the European Union’s vaunted obsession with favouring the lowest economic cost in aviation help to make that the only regulator?</p>
<p class="contents">The third question has to do with checks on aircraft that are a safety risk. The proposed directive, which was again submitted in January 2002, has still not been adopted. We must demand strict safety guarantees for all aircraft using the Union’s airports, step up controls and further harmonise joint technical regulations, including those concerned with flight and rest times. The Council should stop prevaricating and really get down to much stricter and more transparent safety rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if we are to be effective legislators, we must call on the industry’s professionals. Pilots, technicians and other professionals have irreplaceable experience in this field. It is very useful to listen to them. That is the reason for the initiative my group has taken for a hearing to be held here on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want in a few words to give my opinion on the EU-US agreement on the transmission of data relative to transatlantic flights. For the fight against terrorism, data would be transmitted in 34 fields, including the racial origins, political opinions, religious convictions and state of health of passengers, whereas the national authorities competent for the protection of privacy had reduced that list to 19. Moreover, the US authorities want to pass that data to US surveillance networks. It seems to me that this agreement isolates the European data protection directive and, in the light of European legislation, I do not think we can agree to the transfer of this data. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tragic death of these tourists, most of them French, has demonstrated that there are still insufficient safety measures in place. The public wants to know how it is possible, when safety regulations are international, widely known and should be widely applied, for an aircraft that is not allowed access to Swiss airspace to be allowed to fly in other European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission took an initiative more than six years ago, and I am delighted that the Commissioner gave us another account of those events. Unfortunately, we are still waiting for the directive. A dispute about Gibraltar between Spain and the United Kingdom has held this directive up for years. After 11 September, and especially in view of the ensuing crisis in aviation, people have again begun to realise how very important safety is. As the rapporteur for the safety of aircraft from third countries, I am pleased with the promptness with which at least this Parliament has acted and has accepted a number of amendments at first and second reading which we still need to debate. I am delighted that the Commissioner has pledged her support to Parliament and I am convinced that the trialogue will be very fruitful. I hope that the Council's response will also be very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">The most significant difference of opinion between the Commission and Council concerns information to the public. We thought that the Commission was rather reserved in this respect. As rapporteur, I take the view that we must ensure that every European citizen who boards a plane at one of our airports should have the certainty that this aircraft has been inspected according to the same standards and that regulations are also being complied with. This is why we need more European solutions. The European Aviation Safety Agency should also be able to play its role to the full so that our citizens can be informed. We must question whether keeping data anonymous is not a culpable omission at a specific point in time. I cannot accept that a company that is branded unsafe should not be made known to the public. I am sorry I had so little time, but I would like to thank the Commissioner and my fellow-Members for the support that they wish to express in the context of this report, and for the initiative they are taking. I will certainly come and listen.</p>

On my own behalf and on behalf of the members of the French delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I want to express our most sincere condolences and our solidarity with the victims’ families.</p>
<p class="contents">Since it has not yet been possible to analyse the aircraft’s black boxes, it would be irresponsible to draw premature conclusions about this tragedy. For the present, there is nothing tangible that would allow us to call into question either the condition of the aircraft, the professionalism of the Egyptian charter company Flash<span class="italic"> </span>Airlines, the earnestness of the Egyptian civil aviation authority or the reliability of the technical controls that were carried out on that aircraft. From what we know at present, even the hypothesis of an attack cannot be ruled out completely, even if it seems highly unlikely. However, it seems to me essential that European users of air transport should be given every guarantee to reassure them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take advantage of this session, Commissioner, to pass on to you some of the most frequent questions concerning charter airlines in particular. Would it not be possible to require European tour operators to inform tourists who use their services of the precise identity of the airline they will be travelling with at the time they buy their tickets? In order for European tour operators to be better assured of the level of safety of the airlines they work with, would it not also be desirable to go beyond the random checks that are currently made? Would it not be advisable to recommend real in-depth technical audits of airlines that are not European but which are used by our tour operators? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I start by offering, on behalf of my Group, our condolences to the relatives and friends of all victims of aviation accidents, not just the recent one in Sharm el-Sheikh. I firmly believe, however, that aviation safety has to be put into perspective. The industry is the most regulated and has the best safety record of any mode of public transport. When you compare the record of aviation with the carnage that occurs on our roads, and when you consider that the number of air accidents is going down, whilst the number of road accidents is going up, then any discussion on aviation safety must take these facts into account.</p>
<p class="contents">However, civil aviation must carry on improving its safety record. I wish to highlight four areas where improvements could be made. First there is a danger that a system similar to maritime transport's flags of convenience could creep into civil aviation. I hope EASA, the new safety agency, will urgently examine this. Member States need to increase their ramp inspections to weed out those airlines which are based in one country but register in another and have lower standards than we would expect within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, there is an urgent need for a Europe-wide harmonised system of operations by way of an EU-ops. This particular issue is all the more urgent with the impending enlargement of the European Union and would include matters such as flight and duty time for cockpit and cabin crew.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the whole issue of cabin safety needs to be addressed, particularly the number of emergency exits, the amount of cabin baggage – try getting on the Air France flight today from Paris, for example! – and the use of sky marshals.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, there is a need to reform the existing package travel directive which is now not only outdated, but ineffectual and allows some airlines to offer packages without being covered by the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament, with the help of the Commission, has worked long and hard to improve aviation safety and we have had some success. There are still areas where more progress needs to be made. However, I repeat that aviation is the safest form of public transport and accidents, however tragic, are thankfully rare. The House would do well to await the results of any official investigations before jumping to conclusions that can often be misguided and wrong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People are concerned; in my region, too, there is an airport that apparently has been, or is being, used by this airline company, so it is obvious that we need to know whether the assessment of all aircraft that fly in the EU is positive or not. We have Mrs Maes’ report on third-country aircraft, in which, fortunately, we demand such things as our own inspections, the possibility of keeping aircraft on the ground and of exchanging information between Member States. We have now reached the conciliation stage, and I hope that we can make use of this conciliation to tighten things up to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the questions that arose after the accident in Egypt is: what do we tell the public, what is intended for the public domain? It is clear that the Council has toned down the questions that Parliament had on that score. I would like to ask the Council, in the light of recent events, to revisit this issue. It is evident that we do not throw just any piece of information into the public domain, for then it will lead a life of its own. If, however, an airline company is banned from a country, surely people are entitled to know this, so that they can avoid using this airline in future. I think that we should have clear rules in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I have read that a law is to be adopted in France according to which tour operators are to be required to tell customers which company will be used for the trip, so that people know with whom they are flying. I think that passengers have a right to this, and if there were to be an imputation in respect of a company, then customers can establish that link themselves. Why could that not become EU law?</p>
<p class="contents">I have also read that the American Federal Aviation Administration is examining the quality of inspections in third countries, or what Mr Simpson termed the role of the flag state. This reminds me of safety in shipping. Do we actually have control over the quality of the flag state? Could we not do what the Americans are doing? I think that the quality offered by ICAO is sound, but we should apply our own systems and do as the Americans are doing. It is, in my view, not a bad idea for us as Europeans to go and have a look over there whether the quality standards are being respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have read that there are quite a few differences between national inspections, and that one country is somewhat stricter than the other, or at least makes assessments on a different basis. I should like to see flight bans established everywhere on the same basis – after all, one flight ban can be too strict, while another not strict enough. In any case, we now have a European Aviation Safety Agency, and it might be useful if an independent audit were to be carried out on the different ways in which Member States assess the safety of aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope – Commissioner, Mr President, Mrs Maes and other Members who were involved in this conciliation – that we can use the conciliation procedure relating to your report in order to ensure that the points which Parliament pressed home in the light of recent events – and unfortunately, our decision-making is often, if not too often, disaster-driven – will be emphasised. Mrs Maes, I hope that you, together with the Members of this House, will be able to salvage a few things yet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We share the victims’ pain, but there is more! I think many French people, many Europeans have identified with the victims because they express part of our way of life. We try to break with the everyday, and to do so we travel far. We look for a change of scenery, sunshine in winter, and for that you have to go a long way. And then we look for cheap services, and for that, too, you have to go a long way. If we want this freedom or this mobility to last, then we shall have to increase air safety and be more strict, as we are over safety in other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, this air safety is going to become a top priority again because that, at least, is something over which we can and must have some control. Of course, we need first of all to know the causes of the accident. There is a lot of talk about them at the moment, but they are not really known. I think that is a necessity for all of us, even if for some the priority is to find someone to blame.</p>
<p class="contents">A long time ago, in 1996, the Commission presented a proposal following the crash of an aircraft belonging to a Turkish airline. Nothing came of it because some States, Spain and the United Kingdom at the time, were in dispute over Gibraltar. Since then, an Aviation Safety Agency has been set up, but it cannot encroach on States’ air traffic control, and some of these States, France in particular, often use the pretext of their sovereignty to curb its activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Another text has been under discussion since 2002. I hope that this time it will be agreed quickly and that the recent accident will speed us towards a solution. Lists have been made of rust-bucket ships. We must now do the same for aircraft. If some need to be done away with, let us make a list of them, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, like others before me I would like to stress that yes, it is wrong that a passenger who buys a charter ticket does not know which airline he will be flying with. We cannot demand labelling and traceability standards for GMOs but at the same time not worry about them for aircraft. Labelling and traceability are necessary in aviation as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are no guarantees on the duration and the purpose of authorising data and, despite the efforts made by the Commission, the prospects for the future are not encouraging: the data of millions of European citizens who book trips to America will, therefore, be kept for years in US databases. In what way, though, will keeping all their credit card data enhance our security? How are we going to deny other countries something tomorrow that we are today granting to the US? We called for reciprocity as regards citizens’ rights, but the Commission is instead, rather ironically, proposing reciprocity in the exchange of data between security agencies. Let us be careful. If monitoring becomes the norm instead of an exception, if a majority is under suspicion instead of an individual and if all citizens become suspects, then we are heading towards a worrying future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with what she has said. I also wish to express my sympathy for the families of the victims of the air accident at el-Sheikh in Egypt before concentrating on the sensitive aspects of the discussions with the United States on air safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission deserves all credit for its fight to defend privacy in the negotiations with the United States concerning the air passenger lists. Some of us in the delegation for relations with the United States were there in the US and discussed these issues. We know, in particular, how incredibly difficult it is to get the United States to achieve an, in our view, fair and considered balance between combating terrorism and defending human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of the negotiations is, in some respects, successful and, in others, unsatisfactory. The United States has, however, made major concessions. The fact that it is possible to store information for three and a half years is positive from an American perspective. From a European perspective, it is, however, barely acceptable. In this case, it is, however, also a question of creating efficient contacts between the EU and the United States so that business, trade and aviation can thrive and develop. In the light of this, it is very important to find a solution that does not put a complete stop to these contacts at the very moment when the economy is in the process of improving.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, however, to warn against contagion. Three and a half years must not constitute a model for the EU when we proceed with our own legislation on data protection and combating crime. In Europe, we have stronger protection for human rights than the United States does, especially when it comes to protecting privacy. That protection is something of which we should be proud. When we in the EU develop our own measures to combat terrorism – in many cases similar to, but not identical with, those adopted by the United States – we must defend our protection of privacy. Cooperation and coordination with the United States on these issues is certainly necessary, but we cannot abandon our own principles concerning human rights. Who wishes to see European aviation include armed marshals and requirements to have finger prints taken?</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement must fall if the United States does not comply with the protection of human rights. We cannot afford, in either financial or human terms, to make room for woolly interpretations by one side or the other. In this area, the Commission must, on every point, be given clear assurances on interpretation and compliance. A broader international agreement on air safety may be a step on this road too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this time we cannot presume that the recent air accident in Egypt was caused by mechanical failure. It is therefore prudent for us to await the accident investigation report. However, I agree with the Commission that travel agents and tour operators should inform passengers more fully about the airlines which are part of their holiday package. Perhaps we can do something about that. There must also be a far better means of exchange of information, whether it be through the International Civil Aviation Organization, the EU or Member States. In addition, I believe that the Maes Report on ramp checks, which is coming to its conclusion, should address some of the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the transfer of data, we should remember that 3 000 people lost their lives in those horrendous attacks on 11 September, and many of them were from the European Union. So it is not surprising that the Americans reacted in the way they did. Having said that, I fully welcome the outcome of the negotiations attended by Commissioners Bolkestein and de Palacio. The conclusions drawn from those negotiations are extremely positive, not least, in my view, in relation to the information on collection and storage. Hopefully that should satisfy Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that better cooperation between the US and the EU could probably solve problems before they arise. I would therefore urge the United States not to act unilaterally. I think we can do things better.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the suspension and delay of flights over the Christmas and New Year period, they were clearly decisions that had to be made by national governments. In my view, it is therefore necessary to look again at the Lisi Report, which has just gone through Parliament, as regards current non-reference to matters coming under <span class="italic">force majeure</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the honourable Members for their speeches and, firstly, I would like to thank Mrs Maes for the work she is doing as rapporteur on the safety of third-country aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we can have a conciliation quickly and that this accident will serve to make us speed up and overcome certain reservations and difficulties which arose in the Council in relation to the points which I referred to earlier, whether those relating to speedy transposition into national laws or those relating to greater transparency with regard to the stringency and quality of safety and the state of maintenance of the aircraft by the different air companies operating in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there is a middle ground between Parliament’s initial proposal – which was perhaps too exhaustive – and not providing any information at all, and clearly the Commission supports, as I said in my first speech, an increase in transparency regarding the true situation of the aircraft of air companies, that is to say, stringency in the monitoring of safety standards.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as this issue, I would like to refer very briefly to the fact that there are certain issues which have yet to be promoted over the next few years, but the implementation of the European Civil Aviation Safety Agency is an extremely important step forward. When we adopt this legislation on third-country aircraft, we will be taking an extremely important step forward. Within the International Civil Aviation Organisation we must strengthen its controls, since, in principle, the control of how activities are carried out in the different States with regard to their aircraft falls to the International Civil Aviation Organisation. In other words, it would not be a question of the European Civil Aviation Agency going to a third country to check how they carry out their work and their controls there. This task falls to the International Civil Aviation Organisation. It is a different thing for the European Union to have competence to ensure that the aircraft which land in our territory comply with the requirements and that we control how the requirements are complied with by those aircraft. We must take an additional step forward, so that, at Community level, there are common rules, to the effect that if a country prohibits overflight or landing by certain aircraft, that that rule should be extended to the whole of the European Union’s airspace. That if a country detects a particular kind of problem in a specific aircraft, it will be obligatory for that information to be distributed and passed on to all the countries of the Union; and also that there be common rules on the way in which those controls are carried out, on the percentage and on the system. We must reach agreements which guarantee that the whole of the Union takes appropriate measures and that they are applicable throughout our airspace.</p>
<p class="contents">The next point which has arisen is the transfer of passenger data to the United States. I would like to clarify something which Mrs Ainardi has said, and that is that the United States are not requesting the sensitive information the honourable Member has mentioned. The information classed as sensitive in accordance with the Directive on data protection in Europe – health, religion and so on – is not being requested by the United States. This is what the honourable Member must be aware of. It is not that information which is going to be communicated.</p>
<p class="contents">The next issue relates to the communication of data. I can tell honourable Members that we have reached an agreement which the Commission believes provides for protection of the privacy of our citizens, because, as has been said before – I believe it was Mr Poignant – there is tension between the ‘safety’ component and the ‘privacy’ component. We must resolve the tension between the two elements in an appropriate and balanced way. We have reached an agreement – amongst other things, thanks to this Parliament, let us make this very clear – which in the end includes a series of guarantees which the European Union was demanding – a reduction in the amount of data, the type of data, a restriction in terms of the objective for which they will be used, a restriction of the time for which they can be used, in other words, all the elements which the honourable Members are perfectly aware of – which means that we can say that, by means of this agreement, the fundamental rights which our legislation affords our citizens are guaranteed, also in terms of the way the United States uses the information, while at the same time we are helping and cooperating in the improvement of safety in the air sector and the fight against international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that all of this responds essentially to the elements which have been raised here. I would like once again to thank this Parliament for its cooperation in the different steps we have taken. I believe they have been extremely important. We can bring them to a conclusion speedily through this Directive on the safety of third-country aircraft, and, ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to express our condolences for the victims and say that we must continue to work to improve safety in the air sector, firstly, naturally, in European airspace, in relation to aircraft which leave Europe for other places, but also at world level, because, however much information we provide – and naturally we must do so, to increase transparency in the information tour operators give their clients, stating which company is going to provide the transport, stating exactly which companies they work with – this is important and will improve safeguards and information for our citizens and our passengers, and there can be no doubt that we – Europeans or non-Europeans – must fight to improve safety in air traffic and in international civil aviation.</p>
