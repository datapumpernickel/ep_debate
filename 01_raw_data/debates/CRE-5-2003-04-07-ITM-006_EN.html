<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Sarnez (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this difficult time in which we are living, I believe that the Commission’s will to make a knowledge-based Europe a strategic priority of the Union, which has been reiterated on many occasions over several years, is more relevant now than ever before.</p>
<p class="contents">The Erasmus World programme, which we are discussing this evening, is perfectly compatible with this objective. It is therefore very good news for Europe. The programme has two main goals, which are closely linked: to enhance the attractiveness of European higher education to students and university teachers from other parts of the world and increase links between European universities in order to improve the quality and competitiveness of European higher education. In fact, it is by developing links with one another, on the one hand, and links with the rest of the world, on the other, that our universities will improve the quality of the service they provide. As Mrs Reding has said, Erasmus World is the instrument that Europe needs, both internally and externally, in order to respond coherently to globalisation in the education sector. By opening up our universities to the world, we are also opening them up to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the title of the programme, we propose that this programme should henceforth be entitled Erasmus Mundus. This would make it possible to respect and maintain the principle of cultural diversity, which we all consider to be of the utmost importance and which is a driving force of our Union. This programme covers the period 2004 to 2008. It proposes four actions which are all very specific. First of all, the creation of 250 Masters Courses, which we shall call Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses. These courses will be selected for a period of five years and will have to involve at least three higher education institutions from three different Member States. They will lead to officially-recognised degrees. These Masters Courses will be open to students and university teachers from third countries and I would like them to be widely available to students and university teachers from the European Union so that they can also take advantage of this ‘European tour’.</p>
<p class="contents">The qualification of Masters Courses will, of course, be awarded according to the quality of teaching provided, but it should also take account of the quality of hosting facilities for students. The selection procedure must be carried out by a high-level selection board comprising leading figures from the academic world. By the end of their course, students must have learned or used at least two languages. Language-learning must, in fact, remain a priority for the European Union. As Mr Prodi pointed out, language-learning is one of the main ways of promoting genuine understanding between different cultures. We must continue to encourage the promotion of language-learning by all possible means, and this programme provides us with an ideal opportunity to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the establishment of a scholarship system. Substantial scholarships will be offered to 4 200 students from third countries, either directly or as part of a partnership programme between their own university and universities participating in a Masters Course. Scholarships will also be offered to 1 000 third-country university teachers, who will be invited to Europe for teaching and scholarly assignments with an average length of three months.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the creation of partnerships to strengthen and promote intercultural understanding. Higher education institutions will thereby be encouraged to establish cooperation with third-country universities.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the final action is the international promotion of European higher education. A specific website will be created for the programme to provide up-to-date information on Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve all these objectives, we felt it appropriate to provide ourselves with the necessary means. That is why we have proposed to increase the budget to EUR 300 million, whilst ensuring that existing programmes do not suffer and taking account of the appropriate resources and conditions to be determined by the budgetary authority. On all these points, we have enjoyed extremely productive cooperation with the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, as well as the draftsmen of opinions. I would like to thank them for that.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to express the wish that, in future, young students, university scholars and researchers from the European Union and the rest of the world will find our continent a source of learning, training and mutual understanding.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur from the bottom of my heart for the superb quality of her work and for the support which, throughout her work, she and her colleagues have given the Commission. I think, today, we are going to decide on a great programme. Erasmus was one of the flagship programmes in this area, and still is. I think when we talk about Europe to the citizens and ask them to name a European programme, Erasmus is the programme on everyone’s lips and in their hearts. It is very important to speak of hearts, because identification with Europe also involves feelings, in particular the feeling of belonging to one big family. You need only watch Klapisch’s film, Euro Pudding (l’Auberge espagnole), to understand how important it can be for young people to meet on the basis of common ideals and studies.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, therefore, we are extending Erasmus, this flagship programme of the European Union. We are extending it to the whole world, which is a very good thing because, as your rapporteur quite rightly said, we live in a time when we need to build bridges instead of walls. Erasmus World will indeed build bridges, bridges between Europe and the other continents.</p>
<p class="contents">This project is based on absolute respect for the competences of the Member States and the autonomy of higher education institutions. I shall sum up the content of the project in just a few words, Mr President, because your rapporteur has already talked about it. First of all, with regard to EU Masters Courses, we are talking about the fourth and fifth years of university study. These Masters Courses must involve at least three higher education institutions from three different Member States. They must offer a programme that includes a period of study in at least two of these institutions. What is extremely important, and on this point I agree with Mrs De Sarnez and with her fellow Members of Parliament, is that these young people, who are going to study at several universities to do their ‘European tour’, learn not only mathematics or law but also the cultural diversity of Europeans. This is a highly important message that we would like to get into the heads of young Europeans and young people from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, for young people from third countries and for university teachers, there is a scholarship system associated with EU Masters Courses. There are also, and this concerns Europeans in particular, partnerships between these EU Masters Courses and higher education institutions in third countries, seeking to encourage the opening up of European education and to strengthen its global presence. These partnerships also offer our European students an opportunity to study abroad. Naturally, we need to increase the attraction of our higher education by means of activities designed to promote our universities. The proposal includes technical support measures, as necessary, and the budget is set at EUR 200 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if I may, I shall briefly say what the Commission intends to do about the numerous amendments which have been tabled, so that the speakers might make informed speeches. I shall mention, first of all, Amendment No 1 tabled by Parliament. This is the last time I shall say Erasmus World. Parliament has proposed Erasmus Mundus, and Erasmus Mundus it shall be.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You all know very well how important multilingualism is to me. If we create an Erasmus Mundus programme involving a number of universities in several countries, linguistic diversity must clearly be part of Erasmus Mundus, as it is the basis of cultural diversity. I shall, therefore, say yes to Amendment No 4 and to the content of Amendment No 53, or rather, in the long run, Amendments Nos 67, 69 and 77, since they replace it. I presume these will be reworded in order to avoid any prejudice as to the language used for teaching. We also accept the content of Amendment No 29, or rather Amendments Nos 70 and 76 which replace it, and Amendment No 51. In order to maintain the internal coherence of the text, however, they must be combined with Amendment No 53. I cannot accept Amendment No 68 because it seeks to eliminate the promotion of linguistic competence and intercultural understanding, which is completely the opposite direction from that we wish to take.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now come to occupational training. I understand what the Members are saying in wanting to foster occupational training. The Erasmus Mundus programme, however, concerns the field of higher education. The Commission cannot, therefore, accept Amendments Nos 12, 15 or 45. Amendments Nos 18 and 46 can be partially accepted, since references to training will be deleted.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to brain drain, we have always based our thinking on the principle that Erasmus Mundus would have to attract young people from third countries to Europe and then encourage them to return to their own countries, because it is in their own countries that they will have to build on what they have learnt in Europe. The Commission, in this regard, can accept the spirit of Amendment No 24, which must be reworded. Amendment No 7, on the other hand, cannot be accepted, because the aim here is not development cooperation, and nor can Amendment No 78, since the programme cannot provide students from third countries with support relating to their return to their home country.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to equal opportunities, as a woman, I naturally agree with the idea of equal opportunities for women, but this is perhaps not the focus of Erasmus Mundus. We must observe a certain balance. Amendment No 5 seems to me to be balanced, as does Amendment No 23, at least in spirit. On the other hand, I think that Amendments Nos 61, 64 and 65 are in danger of creating excessive operational focus on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as comitology is concerned, we cannot accept Amendment No 42 which seeks to associate competent bodies with the work of the committee. Nor can we accept Amendment No 33, which requires excessive involvement of these bodies in implementing the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the budget, I fully understand what the rapporteur said. For now, the Commission can only maintain its initial proposal. It could, however, review its position in light of a possible increase in the ceiling of heading 3.</p>
<p class="contents">A large number of amendments aim to clarify, simplify or reinforce the text. The Commission accepts them, with the exception of Amendments Nos 27 and 30, where the attempt to simplify the text would detract from the meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community’s role in programmes is, of course, laid down by Article 149 of the Treaty, and is also determined by respect for the autonomy of higher education institutions, which is a <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>condition. The Commission cannot, therefore, accept any amendments which jeopardise this autonomy</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the amendments concerning the selection process have been accepted, with the exception of Amendments Nos 52, 54 and 58, because these impose criteria that run counter to the main objective of quality – and quality is extremely important for Erasmus Mundus – and Amendments No 55 and 57, because they introduce an excessive level of operational detail for a legislative text.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can the concept of specific regions contained in Amendment No 3 be accepted. This is also the case where Amendment No 6 is concerned, which makes a premature reference to future programmes, and Amendments Nos 19, 72 and 73, since they restrict the definition of visiting scholars. Nor can Amendment No 74 be accepted, since it prevents access for private bodies to action 4. This is also the case where Amendments Nos 71 and 75 are concerned, which seek to eradicate Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses. The entire programme is, in fact, based around these Masters Courses.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the Commission can accept 39 of the 66 initial amendments and 5 of the 12 amendments tabled after the vote in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. In relation to timetables, the target is the academic year 2004-2005, which means that the call for proposals should be published in November this year. The adoption process must not be delayed and I therefore trust that Parliament and the Council will be as swift as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we have the opportunity here to do something great, to instigate a programme that will be understood and appreciated by the citizens and which will generate benefits for future generations, in particular with regard to understanding. We are extending a hand today, and I am sure that many others will do the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Erasmus Welt programme, which is so important to the future of the European Union, shows how important and sensible it is that Parliament's committees should cooperate well with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal is supplemented by the amendments tabled to it, which also put it on a broader foundation, especially in financial terms, with EUR 300 million instead of the proposed EUR 200 million. New programmes, especially in the fields of education, culture and youth, which represent important investments in our future, raise again and again the key issue of where we are meant to get the money from if there is none under the heading provided for that purpose. Where is the money supposed to come from if we are disinclined to cut back other similar programmes under the same heading? This question has to be put and answered in this plenary more than once, and I can see the same problem arising with Mr Mauro's report on eLearning.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Parliament has the traditional policy of defending existing programmes. In its legislative capacity, the Council can indeed see how important these programmes are, but as a budgetary authority, it is unwilling to allocate more funds to Heading 3. The current Financial Perspective, which still has until the end of 2006 to run, leaves an extremely small amount of foreseeable room for manoeuvre. That will, in any case, affect the first three years of the Erasmus World programme. The Lisbon strategy, though, which we are pursuing, might well make this a good opportunity for us to show our colours. What priorities do we want to set for the distribution of the funds available, if we want to achieve the transformation into a competitive, dynamic and knowledge-based society, as was reaffirmed, yet again, by everyone at the Brussels Summit just over two weeks ago? With this in mind, we should be putting the case for this important new programme to receive appropriate funding, to the tune of EUR 300 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me then repeat my urgent appeal to the Council to join with us in looking forward and going ahead with this. As a member of the Committee on Budgets, I have to reiterate that the present situation will very probably result in a redeployment of the funds under Heading 3 in order to guarantee compliance with the financial upper limit. It might make sense, in the first instance, to reallocate funds from those action programmes for which no financial framework has yet been laid down in the Financial Perspective, or for which such a framework is to be decided on by way of codecision after 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, we all caught from her an enthusiasm for this new and important project, and let me say loud and clear that our discussions of it brought us joy because we had a sense of playing our part in shaping the future. So, as well as extending congratulations, let me also thank the Commission, and Commissioner Reding, for submitting this programme to us, so that together we are making a contribution to investing in Europe's future and in that of the younger generation. I believe that Erasmus World is the logical continuation of the Erasmus programme, with which we are all familiar, and which has helped generations of young Europeans to get to know the other countries of the European Union as well as their own.</p>
<p class="contents">Erasmus World is now going one step further, both inwards and outwards. Its inward dimension involves something that, even a few years ago, we would have thought impossible, namely that the European Union, and its Member States in particular, are willing, on the basis of their own decisions, of the Bologna Process and the Lisbon resolutions, to cooperate more intensively at university level. An EU quality mark for Masters' courses – excellent! This will bring us closer together, and, together, further forwards. That makes this new programme an important step for us all in improving the situation as regards a shared European education.</p>
<p class="contents">In its second step, Erasmus World opens the way for postgraduate students from third countries to study at European universities. That is what we want a forward-looking intercultural dialogue to involve. Has there ever been a time when a contribution to this intercultural dialogue was more needed than in the present days and weeks? So let me conclude by appealing to the Council in these terms: you cannot, in view of the terrible conflicts in Iraq, afford not to provide the necessary funds for this programme – which amount to at least the EUR 300 million that Parliament has called for! All of us here are duty bound to take an especially responsible approach to investing in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is most important, however, is that the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has managed to deal with the Commission proposal swiftly. I also hope that consensus can be quickly reached with the Council so that the programme can be got fully under way from the start of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a clear need to make Europe a more attractive place and to strengthen the identity of European higher education. At present, the majority of international exchange students go to the United States of America. That country has a long tradition of receiving foreign students, in the form, for example, of Fulbright scholarships. Each year over half a million young people from other countries study in the United States. In Europe, the corresponding figure for the number of students from countries outside the Community is around 400 000. More than three quarters of them come to the United Kingdom, France or Germany: to the three big Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The opportunities offered by European universities are thus hardly being taken up at all at the present time. The same goes for the added value that could be achieved through university networking. The Erasmus Mundus Masters Course programme aims to rectify all these failings by establishing a European Union Masters degree for students from third countries in partnership with three European higher education institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport we pay a great deal of attention to linguistic diversity in Europe. It is perhaps for that reason that the majority on the committee wanted to add the paragraph to Article 4 stating that the purpose of the programme is the ‘promotion of language skills, in particular by the use of two languages spoken in the countries in which the institutions involved in the Erasmus Mundus Masters Course are located’. I fear the worst, in that such a stringent rule will go against the basic aims of the programme. Erasmus Mundus is not a language programme: its purpose is to enhance the attractiveness of European higher education. Let us for example consider the case of a degree course in biotechnology under the Masters programme, to be undertaken in partnership with higher education institutions in Finland, Latvia and Estonia. I am sure a requirement to study the language of these countries would do little to enhance the attractiveness of the programme in the minds of young people interested in biotechnology. This is not a problem that just concerns the northern fringe of Europe, but just as much Portugal and Greece, for example. I certainly hope that this requirement, so precisely defined as it is, will be deleted in the vote in plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission's proposal has come at exactly the right time. Europe wants to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, so it is good that it is emerging as a continent in which the standard of university education is high, so that it is worthwhile for foreign students to come and study here. Promoting mutual cooperation can only benefit the universities.</p>
<p class="contents">Although some parties in my country are suggesting that it is not really necessary to learn two foreign languages, I would like once again to emphatically express my support for the European Parliament's proposal to give third-country students the opportunity to learn the languages of two host countries via this programme. You only have to look round in this Parliament to see how necessary that is. A knowledge of languages not only helps graduates to be more competitive in the labour market, it also increases their cultural stock-in trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to make a comment about this report. The programme is intended for students and universities all over the world, and I would like to urge that we pay extra attention to universities in the developing world. Education is the best weapon in the fight against poverty. By giving students from the developing world the opportunity to complete their knowledge in the European Union, we can contribute to the distribution of knowledge in their own countries. We must, of course, ensure that they do not stay in Europe, because the programme is not intended to boost the brain drain. If European universities are prepared to work together with universities from the developing world, that will be sufficient reason for students to want to return to their own countries and to pass on the knowledge that they have acquired to their compatriots. In this way, we can, via this programme, make a significant contribution to improving the standard of living everywhere, including the developing world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am a research scientist in my country and I cannot hear the expression ‘knowledge-based society’ without flinching. I feel it is important to highlight two points in this regard. First, what is the language of knowledge? If Europe can contribute something to the <span class="italic">mundus</span>, to the world, well, it is precisely its linguistic diversity. It has been repeated time and time again, and I in turn would like to reiterate that it is essential for linguistic diversity to go hand in hand with cultural diversity. If we have a European project, if we also want to show what Europe can give to the world and receive in return, it will be achieved through the linguistic expertise that is so well represented in Parliament. All we ask is that this should also be the case in universities. Thank you, Mrs De Sarnez, for having emphasised this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the language of knowledge is one thing, but knowledge itself is quite another. Commissioner, you said that you accept certain amendments but not others. You are happy for us to point out that equal opportunities are essential but you do not want this to be given too much emphasis. You accept – and these were my amendments – that, overall, there is an objective of equal distribution between the so-called ‘hard’ sciences and the ‘literary’ sciences, but you do not want that to be a selection criterion, if I understood your comments today correctly. I am happy to go no further than principles and guidelines. In order to belong to the world of research and higher education, however, we are quite aware that there must also sometimes be restrictions and that objectives need to be emphasised and in more than just a few words.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the humanities, think of the Sixth Framework Programme for research. Until the Fifth Framework Programme, the humanities were a means, rather than an objective of research; they could assist the other sciences but they were not considered to be separate sciences as such in terms of funding research. Since the Sixth Framework Programme for research, the humanities have a clearly-recognised place, and I am particularly happy about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like the points concerning equal opportunities, such as an equal balance between all sciences and all disciplines, to be more than mere words. I would like it to be genuinely possible to promote them with regard to the movement of students and young researchers or future researchers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad because it refers back to a shared root, from which sprang the cultural and linguistic diversity of the European Union. On the subject of diversity, I would like to emphasise how close to our heart it is that this long-standing objective of the European Union should be reflected in the requirement for written and oral competence in two EU languages in addition to the mother tongue. This is an objective that we should consistently pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow-Members have already mentioned so much: equality of opportunity and the fight against poverty are goals towards which the European Union is expected to strive. What else is still expected of this Union of ours? For what can we still be a motor? What do we expect of ourselves, and what do we have to offer? Here too, I am repeating myself and merely saying what has already been said, but we must again lay stress on one fact. It is that we can offer an area of tolerance, a space full of respect – something that cannot work without education – as well as a space for intercultural dialogue and intercultural competence. That cannot work without education.</p>
<p class="contents">That too leads me to appeal to the Council, for it can work only if we are ready, right now, to invest, if we replenish Heading 3 rather than simply capping it and saying that we will squeeze it out of something else. Whilst we are not meant to be debating what that 'something else' is to be, it is something that we still have to talk about. As Mrs Wenzel-Perillo said, this question has to be put here more than just once. We have to show our colours! The investment in education that we are making today will bring forth a harvest that will bring gladness not only to us within the EU, but also beyond its borders. That is what is expected of Europe!</p>

There are now European-wide programmes operating in all elements of our education system.</p>
<p class="contents">We live in an internal market where there is free movement of people. If the European Union as a political entity is to grow and prosper, we must ensure that its schoolchildren are given opportunities to learn different languages, to experience the education systems of other countries within the European Union. Promoting social and educational interaction between students can only serve a positive function.</p>
<p class="contents">From an Irish perspective, investment in education has made it possible to tackle unemployment and emigration and allowed our dynamic young workforce to participate in a meaningful way in the work of economic development. The EU Erasmus programme is one of the most popular educational programmes operating within the European Union. It has been in existence since the mid-1980s, and provides educational opportunities for students from within the European Union and the applicant states to study in different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the EU Erasmus programme was originally set up, over one million students in Europe have already taken part in this important educational initiative. In fact over 100 000 different students now participate in this programme on an annual basis. The report which we are dealing with today relates to the setting-up of a new Erasmus World initiative which is due to come into operation in the year 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has proposed a budget of over EUR 200 million for the administration of the EU Erasmus World initiative for the years 2004 to 2008. The key elements of this initiative, as has been outlined, include provision of educational exchanges between colleges in Europe and other educational colleges from around the world. Moreover, financial support will be given to both students and educational staff members who are participating in the Erasmus World initiative. Funding will also be provided for conferences and seminars so as to promote educational and student mobility between the European Union and colleges around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This initiative is yet another clear example of the European Union seeking to bring forward proposals which will help to promote and increase the standard of education within the European Union and beyond. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It needs no explanation; that this is a better description than Erasmus World is self-explanatory. For ‘Mundus’ shows that we have a multiplicity of languages and do not express ourselves in only one language, the so-called <span class="italic">lingua franca,</span> English. So I am glad that we have chosen the Latin word.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs De Sarnez' report takes up three points that are of great importance to us on the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and also in my group. The first is the European dimension and the European value that the opportunity of mobility adds to education. Secondly, Europe is given an enhanced presence on the international stage, becoming more attractive and also more competitive – particularly in the field of university education.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is the accent on language learning, and here I want to contradict all those who have said that this is not important. I am glad that this additional amendment is there, for it is the learning of our region's languages that helps the people who come to us to grasp its cultural diversity. Fourthly, the increase to EUR 300 million reflects the desire to create a real European educational area. If, on a Sunday, I talk about how important that is, if I make statements about it in Bologna or in Lisbon, only, on Monday, to fail to make the money available, then the written word is worthless. That is why we should remind our masters in the Council that they now have to make their contribution, in order to do justice to the high expectations they have of themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The stunning success of the Socrates/Erasmus programme, on which I was the rapporteur on more than one occasion, is the inspiration behind this new programme. Erasmus has enabled a million students to study, and both programmes, which are mutually complementary, make it possible to gain an additional qualification abroad. They also facilitate access to European languages, to European culture and to European values. They are indispensable in terms of cultural understanding and dialogue, both of which have been mentioned a number of times today.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the limited budget that we have must be replenished. That is an obstacle. There is also a lack of demand on the part of teachers, for whom there is the hindrance that what they do abroad is often not recognised at home. With the new programmes, that are soon to follow, in mind, we have to give some thought to how we can really harmonise these programmes with each other. I would also like to make another appeal that has not so far been heard today. It is an appeal to the Convention, that these measures – Socrates, Erasmus, Erasmus Mundus – should not be merely support measures, but rather supplementary competences, which we value, and which constitute the heart of the European Union. That is something you could find out if you were at last to talk with the public instead of constantly peering at your books!</p>

At the moment it looks more as if we are moving away from them.</p>
<p class="contents">Erasmus World can be an opportunity to make up this deficit. It is the exchange of knowledge between Europe and third countries, rather than the concentration of knowledge in Europe that is the basis on which we will reach our objective. The programme is aimed widely, at institutions of higher education and postgraduate students all over the world, at students within the European Union, who can go abroad, and at scientists and academics from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe, though, that it is important for our students who go abroad that the necessary recognition of academic achievements and degrees should be pushed through and improved, and that Erasmus students should have study abroad improved and made easier for them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise that I am very much in favour of equality of opportunity or a balance in men and women's participation in this programme. Neither in terms of the countries' participation nor of the academic disciplines do I want this to be treated as secondary. If we do not pay attention to equality of opportunity from the very outset, we will have problems with making it a reality later on.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to briefly address the issue of multilingualism. On this, opinions differ, but I do not think that participation in this programme can be dependent on it, as the Masters' courses have their own priorities, and the students accommodate themselves to them. I do indeed think that linguistic diversity has a part to play during courses of study, and I also believe that people must have the opportunity to participate in language courses, but that they should not be considered to be admission criteria for the bursary.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just say something about the financial arrangements. We are glad of the EUR 300 million, but it is not acceptable that this should be deducted from other programmes. If this is not to go against the idea of promoting a knowledge-based society, there must be additional funding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">European added value has been mentioned with regard to Erasmus Mundus. There is also Parliamentary added value through the amendments which Parliament will make to this European response to the challenge of global competition between universities. This challenge consists of responding to the brain drain by attracting brains, without imitating formulas from outside Europe, while developing a specific objective: linguistic diversity. A knowledge-based Europe is a multilingual Europe, the development of an original system of movement between universities, a vision of the organisation of the academic Community as a network: these are the innovative elements. What are we asking for in order to achieve this? A small budgetary increase, a little budgetary oxygen for Erasmus Mundus, a small financial step, Mr President, for a great leap towards excellence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we are required to take a stand on other issues, such as the issue we are examining.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a decision which we are debating introduces the Masters Course of the European Union and, secondarily, funds access to it for students and teachers from third countries. The first, in blatant violation of Article 149 of the Treaty, is yet another step towards the imposition of a specific higher education model, which is none other than the notorious Bologna model. The programme has not been opened up to third countries in order to help them develop their manpower. It is being used as a cover to push through the Masters Course and as a mechanism for cultural penetration by the European Union, as the prerequisite to economic penetration and the strengthening of its political influence at international level. Typically, the text states that Europe's political and commercial success in the world depends on a better understanding and the ties which future decision-makers in third countries will have with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic objective of the European Union in the field of education is to supply the European monopolies with cheap labour which, rather than knowledge, merely has the skills required at the time. That is the reason for the need for convergence in the structure of studies on the basis of the Bologna standard, with three years' undergraduate study for the large mass of students, two years' specialisation for the select and a three-year doctorate for the crème de la crème. In Greece in particular, which has still not officially assimilated undergraduate degrees with three-year degrees, adopting the proposal which we are examining would speed up the relevant reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the European Union is trying in the proposal for a decision to promote the European higher education market within the framework of competition with the United States. This, of course, depends on the creation of such a market and the adaptation of European universities to its laws and priorities. The result will be the complete commercialisation of education, a sign of which is the quality mark for courses referred to in the text, as if they were cars or oranges. The quality assurance and evaluation mechanisms under consideration are merely mechanisms for education to respond to the needs of industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The Communist Party of Greece is categorically opposed to the proposal for a decision because it interferes with curricula, it strengthens the privatisation and commercialisation of higher education and it promotes the splitting of undergraduate studies into two cycles, in accordance with the Bologna model, and the subjugation of post-graduate study to the demands of the multinationals, contrary to the interests of students, lecturers and the people of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The least we demand is for action one, the European masters, to be removed, and I have submitted a proposed amendment to that effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to congratulate Mrs De Sarnez on her work on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">European universities have much to offer the world in terms of their scientific and teaching excellence. I therefore welcome a programme which will enhance and strengthen the attractiveness of European higher education. Moreover, it will allow this sector to compete with other countries, particularly the United States and Canada, in attracting talented and motivated students and scholars from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I welcome the proposal to increase the multiannual budget from EUR 200 million to EUR 300 million. That is very important as long as it does not impede and take money away from important programmes such as Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci. Nevertheless, the Erasmus Mundus programme should not only benefit European universities but also contribute to the improvement of standards of living, to the development of human resources and the raising of poverty thresholds in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I reiterate the point made by other speakers that it is very important for us to develop the linguistic capacities of our students throughout the European Union. There is no point in talking about a Europe of diversity unless we provide people with the proper skills in languages that will enhance that goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union wants to see its university system compete with that of the United States, not only in terms of standards of excellence but also in terms of attracting students from third countries. The more it is able to do so, the more it will improve the balance between a crucial transatlantic alliance and western civilisation itself. It will also further strengthen the bases of democracy. To my knowledge, North American universities’ policies for attracting and retaining the finest minds are designed more to assure their own interests than those of the countries in which these minds originate. Cooperation, in this case, takes second place to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s ideas in this field are somewhat more cautious, because they refer to encouraging ‘cooperative approaches’, in other words, approaches that ultimately seek to ensure the 'refoulement' of third country nationals who come to study for degrees in Europe. There are other aspects, however, that have given a clear advantage to the United States, since if we are to resolve the same problem in Europe particular attention must be paid to these aspects. Amongst others, these are the language, the quality of teaching and the reputation of the institutions and programmes, the variety of subjects these programmes cover, the recognition of diplomas awarded in the country of origin, legislation on residency, enrolment costs and the availability of scholarships.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of only one language, the enormous competition between university institutions and the enormous variation in quality, the constant concern to attract and retain the finest brains to which I have just referred, and the great variation in the cost of enrolment and course fees, which are as a rule quite high, characterise an education system that attracts many more students from other countries than the European university system does.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, another problem arises immediately as a result of the disproportionate number of students applying to universities in the United Kingdom, France and Germany compared to those applying to universities in the other Member States. Around three-quarters of these students apply to universities in the three countries to which I have referred. To this we should add the issue of Europe’s linguistic mosaic – for which, where higher education is concerned, a universal and satisfactory solution has still not been found – in order to ensure the balanced distribution of potential students. It goes without saying that language learning for university students is not the same as simply learning the basics of the language of the host country. However many courses in the language of the host country might have been provided before students attend an advanced course, however many parallel courses the universities open to their foreign students, it is clearly unrealistic to think that in a short space of time, we can reverse the trend that currently benefits the United Kingdom, France and Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">This relative scepticism, Mr President, is not a reason to vote against the excellent report by Mrs De Sarnez, or to fail to applaud the excellent initiative by the Commission. It is a reason, however, to attempt to develop a solution to the set of problems to which I have referred – a solution that is still far from satisfactory – and also, for this very reason, to attempt to ensure that this set of problems is given an appropriate budgetary allocation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that one reason for this is that we have not yet entirely succeeded in combining the individual strengths, the diversity of the education we have to offer, and also our wide experience in networking.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my opinion that this ‘Erasmus Mundus’ programme can help here. Promoting cooperation with third countries will also improve still further the quality of university education in Europe. What is also lacking, in my view, is a recognisable and clear-cut European identity for higher education. That is perhaps why many graduates and scientists prefer to do their research and studying in America. I think this attractive programme for high-quality education will do something to counteract this tendency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, at this point, to extend sincere thanks to the Commission, and also to the rapporteur, Mrs De Sarnez, for this initiative. Mrs De Sarnez also deserves special thanks for having managed to negotiate an acceptable compromise with the Committee on Budgets, so that ‘Erasmus World’ is not funded to the detriment of already existing programmes. We have heard it said so often that young people's education, being an investment in the future, is no place for austerity measures.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Erasmus report represents a further step forward because, at the moment, although there is free movement of workers, we do not have free movement of students in the European Union. I say this because we must face the fact that students from one country cannot move to another country to continue studying or to work because of differences in school curricula or because their studies or qualifications are not recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Erasmus mundus</span> programme is finally going to try to overcome these obstacles, contributing to the development of quality education and allowing freedom of movement within the European area. Furthermore, this is going to contribute to improving two vital aspects for the citizens of the European Union: understanding of our different European cultures and the very important issue of knowledge of languages.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to cultures, we must be aware that if we want a united Europe we must invest in it. There is nothing free in this world. And we must reflect this in the budgets of the European Union by investing more in the education and the culture of our young Europeans because, let us not forget, they represent the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to languages, I agree with certain fellow Members that it is essential that the future citizens of the European Union speak one or two languages, apart from their own, so that those people will then be able to move freely from one country to another without having to deal with the obstacle of not being able to speak the languages of other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, <span class="italic">Erasmus mundus</span> is a great step forward, it takes account of different cultures. The mobility of students will promote understanding between different cultures and improve knowledge of languages; it will prepare citizens to be able to work within a global society; it will create an employment exchange within each institution – this is very important since it will help young people to find their first job, which is always so difficult to do; it will also put the European Union on the map in terms of advanced studies, because certain other countries were ahead of us in this respect. It will also involve the business sector, which I believe is very positive, since many of these young people will later have to start work within the company world.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to congratulate the Commission on its initiative and the rapporteur, Mrs De Sarnez, on her excellent report and for all the work she has done so that it can come to fruition. I only hope that the success of the <span class="italic">Erasmus mundus</span> programme marks the beginning of the success of many more programmes in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is an important and reformist document.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate Mrs De Sarnez on her common sense and her open spirit, because that is the best way for us to work together.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certain points which I believe are interesting, but which concern me. In this regard I do not agree with my friend, the communist Member Konstantinos Alyssandrakis. I believe that European Masters and postgraduate programmes should help the universities to create partnerships amongst each other; so that they can make free use of the world scene to come together, without external controls, except quality indicators. I believe that no police authority can determine the limits of knowledge and partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that at such a dynamic time for society, we cannot work if we do not allow the people to work in partnership and for the universities to meet, to seek common ground and make decisions. We must simply ‘bless’ – to use a very classical term – their actions. What do worry me – and I address this to the Commission – are the quality indicators, because I am afraid of borders of States and countries. In this regard, I would go as far as to suggest that we should give more support to the establishment of European universities and institutions of a European nature, which, together with the States, would serve as experts, as ‘stake holder’ bodies and as genuine beneficiaries of the programme. These bodies must truly cooperate on these projects and in this way they will also ease the Commission’s burden.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe it is very important to create institutional incentives. For this programme we must not just support students, but we must also reward those universities which work and meet together, and those which carry out the greatest number of exchanges with third countries, because we must create enthusiasm; we must stimulate this process which, by means of the <span class="italic">Erasmus</span> programme, has been a success, even if it has been very slow.</p>
<p class="contents">We will only succeed if we accept the difficulties faced by universities in implementing this policy of approximation and if we help them in this new experiment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I also believe there should be more help for the poorest students, since many of them are not able to join in with the programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
