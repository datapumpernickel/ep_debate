<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ludford (ELDR).</span></span>   – I am delighted to have been able to work with Mrs Buitenweg. She has done an excellent and inclusive job producing a balanced text, which usefully strengthens the Commission’s hand. This proposed directive is a landmark for Europe. It is right that Europe should be legislating to guarantee the fundamental right to dignity, irrespective of ethnicity, and not to suffer discrimination. It is also timely for Europe to legislate now with the alarming rise in the Far Right and racist violence.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to highlight a few aspects of the text. Firstly, the very significant inclusion of indirect and institutional racism, and amendments have strengthened that aspect. Secondly, the specific inclusion of housing, health and other public authority functions, including policing. This is not interference in national responsibilities, but an assertion that the non-discriminatory delivery of these services is a European concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the inclusion via Amendments Nos 15 and 29 of disguised race discrimination. My Group is not favourable to the inclusion of religion or belief in the scope of this directive because that needs much more thought. However, we believe unequal treatment should be caught if it only pretends to be based on religion or nationality but is, in fact, race discrimination pure and simple.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the inclusion, as has already been mentioned, of incitement or pressure to discriminate – that is very important. Fifthly, the role of the European Union Monitoring Centre in assisting the Commission in monitoring the implementation of this directive – and I hope the Commission will welcome that. Sixthly, although my Group understands the thinking behind Amendment No 38, the fact that it includes private clubs or associations is rather problematical. To give you an example: I represent London and it could mean a problem for Caribbean people getting together to reminisce about life in the Caribbean in the 1950s if some white people were excluded. I think that Amendment No 38 is not well drafted.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the adjustment of the burden of proof, and I am borrowing Mr Oostlander’s phrase here, because he is quite correct to refer to it as ‘sharing’ or a ‘distribution’ of the burden of proof. I am rather sorry that the Socialist Group insist on calling it a <span class="italic"><span class="underline">reversa</span></span><span class="italic">l </span>of the burden of proof because that is slightly misleading. It applies to the limited circumstances of equal opportunities law which is civil or administrative law. My Group agrees that since the employer authority has most of the information, it must prove there has been no breach of equal treatment once the complainant has demonstrated a <span class="italic"><span class="underline">prima facie</span></span> case.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there will be more heat than light from some speakers today and I am afraid I might include Mr Helmer of whose remarks I had a foretaste last night on the way back from the delightful asparagus dinner.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Boumediène-Thiery (Greens/ALE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three years after the Treaty of Amsterdam was adopted and the famous and much-debated Article 13 was introduced, the Council is proposing two directives to implement the principles of this Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only congratulate the Council’s willingness to make progress on this issue, particularly at a time when certain parties of the traditional right are starting to sign agreements with extreme-right movements. This has already happened in France, is now occurring in Austria and may soon happen in Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition of a minimum European framework for the fight against discrimination is therefore urgently required. The directive on the fight against racial and ethnic discrimination is heading in the right direction. In particular, it provides for the reversal of the burden of proof, the gradual establishment of positive discrimination – more effective than simple theoretical equality – and the recognition of indirect discrimination. All these aspects reveal a clear desire to forge ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">However, certain shortcomings must be highlighted. Some of these have been raised by our rapporteur, such as the issue of legal proceedings being free of charge for plaintiffs and the necessary extension of the right to take part in court proceedings to groups and associations. There are also two other problems which I must raise. The first is of a general nature. How can the Council consider the issue of racial and ethnic discrimination without being committed to the creation of a comprehensive legislative framework for all discrimination? Singling out one type of discrimination gives the impression that some types of discrimination are less reprehensible than others. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">A second directive on discrimination at work is to be examined shortly. The Council must therefore make haste and propose a draft directive encompassing all types of discrimination. This is absolutely vital as the most excluded are those who suffer several types of discrimination. Protecting them from just one type will only go part-way towards helping them.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem concerns the exclusion of religious discrimination from this directive. It is extremely regrettable that religious discrimination was not included with racial and ethnic discrimination as these different types of discrimination are closely linked. For example, how do you define the Jewish identity? Surely the hatred for Jews which remains significant in many countries is due as much to anti-Semitism, and therefore to ethnic origin, as to religious aspects. Discrimination against North African communities in Europe is also two-sided. It may even often be said that the fear of Islam acts as a catalyst for racism towards these communities. Therefore, limiting this directive to racial and ethnic discrimination risks leaving the door open to ambiguities in interpretation with which the courts might struggle to deal.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, it is essential that the Council adopts an integrated approach towards the legal tools to be established in order to apply Article 13 in our daily life. Dividing the fight against discrimination among a number of texts is dangerous for the overall coherence of the anti-discrimination mechanism and therefore weakens it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, it is not evident that that has happened. On some points, the amendments involve precise improvements to the text in question. In addition to details, I myself wish to refer to the right of collective action, legal assistance and other aspects which are already covered by Portuguese law. However, in key areas, the amendments that we are debating could potentially wreck everything. It seems that the rapporteurs and others who support them have wanted to go too far, and in their desire to do so they may seriously affect the entire proposal. There are three points that particularly worry us: the reversal of the burden of proof, which has not been clarified, and the issues of nationality and religion. Reversal of the burden of proof is already a very sensitive matter in its own right. Even so, there are areas in which it is clearly justified, but it is unacceptable that instead of applying the classic principle of <span class="italic">in dubio pro reo</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>this is to be replaced by a principle of <span class="italic">in dubio pro auctore</span>, especially when there is no explanation as to whether this reversal is to apply to criminal justice cases, and we know that there are cases in this area that can come under the criminal justice system. This would amount to a violation of the fundamental principles of our legal system and of basic rights of trial formulated in Latin, that is to say based on Roman law.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the issue of nationality. We Portuguese can perhaps boast the richest mix of blood and ethnic origins in the course of history. I myself and my circle of friends have not the faintest idea of our ethnic background. We would be a real puzzle for a Nazi investigator or for the chart of ethnic origins which Baroness Ludford admired so much a few weeks ago in another report. We are familiar with the concept of racism, which has no impact on us, although we must combat it. Above all, we must firmly combat racist violence. But it is important not to confuse separate issues. In other words, ethnicity is one issue and nationality is another. If there is discrimination between a black person and a white person, or vice versa, for example if someone discriminates against a white Portuguese in favour of a black Portuguese, or against a black Portuguese in favour of a white Portuguese, this is clearly unlawful racism and should result in prosecution. However, when it comes to applying for a particular post, if a Portuguese, be he Asian, black or white, is suitable for that job, in a way that does not apply to a Zimbabwean, be he Asian, black or white, then this is not a question of racism, it is about citizenship, and this can be legitimate. The problem is that in many of the amendments these two concepts are confused, with potentially disastrous effects, particularly in areas such as public service, and even in other, unexpected areas. The other vital area is religion. We wish to make it clear that freedom of religious organisation is a fundamental civil right, which cannot be undermined, curbed or jeopardised, which would be the effect of some of the amendments before us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With each passing day, Europe is becoming a continent which, as the United Nations’ reports on the European population trend illustrate, is host to citizens of third States but which, above all, needs their contribution, their culture, their potential and their initiatives. In a context such as this, the Union must reaffirm the fundamental principles of democracy and ensure that all citizens and residents have the same rights and the same duties. </p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, we are sceptical about three points in the report and the directive: we are completely against the principle of the reversal of the burden of proof, which is contrary to fundamental legal principles. We do not believe that the end justifies the means but that the means prefigure the end. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we do not support the creation of independent bodies in the Member States, which would be responsible for monitoring racial and ethnic discrimination. This is because, in general terms, we do not have confidence in institutions which, in violation of the democratic principle of the separation of powers, interfere with other institutions, with the result that they either upset the balance between the legislative, executive and judicial authorities or they find themselves without a specific function because everything is already being done by other institutions. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we do not agree with the references to positive discrimination. We are opposed to positive discrimination in general when it is State-imposed, for we feel that merit should take precedence over the quota policy which, when all is said and done, discriminates between individuals who want to fight that very discrimination. </p>
<p class="contents">With these reservations, the Members of the Bonino List will support the report and the directive, in the hope that the European Parliament and the Commission will reflect upon the points we have raised and make the appropriate amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is largely to do with the way in which the discussion of this report has been forced upon us, against normal procedures. </p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, I subscribe to the importance of equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial and ethnic origin. But it is precisely because this is such an important topic that Parliament, and especially the Portuguese Presidency, would have done well to have set more time aside for it. The enactment of the general act on equal treatment cost the Netherlands blood, sweat and tears at the time. I am sure that other Member States have had similar experiences and these experiences should remind us to exercise caution and do our homework before discussing this draft directive. This will require the necessary time, not least because the implementation of the current proposal will have a ripple effect within existing legislation and systems within the different Member States. The change in the burden of proof is just one example of this. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s amendment takes the Commission’s proposal one step further. The Commission specifies that the principle of subsidiarity is still being enforced, but I question that. The directive is said to have a supplementary function with regard to the political signal it sends out. But this type of signal is being emitted with just as much power by long-standing national legislation, which is a great deal closer to the citizen, and by the widely known ECHR. An in-depth discussion would have been desirable, certainly given the far-reaching consequences which this legislation can have on legislation and legal systems within the Member States and the fact that it will infringe on the Member States’ sovereignty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It goes without saying that the principle of equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin should be applied. There is no place for discrimination on these grounds in a modern society. However, it is possible to overshoot the mark, even in the case of such an uncontroversial issue. The reversal of the burden of proof proposed by the Commission would mean imposing an intolerable burden on small- and medium-sized enterprises in particular, as they would in future have to keep a record of every job interview, so that in serious cases they would be able to provide proof. Arrangements like this do not result in greater understanding for the victims of discrimination. Quite the opposite – it actually harms the cause. The precision of the impact assessment form annexed to the Commission proposal is totally dependent on the use of the phrase “without apparent difficulty”. The wording is as follows: “identical rules have already been applied without apparent difficulty”.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, I think that it is important and that it will simplify the debate if the honourable members know how the Commission has dealt with Parliament’s proposal, as far as the acceptance of amendments is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House knows, I – as the Commissioner responsible – presented an anti-discrimination package a few months ago, containing two directives and a programme. Today we are discussing one of these two directives and, allow me to say that this is only possible thanks to the brilliant collaboration and highly efficient work of the two parliamentary committees, the endeavours of which, I think, surpass all expectations. This particularly complicated directive, which has multiple repercussions, involves national peculiarities and different views, and to which all the committees involved have made various contributions, has evolved into a report and a consensus has been found. I should like to congratulate Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Howitt and everyone else involved, as well as the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this conference is of historic importance for two reasons: first, because the demand for this sort of legislative act was tabled over twenty years ago. Social groups, political parties, parliaments, MEPs and international conferences have proposed and have insisted that we legislate against the huge issue of racism and the conduct of organised society. Twenty years on, it is now coming true. We are here discussing this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is that, because of the current political climate, because of the political problems which have arisen within the Union over recent months in connection with racist clashes at political and social level, today’s piece of work is the first to go beyond words, to go beyond resolutions and general political expression to specific policy making. The European Commission has worked quickly following the presentation of your committee’s report, with the collaboration of all the services involved, and I am pleased to say that over half the amendments have been accepted either in spirit or in part. I must stress that the amendments which have not been accepted have mainly been rejected for administrative or legal reasons or because we know from our experience and from our collaboration over the years that the Council is sure to reject them. As you know, our basis is Article 13 and it is an article which limits our room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment on a number of amendments. I am pleased to say that we agree with the amendments to incorporate the sexual dimension (Amendments Nos 7 and 59), the amendments to the material and personal scope (Amendments Nos 5, 30, 31, 34, 36 and 37) and the amendment on taking positive action (Amendment No 40). We also agree with the idea of conciliation procedures in Amendment No 42, consultation with governmental organisations (Amendments Nos 21, 50 and 51) and with the amendments relating to previous acts of the European Parliament and the Council (Amendments Nos 3, 4, 8, 9 and 12). I also agree with your proposal to define the role of the European Monitoring Centre – as contained in Amendment No 59 – although I should point out that our experience at the Commission tells us that the submission of reports by Member States every two years is a particularly demanding task and will not enable us to correctly assess the impact of the policies developed. You also propose to amend the definition of indirect discrimination and one of the speakers also mentioned this. I agree with the points made in the amendments and you may be sure that we shall use them to help formulate the definition in line with the interpretation of the European Court of Justice in the O’Flynn case.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a few words to clarify the article on balancing the burden of proof proposed in amendment 43, even though the debate and the Council have made it clear that there will be problems in getting it accepted. However, I should like to point out – because the Commission agrees with this approach – that a similar discussion was held several years ago along the same lines on the subject of discrimination between the sexes. At that time, too, there was a great deal of concern about the repercussions which this would also have in the courts, where it was feared that a large number of cases would be filed, and in companies. After many years in application, we have seen that these fears were unfounded and that there were no problems. I think, therefore, that we can use this experience and be bold enough to take this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree – and I welcome your persistence – that the directive should apply to all persons present on the territory of the Member States and not only to Community citizens. I also agree with the proposal to make it clear that the directive will apply to natural and legal persons, but I must point out that your reference to non-formalised groups of persons cannot be incorporated because this concept is not legally recognised. The content of the concept is understandable on merit, but it has not yet been legally recognised and will cause numerous problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to refer to an issue which appears to be of particular importance to the House; I refer to the distinction between racial and ethnic origin on the one hand and religious conviction on the other. Long discussions were held in the Commission when the proposal was drawn up as to whether a ban on discrimination on the grounds of religion should be included in this directive. We understand the argument that it is often difficult to make a clear distinction. This frequently applies in the workplace, mainly because there are problems in relation to prayer facilities, obtaining permission for religious events and special dietary requirements in the workplace, which is why the second directive in the package, which relates to employment issues and discrimination in the workplace, makes clearer mention of discrimination on the grounds of religion. But we do understand how difficult and how complicated the issue will become if we have an extensive ban on discrimination on the grounds of religion, for example in education. And how difficult it will be to negotiate the directive with the Member States, where there are diametrically opposed approaches. However, we welcome the approach which you have taken, i.e. the fact that Amendments Nos 15 and 29 point out that some people will probably try to interpret discrimination on the grounds of racial origin as discrimination on the grounds of religion and I agree that the directive must be strengthened on this point and that the Member States must also clearly draw the attention of the courts and other competent authorities to this danger when dealing with the issue of the right to take legal action against discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to comment briefly on independent agencies. I agree with some of the ideas for their role which you put forward, especially the need for them to be independent, but we cannot specify how they are to be organised or how they are to operate because that is a question for the Member States themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of amendments which has actually been accepted is very large and I imagine that we agree that we need to examine how these ideas can be incorporated into an amended proposal so that we retain the structure and balance in the text and the proposal has some chance of being approved by the Council, because I think that, for all of us, the best balance is between what we want and what is feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer very briefly to the more basic amendments which we are unable to accept. The first concerns your reservations on the exclusion from the draft of a detailed reference to specific services, such as the police or the judicial authorities. As the rapporteur rightly pointed out, the directive may only intervene where there is Community jurisdiction. This does not apply in the case of judicial assistance in criminal matters and in the case of police cooperation, both of which come within the scope of the Treaty on the European Union. We therefore agree with the reference in Amendment No 37 to public bodies in general but cannot agree to the specific reference to the police and judicial authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">A few words now on the huge issue of special problems in the area of immigration policies and asylum policies. The Commission prefers to follow a gradual approach due to the complexity of the issue and, when processing specific legislative measures on admission policies in these two areas, i.e. asylum and immigration, the Commission will evaluate the situation and decide to what extent the inclusion of an ad hoc clause against discrimination would be the most suitable response. There are other points, such as public procurement, where the framework prohibits such criteria from creeping in, the issue of statistics, where I acknowledge and support your fear of a shortage of statistics – one of the basic objectives of the action programme is to create databases at European level – and finally, our obligation, as European institutions, to apply the same rules as those which we propose for the Member States. The reforms which we are presently endeavouring to implement within the Commission have taken account of the entire framework of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to thank you for allowing me to run over time, but I needed to comment on a whole series of particularly complicated amendments and articles in order to give the House the best possible understanding of the points which can be accepted and, as you can see, they are numerous.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I think that if we show the joint political will and continue our excellent collaboration, we can make the small vision of Europe’s fundamental commitment on the issue of racism come true.</p>

The international community sets great store by the fight against racism and it is also high on the agenda of the Member States, but a great deal still needs to be done in order to protect human rights and fight racism, xenophobia and intolerance. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also becoming increasingly evident that cooperation within the EU is indispensable. Certainly within an open, internal market which enjoys the free movement of goods, people and services, further harmonisation with regard to the scope, content and options for enforcement is vitally important. </p>
<p class="contents">It is with pleasure that I compliment Mrs Buitenweg on her report. It is an excellent report which deals with the equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial and ethnic origin, in general. I would like to point out, however, that women, in particular, are being disproportionately affected by discrimination and, among women as a group, it is especially women and girls who are often doubly discriminated against on the basis of their race and ethnic origin.</p>
<p class="contents">I have another four points I would like to make, Mr President. It would be beneficial if organisations or other legal entities which intend to fight discrimination were to have the right to initiate the procedure to promote the observation or application of this directive or to support victims in the procedure. I am also of the opinion that it is advisable that each of the Member States should have an independent body, such as we have in the Netherlands, to assess the complaints. This body is called the Committee on equal treatment. It is an independent body which works extremely well and efficiently. </p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased with the amendment tabled by the PPE-DE delegate, Mrs Smet, who advocates that the directive should also apply to elections of employees’ representatives in works councils, for example. This would be a gain, in my view. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say a few words on the already mentioned problem of sharing the burden of proof. This is popularly termed the reversal of the burden of proof in the case of possible discrimination and already applies with regard to women. The same system is now also being proposed with regard to this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to actually tackle discrimination head on, it is extremely important – if not imperative – that this shared burden of proof enter into force. As the Commissioner said, in practice, this has never led to any difficulties in other spheres before. All the more reason to accept a swift implementation here. </p>

And on time! The need to combat discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin or religious conviction is taking on a sense of urgency on the continent of Europe. The revival of fanaticism and Mediaeval attitudes, the emergence of parties based on racial perceptions and the increase in violence bear witness to the fact that respect for others who are different, which is a feature of advanced societies, has not yet been fully achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, in the 21st century, ideological and political convictions will meet somewhere between the progressive, cosmopolitan perception which accepts a multicultural society, and fundamentalism, which approaches those who are different with fear and enmity and promotes racism and xenophobia. This is why the European Union needs to be given legal armour and to speed up the procedures to complete a common area of freedom, security and justice for everyone living on the territory of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the directive has been adopted by the Council, we hope that the Member States will quickly give immediate priority: first, to judicial cooperation and harmonisation of their criminal legislation; secondly, to instructing state agencies and employers on how to apply the directive to all natural and legal persons; thirdly, to applying the 1997 Charter of the European Political Parties on the defence of fundamental rights and the fight against all forms of racial violence; fourthly, to the right of individual victims of discrimination to take collective action; fifthly, to guaranteeing the access of minorities to vocational training, employment, health services and national insurance and pension schemes and their participation in economic, social, political and cultural life.</p>

MEPs and NGOs worked very hard to get Article 13 into the Treaty. I look forward to seeing further directives, perhaps starting with disability.</p>
<p class="contents">Initially, I was against racism being taken separately. I would have liked to see it taken with the directive on employment and with the Action Programme. I was persuaded of the urgency, because of the current rise of racism across the EU. A number of Members have cited individual cases today.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Portuguese Presidency can work very hard to push this through and make sure that we do get this racism legislation. We have to send the message that we are opposed to racism and xenophobia across the EU. I am glad for that reason that we are having the vote today.</p>
<p class="contents">May I turn specifically to some of the amendments. I am very well aware that some European jargon excludes people. This is the reason I wanted Amendment No 48 on simple language to go in. Amendment No 43: people have talked already about the burden of proof. This is working towards a shared burden of proof. The plaintiff does have to provide facts and it has already been said that equal opportunities for men and women cover this in European legislation as well. Amendment No 51: I am delighted that charities and non-governmental organisations are going to be consulted. They are at the sharp end; they know what they are talking about.</p>

It is very pleasing to see this. The action programme against discrimination, the Commission’s two proposals for directives, the opening of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, and lastly the adoption of Article 13 of the Treaty all give an irrevocable signal. There was no anti-discrimination provision of this kind in the treaties before. The European institutions can now, on the basis of Article 13, take appropriate steps to fight certain kinds of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has also made its own contribution. My colleague, Mrs Buitenweg, has, under considerable time pressure, prepared a well considered report on this anti-discrimination package on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and we are now voting on that report.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, Mrs Buitenweg’s 55 or so amendments make the Commission proposal much more substantial. She has achieved a great deal. The proposal before us is the first implementation of Article 13. It concerns equal treatment irrespective of the colour of people’s skin or their ethnic origin. It does not only tackle the most important areas of life, such as access to employment and equal treatment at the workplace, education, social protection and social security. The Commission is also attempting to build on experience gained in the Member States. The reversal of the burden of proof will make the directive a very important instrument. The defendant will now have to provide convincing proof that there is no discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope of the directive has also been widened, with protection against discrimination being extended to associations and groups of persons. A large majority of the committee went along with the rapporteur, and the vote today allows us to take that decision further in a consistent way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to expressly thank Mrs Buitenweg for her excellent work and I assume that we will adopt this report by a clear majority today, even if the Commissioner responsible has let it be known here today that she cannot accept half the amendments. Nevertheless, a very important step is being taken today and we are giving a signal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sylla (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (FR)</span> Mr President, I too congratulate Mrs Buitenweg on her excellent work. Taking these concrete steps against discrimination shows a willingness to tackle the invisible side of racism which is more underhand and which has insidiously penetrated to the heart of our countries. This daily humiliation and harassment can have serious consequences and, in any case, calls into question the logic of integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, I must mention once again the case of the young Strasbourg man who tricked a company in this city two months ago by sending in two exactly identical CVs, one under a French name and the other under a foreign name. You will remember that the author of these CVs was offered an interview for the French-sounding name but received a rejection for the foreign-sounding name.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also mention the young people who are refused entry to discos solely because they are dark-skinned. It is not difficult to imagine why they then withdraw to their estates and districts where they end up getting together with other socially excluded or ethnic groups in order to have some fun. This discrimination encourages them to withdraw into their identities and further reinforces their marginalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation becomes even more complicated when you then go to speak to these young people about public-spiritedness and citizenship. This is regarded as an insult because they are affected by discrimination in all areas and at all stages of their lives. It is their little brothers and sisters who are refused places in schools. It is they who are refused access to training courses. It is their families who are refused access to housing and healthcare. As a result, it has always been, and still is, very important to offer victims a protective legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Adopting the report and implementing the directive would send a strong political signal. The European Union could show in this way that it is concerned about the millions of people who live within its territory and that it is positively acting to reduce racial tensions. It would also show that it recognises the diversity of its population which is a feature of its identity. This is the political response to be given to the resurgence of the racist and fascist extreme right in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when some rightly have doubts about the Union, it could in this way also show that it is not just a coalition to defend the economic interests of the rich countries but that it is based on values of freedom, tolerance and solidarity. For all these reasons we must vote for this report.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the report and the directive have their limitations and will not solve all the problems. Most countries already have legislation against racism and discrimination, including in some of their constitutions. Yet discriminatory practices are continuing. Clearly, what is often lacking is a real political will to effectively apply these texts.</p>
<p class="contents">In France last year there were only 14 complaints and convictions for acts of discrimination. No one is fooled by this small number of complaints, particularly not the human rights associations which are being overwhelmed by thousands of calls. Most of the time complaints are filed without being followed up by the police. They are not investigated by the public prosecutors who consider that there are more important cases to be tried. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than improving the lot and the daily life of individual human beings. Increasing the power of the associations, as quite rightly recommended by Mrs Buitenweg’s report, is positive, but governments must not be allowed to offload their responsibilities onto these associations. Ensuring equal rights is a state responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The associations are currently leading the fight against discrimination. They frequently have to take down the complaints, find a lawyer, obtain sufficient legal aid and sometimes chase up court officials themselves to get this discrimination recorded. Mrs Buitenweg’s report recommends giving financial resources to the associations but I find it hard to believe that governments will do this when, at the same time, the economic criteria of the Stability Pact require Member States to reduce their budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither would I want the payment of a few subsidies to these associations to be used as a pretext for justifying a reduction in the number of police officers or court officials who must now be trained.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, another problem still remains which is the differing application of the nationality code. Currently, a young person born in a Member State of foreign parents is faced with two different situations. If born in France, this young person benefits from the nationality code and may be protected by the law if refused access to a job due to discrimination. On the other hand, many second- or third-generation youngsters, born in countries such as Germany or Austria where nationality is conferred by descent, will always remain foreigners and will not benefit from any legal protection. I know this was not the subject of Mrs Buitenweg’s report but I must highlight this as it is regrettable that, in identical situations, such different treatment can exist in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Commission should ask the Council about this issue so that greater coherence can be achieved in all legislation. That apart, I congratulate Mrs Buitenweg and warmly welcome this report.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Callanan (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, in mediaeval times groups of thugs and hooligans would pick on elderly women and accuse them of witchcraft. They would throw them into the village pond. If the poor souls drowned, they were shown to be innocent; if they survived, it proved their guilt and they were then burned at the stake. Either way, the result is the same.</p>
<p class="contents">We had a similar example in 20th century China during the Cultural Revolution. Red Guards would accuse intellectuals of bourgeois thinking. If they confessed, they were guilty – but, of course, redeemable – but if they denied the charge, they were condemned out of their own mouths because they failed to recognise their guilt. In both of those cases, we see the danger of placing the burden of proof on the accused. Our justice systems have always rightly placed the burden of proof on the accuser, not on the defendant. They have always assumed that a person is innocent until proven guilty.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in 21st century Europe, we are proposing to abandon this fundamental principle of justice and instead to adopt the approach of the mediaeval witch-finders and the Chinese Red Guards. We propose to put the burden of proof on the defendant, and we even have amendments that would further pass the benefit of doubt to the accuser and not to the accused.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the issue of malicious allegations – in which, sadly, we have seen a huge increase – putting a lot of employers to great expense and to great cost. My own party was accused by a lot of left-wingers of racism because it spoke out on the issue of asylum-seekers in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the case of employers, even if an employer manages to mount a successful defence to these unjustified cases, the time and anxiety of a tribunal or a court hearing will be a huge imposition. Given the bias of this legislation in favour of the accuser and the prevailing climate of political correctness that we seem to be obsessed with, even many innocent employers will frequently lose their cases, incurring penalties, as well as court costs and lost time.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation, I am sorry to say, is an invitation to trouble makers and those with chips on their shoulders to bring frivolous and vexatious complaints, or possibly to use even the threat of a complaint to secure financial compensation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, another danger, and that is that employers, aware of the risk of complaints from unsuccessful ethnic minority candidates, may even avoid putting them on short lists altogether, which would be a terrible disaster and completely against the spirit of the legislation. As so often in this House, we have failed to think through the possible unintended consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation is unnecessary at a European level. Most Member States already have their own anti-discrimination measures designed to suit their own culture and their own circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I am proud to say that I am opposed to discrimination and racism in all its forms, but this irrational and unjust legislation will bring Europe further into disrepute among many of my constituents. I am pleased to say that the rest of my delegation will be joining me in opposing it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ford (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I wish to make three points. Firstly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, the draftspeople and the Commission – in particular Commissioner Diamantopoulou – on the directive and the report we have in front of us.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a long time coming. I was the chairman of the European Parliament’s Committee of Inquiry into the growth of racism and fascism in Europe back in 1986, when our rapporteur, Mr Evregenis, proposed such legislation. I myself was the rapporteur for the Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Xenophobia in 1990 that reiterated that demand.</p>
<p class="contents">I suppose in a way it was worth waiting. We have here legislation that will make a real impact on the lives of the 12 to 14 million third country nationals living in the European Union and the 4 million black Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and without subtracting an iota from my support for the report and the directive as a whole, the Council will have to resolve a number of outstanding issues: on representative actions, on the definition of indirect discrimination and, as the previous speaker said, on the burden of proof.</p>
<p class="contents">The last of these must be workable, because otherwise we will keep the previous speaker happy! The best basis is the existing burden-of-proof legislation, which is now underpinned by 25 years of case-law, and where the numbers are not available, expert opinion will suffice.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, I wish to warn my colleagues in the PPE Group. Many of them – the large majority I believe – have been genuinely concerned that Parliament’s procedures have not given them adequate time to consider the detail. Yet a few clearly have darker motives. With Mr Haider and Mr Le Pen lurking in the background, the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento Sociale Fiamma Tricolore promoting racism and xenophobia, the PPE Group, as a whole, should not be surprised if people conclude that if they continue with their technical objections, then this is a thinly disguised attempt to block these proposals which the vast majority of Europe so much welcomes. Those who lie down with dogs get fleas.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The <span class="italic">International Herald Tribune</span> says that we shall not succeed in obtaining that level of immigration and recruitment. On other continents, there is an awareness of how racism is growing in Europe, and it is precisely because of racism that immigrants are choosing other continents, notably America, instead of Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">We are used to coming out against racism, because we want to combat intolerance and xenophobia. Perhaps we must also combat these things for the sake of our own future. Those who maintain that they speak for enterprise and for small businesses are speaking against their own better judgement when they do not support the present proposed directive. </p>
<p class="contents">I support most of the amendments, but on one point I am uneasy. This is Amendment No 29 in which it is proposed that a difference of treatment on the basis of ethnic origin, which is presented as a difference of treatment on the grounds of religion, conviction or nationality, is to be deemed discrimination. I am afraid that this may be self-defeating. In Swedish law on measures to combat ethnic discrimination, it is expressly stated that, in using the term ethnic affiliation, the law means that someone belongs to a group of persons of the same race, skin colour, national or ethnic origin or confession. There is a danger that what we believe to be an extension of the definition concerned may, in actual fact, be a restriction of it. The general interpretation is, in fact, that ethnic affiliation embraces nationality. I shall not, therefore, be voting for the present amendment. It contradicts what I properly consider to be the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As others have said, this is an aspirational directive about the sort of Europe we want to create. It is directly relevant, for once, to the lives of many people living within the European Union. From my constituency of London where a large portion of the population come from minority ethnic groups and where there is a growing number of children of mixed-race relationships, this is an exceedingly important directive. It is even more important for those areas where people wrongly feel that there is no need for anti-racist or anti-discrimination legislation, because there are no visibly non-white people, but yet they will still vote for parties which espouse racist or anti-asylum seeker policies, because they are afraid of the unknown and the different.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the directive. I am pleased Council feels a sense of urgency about it. I assume this will be reflected in their willingness to take on board what Parliament is saying. We have to acknowledge that in this House we regularly call upon other countries and governments to recognise the rights of ethnic minorities and to practice policies of universal human rights. We have to demand the highest standards of ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">It will not be easy to implement this directive and I am not referring to the votes. It requires us to call into question the workings of all our institutions, including longstanding well-respected ones, and our own practices. That will not be easy or painless. In the UK we are gradually admitting to the institutional racism we practice and starting to examine the core values of our institutions. That cannot be done unless the individuals within them examine their own beliefs and actions. That is why the amendments about training, monitoring and implementation are so important in this directive.</p>

We have paid very great attention to the social dialogue, which means talking with each other, examining problems and understanding each other. Social partnership is an ideal model centred on partners who interact with each other and help each other. We should also all be concerned about integration, about good neighbourliness. We should endeavour to provide incentives and to act as a model. I believe that in human society acting as a model is a particularly important characteristic.</p>
<p class="contents">Particularly as an Austrian, I can say that in recent years, with a population of 7 million, we have accepted a million refugees. We are therefore the European country that has accepted most refugees per inhabitant. We were a kind of life-raft in Europe, and we still are today. We fight against extremism on both the left and the right, as well as against violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Austria has the world’s strictest laws against fascism and against nazism. We have learnt some lessons from history and we know how to fight these things.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now talking about discrimination. First and foremost, I am speaking on behalf of small- and medium-sized enterprises. We must make sure that we do not rob companies of working time and jeopardise their success by forcing them to spend more time on statistical form filling. When I visit companies I often hear the complaint that there is too much bureaucracy and too many formalities. Form filling is, of course, a very inefficient kind of work. If, in addition, there are inspections, this also takes time and I believe that the vast majority of companies behave in a proper and decent way, and that relations between employers and employees are generally very good.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I also believe that cancelling public contracts can also be provocative, and I am returning to the key issue now: reversing the burden of proof will have a knock-on effect if it is implemented. It will encourage abuse. People will need to protect themselves against such abuse. It will be necessary to keep more evidence. It will lead to risk limitation, by which I mean surveillance methods, video recordings and tape transcripts. Everyone will try to protect themselves as well as possible so that if they are taken to court they can provide evidence. I can see great dangers here and we must ensure that they are averted.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was going to make a speech of the normal variety, but having heard some of the responses across the House, I want to change what I was going to say, which is more in sorrow than in anger.</p>
<p class="contents">This House should recognise and change its tone on what it sees as Article 13. Of all the speakers, Mrs Diamantopoulou made the very effective point that words can be cheap in the question of anti-racism. Posturing is easy. Motivations are many and varied. My friend, Mr Sylla, and I are concerned about two important things. One is that we create a level playing field through Article 13. The burden of proof, the ability for organisations to take cases on behalf of individuals who have been harassed or discriminated against – all of these laws do not create an advantage for the majority of society. They create the opportunity for people of talent and ability to release their talents and abilities to enrich what we have in Europe to create wealth, to create the culture and diversity of Europe, not to suffer disadvantage for small- and medium-sized enterprises or anyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">We must start talking positively about these proposals mainly because the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency, many who have created this report, many of my colleagues who have worked hard on their opinions, have responded in the way that we have because we understand that this legislation is not about victims, it is about enriching EU countries. Many of those EU countries represented in this House do not pick and choose which race-relation legislation they have – they have none, many of them. We have some – we can improve ours. It is now an opportunity, a symbolic opportunity and an important practical opportunity for this House to make an historic judgement, to vote in full during a presidency which has helped us bring forward a law which I believe will enrich this House and that we, in time, will be very proud of.</p>

So do I, for I applaud the fact that the Commission has been so quick in getting this proposal on the table and implementing Article 13. I would also congratulate the rapporteur on a splendid piece of work. I am, of course, very much in favour of our arranging for the present directive to be implemented in the Member States as quickly as possible. I would especially emphasise four factors which I think are particularly interesting about this directive. Firstly, we have obtained a broad scope of application and, secondly, the directive covers both direct and indirect discrimination, including malice. At the same time, a shared burden of proof has been proposed. We have seen how this is an enormous advantage in connection with sex discrimination, and it is therefore good that it is now being introduced in this area. Finally, it is also an advantage that this is a minimum directive, so that the Member States have the opportunity to go still further if they consider it right to do so. However, the proposal also suffers, unfortunately, from a fundamental flaw in as much as it relates only to discrimination arising on the grounds of race and ethnic origin and does not cover the other grounds for discrimination listed in Article 13. In this way, the Commission is going to create a hierarchy of grounds for discrimination, a way of proceeding which I think is totally at odds with the wording, meaning and spirit of Article 13. It would be interesting if the Commission could explain to us what the motives were for creating this hierarchy of discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is essential that we take advantage of the opportunity that is represented in the Commission's proposals on the whole of Article 13. The time is right to do so. In recent years we have witnessed across Europe a steady rise in racist crime, violence, discrimination and, it pains me to say, ‘political rhetoric’ which plays on racial discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel a heightened sense of urgency as we contemplate and embark upon the enlargement process. That is why this debate is so important because it strikes at the heart of how we define Europe and ourselves as Europeans. We are more than a trading block. We are a group of nations based on a set of values – a set of ideals which must be incorporated and reinforced in all that we do.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this approach will be addressed when we look at the situation effecting all minorities. The price if we do not is a Europe falling far short of its true potential. That is why this directive and the Article 13 package, as a whole, are so significant. They demonstrate that the Member States, Parliament and the Commission are serious about the long-term eradication of discrimination and racism. It is not perfect. It does not fulfil my every ambition, yet it represents a start to a fight against racism in Europe, in our nations, our regions and, more importantly, in our communities.</p>
<p class="contents">One day I hope to be standing in this Chamber debating directives which will aim to eradicate discrimination specifically based on, for example, disability, age and sexual orientation. These current steps must be applauded but there is still a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the spectacle of a white middle-class British male Tory giving a lecture on discrimination and the effects of discrimination would be laughable if it was not so damning and lamentable. <span class="italic">(Applause). </span>Ultimately, discrimination kills and it blights the souls of those who practice it and those who encourage it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should, therefore, adopt this report without further delay. </p>
<p class="contents">This directive forms part of a larger package which implements Article 13 of the EC Treaty. As others have already mentioned, this Article does not only pertain to combating discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin, but also based on other grounds. </p>
<p class="contents">I can understand why the Commission has decided to include the fight against racial discrimination in a separate draft directive. I can also see why we are discussing this document expeditiously now and why, hopefully we shall be adopting it later today. </p>
<p class="contents">Far harder to accept is the fact that this draft directive against racial discrimination applies over a broader social range and, in terms of content, comprises stronger legal guarantees and control mechanisms than the second draft directive which is still in the pipeline and which is designed to fight other types of discrimination. </p>
<p class="contents">Together with the time lapse between the discussion of both draft directives, this difference in content entails the risk that there will be a hierarchy of types of discrimination. This would give out the wrong political message which would, in particular, have an adverse effect on the fight against discrimination on grounds such as age, handicap and sexual orientation. If anything, these so-called more recent factors deserve more, not less, attention. I would therefore like to see the Commission and Council pledge their willingness to eliminate this form of discrimination between grounds for discrimination. </p>
<p class="contents">I have even less appreciation for the fact that there is no mention whatsoever of discrimination on the basis of sex throughout the package which the Commission presented in November, as if the fight against this was done and dusted. It was probably for fear of stating the obvious that no such mention was made. In fact, there was no such risk. Existing European legislation governing the equal treatment of men and women only pertains to the sphere of work and is still lacking in many other areas which, especially if we compare it to the directive which we are discussing today with regard to racial discrimination, need attention as a matter of urgency. There is not enough time to list them all here, but I do not have the impression that a lack of knowledge on the part of the Commission concerning this matter is the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the Commissioner will pledge that she will start this exercise within the foreseeable future and will present proposals soon, as a result of which the equal treatment of the sexes in and out of the work sphere, but especially outside the work sphere, will be aligned to the directive which we are discussing, and will hopefully be adopting, here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I do not believe extending EU competence to this area is either necessary or useful to its cause. New laws will not change the hearts and minds of the people of Europe. What we need is education, time and confidence building in a spirit of cooperation between the various ethnic communities. We have in our own group two ethnic Members of the Conservative delegation who are extremely active and proud to be British Conservatives, in spite of what the other groups were saying earlier, and they will be voting against these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The shift of the burden of proof, as called for by this draft directive, is both frightening and extreme. Already in the UK, Mr Straw is planning that in rape cases the accused man will become guilty until proven innocent, on the basis of the testimony of one person – the woman in question. This is a very dangerous precedent against all forms of natural justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we all condemn violent racist crimes and attacks. I was not present, but I believe a number of allegations were made and cases cited by other groups earlier in the debate. Criminal justice must remain the prerogative of the Member States. Unlike previous speakers who have cited such cases, I oppose any erosion of national sovereignty in the area of criminal justice. This must remain the prerogative of the Member States who will retain control of their own justice systems. The EU has no competence in this area whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">The more the word ‘racist’ is bandied about, the more it will become meaningless, devalued and ignored by the public at large. I call on all those with any sense to oppose these measures.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
