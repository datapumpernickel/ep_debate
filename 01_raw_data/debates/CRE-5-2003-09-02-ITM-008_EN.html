<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span><span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Greenland is an autonomous region of Denmark. It was part of the Community between 1973 and 1984. In 1984 a referendum was held in Greenland and 52% of its inhabitants expressed their wish to withdraw from the Union. Thereafter, relations with Greenland have been governed by the Greenland Treaty. This treaty accords Greenland a similar status to that enjoyed by 19 other territories, namely Overseas Country and Territory status. As a result fisheries products from Greenland may be exported freely to the Community in return for a favourable fisheries agreement. The latter was originally intended to last 10 years but has been extended several times.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2002 fourth protocol provided for the mid-term review currently under way. The review is justified because of the lengthy period of time involved and the significant sums at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope of the communication from the Commission extends beyond matters relating exclusively to fisheries. This is because relations with Greenland involve many other issues. The Committee on Fisheries therefore believes Parliament must take the initiative and draft a general report dealing with political relations, development aid to Greenland and fisheries relations. The report should be set in the broader context of the Arctic dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">(Madam President, I must point out that I am unable to see on the screen an indication of the number of minutes elapsed since I took the floor. I would like to know how much time I still have available.)</p>
<p class="contents">As I was saying, in addition to dealing with relations between Greenland and the Union, the communication from the Commission contains a review of the current state of the agreement. Any amendment would have to be approved by the competent local authorities in Greenland. Consequently a thorough review is suggested, but only after 2006 when the agreement expires. A mere adjustment is proposed for the intervening period.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it is important to bear in mind criticisms made in the House and by the Court of Auditors. We therefore believe that even in the case of minor adjustments, the principles of good governance, transparency and optimal use of Community financial resources should be applied here and now. There is no need to wait until 2006 to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions reached by my colleague Mrs Langenhagen on the fourth protocol two years ago are still perfectly valid, as far as the mid-term review stage is concerned. There is a need to take issues other than fisheries out of the agreement. It is also necessary to keep the European Parliament informed on the use of fishing rights and to promote the establishment of joint venture companies. In addition to promoting joint venture companies, the Committee on Fisheries is now calling for the promotion of temporary relationships between undertakings. Such arrangements are more flexible. In this case they are better suited also to the current situation of both the European Community’s fisheries sector, and the fisheries sector in Greenland. The Committee on Fisheries is also calling for the cost of the agreement to be shared fairly, as is the case for agreements for the southern regions where the cost is divided equitably between the shipowners and the Community budget. I note, Commissioner, that the Commission has not even suggested this for the current adjustment. Further, the reason adduced does not seem to me to be particularly convincing. The reference to the small size of the administration in Greenland does not really provide adequate justification.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union pays Greenland a substantial sum each year in return for this agreement. The amount involved is EUR 42.82 million per year. This makes it the second most expensive agreement of all, after that with Mauritania. The price is actually exorbitant if it is also taken into account that at least EUR 14 million is not linked in any way to payment for fishing opportunities or the development of the fisheries sector. The fishing opportunities relating to the remaining EUR 28 million have a very low take up. Only the German, Danish, British and French fleets have quotas. No other fleets are allowed to make use of fishing opportunities paid for but not fished. This is certainly not the case under the southern agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischler, we are delighted that this taboo was broken in the agreement reached between the Commission and the Government of Greenland in June. We welcome the fact that other fleets will be allowed access to fish for certain species and for experimental fishing activities, even if access is restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">There is actually no provision for the promotion of joint venture companies or of temporary relationships between undertakings. Arrangements of this nature could prove very beneficial for Greenland, given that its economy is stagnating. They could also be beneficial to the Community. EUR 6 million was set aside for this purpose under the previous agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth comment is that the agreement includes quotas for species such as cod and Norway haddock that are almost non-existent in Greenland waters. The Community pays for these although nothing is caught.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that the negotiators agreed on more realistic quotas in June. This means there will be increased opportunities for catching halibut, shrimps and queen crab. We are glad the negotiators made an effort to do away with the so-called paper fish.</p>
<p class="contents">My sixth comment is that the Community’s financial contribution has increased for each successive protocol. At the same time, the fishing opportunities have decreased. Viewed in this light, the agreement is not sustainable. Further, the protocol is inconsistent, as Mrs Langenhagen stated at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission is certainly to be congratulated on reconsidering the current arrangements with Greenland. It is encouraging that sensible steps have been taken. I mentioned some of them. They are part of the agreement reached with Greenland in June. Nonetheless, we believe that the Commission should be more ambitious and strive to introduce radical changes as of now.</p>
<p class="contents">I assume the hope is that this fisheries agreement will cease to violate the principles we hold most dear. I refer to the principles underpinning Community financial provisions, namely transparency and optimal use of financial resources. More than a simple cosmetic review is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">There is every reason why the European Union should support Greenland. A fisheries agreement is not the best way for the Union to do so, however. I made this clear to the Fisheries Minister for Greenland at our meeting here in Strasbourg last July. Greenland is the key to the development of the Union’s Arctic dimension. It would therefore be appropriate to consider financing areas of that relationship other than fishing with recourse to heading 4 of the financial perspective. Another option would be to finance them through the European Development Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, Parliament is basing its position on this report by the Committee on Fisheries. The House trusts that the Commission and the Council will take its position into account as of now. That would be the ideal. If this is not possible, our position should be borne in mind when preparing for negotiations on a new agreement in 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, let me start by thanking Mrs Miguélez Ramos for her report on our communication on the subject of the mid-term review – and I emphasise mid-term review – of the fourth fisheries protocol between the European Union and Greenland. I am glad, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, that you endorse the Commission communication. It was on 30 June 2003 that the Commission and Greenland completed the mid-term review, which is provided for in Article 14 of the protocol. The fourth protocol was signed yesterday, and it is hoped that all parties will ratify it. It provides answers and solutions to the concerns expressed in our communication and in your report.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me set out just a few of the new elements in it. There have, firstly, been substantial corrections to the quotas, in order to adjust catch possibilities in line with the scientific evidence. There is no quota for cod, for Atlantic redfish in the western waters, or for blue whiting, in order to do justice to the EU’s fishing capacity. There are, therefore, no more paper-fish.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and in view of certain catch possibilities not having been used to date, we have now introduced the standard transfer clause, whereby we can transfer unused catch possibilities to other Member States not in possession of a quota. The agreement with Greenland is thereby brought into line with other agreements with third countries making provision for financial compensation. In July of this year, for the first time in the history of this agreement, unused quotas were transferred to other Member States that did not have them.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, your report calls for the introduction of licence fees. That will be happening with effect from 1 January 2004 as an equalisation of burdens between the Community and the shipowners. That, too, brings this agreement into line with those with other third countries and also makes it possible for us to monitor the fishing effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we have responded to the lack of transparency by introducing a budget support programme, and Greenland’s regional government has consequently committed itself to a structural reform of its fisheries policy, aiming at greater privatisation and a reduction in subsidies. Greenland has also undertaken to substantially replenish the budget of the Greenland Institute for Natural Resources, which should make it possible to expand the scientific capacity of that Institute.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are also promoting exploratory fishing and extending it to include cephalopods and mussels. Success in this area will make it possible to make Greenland’s fisheries more diverse and include new species in the next agreement with the country. These changes have been made in dialogue with the authorities in Greenland and in accordance with the principles of the new partnership and fisheries agreement. I believe that they make the agreement with Greenland more balanced and more transparent, as the financial compensation now corresponds to the catch possibilities actually used, and as reform of Greenland’s fisheries policies is supported. Although, as I have said, this is only a mid-term review, the more extensive relations with Greenland post-2006 were dependent on this revision being carried out. Our communication, and the endorsement given by your report, have made it possible for us to revise the fourth protocol in such a way as to remove all obstacles to a deepening of our relationship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also like to welcome the fact that the Committee on Fisheries has adopted the main amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets. In this connection, it is worth emphasising that the fisheries agreement with Greenland comes second in order of importance for the Union in terms of what it costs the Community’s budget. Mrs Miguélez Ramos has already pointed this out. It represents an annual commitment of EUR 42.8 million.</p>
<p class="contents">As was explained earlier, however, this sum does not accurately reflect genuine fishing opportunities for the Community fleet. This is because in the agreement itself, the fishing quota estimated by the Commission is valued at EUR 28 million. Indeed even that sum is too high if it is set against actual catch.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets recognises the special relationship between Greenland and the European Union. The committee is also aware of the specific economic situation in that country. Fishing remains crucial to the economy of Greenland. Nonetheless, although the committee recognises the need to provide financial support for Greenland, it is opposed to the current approach of including such aid in the financial compensation that is part of the Fisheries Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Committee on Budgets believes it is essential for the Commission to table a proposal for a new protocol before the present one expires in December 2006. The financial compensation in any new protocol should be in line with actual fishing opportunities. A different proposal on financial aid to Greenland should be tabled concurrently.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, the committee is pleased to note that the Commission presented a mid-term review of the current protocol. This is in line with the European Parliament’s call for general assessment reports to be presented before the start of negotiations on renewal of protocols or agreements or indeed on new arrangements. These general reports should contain cost benefit analyses.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge the Commission to present similar mid-term reviews for all agreements exceeding annual costs of EUR 3 million for the European Union’s budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is my belief that we are now very, very close to a very, very good solution, and it is not all that often, in the area of fisheries, that we can speak in terms of an historic moment, as Commissioner Fischler has just done, but, for the first time since the fisheries agreement with Greenland was concluded in 1985, unused catch quotas have been transferred. As we have just heard, this happened a few weeks ago and explicitly refers to 2003; I am talking about 2003! One of the core demands formulated in Mrs Miguélez Ramos’ report has thus been met.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure, however, that this is where the Commission would like someone to stand up for them, and that I am willing to do. We are told that they had earlier not proposed a transfer. That is indeed so, but the implementation of such a measure is quite simply not in their capacities. The authority to do so resides simply and solely with the quota holder, and there is no transfer if they do not want there to be one. This transfer of quotas on a voluntary basis, now approved for the first time, is an impressive demonstration of my country’s willingness to resolve the issue of quotas that have not been fully used up, and to do so finally, but in a spirit of partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to what I have often heard said in recent months, Germany has not been engaged in egocentrically stonewalling European policy on these matters; on the contrary, we are backing the European Community. Let me point out, though, that this regulation will not work without effort. I warn against interfering with the principles of European fisheries policy. This rapprochement must not be allowed to erode the principle of relative stability. I believe that we should have further serious discussions about this. So let me repeat that today’s arrangement applies to 2003 and constitutes no kind of guarantee to other Member States that they will receive quotas that were – to take an example – formerly Germany’s, as Germany will in future be backing a fleet that will fish around Greenland. I would like to follow this positive aspect by mentioning another weak point. What we are dealing with here is what we term the mid-term review of the protocol, as agreed in the protocol itself. Having been a rapporteur on the subject, I still remember it very well. I wonder, though, what effect Parliament’s present opinion will have in future, as we know that amendments were agreed on as long ago as the end of June. Have we been asked about them? Will we, in future, be allowed only to nod them through as we did in the past, or will we be permitted to express appropriate outrage? I am thinking not least of the effects of the fisheries agreement on the Budget, about which we have just again heard, when I emphatically demand – not only here and now, but also tomorrow – that Parliament be involved in the negotiating process. We will end up having to amend the relevant treaties if that is to happen. As a matter of principle, I regard anything else as an excuse! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also think it is important to recall the reasons why Greenland chose to leave. It left the Union because we wanted forcefully to remove this small and extremely remote community’s inalienable right to fish within the two hundred miles of its exclusive economic zone, which are today clearly protected under International Maritime law.</p>
<p class="contents">This is perhaps the greatest mistake the European Union has made to date; it has already caused us serious problems in the past and still poses a threat for the future. In small areas criss-crossed by national borders, such as the North Sea, having the European institutions jointly organise fishing for highly migratory surface fish species has been the right approach. Moving from specific cases and solutions to common ownership of fishing resources under a supposed Community law is, however, no longer acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The same set of articles in International Maritime Law that defines the ownership of marine biological resources also defines the ownership of mineral resources, specifically fossil fuels. The same European Community that sanctioned the application of these articles to delimit the ownership of underwater fossil fuel mines in the North Sea by various Member States claims that they do not apply to biological resources. In other words, we would have a law that can only be used for protecting the interests of the States at the centre of Europe, where gas and oil is found, but which does not apply to protecting the interests of Europe’s peripheral States or outermost regions, which contain enormous maritime areas with substantial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In the ten-year period that we feel must now be started in order to ensure that the European institutions discuss the status of the ‘Western waters’, a thorough review must be conducted of the issue of access to waters, European legislation must be adapted to the broad principles of International Maritime Law and the best ways of safeguarding sustainable fisheries in the Atlantic must be studied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor shall I conceal the fact that, for me as a Danish parliamentarian, Greenland and the fisheries protocol with Greenland are of quite special importance.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the fourth fisheries protocol with Greenland, and one which is of great value to both parties. The financial compensation amounts to EUR 900 per capita in Greenland and gives the EU access to Greenland fisheries products, which constitute more than 90% of Greenland’s total exports. The fisheries agreement with Greenland also makes it possible for fishing rights to be exchanged with Iceland, Norway and the Faeroe Islands, something that maintains an overall balance in the north-east Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth protocol contains clear improvements on previous protocols in the shape of increased transparency, so that the Community’s quotas now correspond to the real fishing possibilities in Greenland’s waters, and the EU has, moreover, a continued option on the quantities laid down in the third protocol in the event of the stocks improving.</p>
<p class="contents">There is good cause for acknowledging your contribution, Commissioner Fischler, to what you called ‘the historic agreement’. The fourth protocol proposes that, upon expiry of the protocol, under-utilised fishing possibilities might be used up by countries other than those that derive direct benefit from the agreement in accordance with the principle of relative stability.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the EU’s fisheries agreements with third countries are now a significant part of the common fisheries policy. The general expansion of the coastal states’ fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the seventies meant that 95% of fishing stocks and 35% of the sea was subject to the coastal state legislation. Traditional fishing grounds were lost, and a need was created for cooperation with third countries in order to ensure the continued survival of the Community’s fishing fleets with a view to preserving the Community’s share of world catches and securing continued supplies of fish to the EU’s markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The fisheries agreement with Greenland came into force in 1995 in connection with Greenland’s withdrawal from the EU as a result of the self-government agreement with Denmark. Unfortunately, the Commission neglected to inform the European Parliament of experimental fisheries and of the creation of joint ventures. Joint ventures are, in particular, something I expect a lot of, and I shall propose that we in the Committee on Fisheries initiate a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p class="contents">I am able, in the end, to support Mrs Miguélez Ramos's report, and I should like to commend the work she has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, the establishment of a relationship between financial compensation for fishing rights and payment for development is an improvement in the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's press release in June it noted that these two aspects have been separated. As a result, it should now be possible to identify clearly what has been paid for. It should also allow for greater transparency and accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">While this is very welcome, it does not give much detail. I would like the Commission to give us more details as to what is going to be funded by the development fund and how it is going to be managed.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst this is a welcome change in the way in which the Commission looks at fisheries agreements, it should take the same approach with the ACP agreements. The Commission says that this is too difficult for all sorts of reasons, though it was one of the focal points in the recent partnership agreement discussion paper which the Commission produced. We want to see this approach taken in the ACP agreements as well. This kind of approach, separating development from what is actually being paid for the fishing rights is extremely important, as has been mentioned by other speakers. If it is possible for Greenland, then it should also be possible for the ACP countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am going to refer essentially to the issue of Greenland, because I believe it to be important. We are seeing great unanimity here on the part of all Members and this seems to me to be very positive and very important. We are in a good frame of mind! Commissioner, I would like to congratulate you on your speech and the communication that has been made. Parliament and the Commission are in agreement, which is very important and, with a view to the new Protocol which is going to be signed from 1 January of next year, I believe there is agreement already between the Member States themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will allow me to say this, I believe the Commission has backed down, or if I may put it another way, the wise are ready to rectify. As far as I remember, we in this Parliament have been calling for greater equity, greater transparency and greater justice in this agreement compared to the agreements in the south since 1994 and now this is beginning to be acknowledged.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate the new Director-General for Fisheries, Mr Holmquist, and the Director for Foreign Policy, because I know that they have made extraordinary efforts to make progress on the new line which Parliament is presenting at the moment and which – we all agree – is the line we must use for the agreement with Greenland.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous one, as has been said several times, was a scandal, and this is how the Court of Auditors saw it, as did this Parliament, because there were paper fish, there was wastage of quotas, which were not used by the States who could do so, as happens with the agreements in the south, and also there was non-payment of licences by ship owners. Now this is being unified with the criteria of the agreements in the south and I believe that this is a truly positive step.</p>
<p class="contents">There is agreement in the Commission, there is agreement in the Council, as I understand it, and there will also be agreement in this Parliament. Moreover, this is something we should all be pleased about for the sake of the interests of the European Union and all its Member States, naturally, and also in the interests of Greenland. We are moving in the direction of mutual interest, and that is what is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Experimental campaigns have been authorised since July, for new species, and there are possibilities for diversifying fisheries in Greenland, which is positive – I was in Greenland when I was chairman of the committee – and I know that there are other scientific possibilities and they must therefore be exploited.</p>
<p class="contents">I would draw your attention to mixed undertakings – I believe this is very important – and to temporary associations of undertakings. The fishermen of Greenland themselves had asked me personally to help them achieve mixed undertakings, and therefore the issue is of interest to them, and I believe that by diversifying fishing opportunities in Greenland and by making it possible to use all the fisheries quotas, we will have done something very positive, as I have said, so that we can all be happy with the new Protocol which is going to be signed now from January and also in 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the draft constitution now before us, which will be going to the Intergovernmental Conference, there is not. In the third part of the common policies, in the section dealing with agriculture and fisheries, fish are called agricultural products, and no reference at all is made to the CFP. In a discussion of the Union’s seas and maritime resources, this is as surprising as it is Kafkaesque. It says nothing about the CFP, nothing about ensuring equal rights for all countries and fleets whilst, of course, preserving fish stocks for our children and grandchildren.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, amongst others, I support the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos on the mid-term review of the 4th Fisheries Protocol with Greenland. I support the report precisely because it represents a step in the right direction, calling for the fishing countries, fleets and companies unfairly excluded both by the incorrect application of the principle of relative stability, and by the current protocol to be given the opportunity of fishing in Greenland’s waters.</p>

She has highlighted some vitally important issues, not least the discrepancy between what we pay to Greenland every year – EUR 42.8 million – and what we get in return – fishing rights worth EUR 28 million. I am glad that Commissioner Fischler has pointed out that the protocol signed yesterday goes some way towards adjusting this matter that the auditors have criticised in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth remembering, as Mr Casaca said, that these were the terms of an agreement drawn up at the time Greenland left the European Community. A substantial part of this compensation package is to support the Greenland economy and the desperately poor Inuit population of Greenland. I know this is a fact that Mrs Langenhagen is an expert on and has asked Parliament to deal with sympathetically in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I support the rapporteur when she insists that those non-fisheries-related aspects of relations between the EU and Greenland have to be financed under heading 4 of the financial perspective or through the European Development Fund. The fisheries budget must only be used for fisheries purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I wish to sound a note of caution on that aspect of the report which calls for a share-out of under-utilised fishing rights. Commissioner Fischler drew attention to this in his statement, and the protocol signed yesterday appears now to be able to allocate these under-used fishing rights to other Member States. I would urge the Commissioner in this respect to remember the beleaguered whitefish fleet around the North Sea, particularly that of the UK, which is now tied up for half of every month with the quotas slashed by 50%. If there is to be a handout of under-utilised rights or joint-venture partnerships, please ensure that the whitefish fleet in the North Sea comes at the top of the queue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that with this Commission statement, together with this declaration of intent, if it is put into practice – and we all hope that it is – we will finally put an end to the somewhat bizarre situation in which we have been operating until now. First of all, as has already been said, we have been paying out compensation under the common fisheries policy that is worth almost twice the real value of catches – and this is no small matter; we are in fact talking about a straightforward doubling of the figure, which amounts to a tidy sum. Secondly, we are finally seeing budgetary transparency, something that was previously lacking, as pointed out recently by the Court of Auditors. Furthermore, there has been discrimination as regards access to resources in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would recall the specific case of my own country, which has historically always fished in these waters but which, after joining the European Union, because it had no agreement with Denmark, lost those historical rights. We have a great deal of respect for the principle of relative stability but we feel that there must be flexibility so that quotas that go unused in any given year are taken over by those that can actually use them, without this, of course, preventing us from continuing to seek to divide up these quotas equitably, and consequently ensure relative stability. This is why the Commission’s document represents a step in the right direction and I hope that it is put into practice, together with the appropriate legislative measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all we have to isolate the fact that European taxpayers' money has to be spent with transparency – and at the moment it is not. Clearly we are overpaying for the fishing rights and we should pay for the amount of fish that is caught by European fishermen, but if we wish to pay for Greenland development aid then let us pay for it separately. I am not against it but it cannot be paid for with paper fish through a fisheries agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very surprised at the Commission's attitude to the idea that we should now open up the number of species that can be caught in and around Greenland. Anyone would think that the common fisheries policy has been a great success, when in fact we see fish stocks in European waters as a whole declining more and more. The idea now is to open up more quotas for more species. I have often said in this Chamber that fish unfortunately do not swim separately and very often, when one species of fish is caught, others also swim into the nets. If the fishermen do not have quotas, these fish are discarded. We all know that a disgraceful amount of fish is discarded in the European Union every year.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to review the whole idea of having third country agreements. Very often it leads to the European Union exploiting third countries' waters and means that fishermen in these third countries are driven out of business and the whole thing is being brought into disrepute. Often the money which the EU spends does not reach the fishermen or the countries for which it is intended. It very often ends up in the wrong place. We should review the whole situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also want to thank the Commissioner for having tidied the whole matter up and made what was certainly an unacceptable situation a bit more acceptable in these renegotiations. I should like to refer to what my friend Mr Casaca said about the appropriation by the European Union of the fish of Greenland. That also applies to the Azores, I am sure, and to Ireland, though the Azores' waters are not so rich.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is something different. At the time they joined the European Union there was only a six-mile limit in existence. It was subsequently that the European Union extended it to 200 miles. Then the fishermen of Greenland, Ireland and perhaps the Azores as well, began to see what might have been. I agree – and have frequently repeated – that in order to have a common agricultural policy it was not necessary to take fish into common ownership. We could have had a decent common fisheries policy without taking fish into common ownership. We got the worst of all worlds, in that the Union owned the fish, but the national governments had the job of policing them. That is where a very bad job was done. That is why the stocks are run down. What was everybody's business was nobody's business. It was not the common fisheries policy in itself that destroyed the stocks, it was the lack of the necessary supervision. If the Union had had the job of policing the catching of fish, we might have had some success.</p>
<p class="contents">Greenland withdrew from the Union. It was not exactly as Mr Casaca said, but it withdrew after the 200-mile limit was extended. It should have stood its ground and maintained solidarity. It would have benefited from the structural funds, amongst other things. At the very best, structural funds have only given EUR 300 per capita to any state in this Union – that was in Ireland. The Portuguese, Greeks and southern Italians got a lot less than that. However, according to Mr Busk's calculation, the people of Greenland are receiving EUR 900 per capita per annum. That is too generous. I believe we have mixed up our foreign policy with our fisheries policy. We have given Greenland a deal that it had no right to expect, seeing that it voluntarily walked away and did not accept in good faith that it would have been fairly treated within the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
