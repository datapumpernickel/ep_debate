<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berenguer Fuster (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, about two years ago a conference was held in Brussels to mark the tenth anniversary of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 on the control of concentrations between undertakings. During the conference, all the speakers spoke unanimously in favour of the virtues of this Regulation, which is somewhat unusual for expert opinions. I agree with these opinions and with this positive assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">In putting forward the proposal to amend the Regulation, however, there is one opinion that must be pointed out from the start. The positive assessment of the Regulation does not prevent suggestions being made with regard to partially reforming it or adapting it to the requirements brought to light by experience, but, in any case, these reforms will be limited.</p>
<p class="contents">The text of Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 itself stipulates that certain aspects should be reviewed ten years after its entry into force. Now that this period is over, the Commission has issued a Green Paper suggesting that not only the points laid down in the Regulation, but also those allowing the text to be updated, should be analysed. This is a very positive initiative on which the Commission should be congratulated.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the most important points of this Green Paper concern the definition of the thresholds at which concentrations are considered to have a Community dimension and, secondly, the hypotheses whereby a concentration notified to the Commission could be referred to the national authority or authorities for analysis and a decision and, vice versa, whereby a concentration notified to the national authorities could also be referred to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first of these sections, the Commission suggests that the concentration should have a Community dimension if it needs to be notified in three or more countries, thus eliminating the complicated procedural rules contained in section 1 of Article 3 of the Regulation. Certain national competition authorities have protested against the amendment of this section, or its replacement by criteria other than those of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot agree with these objections. The rule on the automatic assigning of competences proposed by the Commission allows for greater clarity and simplicity, promotes uniform assessment criteria, increases legal certainty and saves companies money. We therefore support it wholeheartedly.</p>
<p class="contents">The second of these sections, regarding the referral of cases, is more complex, and the European Parliament and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have therefore made some suggestions. The first concerns the suitability of parties consenting to the referral of the case by the European Commission to one or more national authorities. If joint handling is considered more effective and saves companies money, it appears that, under the referral process, companies cannot be obliged to submit different cases against their will.</p>
<p class="contents">In another section, the European Parliament warns the Commission of the problem caused by this referral process when the final decision rests with the political authorities and not with independent authorities. Account should be taken of the fact that in several Member States, the decision is taken by a political authority, such as in my country, for example, where the Government takes this decision. The criteria according to which concentrations are approved or rejected may therefore differ from the criteria used to analyse the effect on competition and its potential efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">In an interview published in the Spanish press recently, Commissioner Monti emphasised the pressure that Governments apply in competition cases. It is not hard to guess what the position of these Governments would be if they were the ones taking the decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists has tabled two amendments: the first concerns the need for the efficiencies that could counter the ill effects of a concentration on competition to include the maintenance or creation of employment. In fact, this is a version of the failing company defence principle, which has already been applied by the Commission and which we believe would improve the report if reflected in the text.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe the report would be improved by the content of the second amendment, which asks that, in concentration cases, not only competitors, but also consumers, and, where appropriate, representatives of the workers concerned, be considered as interested parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate him on his work, and I also congratulate the Commission, represented today by Mr Monti, on the initiative, which we feel is also very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has included in its report some of the conclusions of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I would refer in particular to those concerning not extending ex ante control to new cases, simplifying the calculation of deadlines and rejecting the recording of oral submissions which could affect legal certainty. I thank the rapporteur for his favourable position on these amendments and the competent committee for its approval.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, other items into which the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not been incorporated and which must be re-stated. Specifically, we do not think it appropriate for the dominance test to be replaced by the criterion of substantially reducing the competence to authorise concentrations, nor for the Commission’s powers of referral to be transferred to national competition authorities, nor for fines to be calculated as a percentage of turnover volume. This is because we consider it inadvisable to take risks with regard to legal certainty in our eagerness to introduce new, more or less innovative procedures when they are not necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore clear that, in my opinion, the amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and Amendment No 5 of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, which run counter to the tendency to clarify the procedures and which are obviously imprecise, and the other two amendments, which have nothing to do with the objective of achieving a better procedure for the control of concentrations, should not be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Congratulations, therefore, on the initiative, and take care not to reduce the effectiveness of a procedure that works well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can identify with it very well, less so in the case of the amendments which he tabled before the plenary session, but more on this later.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper on the control of mergers outlines the way in which merger control will take place in Europe in the next couple of years. It is valuable to check the existing rules and to carry out reforms where necessary. There was a great deal of criticism from companies on the application procedures, particularly in the case of transnational mergers. The absence of mutual harmonisation between the Member States leads to bureaucratic, costly and time-consuming procedures. The solution presented by the Commission strikes me as excellent: a One-Stop Shop in Brussels for multiple applications in more than two Member States. As far as I am concerned, the One-Stop Shop should also apply to applications in more than one Member State. An application in Brussels not only costs less, it also considerably enhances legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be welcomed that cooperation between the Member States in the area of the control of mergers is now finally starting to take shape. Needless to say, the new Member States should be involved in this too. Let us hope that this cooperation between the Member States leads to less bureaucracy and equal procedures and criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also urge the Commission, in respect of the One-Stop Shop’s equivalent, the referral by the Commission to the Member States on the basis of Article 9, to display the necessary restraint. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs clearly stated in the report that referral back is, and should, only be possible with the consent of the companies involved. This too is in the interest of legal certainty. The control of mergers monitors their effect within the market. New structures are created, and the effect of these structures within the market is central to the control by the Commission. This involves an economic system whereby the assessment criteria, which, in my view, also include improving efficiency, are based on competition law. My group is therefore opposed to all amendments that aim to extend the assessment criteria, with, for example, implications for employment and other social aspects. This does not belong in the regulation on the control of concentrations. </p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the amendments with a trade-political content tabled by Mr Herzog. The control of concentrations is not about reinforcing European industries or setting up strong industries. The strongest industries and the strongest companies are the result of tougher competition, which is precisely what the control on concentrations sets out to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already pointed out that I set great store by the legal certainty of companies in procedures of this kind. Using a range of criteria can lead to conflicting conclusions. For the same reason, we are also opposed to more collegiality in the decision-making process concerning mergers. Enormous investments are involved. Companies are entitled to prompt and simplified procedures. The Green Paper by the European Commission sets the right tone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, it is far-sighted to embark on a process of modernisation and reform at this stage, notwithstanding the successful history of the Regulation on merger control. I also think it is far-sighted since account is already being taken of the enlargement processes.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the rapporteur's report – as, indeed, does my group – but I also share the concern, for example, that some of the proposals set out in the Green Paper cannot actually be achieved in practice. For this reason, it is very important to ensure that the Commission gives its pledge that the issue of definitions, but also the replacement of the dominance test, will not be held over until other occasions in the future when the Regulation is reviewed again. I think this applies especially to the international dimension of the merger processes and especially to the innovative areas in which mergers are taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of transnational corporate mergers has risen steadily in recent years. Their growing number and complexity are undoubtedly one reason for reviewing the division of competence and adopting new arrangements on coordination between national and EU competition authorities. I welcome the greater concentration on the Commission as a central contact point in the interests of efficiency, transparency, legal certainty, a shortening of deadlines and reducing the administrative burden on companies, and I also expressly endorse the Commission's indication that it may be necessary to create an additional judicial instance.</p>
<p class="contents">What must be examined in detail, however – and here I disagree with the previous speakers – is the major impact of mergers, especially on employment, and the criteria and procedures for examining the permissibility of a merger. Throughout the EU, thousands of jobs have been lost as a result of such restructuring. Companies should undoubtedly have the greatest possible freedom to make management decisions, but it is often the largest employer in a region which carries out these restructuring plans. The resulting job losses do not only affect the individual workers; they also have an impact on economic and social cohesion in the region as a whole.

<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have said it before, and have said it in Sweden. You are perhaps the most important Member of the Commission for citizens of my country, where issues of competition have <span class="italic">never </span>been high on the agenda. Things have started to improve now, so there is cause for hope. Competition policy is particularly important for small countries, where the risks of monopolies and concentrations of undertakings are obvious. It is great that the EU is now prepared to carry out a review of the way acquisition control is to function in a globalised economy. The world around is changing, which places new demands on EU merger control.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, we have had a broad discussion on these issues since a number of high-profile intended mergers failed to happen. I am <span class="italic">not </span>saying that the Commission has made incorrect assessments in these particular cases. However, I feel that broader considerations could be applied in assessments of mergers. Once again, this is particularly important for small countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention a few particular points. Firstly, acquisition control should be more focused on promoting the development and rationalisation of companies in the internal market as a whole. We must create a complete market without obstacles and segmentation. This is not currently the case. Secondly, acquisition control must become more predictable. Thirdly, the Rule of Law could be strengthened. It is a sound principle that the authority investigating an issue should not be the same one which then makes a decision on the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we need stronger companies in Europe. We need more competition. We need global players which can grow strong enough to handle increasingly tough international competition. Therefore, there is a need for a more long-term and dynamic approach in the Commission’s assessment of mergers. In this respect, the EU may have something to learn from the US, <span class="italic">entirely </span>with the aim of creating an EU with better growth and more competitiveness, in line with what was said in Lisbon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, points out, the control of mergers is one of the mainstays of Community competition policy. Competition, however, cannot be used as the sole criterion when assessing the acceptability of a planned merger. Other objectives defined in the Lisbon strategy, such as the dynamics of full employment and competitive industries, must also be included in the assessment. Both types of objective should be accorded equal legal status with a view to preventing any lessening of competition but also with a view to advancing the interests of industry and employment, which have become the poor relations in our present-day economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of renewing the assessment criteria is therefore crucial. Greater consideration must be given to the realities of global competition, it should be recognised that the idea of national markets is becoming meaningless in all but a few segments of the economy, that the European market is what counts now and, finally, that there is a need to develop the concept of contestable markets by moving towards the criterion of significant lessening of competition. At the same time, procedures must be improved. The One-Stop Shop principle for operations of Community interest is excellent, provided it is combined with good safeguards. The notification conditions can be simplified and the two-thirds rule preserved without losing sight of the need for coherence within the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is on two methodological aspects that substantial progress must be made. In view of the huge social impact of these operations, it is imperative that representatives of the workforce and the other interested parties be consulted before any final decisions are made, as proposed by Mr Goebbels and Mr Berenguer Fuster in their amendments. The procedure used to test the market must be made completely transparent; to this end, it will be necessary to listen to the arguments of the interested parties and to respond to their observations. The interests of industry have thus been protected, which was the purpose of one of my amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">More could be done, of course, with regard to the contestability of decisions. Effective competition in the wider market on the one hand and development of industry and employment on the other: these are two aims on which further improvement is needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, there is the greater integration of the markets, and on the other, there is economic globalisation, which is associated, not least, with an increase in corporate mergers, and finally, there is the challenge of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition is a key instrument to achieve our economic policy goals while upholding our principles within the framework of the ecological and social market economy to which Europe is committed. What is at stake is Europe's competitiveness in the global market. The issue is competition within Europe, which we urgently need to achieve the Lisbon goals and to strengthen the internal market. We do not want government monopolies to be replaced by private monopolies. We want competition on the basis of common rules. Competition as we define it safeguards and creates jobs, leads to consumer-friendly prices, and fosters the urgently needed dynamic process of renewal.</p>
<p class="contents">We face the additional challenge of enlargement, which urgently needs mutual agreement on fundamental aspects of the competition rules among the Member States and with the accession countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we naturally have wishes as well. We want a clear definition of the relevant market, especially in the era of globalisation. We regret that there is no separation between the investigating and decision-making authorities. We underline the need for the division of competence and coordination between the Commission and the national competition authorities to be shaped in a coherent way. We welcome the fact that venture capital investments no longer fall within the EU merger control arrangements. The fact that we must embark on our own process of renewal is apparent from the example of Austria, where, since 1 July, we have had a new competition …</p>

The Internal Market facilitates the existence of mergers, as does the single currency, enlargement of the Union and globalisation, actually a type of merger, and helps put global control of the economy and communications in the hands of the few. Convergence itself has led to a situation where the IT sector, the media and the telecommunications sector are actually one inside the other, with the result that there exist enormous concentrations – mega-powers, in fact – in which economic and industrial power, the power of communications, and, in many cases, political power, are in practice concentrated in the same hands. The media is also decidedly centralised, and I have not seen the Commission interfere very much in that. The situation in Italy reminds one of Russia, although the Russian leadership at least does not own television channels. There will perhaps soon be only a few companies or operators left in the telecommunications sector, and although they might not attain a dominant market position in one, two or even three countries, it might come about globally. A company will thus have a considerable market share in a group of ten countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I do hope the Commission will address the situation and assess the globally important market position. Companies that have benefited from economies of scale can manipulate markets. The Union’s binding principle of social cohesion requires that the business interface takes account of social welfare and labour law, and let us also mention the rights of shareholders, which is also part of the social cohesion system we have decided to embrace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This self-satisfaction is ridiculous, because the heads of the large companies that engage in these activities pay infinitely more heed to the interests of their major shareholders than to the opinion of the European Parliament. By affirming that these mergers boost competitiveness and hence economic growth and employment, the report reproduces the employers’ mantra that what is good for entrepreneurs and their shareholders is good for society. However, one need only compile a catalogue of the mergers that have taken place, listing the job cuts and plant closures they have entailed, counting the thousands of workers consigned to the dole queue and the entire regions condemned to economic ruin, to demonstrate clearly that the interests of shareholders are diametrically opposed to those of the majority of society who work for their living.</p>
<p class="contents">The Vivendi affair, the latest in a long line of similar cases in the United States, shows how your system transforms production into financial capital, into a mere object of speculation. The stock exchange makes the rich grow richer and impoverishes some speculators, but most of all it impoverishes society. Wealth is not born of speculation but of work, and the only purpose of the stock exchange is to squander the real fruits of labour and convert them into false values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the last decade, financial investment has become increasingly important both quantitatively and qualitatively, geared towards better resource placement and anticipated cost savings. Thanks also to developments in information technology, there has been a clear, decisive process of globalisation and concentration, which has brought considerable benefits in the development of investments and productive activities but has also generated crises that have destabilised banking and financial systems in developing countries. The negative effects have spilled over into production and employment, and sometimes into the living standards of broad sections of society in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is true that concentrations have developed the economic systems of certain countries, which, through their tried and tested stability, have been able to benefit from the opportunities they bring, it is also true that concentrations should be able to favour initiatives to strengthen international support, which must aim at introducing reforms to encourage integration in world trade. Often, however, market mechanisms, which encourage and sustain concentrations, show obvious limits and can create severe hardship in that part of the population that remains excluded from the advantages that such situations can create. If economic concentrations are based only on the share golden value, or the optimisation of the value of the company, they will come into serious conflict with other market operators and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">In banking markets, where the dominant trend is towards concentrations and the exclusive pursuit of profit, the consequences of this are easy to see. The Cruikshank report – this is the second time I have reminded you of it, Commissioner – considers that the British banking market has a degree of concentration that is bad for the consumer. The fact that the four largest commercial banks hold such large market shares leads to disproportionately high charges and prices and a poor supply of products and services to private and business customers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament clearly seems to share the Commission’s objective, which is to strengthen the legislative arsenal for controlling concentrations. Only by using up-to-date methods and instruments is it possible to face challenges such as the forthcoming enlargement, the strengthening of relations with the other competition authorities and greater international awareness of the importance of concentration control issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like here to express my gratitude to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, as well as all those who have contributed to this debate, particularly the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. The public consultation process has provided and is still providing a number of interesting and well documented opinions on jurisdictional, procedural and substantive questions raised in the Green Paper. In my opinion, your report, Mr Berenguer Fuster, offers a very well-reasoned account of it and makes some particularly interesting observations. You all know the high esteem in which I hold Parliament’s contributions, and I can promise you that this report will be examined with the greatest attention. On the basis of all this input, the Commission will adopt a proposal for a new Merger Regulation by the end of this year, for subsequent debate by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider this regulation to be part – an important part, yes, but just a part – of a package of reforms which will also include interpretative guidelines on the application of the substantial competition test – we have heard various opinions on the current dominance test and the possible alternative of the substantial lessening of competition test – which clarify in particular the procedures for analysing market influence in cases of concentration and the importance that should be attributed to efficiency considerations, which have been mentioned several times. The draft regulation will naturally be made available for public consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also intend to come to an agreement with legal and enterprise circles on a new series of guidelines on best procedural practice, that is in the investigation of concentrations. We must therefore think about the structural or management changes that will be needed to accompany this reform package, particularly how to take further the matter of rights of defence and the matter of strengthening our economic capacity and the role of economic analysis in our decision-making procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I should like to touch briefly on a matter that a number of Members of the House have raised this evening, which is the matter of a possible link between social policies and competition policies.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an issue which raises questions about the tests for assessing concentrations. I want to be very clear on this point. The introduction of further tests, different from those concerned with competition, in the concentration assessment system would complicate, confuse and, ultimately, risk defeating the primary function of the Merger Regulation, which is to maintain effective competition. In no way does this mean not making employment policies a top priority. The European Union has employment policies, the Member States have employment policies and the Commission and I myself are all for the strengthening of employment policies. Maintaining healthy competition, as has been pointed out, also encourages a growing economy over the medium to long term, and with growth comes employment. I do think, however, that to mix up objectives and include an objective on maintaining employment in the Merger Regulation would make it less effective.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not mean that, when concentrations take place, the companies should not be reminded of their obligations to comply with social legislation, wherever this is required. For our part, we want to give workers and their representatives the opportunity to express their views to the Commission during the investigation. As I was saying, we examine the competition and, in this context, the viewpoint of dependent workers and their representatives may take on greater importance if it concerns the effects of the operation on competition.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I believe that social legislation, which is important, and competition law, which is also important, pursue technically dissimilar goals by means of a variety of different but equally valid methods. I am quite certain that mixing up the instruments would not benefit either policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Parliament once again for this latest contribution to our efforts to refine the competition instrument. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
