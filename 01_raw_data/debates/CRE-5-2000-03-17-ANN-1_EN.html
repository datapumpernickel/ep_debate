<p>The Council is deeply concerned at the increasing number of attacks against civilian personnel working for the United Nations, which resulted in the death of 184 United Nations staff members between 1 January 1992 and 31 January 2000, and fully supports the condemnations of these acts of murder and other violence against UN staff members, as expressed by the UN Security Council, most recently on 9 February 2000.</p>
<p>The protection of United Nations and associated and humanitarian personnel is a fundamental responsibility for United Nations missions in situations of conflict. Violence against them is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated under any circumstances. Without their safety and security, missions and operations could not function, let alone succeed.</p>
<p>The Union has expressed a firm position on this question during the Security Council open debate held on 9 February 2000. On this occasion, the EU stressed that the responsibility for the safety of personnel on the ground falls, in the first instance, on the governments hosting peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. The Union urged all parties to conflict to take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and security of United Nations and associated, as well as humanitarian personnel, including locally-recruited personnel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Union expressed the view that perpetrators of crimes against such personnel must be brought to justice. Governments must act forcefully to prevent these acts of violence and to punish those responsible for them. In this context, the Statute of the International Criminal Court is also essential. The inclusion in the Statute of the war crime of intentionally attacking personnel involved in humanitarian assistance or peacekeeping missions will help to bring perpetrators to justice.</p>
<p>Finally, the Union stated that the United Nations Secretariat must ensure that United Nations and associated personnel are adequately protected. The Union supports the Secretary-General’s continued strengthening of the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator with personnel dedicated to security in peacekeeping operations.</p>
<p>The Union's positions are largely reflected in the Statement made by the President of the UN Security Council on behalf of the Council on 9 February 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0178"></a>

<p>In the Council President’s view, have the sanctions against Austria, adopted by the 14 Heads of State and Government and announced by the Portuguese Presidency, had the desired effect?

<p>Finally, does the Council President consider that this procedure should continue to be used in future, in preference to the provisions laid down in Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>1. As I pointed out in a written answer to a question put by Mrs Pernille Frahm in the framework of the Question Time of February last, the position expressed by the President of the European Council, in the name of fourteen governments of the Member States of the European Union, regarding the inclusion of the Freedom Party in the Austrian Government, does not represent a Council position.</p>
<p>2. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for the Council to express an opinion on actions which have been taken by one or more of the Governments of the Member States and which have no direct bearing on the work of the Council.</p>
<p>Any such action is a matter for the governments of the Member States concerned. The use of the provisions of Article 7 of the EU Treaty is a separate issue. The mechanisms provided for under this Article have not been invoked nor has the possibility of having recourse to them been discussed by the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1. With regard to Turkey, the pre-accession strategy will outline the EU’s priorities for satisfying the so-called Copenhagen criteria. Accession negotiations will not be able to start until Turkey satisfies these criteria, which include human rights and the protection of minorities. In this context, it should be made clear that Turkey does recognise the minorities referred to in the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, specifically the Greek, Armenian and Jewish minorities. The pre-accession strategy for Turkey will probably be adopted in October or November 2000.</p>
<p>2. On 24 February, the current Chairman of the HADEP (the pro-Kurdish party) and his predecessor, together with 16 other members of the party, were given prison sentences, some of more than three years, for allegedly supporting the PKK terrorist group. The support in question involved hunger strikes in support of Abdullah Öçalan during his stay in Italy at the end of 1998, before his arrest in February 1999.</p>
<p>3. The elected leaders of the councils in Diyarbakir, Siirt and Bingöl, who are all Kurds and members of the HADEP, had been arrested a few days previously by the security forces in spectacular circumstances. They were then also accused of supporting the PKK and were remanded in custody pending trial. The three council leaders have since been released, following intervention by the EU.</p>
<p>4. Human Rights organisations have condemned the recent actions carried out against Kurdish politicians. The European Union stressed – through the confidential work of a troika in Ankara – the importance of non-interference in democratic institutions in the context of the Copenhagen criteria for accession and of the proper treatment of the arrested men. The EU also expressed its “surprise” at these arrests.</p>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The reason given for the EU’s approval of NATO’s bombing of Yugoslavia at the Berlin Summit on 25 March 1999 was to stop human rights violations in Kosovo.</p>
<p>In the light of the human rights situation before, during and after the intervention by Russia in Chechnya, what is the difference in the quality, scale or nature of the human rights violations that led the EU to support the bombing of Kosovo, but do nothing in Chechnya other than allow the Russian Government to act as it sees fit?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly condemned Russia’s military intervention in Chechnya and considers it to be completely unacceptable. It has stressed the fact that the fight against terrorism does not justify, under any circumstances, the indiscriminate use of force. The Council has made it quite clear that this behaviour contravenes the basic principles of humanitarian law, the commitments given by Russia to the OSCE, as well as its obligations as a Member of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p>The Council has on several occasions urged Russia to end its military offensive against the Chechen people, to allow the delivery, in safe conditions, of humanitarian aid, and to immediately enter into political dialogue with Chechen representatives. The Council is convinced that only a political agreement can provide a lasting solution to the complex underlying causes of the conflict. The Council therefore fully supports the efforts of the OSCE and the Council of Europe. Any political agreement would clearly have to give the Chechens a sufficient degree of autonomy, without threatening Russia’s territorial integrity.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the Council is deeply alarmed at the increasing number of reports on human rights abuses, such as torture and executions. In their meeting on 2 March with the Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, the EU Troika urged Russia to end these abuses and to bring those responsible to trial. The Troika appealed to Russia to allow independent investigations to take place in order to ensure complete transparency. In addition to this, at the trilateral ministerial meeting of 3 March in Lisbon, the EU and the US together put pressure on Russia to do so. The Council will continue to follow this issue very closely, and to put pressure on Russia if necessary.</p>
<p>In this context, we must emphasise that the Council has already urged Russia on several occasions to allow a permanent presence in the region of competent international organisations such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE and the United Nations. The Council supports the efforts of the President-in-Office of the OSCE, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, who will shortly be travelling to the region, as well as the commitment of Mary Robinson and of the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Gil Robles. The Council will continue to exert pressure on Russia so that the OSCE Assistance Group can return quickly to the region.</p>
<p>As a result of the situation in Chechnya, the Helsinki European Council decided to refocus the Joint Strategy for Russia, to redirect the TACIS programme towards certain priorities, to adopt a strict approach to trade matters, if Russia violates the PCA and to end cooperation under the PCA in certain areas. The EU is currently working on the implementation of these measures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council is particularly concerned at the treatment of journalists working in Chechnya. In light of the case of Mr Babitsky, the Council has urged Russia to adopt all necessary measures to guarantee basic conditions for free and independent media to operate, as well as an unhampered flow of information.</p>
<p>Under growing international pressure, Russia has accepted the participation of experts from the Council of Europe in Vladimir Kalamanov’s team, and has stated that it is willing to study the possibility of other interested organisations participating. On its own initiative, Russia has invited the president of the ICRC to travel to Moscow, and he will probably also visit Chechnya. The new head of the OSCE Assistance Group travelled to Chechnya on 11 March.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to closely follow the human rights situation in Chechnya and to take every appropriate opportunity to express its concerns to the Russians.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Over the last few days, the Israeli Airforce has frequently attacked targets in Lebanon. During these so-called 'reprisal' raids, strike aircraft and helicopters made repeated attacks on positions occupied by the radical Islamic Hezbollah militia. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy warned Hezbollah, which operates out of Lebanese territory, not to attack border areas in Northern Israel, since, according to Levy, Israel would not tolerate this and Lebanon would burn. Lebanon's economic interests could be hard-hit by this and reconstruction could last years. The situation had already escalated to the point where Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was obliged to declare a state of emergency in Northern Israel.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Russian Airforce has continued its attacks in Chechnya, which have been going on for months. The second Chechnya war started when the Russians marched in last September. According to latest reports, the Russian military has now given advance notice of the 'final phase' of the war in what is an utterly destroyed and broken region.</p>
<p>In the light of these developments, does the Portuguese Presidency intend, in 'time-honoured' fashion, to formulate a statement on behalf of a number of Member States and subsequently freeze bilateral relations with Israel and Russia, as it has recently done 'particularly successfully' with Austria?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1. With regard to the questions on Chechnya, I would ask the honourable Member to refer to the answer I gave to the previous questions on this subject.</p>
<p>2. With regard to the questions on the repeated air strikes by Israel on Southern Lebanon, I would draw you attention to the Presidency’s recent statement on Lebanon on behalf of the European Union, the tenor of which was the following:</p>
<p>Declaration by the Presidency on behalf of the European Union on Lebanon </p>
<p>The EU has followed the situation in Lebanon very closely and wishes to express its deep concern at the escalation of hostilities, its consternation at the consequent deaths and injuries, and its deep sympathy with the wounded and the bereaved families. In response to attacks on its forces, Israel launched air strikes against Lebanese infrastructures, causing casualties amongst Lebanese civilians. The EU consequently wishes to emphasise that the main objective of the agreement of April 1996 is to protect civilians from such attacks, and it regrets any violation of this agreement. The escalation of hostilities threatens the progress that has recently been made in the peace process and as a result of the reopening of negotiations with Syria and with Lebanon.</p>
<p>The EU urges all parties to exercise restraint and to scrupulously respect the terms of the cease-fire agreement of April 1996. The EU also calls for the Monitoring Committee to be convened quickly in order to ensure that tensions are appeased and to prevent further violations of the agreement.</p>
<p>These incidents confirm the urgent need to redouble our efforts to establish lasting peace in the region. Our success in this depends in particular on the implementation of Resolution 425 of the United Nations Security Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0193"></a>

<p>Sweden is currently negotiating with the Commission for an extension of its derogation regarding the alcohol brought into Sweden.</p>
<p>The temperance movement in Sweden, the IOGT-NTO, argues that Article 28 of Directive 77/388/EEC<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> states in essence that the Commission is to submit a report to the Council on the operation of the derogations and submit a proposal for a final system. This system will in principle be the same as the arrangements which are intended to apply within the EU, that tax should be imposed only in the country of origin of the goods. When the Council, after considering the report, believes that the conditions for transition to the final system exist, it should, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting Parliament, adopt the rules to apply to the final system. It goes on to say that the transitional rules shall be automatically extended until the date on which the final system enters into force. The agreement concluded in 1996 (Article 1(3) of Directive 96/99/EC<a href="#defann_10_2" name="refann_10_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>) states, according to the IOGT-NTO, that Sweden is entitled until 30 June 2000 to continue to apply the current restrictions on the quantity of alcoholic drinks, subject to review as laid down in Article 28 of Directive 77/388/EC.</p>

<p>Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union states that “the Common Foreign and Security Policy shall include all issues relating to the security of the Union, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, in accordance with the second subparagraph, which might lead to common defence, should the Council so decide”. Common defence is envisaged in the Treaty as a possible long-term objective, which will in any event require a specific decision by the European Council and the subsequent adoption of a decision by the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional laws.</p>
<p>There is currently no “supreme guarantee” within the Union. This guarantee of assistance against external aggression is laid down by the North Atlantic Treaty and by the amended Treaty of Brussels (the Western European Union) in relation to the States that are party to these Treaties.</p>
<p>The purpose of developing the Union’s military capabilities is to provide the Union with the necessary means for crisis management, in other words, to satisfy the so-called “Petersberg Tasks”, which are humanitarian and evacuation tasks, as well as tasks aimed at maintaining and re-establishing peace, to which specific reference is made in Article 17(2). This fact was clearly stated by the Cologne European Council in June 1999 and confirmed in Helsinki in December 1999. In addition to this, it has also been specified on several occasions that this process “does not imply the creation of a European Army”.</p>
<p>Given that common defence is not in question, the participation of neutral Member States in this process and in crisis management does not raise any problems. Under the single institutional framework, all of the EU’s Member States, whether they are neutral, non-allied or Nato members can participate on equal terms in all preparatory stages and in decision making with regard to EU-led operations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With regard to the participation of applicant countries and countries which are Nato allies but not EU Members, the Helsinki European Council decided that, in crisis management operations launched by the EU, appropriate structures will be created for dialogue and the exchange of information with those countries. These structures will be used for the purpose of consultation when the Council has not reached a decision. The possible forms of these structures are currently under discussion in Council forums.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0198"></a>

<p>1. The Council decision to which the honourable Member refers relates to the Council conclusions of 4 March 1996, in which the Council agreed that including standard readmission clauses in joint agreements would be given due consideration on an individual basis at the time of adopting negotiation directives for such agreements. The Council decision modifies these conclusions to suit the new situation arising as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam coming into force. In fact, it was necessary to review these standard clauses agreed in 1996 in order to take account of the fact that henceforth, the European Community is authorised to conclude readmission agreements with third countries. According to this decision, the revised standard clauses would, in future, have to be incorporated into Community agreements and into association and cooperation agreements between the European Community, its Member States and third countries. In legal terms, this relates to negotiation directives adopted by the Council pursuant to Article 300(1), of the EC Treaty. This clause does not provide for the European Parliament to be consulted. </p>
<p>Once adopted, these new directives will be applied to ongoing negotiations and future negotiations. </p>
<p>2. The clauses do not stipulate any obligation to deport illegal migrants. Their only purpose is to commit the contractual parties to readmitting their own nationals and to conclude readmission agreements which entail the obligation to readmit third country nationals and stateless persons. As far as the deportation of illegal migrants is concerned, each Member State bears the responsibility for ensuring that the deportations are carried out in compliance with their obligations under the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 and the Protocol of 31 January relating to the status of refugees as well as other relevant treaties.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0220"></a>

<p>How does the Council assess the implementation of the 1997 joint action and what is its position on reviewing the action so as to give a political signal of the EU’s commitment in this field?</p>
<p>What progress has been made in adapting the Member States’ legislation? Have the reports on this question been drawn up and published?</p>
<p>What significance is given to the question of anti-personnel mines in the Union’s political dialogue with its partners, in particular the applicant countries (five of which have not signed the Convention)?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>1. Shortly before the Ottawa Conference in 1997, the EU approved a new joint action on anti-personnel mines, in which it reiterated its commitment to the objective of completely eliminating these mines throughout the world. The Union was therefore delighted at the signing of the Convention in Ottawa, as well as at the efforts made by its signatories to promote universal adherence to the Convention.</p>
<p>2. At the first Conference of Signatory States to the Ottawa Convention (3-7 May 1999), the Union called on all States to unite their efforts to achieve the complete elimination of anti-personnel mines throughout the world. The following associate countries subscribed to this statement: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Cyprus (Poland did not). In order to promote the rapid and full implementation of the Convention, the Union undertook several initiatives which demonstrated its full support for the Convention’s objectives. It was with this in mind that, in the Joint Action, the EU Member States also made a commitment to actively participate in the conferences due to be organised following the signing of the Convention and to promote, in all appropriate forums, any effort likely to contribute to the objectives of the Joint Action.</p>
<p>Finland has not yet ratified the Ottawa Convention.</p>
<p>3. As the honourable Members will be aware, the Convention has been ratified by fourteen EU Member States. Finland is studying the possibility of signing up to the 2006 Ottawa Convention and replacing anti-personnel mines with alternative means by the end of 2010. Finland has emphasised that it is continuing to participate in international cooperation, both in terms of the objective of a total ban and in terms of mine clearance.</p>
<p>4. The EU has raised the issue of the universal acceptance and implementation of the Ottawa Convention in the meetings involving political dialogue on global disarmament and arms control that it has held with all associate countries, with the EFTA countries that are members of the European Economic Area, with Canada, with the United States and with other countries such as Australia and regional groups such as the SADC.</p>
<p>Reference to the issue of the Ottawa Convention in negotiations for accession to the EU.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5. With regard to negotiations for accession to the European Union, it is hoped that the applicant countries will fully adhere to the acquis, including the joint positions and joint actions adopted under the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>
<p>Reports presented by Signatory States to the Convention.</p>
<p>6. At the first meeting of the Standing Committee of Experts, on the general status and operation of the Ottawa Convention, which was held on 10 and 11 January 2000, a positive assessment was made of the increasingly universal acceptance of the Convention, which has already been signed or accepted by 137 countries and has been ratified by 90. It was stated that 31 States had already submitted their respective reports on the implementation of the Convention to the Secretary-General of the United Nations (Article 7 of the Convention), while 34 other States are late in doing so. In their capacity as co-chairs of the Standing Committee of Experts, South Africa and Canada have informed the participants of the meeting that they had implemented, together with interested States, initiatives for the States in question to encourage them to adopt all the necessary measures to prove that they still firmly support the prohibition of anti-personnel landmines. While the Convention does not require the publication of reports and while the Council is not aware that reports by EU Member States have been published, Article 7 of the Ottawa Convention stipulates that the Secretary-General will forward all the reports that he has received to the signatory States to the Convention, who will then study the issues raised in them at the meeting of Signatory States. Furthermore, we wish to inform the honourable Member that the reports by the United Nations Anti-Mine Services will be available on the website of the United Nations department for disarmament issues.</p>
<p>Implementation of the Joint Action</p>
<p>7. The Joint Action establishes the framework for specific actions and for the EU’s financial contributions to mine clearing activities. In the period between 1993 and 1997, the Union contributed USD 140 million for mine clearing operations and assistance to victims. This amount does not include individual contributions by EU Member States. In 1998, funds provided by the European Community and by the Member States reached a total of approximately USD 95 million. These figures demonstrate the EU to be the largest donor in the world in these areas.</p>
<p>On 28 November 1997, the Council of the EU adopted a decision on the implementation of Joint Action 96/588/CFSP, of 1 October 1996, on antipersonnel landmines, in order to contribute to the funding of certain SADC programmes (EUR 2.07 million), of the ICRC “Mines Awareness Programme” in former Yugoslavia and of the rehabilitation programme for the victims mutilated by mines in Iraq (EUR 1.43 million). On the same day, the Council approved a decision on implementing Joint Action 96/588/CFSP on anti-personnel landmines, in order to cofinance the ICRC “special appeals” (maximum contribution of EUR 8 million).</p>
<p>Updating the Joint Action</p>
<p>8. In the Union’s statement at the first Conference of Signatory States to the Ottawa Convention, it remarked that all of the Signatory States had committed themselves to never, whatever the circumstances, using anti-personnel landmines. The EU also hopes that all of the Signatory States will fully respect the objective, the design and the spirit of the Ottawa Convention. Although the EU was guided at first by humanitarian concerns, it will focus its efforts on the Party States and the Signatory States, who in practice are fully observing the principles and the objectives laid down in the Convention. The recent civilian victims of the use have emphasised the importance of this lethal weapon being abolished and the appropriate nature of the objectives stated in the EU Joint Action, which are to completely eliminate anti-personnel landmines and to help to resolve the problems already caused by these weapons. As the objectives remain valid, the Union does not currently envisage updating them.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Shortly after the Mozambique Government asked for help, the President-in-Office of the Council, the Portuguese Secretary of State for Development Cooperation, Mr AMADO, together with Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Mr NIELSON, went to Mozambique from 2-4 March to assess the scale of the damage of the floods compounded by a tropical storm.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Council held a number of meetings at different levels to coordinate the response of the Member States. Given the scale of devastation, the Council is following with great concern the humanitarian catastrophe and is discussing how to best coordinate emergency aid and relief. Pursuant to these ongoing discussions it will be debating the situation on Mozambique in the General Affairs Council on 20 March.</p>
<p>The Member States, as of 8 March, have pledged nearly EUR 60m in emergency humanitarian aid as well as further aid in kind to complement the 4, EUR 15m provided by ECHO. Although it is recognised that the lead role in coordination lies with the local National Institute for Disaster Management and the UN agencies, the Member States have placed great emphasis on the need to exchange information between themselves and with the Commission on their activities. This is to ensure effective coordination so that there is no duplication of effort and that the aid provided has maximum impact.</p>
<p>The Council recognises the broader impact this catastrophe is likely to have on Mozambique's economy and development. It will follow a twin-track approach aiming at meeting the immediate needs for relief while working with the Commission to look at measures to ensure macro-economic stability, the rehabilitation of the affected areas in the medium-term and the maintenance of on-going programmes of development assistance including Lomé. To this end, several Member States have already announced measures for rehabilitation, budgetary support and debt relief and their intention to redirect their development assistance programmes towards rehabilitation if this is required. This complements the EUR 21m in aid announced by Commissioner Nielson for the medium term needs of the flood victims.</p>
<p>EUR 100m were provided in 1999 for Mozambique from the European Development Fund and up to EUR 150m could be available for the National Indicative Programme in 2000.</p>
<p>The Council also plans to look at the lessons to be drawn from this crisis in the context of its on-going discussions on the evaluation of humanitarian aid and its emerging response on the management of non-military crises in general.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0237"></a>

<p>We can assure the honourable Member that the EU’s aim is still to establish a democratic and multiethnic Kosovo within the internationally-recognised borders of the former Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly condemned all acts of violence, whoever may have perpetrated them and has expressed particular concern at the countless outbreaks of ethnic violence in Mitrovica and the recent attacks on Members of KFOR. The Council has requested all political leaders in Kosovo to strongly condemn every kind of violence and to use their influence to bring it to an end. Kosovo’s leaders also have a responsibility to help prevent separatist attacks on Southern Serbia. The Council has drawn their attention to the fact that their presence in Kosovo also depends on the progress made in reconciliation between ethnic groups and in total compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, in all of its aspects, including the promotion of the principle of the territorial integrity of the former Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Council accepts the urgent need for a solution to be found for the continuing violence against Serbs, Gypsies and other non-Albanian Communities and to the growing problem of organised crime. The establishment of a safe environment will be a central factor in preventing the Kosovar Serbs from leaving the region and in encouraging those who have already done so to return. To this end, the Council recognises the need to strengthen the presence of the international police in Kosovo. Member States are responding positively to the urgent appeal by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Dr Kouchner, and of the High Representative, to bolster the numbers of police officers supplied by the United Nations in Kosovo’s civilian police mission.</p>
<p>Resolution 1244 of the United Nations Security Council granted KFOR, an international force under NATO command, the mandate to establish a security presence in Kosovo, to prevent the renewal of hostilities, to demilitarise the KLA and to establish a safe environment to which refugees can return and in which the international civilian workers can operate. The EU fully respects the division of labour decided on by the United Nations Security Council. The Council is Consequently, leaving to NATO and KFOR the task of assessing and deciding what they need to fulfil the mandates that they have been given by the international Community.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council would remind the honourable Member of the EU’s special responsibility under the “Fourth Pillar” (economic reconstruction) for the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), which is administrated by the European Union, and thus the importance of this pillar for Kosovo’s peaceful future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0216"></a>

<p>Trade policy is never gender-neutral. Women make up 70% of the poorest people in the world and they are hardest hit by liberalisation of trade and the transition to a market economy. Nevertheless, gender rarely forms a natural part of the analyses on which our trade policy is based.</p>
<p>Article 3(2) of the Amsterdam Treaty provides that equality must be present as an aspect of all areas of policy, including trade. What practical measures does the Commission intend to take to ensure that the EU's trade policy is not detrimental to women but, instead, benefits the population as a whole ?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the honourable Member is aware, trade policy as such is gender neutral and non-discriminatory. Where the Commission might agree is that the effects of trade liberalisation may not always be gender neutral to the extent that the local framework to which this liberalisation is applied, does not support equal opportunities sufficiently.</p>
<p>As such, the Community's trade policy is based on the principle of a level playing field for all economic actors, and therefore a basic of equal opportunities.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is surely aware, the Community proposed in Seattle the establishment of a joint World Trade Organisation (WTO) - International Labour Organisation (ILO) forum to consider the issue of core labour standards. Even though no conclusion was reached, a point raised by many countries is the need to consider, apart from the issue of core labour standards, other social development questions arising from United States conferences. This may therefore provide an opportunity to also initiate a dialogue on issues related to gender in the context of trade policy.</p>
<p>At the level of the Community the Honourable Member will be aware that 'mainstreaming' of the issue of equal opportunities for women and men is part of its policy-making.</p>
<p>Therefore, as one of the concrete steps to improve knowledge on the effects of our policies, the Commission has launched last year a Sustainable Impact Assessment (SIA), which should also seek to assess gender impact.</p>
<p>One clear outcome of the SIA is that trade liberalisation, while not itself intrinsically bad for gender inequality or any other sustainable development objective, can create problems if it generates growth in an economy where the framework of law fails to guarantee equal opportunities (or adequate environmental protection for that matter).</p>
<p>That is why the Commission, with the support of Parliament in its pre-Seattle resolution, has pressed for trade talks to be flanked by capacity-building measures and for the aid effort undertaken in other frameworks to be better coordinated with the WTO's work programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0204"></a>

<p>Since, in most Member States, arable farming accounts for the majority of agricultural production, it naturally follows that arable farming also uses the largest quantities of pesticides.</p>

<p>Through the introduction of direct subsidies instead of the previous system of price support, however, the Community has put a stop to the further intensification of cultivation, which should lead, in time, to a reduction in the use of plant protection agents.</p>
<p>The Commission is conscious of the fact that the common agricultural policy has to give greater consideration to environmental aspects and, to this end, has incorporated in Agenda 2000 the principle whereby the granting of direct income support is conditional upon environmental considerations being satisfied.</p>

<p>Export subsidies are never used as a means of dumping agricultural exports in poor countries but are the result of supporting market prices under the common agricultural policy.

<p>Does the Commission not consider that there is now an urgent need to amend the Community rules by introducing the principle of direct income support for producers, rather than for processing, i.e. adopting the system used for aid to the cereals sector, and thus by-passing the tangled web of a bureaucracy which is often parasitical and biased.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The 1999/2000 financial year for citrus fruits was characterised by a general drop in production prices in the EU, attributable to increased output. As far as southern Italy is concerned, alongside this general state of affairs, the consequences of adverse weather conditions throughout October and November 1999 must also be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>To these cyclical problems should be added the structural problems arising from the continuing deficits in production, marketing and processing structures.</p>
<p>Citrus fruit producers earn a living either by selling their produce on the fresh market or by selling it on to the processing industry. This necessitates bringing production into line with market requirements in terms of both quality and quantity.</p>
<p>The Commission is of the opinion that the introduction of a subsidy per hectare would be unsuitable as far as the Community’s citrus fruit sector is concerned. A subsidy of this sort does not promote the specific switching to different varieties which is necessary to be able to boost demand.</p>
<p>In fact, the 1996 reform of the processing sector involved replacing a processing subsidy with a direct subsidy to the producer organisations so as to protect the income of those producers supplying the processing industry. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0221"></a>

<p>A few years ago, people in the Netherlands were shocked to learn that there was a huge black market in fish there, with hundreds of thousands of guilders’ worth of revenue being lost through fraudulently concealed fish sales. Since then, it has been generally assumed that the Netherlands State authorities were strictly enforcing quotas and limits on fishing days. Recently, however, it has been rumoured that some Member States, including the Netherlands, are still evading quotas by means of ‘black’ and ‘grey’ markets. The figures quoted by the Netherlands Ministry of Agriculture apparently do not correspond to reality, inspections remain lax and the self-monitoring system introduced in the Netherlands is said to be ineffective. More specifically, boats (longer than 10 m) which no longer operate are included in lists submitted to the EU in order to increase the fish quota and the number of fishing days.</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of these claims? Is it possible that such fraud may be taking place? To what extent does the Commission carry out checks in the Member States? How does the Commission inspect the national monitoring systems? Does it do so only by administrative means or also by means of visits on the spot? Will the Commission compare the quota figures with trade statistics (including VAT statistics)? Will the Commission carry out a thorough and detailed investigation of the above accusations?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has, on many occasions since it presented its 1992 Report on the Implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy, drawn to the attention of Parliament and the Council to weaknesses in the area of fisheries control. The last time it did so was in 1998 when it presented its Communication on Fisheries Monitoring under the Common Fishery Policy (CFP).</p>
<p>If the situation is not yet satisfactory in all cases, over the last eight years, the Commission has observed considerable progress on the improvement of control of fishing activities in many areas and notably an improvement in the efficiency of control of landings in several Member States. The Commission expects further significant progress in control notably as a consequence of the introduction of surveillance by satellite tracking of fishing vessels (VMS). Since 1 January 2000, all Community fishing vessels exceeding a length of 24 m overall are subject to this type of surveillance.</p>
<p>The Commission is fully aware of the fraud which took place about 10 years ago in the Netherlands. In fact, the fisheries inspectors of the Commission documented these practices and action has been taken against the Netherlands. Since 1992, these practices have ceased to exist.</p>
<p>The Commission fisheries inspectors verify on the spot the implementation of the CFP by the national authorities. They are, so to speak, the 'controllers of the controllers'.</p>
<p>The Commission checks on a sampling basis the consistency between trade figures and catch and landing data. On a routine basis the national authorities have the obligation to cross-check catch and landing data with sales notes and transport documents. Sales notes correspond to invoices as referred to in the Sixth Directive on VAT.</p>
<p>The Commission cannot usefully investigate allegations of the existence of 'black or grey' fish if it does not get reasonably concrete and verifiable information as to where, how, and when such practices are suspected to occur.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0165"></a>

<p>In order to promote Renewable Energy, the Commission is implementing the White Paper for a Community strategy and Action Plan: a progress report will be submitted to Parliament and the Council, probably in April 2000. In addition the Commission is implementing the Campaign for Take-Off. The Commission is also preparing a draft Directive on electricity from Renewables that will be sent to Parliament and the Council in April 2000. Also a communication on an Action Plan for Energy Efficiency will be transmitted to Parliament and the Council at the same time.</p>
<p>Concerning the ALTENER II and SAVE II Programmes the Commission will launch a call for proposals for each programme this year, with budgets doubled compared to last year. The 5th RTD Framework Programme includes in the ENERGIE sub-programme, two Key actions related with Renewable Energy Sources and Energy Efficiency. After the allocation of EUR 315 m to innovative ventures in 1999 (about two thirds of this amount rewarded to renewable and energy efficiency proposals), an additional call for proposals, with a budget of EUR 100 m, will be launched this year for these two energy sectors.</p>
<p>In the former Directorate-General (DG) for Energy, activities related to promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency were dealt with in one unit which was part of the former Directorate C, whereas the activities related to technology promotion was dealt with in the former Directorate D. In order to more effectively promote energy efficiency and renewable energy, these activities have now been regrouped in one Directorate with three Units specifically dealing with these matters and one Unit dealing with clean urban transport.</p>
<p>After the merger of the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport, the number of officials dealing specifically with energy and transport issues is as follows:</p>
<p>- 142 officials of categories A, B and C deal specifically with energy;</p>
<p>- 189 officials of categories A, B and C deal specifically with transport.</p>
<p>Moreover, approximately 200 officials are dealing with important horizontal tasks on energy and transport, including internal market issues, international cooperation, environmental protection, information, communication and dissemination of technological innovations, as well as Trans-European Networks. Because of the integrated approach to energy and transport issues it is not possible to specify the exact break-down between energy and transport for these officials.</p>
<p>According to a rough estimate, about 68 people were working on renewable energy and on energy efficiency in the former DG Energy. With staff now grouped in one single Directorate (New Energy and Demand Management) 28 people deal exclusively with energy efficiency, 25 with renewables and 11 on clean urban environment. Also on these issues, a significant number of officials in horizontal directorates have important tasks related to policy and technology promotion, for example with regard to environmental protection and dissemination of innovative technologies. In total therefore, Energy efficiency and Renewables have been strengthened in the new organisation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0167"></a>

<p>Over 20 years ago the A-15 toll motorway was built to link Pamplona-Iruña with Tudela to the south and Irutzun to the north, its purpose being to relieve the heavy traffic on the 121 (Pamplona/Iruña-Tudela) and 240A (Pamplona Iruña-Irutzun) trunkroads. Since then the volume of traffic has increased to the point where over 15 000 vehicles now use the N-121 and the N-240A every day.

<p>Inverness, the capital of the Scottish Highlands, lost its air connection to London Heathrow and to that airport's worldwide network in November 1997, with damaging economic and social consequences for this remote and fragile part of Europe, which at the same time was a beneficiary of Objective 1 funding. Should it not be a requirement that a certain percentage of slots at vital European hub airports should be reserved for regional connections of this type?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The current slot regulation gives the possibility to Member States to ensure that domestic scheduled air services have physical access to congested airports by reserving slots at such airports for routes that were already operated in 1993 when the Regulation entered into force or for routes where public service obligations have been imposed. Such obligations may be imposed according to the provisions of the Regulation on market access, where for particular regions it is economically vital to ensure that sufficient scheduled air services are provided where otherwise none or unsatisfactory air services would be operated.</p>
<p>In both cases it is the competence of Member States to examine the need for such services and reserve the appropriate slots. There is no limit in the slot Regulation for the amount of such reserved slots, which seems to give more flexibility than just opening the possibility for a certain percentage of slots.</p>
<p>It might be difficult to demonstrate that a public service obligation can be imposed on services from Inverness to Heathrow if another London airport, like Gatwick is already adequately served. Obviously, a service to Heathrow would be even more attractive, however, it would have to be examined whether such service is "vital for the economic development of the region" as the Regulation requires.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The European air transport sector has great problems in terms of congestion and delays, leading to significant cost consequences and inconvenience for the airlines and the travelling public. The problems also have a negative impact on the environment and could affect safety. Several European states including Denmark, Germany, Holland, Italy, Spain and Sweden and some airlines have, with the sponsorship of the European Commission, been involved in the highly successful development of new European technologies that could help to solve those problems. The same technology has recently been adopted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) as mandatory equipment for ships at sea.</p>
<p>Mr K-H Neumeister, Secretary-General of the Association of European Airlines (AEA) in a letter to the Director-General of EuroControl, Mr Yves Lambers, has expressed serious concern about a possible reduction of resources and redirection of focus on the implementation of the technology referred to as Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). AEA points to the successful development programmes conducted in cooperation with airlines such as Alitalia, Lufthansa and SAS on a technology called VDL Mode 4. A rapid implementation of this system could, according to AEA, 'contribute to solving the delay situation'.</p>
<p>What action is the Commission planning to facilitate and speed up the implementation of new technologies in order to reduce the present chaos in European air traffic systems?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission agrees with the honourable Member that the implementation of Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) can contribute in the mid-term to solving the delay situation in Air Traffic Management. The Commission saw a high potential in the VHF (Very High Frequency) Data Link Mode-4 technology as an enabler of ADS-B, that is why it has supported its further development through both the research and trans-european transport network funds, with a total sum exceeding EUR 10 million.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the introduction of the new technologies, the Commission, in conjunction with experiments and pilot projects, is supporting standardisation of that technology in European Standardisation Organisations. It is being considered whether a standardisation mandate to cover formally the work undertaken in European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) is appropriate at this time.</p>
<p>Implementation of new technologies in air traffic management is a complex issue because it requires the definition of a new concept of operations and a greater degree of cooperation between the different actors. The Commission is constantly working on means to speed up and improve this process, both in the context of its programmes and by means of policy initiatives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0200"></a>

<p>In the framework of the revision of the trans-European network's (TENs) guidelines, the Commission does not intend to propose radical changes to the maps, but rather to update them to reflect where planned links had now been completed and identifying bottlenecks. Of course, one of the objectives of the TENs is to ensure economic and social cohesion and the Commission will continue to support the development of infrastructure links to peripheral regions.</p>
<p>In terms of funding, the Commission will follow the priorities identified in the guidelines. In this context, it has to be noted that TENs budget line does not represent the only source of Community funding for infrastructure projects, and that many transport projects in peripheral regions receive significant Community financial support through the Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds.</p>
<p>The Commission will ensure that priority is given to the promotion of rail and maritime links. To this end, the Commission has followed and will continue to follow the limits set by Parliament in the notes to the Community yearly budget and now also included in the revised TENs financial regulation. This means that at least 55% of the TEN-T (transport) budget be allocated to rail projects (including combined transport). For maritime transport, the Commission is keen that the TEN-T be amended to include the key ports, and hopes that agreement on this proposal is reached shortly. These funds place particular emphasis on connections and interconnections with TEN-T where they need to be completed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The “Friob” study, to which the honourable Member referred in his question, was the result of the Commission’s obligation under Directive 81/670/EEC (Article 4(1)) to produce a comparative analysis of the requirements applied in each Member State for issuing pilots’ licences on an equal basis. This analysis, which was carried out in 1993, was intended to assist Member States in assessing the equivalence of licences issued by other Member States. It is not a legally binding document and hence, Member States can not use it to refuse to accept licences issued by other Member States. The Commission has not received, in the case in point, any complaints from Italian pilots whose licences would not be recognised on the basis of this analysis. </p>
<p>Directive 91/670/EEC still remains the only legal basis for the mutual recognition of pilots’ licences. In this respect, it must be noted that if the directive (Article 3(1)) obliges Member States to accept equivalent licences issued by other Member States, it further stipulates (Article 4 (3)) that should a host country have reasonable doubt as to the equivalence of a licence – particularly taking into account the aforementioned comparative analysis – then it can insist upon further requirements or additional tests before accepting it.

<p>All the Member States were to have implemented the 'electricity directive' in 1999 but not all have yet managed to do so. Denmark has taken the opportunity to carry out an overall reform of the electricity sector based on complete liberalisation of market access together with the introduction of quotas for CO2 emissions and quotas for renewable energy. Part of the Danish legislation is to be approved by the Commission, which has not yet been done. This means that the new quota system designed to reduce CO2 emissions cannot be introduced. It also means, however, that Danish windmill owners cannot obtain the price for their electricity that they were led to expect.</p>

<p>The Commission welcomes the Danish approach to liberalising the electricity market and to open up fully the Danish electricity market to competition. In principle, the Commission also welcomes the Danish quota system for CO2 emissions as a cost efficient approach towards reducing the CO2 emissions from the electricity sector.</p>
<p>However, the way in which the Danish Government has proposed to allocate CO2 emission quotas only to incumbent electricity producers (“grandfathering”) could unduly distort the functioning of the internal electricity market, and in particular the establishment of new generation capacity hence hampering the entrance of new players into the market.</p>
<p>The Commission has had a fruitful dialogue recently with the Danish authorities with a view to find a mutually satisfactory solution. On 17 February 2000, the Members of the Commission responsible for energy and transport on the one part and for competition matters on the other had meetings with the Danish Minister for Environment and Energy, Mr Auken, to discuss the Danish schemes and it is hoped and expected that a balanced solution will be found soon. The Danish authorities have given a commitment to the Commission to amend Danish legislation on CO2 quotas in case of an application to construct new power generation capacity in Denmark in order not to discriminate against new entrants.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Commission has adopted on 8 March a Green Paper on “Emissions Trading within the EC” setting out options and questions in relation to the trading of CO2 in a Community context, for consultation of all concerned.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of the support scheme for renewables for electricity generation in the form of a green certificate system, the Danish Government has decided to notify the part of the scheme which concerns new plants under a proposed new set of guidelines regarding state aid to environmental protection which the Commission hopes can enter into force in a matter of a few months following consultation of Member States this month. The Commission will decide on the other aspects of the notified scheme shortly.</p>
<p>More generally the Commission is working on a draft Directive aimed at promoting renewable sources of electricity production in the internal market for electricity.

<p>The investigations performed by the Commission have revealed that Commission competence is not involved in this case.</p>
<p>In particular, as far as Euratom safeguards is concerned, the falsifications do not have any consequences, since operators' declarations for safeguards purposes are based on pellet weights and not diameter measurements.

<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The document relating to the costs of transition to competition (CTC) for Spanish companies is currently being reviewed in the context of the rules pertaining to state aid, which form an integral part of competition policy. When analysing the compatibility between state aid and the common market, the Commission should at all times ensure that the distortion of competition unavoidably created by the aid does not adversely affect trade to the extent that it goes against public interest. As for competition policy, its ultimate aim is to protect the end consumer.

<p>The Commission underlines that reconstruction in Kosovo is well underway. The Commission in fact began the first steps even before the conflict, carrying out a damage assessment in late 1998 the provisional results of which were presented in February 1999. The fact that this damage assessment already existed permitted a rapid update, once access to Kosovo was again possible in June 1999, and use it as a basis for the international community's reconstruction efforts in Kosovo.</p>
<p>In late June and early July 1999, the Commission sent a Task Force of officials to Pristina. This Task Force was intended as an interim measure until the Kosovo Reconstruction Agency could be established. As the honourable Member is aware, the establishment of the Agency took somewhat longer than foreseen, with files currently being transferred to the Agency which has finally replaced the Task Force. In a few short months, the Commission's Task Force succeeded in committing a total of EUR 127 m, over EUR 50 m of which was already contracted by the end of 1999. The Task Force has, in effect, shown what can be achieved when suitably flexible procedures are available, and it is hoped that the Agency will continue this success. As far as fair distribution of funding between nationalities is concerned, the priorities for funding are agreed with the UN Mission on the spot (UNMIK).</p>
<p>Apart from the implementation of Community assistance, the Commission is also involved in the wider international effort, working with the major international financial institutions and actors, having responsibility with the World Bank for donor coordination. The Commission is also fully involved in the work of the United Nations (UN) civil administration in Kosovo, where the Union has special responsibility for "pillar 4", dealing with economic reconstruction, recovery and development.</p>
<p>Full details of the assistance provided to Kosovo from the Community budget, by Member States and by other donors are available on the web-site of the Joint Office of the Commission and the World Bank: www.seerecon.org as well as full details of the two Kosovo Donors' Conferences which the Commission has organised, with the World Bank.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0140"></a>

<p>On 19 January 2000, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe met to prepare a special session of the UN General Assembly due to take place on 5-9 June 2000 in New York to assess the situation of women five years on from the Beijing World Conference on Women, which adopted a platform for action to tackle the problems faced by women at international level.</p>
<p>During the proceedings, the Swiss Foreign Minister, Mrs Ruth Dreifuss, stated that 300 000 women were victims of trafficking in Europe.</p>
<p>Does the Commission concur with that statement? Does it consider that the measures it is taking are sufficient to guarantee the safety and dignity of women in Europe in the face of the threat of trafficking?

<p>The Swiss Foreign Minister was certainly right in saying that there are several thousands of women being victims of trafficking in Europe each year. It is, however, by definition almost impossible to confirm an exact figure such as 300 000 since there is a lack of reliable statistics and data. The Commission recognises however that trafficking is a growing phenomenon and one striking feature is the increase in numbers of women trafficked into the Union coming from Central and Eastern European Countries.</p>
<p>The Union has since 1996 developed a wide policy in the fight against trafficking in women. Its objective is to involve all those responsible in the fight against this degrading and serious form of violation of human rights and dignity. Action is needed throughout the trafficking chain of recruiters, transporters, exploiters and clients. Preventive and repressive measures, as well as support to the victims, are taken and are essential. Because this phenomenon is world-wide, the Union is also actively engaged in international cooperation.</p>
<p>The Joint Action of February 1997, whereby the Member States agreed to review their criminal laws on trafficking, is part of the “acquis” which must taken on board by the candidate countries. Under the existing STOP Programme the involvement of partners from the candidate countries has also steadily increased over the years.</p>
<p>For the future the Commission, as indicated in its work programme 2000 is committed to present detailed proposals to approximate the penal provisions of the Member States as regards trafficking. When adopted, they will form a part of the “acquis” to be implemented also in the candidate countries. The Commission’s intention is to include the issue of temporary residence permits for victims who are ready to provide evidence in front of courts. In addition, the Commission will draft a proposal for the renewal of the STOP Programme, which will be opened up to the candidate countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0142"></a>

<p>The Commission has become increasingly concerned in general about the welfare of animals.</p>
<p>The Commission’s responsibilities towards animal protection have increased under the recent amendment of the Treaty. A Protocol to the EC Treaty on the welfare and protection of animals requires the European institutions and Member States to consider animal welfare a priority when drawing up agriculture, transport, single market and research policies.</p>
<p>Community legislation is drawn up on the basis of the results of scientific research and practical knowledge, both of which indicate that animal transport is feasible if specific conditions to protect animals are met.</p>
<p>Community animal welfare legislation is under revision in line with new scientific knowledge and practical experience in the field.</p>
<p>The scientific Committee on Animal welfare recently adopted a report on standards concerning temperature and humidity conditions in the transport of cattle, pigs, sheep and goats in vehicles for journeys over 8 hours. The report will serve as a basis for new legislative proposals by the Commission.</p>
<p>Concerning the experience of Member States derived from the application of Directive 91/628/EEC a specific report will be presented to the Council and to Parliament before June 2000. The report will include the data submitted by Member States and those derived from the inspections by the Food and Veterinary Office.</p>
<p>The Commission may consider amending current Community legislation on the basis of the conclusions of the above-mentioned report and following the recent opinion of the scientific committee on animal welfare.</p>
<p>Furthermore the Commission has started to negotiate the participation of the Community in the revised "European Convention for the protection of animals during international transport". This will help ensure an acceptable level of animal welfare protection in Europe and accelerate the process of harmonisation of legislation on animal protection in the candidate countries.</p>
<p>In this framework, and given the priority of the subject, the issue of long distance transport of animals and in particular the importation of horses in the Community from Central and Eastern European Countries, will be discussed and analysed in the 7th meeting of the Working Group of Chief Veterinary Officers of the Associated Countries that will be held in Lisbon on 11/14 April 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is aware of safety issues including the need for fire prevention. It is aware that effective fire prevention requires measures to be taken by the national or local authorities in all relevant areas such as building standards, requirements concerning the reactions and resistance to fire, fire exit arrangements, fire-fighting equipment (sprinklers) and public information. A coherent policy can therefore only be carried out at the appropriate national level.</p>
<p>Requirements regarding inflammable furniture are only one of the fire safety aspects. In the absence of harmonisation at Community level regarding these products, it is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure the protection of health and safety of persons and property on the basis of national rules adopted to this end. In addition, under the provisions of the Treaty (Articles 28 to 30) the principle of mutual recognition of these products and testing and certification procedures makes it possible to avoid unjustified obstacles to trade.</p>
<p>In addition, the CEN (European Committee for Standardisation) has developed methods of testing inflammability of furniture. These standards must be used as a reference for the purposes of mutual recognition referred to above. Finally, the Commission has immediate plans to proposed amendments to the directive on the general safety of products when it will introduce the concept of ‘presumption of conformity’ in order to ensure a consistent and high level of consumer protection. In this way, products meeting the European standards drawn up by the European standardisation bodies acting under instructions from the Commission, will be considered to comply with the safety criteria laid down by the directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0149"></a>

The time-lag between the subsidy application and actual funding is growing, and the ongoing funding of projects is jeopardised.

<p>A generalised call for proposals in the field of Democracy and Human Rights was launched on 17 June 1999 aimed at improving access to Community grants on a basis of transparency and equal access for non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The launching of the call for proposals was delayed, partly due to the adoption only in May 1999 by the Council and Parliament of the regulations which constitute the legal basis for financing actions in this field.</p>
<p>The proposals selected did not include several submitted by NGOs working in the field of torture victims which had previously enjoyed Community support. In an attempt to meet the needs of good projects which were not selected, 8 torture victim projects have been placed on the reserve list of the call for proposals in order to proceed with them as soon as funds become available under the 2000 budget. A further eight proposals have been earmarked as potential targeted projects within a global amount of some &#x80;million to be made available under the 2000 budget. The Commission is in touch with the organisations concerned.</p>
<p>The priority given in the Call for Proposals to projects over EUR 500 000 reflected the need to manage projects effectively with the resources available, and to reduce the delays which have occurred in this area. However, the priority given to larger projects was not, in itself, prejudicial to those concerning torture victims. Firstly, small projects were not excluded. The guidelines expressly stated that up to 30% of the total available for the call for proposals would go to proposals under EUR 500 000. Secondly, attaching priority to larger projects encouraged NGOs to cooperate in their requests for funds which several successfully did. Thirdly, many of the proposals presented were for sums exceeding EUR 500 000.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that many NGOs have faced uncertainty and lack of clarity over their funding. The Commission is making major efforts to address these problems. However, given the need to prioritise and to ensure sound financial management, it will always be the case not all requests for support in this area can be guaranteed funding.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0152"></a>

<p>The Greek Agriculture Minister recently announced government measures to limit the area of land devoted to cotton-growing throughout Greece. The measures rest on the legal basis of the EU concerning the protection of the environment from nitrate pollution and on the Commission’s proposals for a new regulation on cotton. The Commission has announced that it has made an application to the Court of Justice against Greece for its failure to adopt the codes of good agricultural practice and the action programmes required under Directive 91/676<a href="#defann_61_1" name="refann_61_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources.</p>
<p>In the light of the above, is Greece able to take measures to restrict cotton-growing throughout the country, invoking Directive 91/676 as its justification, even though it has not adopted codes of good agricultural practice or action programmes? Since there are no action programmes, which crops will be allowed on the land which is withdrawn from cotton? Will those who are forced to stop growing cotton receive compensation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Council Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources is non-specific in that it is not directed towards any particular livestock or crop sector but rather towards the protection of water. It sets down a series of steps, which must be taken when an area is deemed to be nitrate vulnerable, namely the obligatory respect of nitrate-related good practice together with the implementation of ad hoc action plans. These steps involve restrictions, which concern the use of nitrogen largely in so far as timing and application rates are concerned and appropriate crop rotations (including winter cover of the soil) in order to avoid nitrogen leaching and erosion.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently examining a draft action programme for nitrates in Thessaly, which envisages certain restrictions on nitrogen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it should be recalled that now under Regulation (EC) n° 1257/99 for rural development Member States have to draw Codes of Good Agricultural Practices as a threshold beyond which agri-environmental measures will apply.</p>
<p>As for limitations on cotton growing, from the information available in the Commission, the recent decisions of the Greek Government seem to take into account the proposed reform of the Common Market Organisation for cotton, which is under discussion in the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission would like to remind the honourable Member that, pursuant to Article 255 (ex Article 191A) of the EC Treaty, the Council and the European Parliament’s proposal for a regulation on public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, adopted by the Commission on 26 January 2000, aims to establish general principles and restrictions for the rights of access to all institutional documents enjoyed by European citizens and all natural or legal persons resident, or based, in one of the Member States. </p>
<p>This legislative proposal is not in any way intended to govern interinstitutional relations between Parliament and the Commission. </p>
<p>The question of access by Parliament to Commission documents is currently the subject of negotiations with Parliament as part of broader negotiations with Parliament on the Framework Agreement (ex-Code of Conduct).

<p>The Commission for its part considers that the Agreement drawn up in March 1999 between Mr Oreja for the Commission and Mrs Theato and Mr de Giovanni for Parliament, but which was never approved by Parliament in plenary sitting, should form the basis for the negotiation. The Commission is awaiting a substantive reaction from Parliament.</p>

<p>The Commission Decision 1999/830/EC of 26 October 1999, on the national provisions notified by Denmark on the use of sulphites, nitrites and nitrates in foodstuffs, rejected the request for Danish national legislation to be maintained since this is not compatible with Directive 95/2/EC on food additives.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 95(4) of the EC Treaty, the Danish Government justified its request for a derogation based on the rules of free movement in the internal market considering that the provisions of Directive 95/2/EC, with regard to the three substances in question, represented a consumer health risks. </p>
<p>However, it could not be ascertained from the information presented by Denmark in support of its request that the request was justifiable or necessary for the protection of public health, and that no measure which would be less obstructive to trade could be allowed.

<p>In its Communication of 30 July 1996 setting out the new European Community Disability Strategy, the Commission made clear its commitment to a rights-based equal opportunities approach to disability.</p>
<p>Since then, the Commission has paid particular attention to the employment needs of people with disabilities. Guideline Nine of the National Action Plans for Employment says that Member States will give special attention to those needs and develop appropriate forms of both preventative and active policies to promote disabled people's integration into the labour market.</p>
<p>In November 1999, the Commission adopted proposals for an anti-discrimination package based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty which gives the Community new powers in this field. These proposals include a draft Directive to outlaw discrimination in employment on any of the grounds mentioned in Article 13, including disability.</p>
<p>However, until this package becomes law, the Commission is not in a position to intervene in the case mentioned by the Honourable Member.

<p>The euro is currently about 10% below its level of January 1999 on a trade-weighted basis. This decline mainly reflects movements in the bilateral exchange rates against the US dollar, sterling and the Japanese yen. While the euro depreciation is substantial, it has not reflected any disorderly behaviour in foreign exchange markets. Moreover, the depreciation in the euro is only 6.5% with respect to its level in May 1998 when the decision to launch the third stage of economic and monetary union (EMU) was taken.</p>
<p>The implications of the euro depreciation for output growth and inflation in the euro area are limited. This is because of the relatively closed nature of the euro-area economy. The share of external trade in euro-area GDP is about 16% - only moderately greater than the 12% share in the US economy. On the other hand, it cannot be complacent about the inflationary effect of recent exchange rate developments. Indeed, such considerations contributed to the European central bank's (ECB) decision to raise its main refinancing rate on 3 February.</p>
<p>The evolution in the euro exchange rate can be explained by two main factors.</p>
<p>The first is the unexpectedly robust performance in the US economy relative to that of the euro area.</p>
<p>The second is the unwinding of euro-denominated investments made in the months preceding the launch of EMU. At that time, enthusiasm for EMU was at a high point and markets were concerned about the implications of the Russian debt default for the US economy and financial system.</p>
<p>As economic growth rates in the US and euro-area converge in coming years, a significant appreciation in the euro is to be expected.</p>
<p>Finally, the historical link between the euro, the ECU and the US dollar is indeed complex. The euro was introduced at parity with the ECU on 1 January 1999 as provided in the Treaty. The honourable Member rightly recalls that the ECU, when created in 1978, was identical in value and composition to the European Unit of Account (EUA). This latter unit was introduced in 1975 for the purpose of expressing currency amounts in the Lomé agreement. The EUA was constituted in such a way that its value was equal, when it was created on 28 June 1974, to one Special Drawing Right (SDR). The value of the SDR was initially at parity with the USD.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0171"></a>

Given that there are clearly veterinary problems with reindeer meat from the Kola peninsula, that slaughter and hygiene are not monitored there, and that the same principles are not applied to them as in EU countries, the decision is very dubious.

<p>Prior to its accession to the Communities, Sweden imported reindeer meat from Russia. Under Community legislation this was no longer possible. At the repeated requests of the Swedish and Russian governments, an inspection team from the Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission visited the Murmansk region of north western Russia in October 1998. Its purpose was to assess the structure, organisation and legal powers of the veterinary services in the field of animal and public health as well as the actual health situation on the ground in the region inspected.</p>
<p>The report of that mission was submitted to Parliament on 11 February 1999.</p>
<p>The inspection team comprised two Commission officials, and one official from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture. Severe difficulties were encountered during the organisation of this mission due to the very slow response from the central veterinary services in Russia. Furthermore, although two of the inspectors were fluent in Russian, it proved impossible to obtain official interpretation support for the third inspector. For these reasons, it was necessary to take exceptional measures, which fell outside normal Food and Veterinary Office practices, to ensure the successful performance and completion of the mission. To this end, the assistance of an interpreter for the third inspector, provided through the Swedish-owned exporting company, was accepted. In addition, the mission programme was finalised with the regional, rather than the central, official veterinary services, with assistance from the Swedish exporting company. A director of that company travelled with the team to assist with travel arrangements but did not actively participate in the mission or in the evaluation of the findings by the mission team. The performance of the mission and the reporting of its findings, conclusions and recommendations were in no way prejudiced by this arrangement. All travel and accommodation arrangements were made fully in accordance with Commission rules and were paid for directly by the inspection team.</p>
<p>The mission inspected all aspects of reindeer meat production, including disease monitoring and meat handling, and found that the veterinary controls and health situation in the region inspected were largely acceptable, subject to the receipt of satisfactory assurances from the Russian authorities, which were forthcoming. The mission also found that the Murmansk region was practically self-contained and sufficiently isolated from other regions of Russia, with good regional veterinary services and animal health situation. The mission did not investigate quality issues as these fall outside the scope of a veterinary inspection.</p>
<p>On 12 January 2000 the Commission presented draft proposals to the Standing Veterinary Committee which had the effect of permitting the import of reindeer meat from the Murmansk region of Russia inspected by the Commission.

<p>Turkey's application for membership of the EU has prompted questions from people concerned about democracy, human rights and minority rights. What strategy has the Commission defined on spelling out a route for Turkey towards satisfying the Copenhagen criteria (which specify respect for minorities as an accession requirement)? What changes to the law do the Commission's legal experts feel are necessary? Has a detailed and clear agenda been drawn up for establishing respect for minorities and the fascinating cultural diversity in Turkey? How constructive is the attitude of the Turkish authorities, and what contribution are they themselves making?</p>
<p>Is there also a discussion with the Turkish authorities to encourage them to engage in peace talks on the conflict concerning the rights of the Kurdish minority, as has been the case in Northern Ireland for some time now? Is there to be a European peace fund, modelled on the fund for Ireland, to build bridges between the communities involved?

<p>A centrepiece of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey, launched at the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999, is the Accession Partnership (AP) to be prepared by the Commission before adoption by the Council. The aim of this AP is mainly to set out priorities to be implemented by Turkey in all the fields of the Copenhagen criteria (including the political field) with a view to Union membership. In parallel, Turkey, as the other candidate countries, will have to decide on a National Programme for the adoption of the acquis (NPAA), which sets out the way in which the priorities of the AP will be implemented in terms of a precise timetable, human and financial resources. The first AP and NPAA will be adopted before the end of this year.</p>
<p>As Turkey does not fulfil for the moment the political Copenhagen criteria, it is clear that the AP/NPAA will have to cover this field substantially. As far as the AP is concerned, the main basis for the definition of short or medium-term priorities will be the last regular reports on Turkey provided by the Commission. The 1999 regular report identifies main shortcomings and deficiencies in the political field, notably concerning the issue of the protection of minorities. The Commission is currently working on how the AP could better cover this issue.</p>
<p>On all questions to be covered in the AP, the Turkish authorities will be consulted at the appropriate moment in order to be able to reflect the AP priorities in the NPAA they have to prepare.</p>
<p>As far as the Kurdish issue is concerned, the Commission continues to support a civil solution to the situation that prevails in the south-eastern part of the country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0184"></a>

<p>The Commission has become increasingly concerned in general about the welfare of animals.</p>
<p>The Commission’s responsibilities towards animal protection have increased under the recent amendment of the Treaty. A protocol to EC Treaty on the welfare and protection of animals requires the European institutions and Member States to consider animal welfare a priority when drawing up agriculture, transport, single market and research policies.</p>
<p>Article 6 of Council Directive 91/630/EEC laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs provides for the possibility to prepare appropriate proposals to improve the welfare conditions of farmed pigs in the Community on the basis of a specific report from the scientific veterinary committee on animal welfare.</p>
<p>This report has been adopted by the scientific committee, and it addresses different recommendations to improve the welfare conditions of pigs kept in intensive conditions, such as that pigs except boars and sows kept in farrowing crates, should not be housed in social isolation.</p>
<p>The Commission will submit a proposal to amend the present legislation based on these recommendations and practical experiences of the Member States before September 2000.</p>
<p>The draft Commission proposal, which is under preparation, will envisage in particular provisions for the keeping of sows in groups and establishing separate areas for the performance of their normal behaviour patterns. The Commission will also take into consideration socio-economic implications when envisaging measures such as the ones related to the ban of individual sow stalls.

<p>Statistical errors, inaccuracies in the monitoring of samples and downright negligence are causing problems with the monitoring of possible salmonella infection in imported meat. In the summer of 1999, two people in Huddinge died as a result of eating infected French turkey breast. Sweden invested considerable resources in combating salmonella before it joined the EU. In fact salmonella is causing significantly more damage than the BSE crisis has done. In 1997 the Swedish Food Safety Authority carried out a large-scale investigation of imported meat, which unfortunately showed that salmonella was present in 12 out of 569 samples. A further investigation will probably be carried out this year.</p>

<p>First of all the Commission would like to explain the legislative framework of checks and controls of products of animal origin made in the Community. Member States apply the provisions of Directive 89/662/EEC concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade. With the completion of the internal market in 1992, checks are made at the place of production of goods according to the rules laid down in Community veterinary legislation. At the place of destination, the authority may check the goods by means of non-discriminatory spot-checks to verify compliance with the checks at origin. These rules should ensure that health is protected.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned Directive also lays down the rules for procedures to be followed if the Member State of destination considers the control measures at origin inadequate. As a first step, the two Member States together seek ways of remedying the situation. In cases of repeated irregularities, the Member State of destination shall inform the Commission and the veterinary department of the other Member States.</p>
<p>In the case of Sweden, specific rules apply as regards salmonella, which were agreed in the context of the Act of adhesion. Primarily, the consignments of fresh poultry, beef, veal and pig meat shall be tested for salmonella at the establishment of origin and the results must be negative. The results of the testing shall be available in the documents following the consignment.</p>
<p>In the case referred to in the question of the honourable Member, the Swedish and French authorities have been in contact in accordance with Directive 89/662/EEC. Since no further events have occurred, the Commission has not deemed it necessary at this stage to take further action.</p>
<p>Finally, no Member State, including Sweden, has made a request to change the provisions concerning the so-called salmonella guarantees. Should that happen, however, the Commission would naturally study the initiative, and prepare necessary proposals, if the request is deemed appropriate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0197"></a>

<p>The question concerns payments by card in the context of electronic commerce. The honourable Member suggests the development of chargeback mechanisms to enhance consumer confidence. The Commission shares this idea.</p>
<p>The term chargebacks covers facilities offered to consumers who paid for goods or services with a payment instrument (usually a card) to dispute certain or all aspects of the transaction through the issuer of the payment instrument. These facilities are diverse, complex and differ from Member State to Member State. Essentially they are based on the idea that the contract for the purchase of goods and services and the payment form an economic or legal unit.</p>
<p>Experience in the United States, where extensive chargeback rights and services are available to consumers, shows the very positive effects chargebacks have had for consumer confidence in distance selling and more recently electronic commerce. According to the American authorities chargeback rights and services have also contributed significantly to the growth of the payment card sector itself.</p>
<p>In the Community the picture is rather complex. For payments within a Member State, national rules apply. For cross-border payments the international card associations have systems in place. But these systems are voluntary and their use varies from Member State to Member State. Consumers tend to be little aware of these systems.</p>
<p>This is an unsatisfactory situation. Attempts to come to more coordination have been made. The Organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) Committee on Consumer Policy has had for a number of years a working group on the issue. In December 1999, the OECD adopted guidelines on consumer protection in electronic commerce. They highlight the importance of chargebacks as a powerful tool to enhance consumer confidence and state that they should be further developed and their use should become more widespread.</p>
<p>At Community level a number of legal provisions already exist that relate to chargebacks.</p>
<p>Article 11of the consumer credit Directive (87/102) provides that the consumer who has paid for goods or services by means of credit can, under certain circumstances, exercise claims against the grantor of the credit, where he is unable to exercise his claims against the seller of the goods or services. The Commission is currently preparing a revision of this Directive. The Commission intents to submit a formal proposal before the end of this year.</p>
<p>Article 8 of Directive 97/7 on distance selling provides that the consumer can ask for cancellation of a payment where fraudulent use has been made of his payment card in connection with distance contracts, and be recredited with the sums paid. The proposed Directive on distance selling of financial services contains identical provisions.</p>
<p>Also Commission Recommendation 97/489 on transactions by electronic payment instruments is relevant. It contains provisions on liability in case of unauthorised transactions. The Commission is studying the degree of implementation of this Recommendation. Should the Commission encounters problems with this, it will present a proposal for a Directive.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the lack of consumer confidence in on-line payments is a major barrier to the development of electronic commerce. That is why it intends to elaborate further on this issue in the context of overall strategy on electronic commerce.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0224"></a>

<p>As far as the origin marking for products marketed in the Community is concerned, there exists no marking system at Community level. Member States legislation applies in this field. In the particular case of ceramics, the Commission will consequently not propose any specific legislation on origin marking.</p>
<p>The Community is currently involved in the international harmonisation of non-preferential rules of origin. In this context, the World trade organisation (WTO) Agreement on Rules of Origin stipulates that, if marking systems are based on the origin concept, then harmonised origin rules should apply. The origin rule supported by the Community at the WTO negotiations is that the country of origin of ceramic products should be the country where the firing of the products took place (origin rule currently applied in the Community). Consequently, depending on the production costs, such process might not always represent 90% of the value of the finished article.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the absence of Community origin marking system, European producers have at their disposal national and Community instruments to help the consumer to distinguish between European and imported products.

<p>The Commission shares entirely the concern of the honourable Member – setting up an enterprise in Europe is often too cumbersome and time-consuming.</p>
<p>However, the time it takes to set up a business varies widely across the Community. It takes in average more time in the Community than in the United States (US), but there has been progress in some Member States. Further, time to set up an enterprise is not the only important factor affecting entrepreneurs. The main difference between the Community and US is the lack of a dynamic enterprise culture in Europe. Other reasons are the complexity of procedures, lack of seed and venture capital, higher costs, slowness in Internet take-up and e-commerce, and often the lack of second chance after a bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The Commission has shown in its BEST Report<a href="#defann_79_1" name="refann_79_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> all aspects impacting on entrepreneurship and enterprise. One priority is the simplification of the formalities involved in business start-up as a priority. That is why, while recognising that this is primarily a matter for national governments, the Commission has encouraged Member States to address this problem and has supported their efforts to find simpler and better solutions. Other areas are education and training, access to finance and better public administration.</p>
<p>The BEST Report calls on Member States to facilitate the creation of enterprises. Under the follow-up<a href="#defann_79_2" name="refann_79_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span> to this report, the Commission is monitoring and evaluating progress made by the Member States. It is also sharing information about good practices. The Commission will report on the follow-up later this year.</p>
<p>Further, under its Concerted Actions<a href="#defann_79_3" name="refann_79_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup">3</span>, the Commission assists Member States in exchanging good practices. A good example is the French Centres de formalités d’entreprises, which have greatly simplified procedures for start-ups. Moreover, there is encouraging evidence of Member States learning from each other's experience. Thus the Portuguese Centro de Formalidades das Empresas network, which has reduced normal start-up times for businesses from around six months to around fifteen days, exploited the French experience.</p>
<p>Benchmarking is an important tool to show differences and progress. The Commission will continue benchmarking between Member States and vis-à-vis Japan and the US in the field of entrepreneurship and innovation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Promoting the take up of e-commerce amongst small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is a priority of the e-Europe initiative adopted by the Commission in December 1999. Action 3, "Accelerating e-commerce", insists that Europe needs to accelerate the growth of e-commerce, especially for SMEs, so that they can consider the whole European market as their market. This requires a reliable Internal Market legal framework for e-commerce, which provides legal certainty, removes barriers to cross-border services, encourages on-line innovation and consumer trust. To this end, a number of legal initiatives are under way at Community level. Their adoption by the end of 2000 and rapid transposition to national laws is a Commission priority, as is expressed in the Commission’s contribution “An Agenda of economic and social renewal for Europe” to the special European Council in Lisbon. In addition, e-Europe proposes the launch by Member States and the Commission of a campaign to help SMEs “go digital” by facilitating the transfer of technical know-how through traineeships and a network of centres of expertise. The said campaign should also be launched by the end of 2000.</p>
<p>In addition, a number of concrete actions have also been launched recently to help SMEs to access the electronic market. Typical examples are the WEBTRADER scheme which aims at putting in place an on-line certification and arbitration programme for enterprises in 7 Member States (Alternative Dispute Resolution-ADR scheme), the EUROECOM project to promote the start up of pan-European projects in the area of electronic commerce in several regions, the IECOMM project (international electronic commerce for SMEs) which aims at fostering of international electronic commerce within SMEs through an on-line service, the TECHSPHERE project setting up an Internet based network for various services addressed to SMEs. The SCREEN (Small and Craft Enterprises Electronic Networking) is another example (http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg23/craft/craft-screen/craft-screen.html). It works through a consortia of regional business support organisations and involves enterprises testing existing on-line support services for E-commerce and exchanging information at European level on successful small businesses involved in E-commerce.</p>
<p>Furthermore, electronic commerce standardisation and in general consensus building initiatives have been launched in close cooperation with European standardisation organisations to promote open electronic marketplaces in several industrial sectors and, after a targeted awareness campaign, attract interested parties including SMEs, through their European associations, to come to industry agreements, codes of conduct etc. in the form of European committee for standardisation (CEN) Workshop Agreements or open specifications representing a self-regulatory scheme (ECOM-IS: Electronic Commerce Open Marketplace in Industry Sectors) (</p>
<p>The Commission recognises the crucial importance of consumer confidence for E-commerce, in particular for SMEs. Unless consumer confidence is broad-based, large companies will dominate the market. The Commission is working on an initiative in the context of e-Europe to promote consumer confidence.</p>
<p>This year, "The School of Tomorrow" is a key issue addressed within the IST (Information Society and Technologies) Programme. The new Minerva action of the Socrates Programme, devoted to the critical and responsible use of new technologies in education is addressing this issue strategically from an educational, pedagogical and organisational perspective. The Comenius action for schools will also contribute to the launch of collaborative projects, thematic networks and the dissemination of best practices in this field. These actions will contribute to the implementation of e-Europe in particular making sure that by the end of 2003 all pupils should be “digitally literate ” by the time they leave school. In cooperation with the Member States the initiative eLearning will be adopted by the Commission in order to ensure that the e-Europe targets are reached and to promote the widespread introduction of innovation in education. It will be presented to the Council of Education Ministers on June 8, 2000. The e-Europe initiative also sets the target that all schools in Europe should be connected to Internet by 2001.</p>
<p>The European Schoolnet (http://www.eun.org) initiative brings together 20 Ministries of Education, national school administrations and school networks in cooperation with the Commission. Its objectives are to foster and support school cooperation in Europe, to provide high quality pedagogical and information services on the Internet with a European added value, to support the professional development of teachers and to provide a framework for cooperation between the Commission and the Member States. A major conference "Learning in the New Millennium. Building New Education Strategies for Schools" will take place on March 20-21, 2000 in Brussels in partnership with the ICT industry.</p>
<p>The Commission’s Netd@ys Europe (http://www.netdays2000.org) initiative is aiming to raise awareness in schools and elsewhere of the potential value of using the Internet, as a teaching and learning resource. It is now in its fourth year and is the largest event of its kind in the world. Taking place this year on November 20-27 it will, amongst other things, aim to reduce barriers to learning ensuring equality of access for people of all ages, including those who live in disadvantaged and isolated areas and those with special needs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0234"></a>

Moreover, the relevant decisions have been taken without any dialogue or negotiations with trade unions and European works councils.

<p>These issues are dealt with in the report from the Commission to Parliament and the Council on the implementation of the Directive which the Commission will adopt in the coming weeks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0239"></a>

<p>Member States are required under the Environment impact assessment (EIA) Directive (Directive 85/337/EEC<a href="#defann_84_1" name="refann_84_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> on the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, as amended by Directive 97/11/EC<a href="#defann_84_2" name="refann_84_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span>), to ensure that an environmental impact assessment is carried out before development consent is given for projects likely to have significant effects on the environment. For the purpose of the Directive, project means the execution of construction works or of other installations or schemes or other interventions in the natural surrounding.</p>
<p>For projects falling within Annex II of the Directive Member States have to ensure that an environmental assessment is carried out where they consider that the projects will be likely to have a significant environmental effect (Articles 2(1) and 4(2)). The developments identified in the Crowe Report would presumably fall under category 10(b) of Annex II, urban development projects. In determining whether an Environmental Impact Assessment would be required for the entire planned venture rather than for separate and specific site developments, it is necessary to consider whether the entire venture would constitute one single project for the purpose of the EIA Directive. According to the information in our possession, this would not be the case. In this respect, it should be noted, however, that the Directive requires to evaluate in the environmental assessment process the cumulative effects (where they are significant) of individual projects on the environment.</p>
<p>According to the Commission's information, the Crowe Report does not constitute an application for development consent for a project. In that context it would not appear that the adoption of the Crowe Report requires an Environmental Impact Assessment.</p>
<p>As far as plans/programmes are concerned, the future Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive will expand the principle of Environmental Assessment to the planning level. However, since this instrument is still under discussion, it is not yet a legal requirement in Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The main issue to be dealt with at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit will be the fight against unemployment. According to data compiled by the Commission itself, in the last eight years since the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty and with the broadening of the criteria for convergence and the Stability Pact, we have been witnessing a stabilisation of monetary conditions, a growth in GDP and in productivity per man-hour, but at the same time there is a worrying increase in unemployment, labour deregulation, insecure jobs and social exclusion, combined with a reduction in social security benefits.</p>
<p>In view of these contradictory developments, with positive economic figures and negative unemployment figures, does the Commission not consider that the criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability Pact should be revised?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The employment situation has improved considerably in recent years, with the average unemployment rate in the 15 Member States at its lowest level since 1992.</p>
<p>This is partly due to the framework of macroeconomic stability that has been established with Economic and Monetary Union. It is also partly due to policies to improve the functioning of labour markets that Member States have pursued. These policies go beyond deregulation of labour markets to embrace a comprehensive approach, including in particular a shift from passive measures to active measures aimed at improving employability.</p>
<p>More active employment policies and reforms in labour markets - in line with the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the Employment Guidelines - have given rise to improved labour market performance. In particular, through a comprehensive, preventive approach to employment policies and through contributing to a progressive shift from passive spending to active spending measures, as mandated by the Florence European Council in 1996.</p>
<p>However, unemployment, much of it structural and long-term, remains unacceptably high, and is the prime cause of social exclusion in the Community. Therefore, one of the Commission's proposals for the Lisbon European Council is that Member States commit themselves to a return to full employment. The main policy strands for achieving this should be the pursuit of economic reforms and the strengthening of the European social model through investing in people.</p>
<p>The Convergence Programmes and the Stability and Growth Pact have played and will continue to play a crucial role in establishing a stable macroeconomic environment, which is a necessary condition for achieving sustainable growth and employment. Therefore the Commission does not consider that the convergence criteria or the Stability and Growth Pact should be revised.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
