<p class="contents">Central to that meeting were areas that are of major importance to the public, such as the economy, and the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We also discussed the issue of ‘Communicating Europe’,<span class="italic"> </span>namely improving communication and interaction between politicians and citizens across Europe. Finally, we debated a number of topical external issues, including Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent developments in my own country give me no choice but to start with the topic of freedom, security and justice. Those developments illustrate in an unpleasant but powerful manner that a further step in cooperation in those areas is indispensable.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very indebted to you, Mr President, for the words of support and solidarity which you spoke to the Dutch Government and the entire Dutch community on 15 November. Allow me to react to those words in my national capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Netherlands is proud of its diversity. Since the Second World War, we have received large groups of people from many countries – some because they were persecuted, others because they could build a better future with us and were welcome reinforcements on our labour market. The contribution of those people in terms of quality of our society is immense and is appreciated.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, they, and their relatives, belong among us, and that ‘belonging’ requires consideration and effort from both parties. Integration is a complex issue that touches on identity, standards and values, as well as getting to know and understand each other. At the same time, integration also requires respect and compliance with the fundamental rules of our society: freedom of opinion, freedom of religion, and respect for the democratic rule of law, which must offer individuals the protection to which they are entitled.</p>
<p class="contents">Last time I had the good fortune of addressing this Parliament, I said, referring to the prospect of Turkey’s accession to the Union, that Islam or religion are not the issue. I would repeat that today. In our European society, there is every chance that people with different beliefs can live alongside, and with, each other. What is not acceptable is to use religion as an excuse to attack people, schools, mosques or churches. That is what all of us, across Europe, have to fight with conviction and decisiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in your expression of support last Monday, you drew attention to the significance of recent events in the Netherlands for the whole of European society, and in that I agree with you. The Netherlands is convinced that we must work together more effectively in fighting terrorism. The fierce reactions and counter-reactions in the wake of the killing of Mr Van Gogh once again demonstrated that there is tension in the make-up of our society. In Europe too, we have to learn from each other in terms of integrating minorities. I will presently examine in more detail the multi-annual programme for Justice and Home Affairs, the Hague Programme, that provides for a deepening in both areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, a ministerial conference was held, at which the subject of integration was discussed at length. Of course we immediately applied the existing operational instruments over the past week. In addition, the Justice and Home Affairs ministers have asked to discuss the events in the Netherlands and to deliberate on European aspects of these with their colleagues in the Justice and Home Affairs Council next Friday.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now return to my role of President-in-Office of the European Council and to the actual topic of this debate. The European Council laid down the Hague Programme on 5 November. The programme outlines our cooperation in the area of freedom, security and justice for the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Hague Programme is the first comprehensive package of measures to have been the subject of negotiation involving 25 Member States. That illustrates that in an enlarged Union, we can also reach agreement about important, complex issues, and that bodes well for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In a Europe with no internal borders, we have to join forces in order to tackle problems such as organised crime, terrorism and human trafficking. In addition, we must work closely together in the fields of asylum and immigration. After all, asylum seekers and immigrants are entitled to know where they stand in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hague Programme builds on that of Tampere, which, in 1999, was the first programme to formulate cooperation in this area. It is based on Member State contributions, the Commission evaluation of Tampere and the European Parliament’s recommendation of 14 October of this year, particularly in respect of decision-making methods.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hague Programme gives important new impulses. Loopholes in national systems are being closed, as a result of which phenomena such as cross-border crime will be given far fewer opportunities. Closer attention will be paid to the proper implementation of the measures taken, and the effectiveness thereof will be scrutinised on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Hague Programme specifically mean?</p>
<p class="contents">The Union will make it easier for police, justice and intelligence services of the Member States to exchange information on the basis of the principle of availability of information.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to terrorism, it has been agreed that Member States will go further than maintaining their own security; they will also extend their vista to the entire territory of the EU. Institutions such as Europol and Eurojust will be given a central role in fighting crime.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to work hard on a European legal area, in which it is no longer possible to escape one’s sentence by moving to another EU Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this, we will work towards a common asylum system by 2010, in which the same procedures will be followed in all countries. We want a single system that is humane, but also unambiguous, so that ‘asylum hopping’ will become a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Illegal immigration will also be tackled more effectively. This involves a common repatriation policy and better border control.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now working on the basic principles for integration which will, if possible, be laid down during the Dutch Presidency. A start was made on this during an informal ministerial conference in Groningen.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point I should like to mention in particular, is the introduction of Qualified Majority Voting and of codecision in the fields of asylum and immigration, something upon which you insisted in your recommendation of 14 November. We will comply with your request by making the Union more decisive and democratic in this respect. This will be effective on 1 April 2005. Although there were compelling requests among a few Member States to make various allowances, eventually, these remained restricted to the exception of legal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, it is an ambitious and realistic programme, in respect of which the European Commission will be presenting an action plan next year. The separate legislative proposals contained therein will be submitted to you under the consultation and codecision procedure. I am particularly pleased that agreement has now been reached among the Member States about the objectives and the way in which we want to achieve these.</p>
<p class="contents">A safer Europe for free citizens whose constitutional rights are protected effectively. That is what this is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the other important topic of the latest European Council, namely the European economy, in other words the preparation of the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2004 is marked by a slight recovery in the European economy. That recovery, however, is not a matter of course. In order to safeguard our European social model, we will need to make further adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">The main feat of the Kok report is that it clearly demonstrates the relevance, if not, necessity, of the Lisbon strategy. The key objective of the strategy is still very much alive. There is no alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">The world around us is changing because in addition to the US, there are economies, including China and India, which not only compete in terms of labour costs, but also increasingly so in terms of quality and innovation. Europe itself is changing too, though: the population is ageing, with all the consequences that this entails for labour participation and tenability of pension schemes and health care.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, the road ahead is clear: only by facing the challenge of the future can we retain the achievements of today. Knowledge, innovation and competitiveness must be the pillars underlying the adaptability of the European economy. Europe must develop its strengths further. Founded on a broad-based and highly-qualified population, flexible labour markets, activating social systems and innovative ecology, Europe will be able to meet the global challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kok report thus clearly demonstrates that the Lisbon strategy must be pursued with force. Progress has been made on a number of scores: in the fields of labour participation, the internal market and the dissemination of ICT and the Internet in schools, universities, governments and households. We should not fool ourselves, though. At the same time, Mr Kok has indicated that the efforts, particularly by the Member States themselves, have to be stepped up. If not, we will assuredly not achieve the objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this very process, where structural change is being carried out while retaining the public support base, which was the topic of a very lively discussion between myself and my colleagues during the past European Council. There was an exchange of practical experience, and future prospects were outlined. It was a sound discussion, particularly because the Kok report refers to the Member States themselves. </p>
<p class="contents">What struck me during that informative discussion was the unanimity about the need for reforms and about the need for good communication about this with the public and civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Heads of Government were unanimous in their willingness to take upon themselves political responsibility for the Lisbon strategy at European level, but also at home, in their own countries. It was gratifying in that respect that the future President of the new European Commission, Mr Barroso, also confirmed that he considers the Lisbon strategy to be at the centre of his policy and he personally will take responsibility for this in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I have discussed the roles which the European Council, the Commission and the Member States must play. However, the Kok report also addressed the European Parliament directly, which should have greater involvement in this strategy. For example, it contains a suggestion for you to set up a permanent parliamentary committee that focuses on the Lisbon strategy and growth and employment. I am, naturally, interested to find out how you will act upon this recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should now like to turn to another topic, one which you yourself have discussed with us, namely that of ‘Communicating Europe’. The awareness that we need to communicate more effectively with the public about what Europe is and what it is doing requires constant attention. I see it as positive that future presidencies have indicated that they will be continuing the discussions on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is an important occasion to further improve communication with the public. The citizens of Europe share essential values and it is up to the politicians, you and I, to convey the European project. Creating a truly open debate requires teamwork between the Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission. I therefore welcome the intention of the future President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, to entrust a Vice-President with the portfolio of communication. We are looking forward to the announced communication strategy which will be tabled even before the European Council of June.</p>
<p class="contents">I have now come to the areas of external policy that have been the subject of discussion. First of all, Iraq. The European Council managed to reach agreement about a package of support measures for Iraq in the short term. We presented this package to the Iraqi Prime Minister, Mr Allawi, who we had invited especially for the occasion, during a lunch meeting on 5 November. Moreover, we then offered Iraq scope for cooperation and dialogue for the long term. Mr Allawi thanked us for the support for the Iraqi reconstruction process. In this process, the elections play an important role. I therefore set great store by Prime Minister Allawi’s communication that, despite persistent security problems, these elections will be taking place in January at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">Our meeting with Mr Allawi and the aid package we presented to him demonstrate that the European Union is willing and able to play a greater role in granting concrete support to the political and economic reconstruction process in Iraq. Moreover, a similar signal of unanimity has been given within the Union with regard to Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">A second item of external policy on which the European Council expressed a view is Iran. Let there be no mistake: we want complete and permanent suspension of all enrichment and improvement activities by Iran on a voluntary basis. Only then can the European Union offer Iran a prospect of discussions about long-term cooperation which will benefit both the European Union and Iran. Although the agreement that was reached with Teheran at the weekend is a step in the right direction, we should satisfy ourselves first that the suspension by the International Atomic Energy Agency can be determined promptly. If that attempt fails too, then we seem to have no choice but to resort to the UN Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the Middle East, where there seems to be another window of opportunity for the peace process. It is to be hoped that the Israeli decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip will offer a new opportunity for carrying out the roadmap. The European Council has tried to cash in on this. At the proposal of Javier Solana, we have now drawn up a short-term action programme to support the Palestinians in the areas of security, reforms, elections and economic development. Needless to say, we need cooperation from both the Palestinians and the Israelis for this programme to be successful. Although, at the moment, there is mourning for the death of President Arafat, I hope that the Palestinian Authority will, when a new president is elected in January, make a new start promptly and decisively.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Sudan remains extremely difficult. The European Council has urged the Government of Sudan and all other parties to meet the international requirements. In this respect, we have an obvious stick, namely the possibility of instituting sanctions, if need be. If that is what it takes, that is what we will do.</p>
<p class="contents">Three weeks ago, the European Parliament held a debate with the Council about Ukraine. I hope that the message which the European Council sent is being properly understood by the Ukrainian authorities. The second round of the presidential elections is taking place this Sunday. This round will need to be more democratic than the first one. If not, we will need to consider the implications we want to attach to this.</p>
<p class="contents">As is evident from the conclusions, the European Council has not discussed the Union’s enlargement. We will do this in December. We will then know the outcome of the debate which Parliament will devote to this. The decisions we are facing regarding the four candidate countries can change the Union drastically. A clear, positive and future-oriented view of Parliament is crucial in order to face the decision-making and implementation of the decisions with confidence. I hope that that will be the result on 2 December.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finally say a few words about Parliament itself and about the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I share your wish to resolve the long-standing issue of the statute of the Members of this Parliament. Transparent and unequivocal agreements about the salary and other working conditions of the Members of your House avoid perceptions which undermine confidence in the institutions and the Union as a whole. In the next few weeks, the presidency, in the form of the European Affairs Minister, Mr Nicolaï, will be examining the possibilities that exist in order to reach agreement on this issue that has remained unresolved for far too long. Mr President, you too will be consulted in this matter in the next few days.</p>
<p class="contents">Strictly speaking, the outcome of the debate which this Parliament held three weeks ago about the proposed Commission was not on the agenda of the European Council. Mr President, you were right to pay attention to it in your contribution to the European Council nevertheless. I should like to do the same now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union did not end up in crisis because of this debate; on the contrary, it drew strength from it. In the Treaty, Parliament has been assigned an important role in the appointment of the Commission. Parliament has every right to reject the proposed Commission. Had Parliament done so as a result of a vote, then that would have been an expression of political self-awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, it is good that Mr Barroso, the President-designate, has drawn the political lessons he needed to draw from the debate. He has been able to adjust his Commission with a view to receiving the broadest possible support in this Parliament. In this way, he is laying a strong foundation for cooperation between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Council’s point of view, the outcome is also positive. The Council wants to set to work with Parliament and the Commission. We are facing important issues and important choices. I have high hopes that tomorrow, the European Parliament will express its confidence in the Commission, and we will be able to roll up our sleeves thereafter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also held an exchange of views on a topic of particular relevance to citizens: communication on Europe. It heard a presentation on enlargement by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and adopted conclusions on a number of foreign policy issues, notably Sudan, Iraq, the Middle East and Iran. Finally, the Heads of State and Government met the Prime Minister of Iraq, Mr Allawi, over lunch. Also on that occasion, the President-designate of the Commission, Mr Barroso, presented an amended list for his team of Commissioners, to be approved by the Council and submitted to the European Parliament for a vote.</p>
<p class="contents">When he met the members of the European Council on 4 November, the President of the European Parliament, Mr Borrell, underlined the role played by the European Parliament in this process. I shall briefly highlight the main points discussed at the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the Lisbon Strategy, the European Council confirmed the validity and relevance of the process it set in motion in 2000, aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of European economies through a balanced strategy with an economic, social and environmental dimension. It encouraged the Council to maintain the momentum of this work. It reiterated the importance of the implementation of agreed measures by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council welcomed the presentation by Mr Wim Kok of the report of the high-level group he chaired. On the basis of the Kok report, the Commission will prepare proposals for the European Council next March for the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy. It is clear that progress has been made over the past five years but, as President Prodi said, we have not done enough and Member States still have to deliver on their commitments. I am tempted to repeat that: Member States still have to deliver on their commitments!</p>
<p class="contents">The President-designate, Mr Barroso, has already indicated that the Commission's key priority will be to promote a competitive Europe through more growth and jobs and that it will remain fully committed to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy in all its components. In this context, the Commission also remains committed to better regulation. The presidency has focused work on actions for simplification, impact assessment and measuring the administrative burden. We support these actions and welcome the work of the high-level technical group on better regulation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the area of freedom, security and justice, the European Council adopted an ambitious multiannual programme – the Hague Programme – that follows on from the Tampere Agenda, and that will guide the action of the Union in those areas over the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizens rightly expect that the EU, while guaranteeing respect for fundamental freedoms and rights, will take more effective joint action on cross-border problems such as illegal migration and trafficking in human beings, as well as on terrorism and organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hague Programme reflects the ambitions as expressed in the Constitutional Treaty. It puts the emphasis on delivery and implementation; it takes account of the evaluation by the Commission of the Tampere Agenda, as well as of the recommendation on the use of qualified majority voting and the codecision procedure adopted by the European Parliament on 14 October 2004. The Commission will present an action plan in 2005 to translate the aims and priorities of The Hague Programme into concrete actions.</p>
<p class="contents">On 'communicating Europe', the European Council reiterated the need to increase public awareness of the importance of the work of the Union. Politicians at both national and international level have a responsibility to communicate the relevance of the European project, to involve Europeans through public debate and active citizenship in decision-making. European institutions also have a role to play in this regard. The Commission, for its part, intends to present a communication strategy in good time before the June 2005 European Council. The ratification of the Constitution in all Member States will also represent an unprecedented opportunity for discussing European issues with our citizens. That is the responsibility of each Member State, but it is very important that we hold an EU-wide debate, rather than leaving it to individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On enlargement, at the European Council President Prodi presented the progress report, the strategy paper and recommendations, as well as the study of issues arising from Turkey's membership, produced by the Commission on 6 October. As you know, the European Council will address these enlargement issues at its meeting in December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Dutch Presidency on the exhaustive Hague Programme in relation to the area of freedom, but I would like to add a brief comment. We still need to establish emphases, priorities, with regard to promoting this area. Governing means making choices and establishing priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Times have changed since Tampere I. The time has come to choose priorities and identify the most urgent problems affecting the co-existence of the Europeans and, above all, those which are going to affect its future. We must have the courage to choose and to accept the risk. Courage is what the future of this area of freedom and justice in the European Union is going to require.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council says, for example, that the fight against terrorism must be given impetus, but it still does not have sufficient impetus to identify Islamist terrorism as the main problem threatening the co-existence of the Europeans. Madrid, Beslan, the tragedies of the European hostages and last week’s events in the Netherlands confirm this. More Union means more ability to choose and select. So this area must be promoted on the basis of a few, very few, but solid and identifiable European political projects which deal with the real problems facing us, the first of which is Islamist terrorism. The greatest risk to Europe in this field is inaction, paralysis and not knowing what to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hague Programme does not mention the necessary protection for the victims of terrorism, and I regret that the conclusions have not mentioned this Parliament’s request concerning the creation of the European Office for Assistance for Victims or the consolidation over the coming years of a political project, a political programme aimed in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, having seen the report on the mid-term review of Lisbon, the most important thing is that we are aware that we are seriously behind schedule. The European Parliament must promote this Lisbon Process on the basis of three very simple and fundamental ideas: the first is that this Parliament must encourage governments to show signs of courage and to promote the necessary structural reforms, since more Union requires more Europe and more structural reforms; the second is to accept that employment is undoubtedly the best social policy, since more Union means more emphasis on job creation; and, finally, in order to implement Lisbon, the States need streamlined public finances, since more Union requires more budgetary stability demands and no more relaxation of finances amongst the European States as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for the work you have done over recent months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schulz (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my colleague Mr Désir will be speaking on behalf of our group to make some points about the issues raised by the Lisbon process, but I would like to point out that it is to evaluating the outcome of this process that my group in this House, and, I think, the Union as a whole must primarily devote their efforts, for the Kok Report, which you are discussing in the Council, has plain words to say about it. We are, quite simply, not fit enough, and it is on this that all our efforts – those of the new Commission, of the Council and of this House – must be concentrated. We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will lay great stress on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather like Mr Mayor Oreja, though, who has already spoken, I would like to say something about the area of freedom, security and justice. It was decided in the Council that 1 April of next year would be the latest possible date for the transition to majority voting and codecision in the areas of immigration and asylum policy and in other areas of justice and internal cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, we demanded this in a resolution on 14 October. The only thing is that it was not this resolution of 14 October, but a lengthy process lasting five years, and so I want to make reference to someone who is not here, namely our former colleague and Commissioner, Mr Vitorino, as it is not least thanks to his tenacity that we are where we are at the end of the Tampere process. That is something I want to say loud and clear on behalf of our group.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What is this about? What I am going to talk about is the way in which the Commission, the Council and Parliament share in the responsibility for the balanced policy we will be putting together. The words you used at the beginning of your speech, when you drew attention to your own country’s situation, were, I think, extremely well chosen. The European Union and its citizens make demands where security policy is concerned, demands made of the Member States and of the EU, and with these demands we must comply. There is no time to be wasted; we cannot leave any room, any room whatever, to the enemies of fundamental citizens’ rights, to the enemies of democracy, to those who give expression to their blind hatred through murder and assassination in order to destroy the order that we defend. A strong democracy has the right to be strong and to take vigorous action against its enemies. In that, our group is always right alongside you.</p>
<p class="contents">That, though, is but one side of the coin. The other is that the state, the Union, the forces of law and order that are there to defend fundamental democratic freedoms, cannot curtail these rights while at the same time claiming to be defending them. It is easier to say that in this House than to do it in the real world – that I do know, but even so, we cannot stint in our efforts to keep on correcting the balance between the public’s right to be protected from uncertainty and the guarantee of their fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">When, though, I hear certain of the debates in the Council or in the Commission, when I hear speeches by unsuccessful candidates for the Commission, I sometimes get the impression that this has to be said with more energy. Speaking as a German MEP, I cannot imagine that Libya, to take one example, is a country with much experience of the observance of fundamental rights. It follows that the quick and appealing solutions offered in the media market are not always the best ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate that if we want to combat illegal immigration – and it has for some time been one of my group’s articles of faith that we do – we must at last create the possibility of legal immigration. This House’s debate on the subject, which begins on 1 April next year, will open the door to that, to our being able – and we are willing – as legislators to help bring about a situation in which, if we want to establish security, we cannot simply talk in terms of illegal people, but can establish a framework within which they can become legal. That too is an opportunity that we will have from next 1 April onwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That would seem to be urgently needed.</p>
<p class="contents">On 4 and 5 November this year, the European Council laid down its priorities for the further development of the area of freedom, security and justice. It is probable that these developments will do more to shape the EU’s character than any previous joint initiative, for it is on the realisation of this Union governed by the rule of law that a common European community will be founded. The character of our society will be determined not only by to what extent the European Union wants our 450 million citizens to be protected against the dangers of terrorism, among other things, or the degree to which it wants judicial cooperation to be organised in future practice, but also by joint action in the areas of asylum, immigration and integration. We must not forget that the foundations we will be laying down over the coming five years will determine not only the futures of 450 million people, but also those of their children and grandchildren.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to take this opportunity not merely to remind you, but also perhaps to make you again aware, of the responsibility we all took on when we made the decision to be policymakers in this House. We shape societies and fashion their futures; it is, alas, only in retrospect that we will learn whether our efforts are crowned with success. We will then, however, have to answer our children’s questions, as our parents and grandparents had to answer our own, and I will be able to tell them that I did indeed prevent freedom being sacrificed to security, that I did indeed help to keep this great society open, tolerant and free, a society that would never tolerate intolerance, that I did indeed offer those persecuted in foreign lands the opportunity to seek safety in this Europe of ours, and gave that same opportunity to those who wanted to live and work here.</p>
<p class="contents">And when my children ask me how I achieved that, I hope I will be able to tell them how we, the citizens’ directly elected representatives, would not stand for the interior ministers of a few countries joining together in what they called ‘G5’ and taking essential decisions without reference to Parliament. We have seen how important it is to integrate the foreigners living in Europe, in a way which respects them and likewise demands that they respect it. I will tell them how we overcame those who sought to burn a free society to the ground, how we, in fighting terrorism, always took account of the need to preserve citizens’ rights and freedoms. Such measures as biometric data in identity documents are to be assessed most stringently by reference to their necessity and proportionality. I will tell them how we stamped out every form of traffic in human beings, which was slavery in a modern guise, combating it at every level and making it possible for people to enter Europe legally, and how we discharged our obligations to those who seek asylum, without making it easy for ourselves by shifting our responsibility to states beyond our borders and without our laws. I will tell them that we did not merely create empty institutions, but such bodies as the European Human Rights Agency, endowed with funding and a mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hague Programme is a beginning; it is certainly not an end. Before we make irreversible changes to our society, we must think, discuss and argue, and do it time and time again. For it is the protection of human and civil rights, of freedom and security, that underpins this Europe of ours, which we must defend – even, and something particularly, within its own institutions.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, on a personal basis I always worry when I hear a politician use the phrase 'there is no alternative', because Mrs Thatcher used that phrase when we were all perfectly well aware that there were plenty of alternatives. I worry, therefore, that we only look on the Lisbon Agenda as some sort of Holy Grail that we have to pursue, and genuinely welcome the Netherlands presidency's recognition of the breadth of that Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often in this House the Lisbon Agenda is limited to the issue of competitiveness, and we omit all the other facets concerning more and better quality jobs, social cohesion and sustainable development, which went on to be developed more fully at Gothenburg. If we reduce the Lisbon Agenda to the sphere of competition we are selling ourselves short and will not solve many of the problems facing our societies. The relevance of a partial reading of the agenda is thus highly questionable, and it is partly because of that partial reading that we have had such problems in implementing much of the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">We have totally forgotten the Cardiff Process on integration of the environment into all the processes and policies of the European Union. When one looks at social cohesion issues, which are linked to some of the other topics touched on today, we would also seem to have forgotten the dynamic approach needed in the implementation of the Article 13 directives on anti-discrimination. We would do well to reconsider the role of the Equal Programme in future, rather than consigning it to the dustbin. The implementation of legislation on anti-discrimination deals with issues surrounding the marginalisation of many in our societies, and also deals with some of the issues people have talked about this morning, in terms of respect for individuals and for what they can offer.</p>
<p class="contents">When looking at the Hague Programme itself, one of the things not to have come through strongly enough is political leadership on issues concerning anti-discrimination. A directive on anti-racism and xenophobia is still stuck in Council and we are not giving the political leadership that the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia has identified as being necessary to move forward. I wonder whether the EU Human Rights Agency will provide that.</p>
<p class="contents">We obviously welcome the moves towards qualified majority voting and codecision, and assume that this will also bring the European Court of Justice into play, although this is something not yet made explicit. However, I regret that legal migration has not been included because, as the Council conclusions state, and as we have again heard this morning, illegal migration cannot be separated from legal migration. This is not just a home affairs issue. It also has real resonance for employment policy. People prefer to have a legal status, and we need to look at the bureaucratic complexities which stand in the way of this, and which Parliament clearly identified in the previous legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than simply dwelling on the negatives – of which we have heard many this morning – we are looking for greater political leadership in terms of the sort of Europe we want to create. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group takes a critical view of the Lisbon strategy to date, and we do so not because it aims for more and better, not because it demands social cohesion and sustainability; we take a critical view of it because this Lisbon strategy makes the world’s problems even worse. The message that now goes out from the Council meeting in Brussels and also from the conferences held under the presidency of the Netherlands is that the creation of more meaningful jobs that actually pay a living wage, the strengthening of social cohesion, and the rational use of the natural world, now take second place to the competitiveness of conglomerates and to the EU’s ability to compete as a global player.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than hearing of how political priorities have been responsibly adjusted for the sake of social, environmental and global sustainability and seeing proposals submitted for consideration by the Spring 2005 Council, we now hear that, firstly, Europe is to be made more competitive, labour markets to be made more dynamic, and that the social security systems are to be adapted to meet the challenges presented by the need for competitiveness and by population change. Let me tell you, in plain terms, that this will not enable us to solve the world’s and society’s problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kok’s report was presented during the session, and it, too, has no alternatives to offer. It does not help to develop a social and employment policy for our own time. I therefore take the same view of it as the European Anti-Poverty Network and am more than willing to discuss these proposals for something like a social policy agenda for the years from 2006 to 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">With the summit in mind and looking forward to the proposals that the Commission will be putting forward next January, I call upon the Commission, the European Council and the Member States to adjust their political priorities within the Lisbon strategy along the lines to which I referred earlier.</p>

In these difficult circumstances, leadership is indispensable. Without solidarity and unanimity in tackling those who threaten the rule of law, we would not achieve our goals. What is positive is that this need also appears to exist in society. I wish you God’s blessing in your work, particularly in bringing, and keeping, together the different ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last meeting of the European Heads of Government, Mr Kok presented his report on the Lisbon strategy, a report to which we in this House were very much looking forward. The conclusions and recommendations are not new. What <span class="italic">is</span> new is that an advisor consulted by the Council has put the ball back in the Member States’ court. Those Member States must make a start on structural reforms, which they have apparently not yet done. No choices were made from the excess of objectives. However, it remains to be seen whether reducing the number of objectives would be sufficient. I doubt it. More should be done, but that implies that there is a will. Which Member State will be the first to stick its neck out?</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2001, we in this House have had many a debate on the question why this strategy has not had the desired effect. This Parliament has restricted powers in the process of Lisbon, and in the open coordination method, it is in any event difficult to make the Union’s role concrete. Environmental policy and social policy are under pressure. Despite this, we will need to adopt a sustainability strategy if we want to maintain our level of prosperity and welfare for future generations in the longer term. The parties are largely agreed on the analysis. Which Member State, though, will take the actual first step? My question, therefore, to Mr Balkenende is what we can expect from the Dutch Presidency in the next six weeks in terms of follow-up. After all, the Netherlands has always been a great champion of reforms in order to make the Lisbon process a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These include security and economic growth. Essentially, the latter is conspicuous by its absence across Europe as a whole, in spite of the Lisbon strategy’s unusually ambitious provisions. This state of affairs is due firstly to the fact that we still have an extremely naïve belief in the power and force of regulation as an agent of change, in particular as far as the regulation of economic life is concerned. This naïve belief has led to Europe becoming completely defenceless on the global market, and to our citizens and entrepreneurs being overwhelmed with reams of legislation, legislation that is very frequently detrimental. The second reason for poor economic growth is that our societies are ageing extremely rapidly indeed. Ageing at the rate currently experienced in Europe would ruin even an economy that was at the height of its development, to say nothing of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the impending Council, it is worth touching on the harmonisation of legislation. There are some areas in which harmonisation could have positive effects, yet there are also areas in which harmonisation is nothing short of impossible. Such areas include family law, for the simple reason that radically different opinions on the family are held within Europe. The Buttiglione affair is an excellent example of this. It would be a serious error to think that it might be possible to use European law to ensure that homosexual relationships are legally recognised in countries that have not agreed to such an experiment.</p>
<p class="contents">Still with the Council meeting in mind, the Council is to be commended for taking an interest in Ukraine. It must be added that this interest has come too late, and indeed we must hope it has not come altogether too late. If this crisis had not arisen, the exceptionally passive policies adopted with regard to the East would presumably have remained in place. The crisis we are witnessing within the pro-Western and pro-European forces in Ukraine would presumably not have come about had our neighbourhood policy been more courageous in political terms, more generous in economic terms, and above all, more open to the accession of countries such as Ukraine to the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Upon reading this motion for a resolution, I found a statement to the effect that the Lisbon strategy is good, but that the bad Member States, who do not wish to put it into practice, are the ‘chief obstacle to faster progress’. This sounds worryingly familiar, and I must concur with the comments made by Mrs Lambert and Mrs Zimmer on the issue. With regard to paragraph 4 of the motion for a resolution, the reference made by its authors to investment in people, research and innovation might lead one to fear that this will, unfortunately, be implemented by favouring the old Member States over Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, as is the case in the provisions of the draft EU budget for 2007-2013. Fine words can, and alas sometimes are, put into practice in a way that is far from fine. After those words of criticism, I should like to commend the Council for having finally recognised the importance of the demographic factor, and the authors of the resolution for having asked the Council that ‘action to deal with the consequences of the ageing of the population of Europe be considered a policy priority’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wholly concur with Mr Blokland’s congratulations addressed to Prime Minister Balkenende on the way in which he is taking charge, and giving direction in channelling the feeling of our population towards a more tolerant society in which people respect one another. Respect for those values is also something which we in this House will need to defend at all times. Tolerance, however, goes hand in hand with setting and demarcating boundaries. I welcome the way in which the Hague agenda is building on Tampere. My congratulations on the way in which agreement has been reached. I do share the views of Mr Oreja, who stated a moment ago that what matters now is to take concrete action, and to give priorities to concrete action points in the short term. The President of the Council may be able to elaborate on this. I would in any case like to mention one of my personal priorities, one I have mentioned before. It is unacceptable to me that, following the attacks in New York and Madrid, we hear the Justice and Home Affairs Council say that we will now automatically start exchanging information about possible attacks without delay. It is inconceivable that this has not happened to date, that the urgency has sunk to that level again, while we noticed once again that there may be international links in the case of the political assassination and subsequent events in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a brief comment about the Lisbon strategy. It is the only way, according to Mr Balkenende, and he is right. It is the only way, and we will need to continue on this path. What matters is the way in which we negotiate it. Not with the ‘super-Commissioner’, as proposed in the past by Chancellor Schröder of Germany, but by learning from each other. Does he think it possible that innovation councils chaired by himself would make for a more effective way of exchanging good examples? Does he also think it possible that national parliaments might be called to account much more emphatically with regard to delivering on their share in responsibility for this?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, communication in Europe is also an important item. Indeed, Mr Balkenende, it is essential that the statute should come into being, for as long as we do not have one, we will have a negative image at every election. I thank you. I am interested to see how far you will take this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The progress made with this strategy lags a long way behind the objectives set in 2000, something which is down to the fact that far too many priorities were set. Advances have been made on all aspects relating to the Community method, or liberalisation, whereas no progress has been made with any aspects which required the commitment of the Member States and which depended on the open method of coordination, such as investment in research, innovation, training, the quality of social dialogue and human capital. Greater national ownership has also not been achieved, and much remains to be done in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">We are delighted that the need to maintain a balance between the three dimensions of the Lisbon strategy, the economic, social and environmental dimensions, has been reiterated, and it is our belief that the European economy needs a higher level of growth and competitiveness in order to preserve the European environmental and social model. Yet we must continue to discuss the links between these dimensions and the conditions required for sustainable growth in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There appears to be a growing temptation to take the easy way out, namely to have recourse to liberalisation in an ever increasing number of areas, including services, the labour market and welfare systems. If we carry on down this path, there will soon be little left over of the European model, of its uniqueness, its strengths and its advantages, which lie not in a downward adjustment towards the social level of some of our new international competitors – and here I have China and India in mind – but in competition to achieve excellence, quality, top-of-the-range products and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we are sure that investments in human capital, in a high standard of lifelong employee training, in quality of public services, in European environmental standards and in good social dialogue are all productive factors, competitive factors and prerequisites for ensuring that reforms are adopted as and when they are needed. This is why these things do not merely entail costs, expenses and inflexibility, but instead provide support to ensure the success of a new growth and development strategy for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We want growth and jobs to be a priority, and I believe that this also involves better links between all European policy instruments, or in other words a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact to ensure that it has tighter links with the broad outlines of economic policy, the new financial perspective and, indeed, the revised Lisbon objectives.</p>

I think that Mr Kok’s report is very welcome and that it identifies where things are wrong. Indeed, the remedy is already well enough known; what is lacking is action. Slowly but surely, I am growing a little despondent when I see that we have said this so many times and we still have not found a way of galvanising the Member States into action. I should like to hear from the EU Presidency what it intends to do about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, from time to time, I hear that a false dichotomy is being created between competitiveness and solidarity. Those elements complement each other; they certainly do not contradict each other. We all agreed in Lisbon that liberalisation is necessary, and liberalisation does not undermine our European socio-economic model but in fact strengthens it.</p>
<p class="contents">If we examine the facts – and here I am particularly addressing the Left of this House – liberalisation and free markets have brought more products and more services within the reach of more people. That is the reality, and I think that we should not have recourse to the old instruments of protectionism or state support, which is an inefficient way of spending taxpayers’ money, and monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to comment on the Hague Programme. That is extremely welcome and cannot, of course, be seen in isolation from the events in the Netherlands. It is not a Dutch issue, but a European one. What is more, freedom and a peaceful society are the <span class="italic">raisons d'être</span> of the European Union, and so we should fight extremely hard to maintain them. That means, on the one hand, that we will work very hard on security, and in that light, I should like to underline that I cannot comprehend the way in which the Member States, over the past few years, have cited national sovereignty as a justification for their unwillingness to step up cooperation. Human lives, our democracy and social cohesion are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, alongside this unilateral approach towards repression and terrorism, we should also consider the other side of these phenomena. A unilateral approach on its own is ineffective; we might as well be fighting a running battle. It follows that we must also fight hatred and racism. And I should like to conclude by drawing your attention to the tone of this debate which contributes greatly to the solution of this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the cultural dimension also needs to be addressed more effectively, especially if we are to celebrate our diversity, as the Minister said earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the emphasis that was put on communication in this meeting. Within the European Free Alliance parties we have different positions on the Constitution, but we all agree with the urgency of improving the relationship and communication between the EU and the peoples of Europe. There is no more effective way of doing that than by using people's own languages and this is why I take the opportunity presented by the Bureau Decision of 13 October to allow the use of other languages in this Chamber. I conclude by saying this in Welsh, even though there is no official interpretation.</p>

I believe that the package adopted is expensive and pointless, and Fallujah is its failure foretold. Fallujah is not only a further human tragedy – with 1 500 more deaths, thousands more people wounded, tens of thousands more people made homeless – it is also the graveyard of the January elections. Because of Fallujah, neither the Sunnis nor the Shiites, who oppose the occupation, will go to the polls.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing is guaranteed in the January elections. There is no guarantee that voters will be able to register, nor that opposition parties will take part, nor that the candidates or the voters will be able to move freely and safely.</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq’s electoral platform must not be US or British tanks. This is not the way to rebuild hope or restore confidence. Elections must be Europe’s priority in Palestine, however. Arafat’s death points up the urgent need for a new leader who is the indisputable embodiment of the will of its people.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must therefore be on hand to monitor the entire electoral process, so that no doubt is cast upon its transparency. That is not all, however. Europe must tell Israel that what is required is a return to political dialogue and a respite from hostilities – no suicide bombs, on the one side, no collective punishment or selective executions, on the other. Signals must be sent out that voter registration can take place in Jerusalem and that restrictions in the Occupied Territories will be lifted, so that mobility can be guaranteed during the campaign and, most importantly, that Marwan Barghouti can be freed.</p>

Seventy-three per cent of people in that region said they did not want any more Euro-bureaucracy. I wonder what percentage would vote to get rid of the already-existing regional assemblies, with their awful appointees and their corrupt practices?</p>
<p class="contents">We will shortly have the opportunity to say 'No' to the EU Constitution and I mean any European Constitution, because the gap between Euro-rhetoric and reality has never been wider. The pretence here is that there will be no further integration until there has been a referendum. The reality is that the referendum is being pushed ever more backwards, while integration is being speeded up, with, for example, a common visa policy by 2006 and a European evidence warrant by 2005. I could produce 25 other examples, the most important being the common asylum system, which will be introduced in 2005, with coordination in place by the end of that year. All these things will be in place before a referendum takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members of this Parliament we are therefore entitled to ask what the effect will be of a nation saying 'No' in a referendum.

We need assurance on this point.</p>

The European Union must complete the internal market, improve the European regulatory environment and make the whole European Union less complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">All new EU legislation must be subject to strict tests to measure its impact on enterprise and competitiveness. The European Union leaders have set the goal that the EU must become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. A strong and well-functioning internal market is necessary if the European Union is to become the most competitive economy and meet the objective of the social cohesion strategy. The internal market has helped to create 2.5 million jobs in Europe over the last 10 years alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs better regulation. That does not mean more regulation; as a matter of fact it means less. A new corporate governance and action plan must be supported, ensuring that European business practice operates at the highest international standards. A new Community patenting system must be put in place within the EU and the Community customs codes must be changed to strengthen and modernise EU customs policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the action for growth initiative, which will ensure that the research and development investment target of 3% of GDP within the European Union must be met by the year 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">These are not easy challenges, but they must be prioritised. The European Union economy is lagging behind that of our counterparts. We must improve our methodology.

I have great admiration for the fine results that have been achieved with what is known as the Hague agenda. Unfortunately, these have remained virtually unnoticed in the Netherlands amidst the commotion and unrest in recent weeks. I would nevertheless like to say that it is thanks to Mr Donner, and to the many sound agreements in the area of home affairs, security and justice, that we are one step closer again to freedom for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to Lisbon. I could not agree more – and the Dutch Presidency has certainly played a part in this – that the three pillars of the strategy, namely economic reforms, social cohesion and sustainability, remain the guiding principle for the Lisbon process in terms of balance and coherence.</p>
<p class="contents">Social cohesion and sustainability, however, can be achieved only if we can again make Europe a true player in the world market. Economic improvement, incidentally, is not a goal in itself, but a necessary condition if we want to retain for generations to come the European social model that was built on solidarity between the working population and those entitled to benefits, between the young and the old.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency was also successful in another area. As Mr Kok’s report mentioned, the key goal of the presidency was to cut back on the pressure resulting from rules and regulations. Allow me to remind you of Mr Doorn’s report of April 2004; we are reportedly the very first parliament that is also prepared to subject its own amendment proposals to an impact test. That is an example that deserves to be followed by other parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Lisbon. The goal is clear. I truly hope that in March 2005, we will be able once again to make the Lisbon strategy into a strategy for opportunity, but then with simpler procedures and tighter agreements, especially for the Member States, as Mr van Nistelrooij rightly points out, where that process is now too strategic, with a consequent lack of positive outcomes. Parliament is happy to lend a hand in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore appropriate for the European institutions to try from time to time to place human rights in their social context when examining and defining future goals.</p>
<p class="contents">This task is not easy. Our whole life is defined by a network of human rights ranging from the inviolability of human dignity to equal opportunities for individuals, communities and generations. Therefore, after the two examples of Tampere and Lisbon, we should be thankful to the Dutch presidency for the Hague Programme and their examination of these questions in their social context.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the section in the document and in the related European Parliament resolution that tries to bring together the decisions on the protection and exercise of human rights into a complex system and suggests that these decisions should be interconnected and build on one another instead of just following each other. And if this is to happen, then we must think back from The Hague to Lisbon when it comes to human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Why? Because today the strategic programme for competitiveness and social cohesion also sends us messages concerning human rights. People living in a united Europe will only become European citizens if they do not become marginalised, if their security is not breached by the threat of war or terrorism, by the evils of unemployment, the danger of homelessness or the grim prospects of unassisted old age, and if they are not threatened by discrimination and labelling. While welcoming the Hague Programme, therefore, I believe that the forthcoming Luxembourg presidency will also have a lot of work to do in this area, and I would like to wish them good luck with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we do that, we will preserve the transatlantic relationship, or at least we will not be blamed for damaging it.</p>

Some Members have expressed reservations with regard to legal immigration, but I should like to ask more detailed questions on the external dimension of asylum and immigration policies, something that is acquiring an ever greater significance. It is apparent that these policies are becoming increasingly dependent on the EU’s ability to conclude Partnership and Cooperation Agreements on returns, readmissions, the strengthening of capacities, border control and police and judicial cooperation, or in other words on a set of agreements with third countries which are not subject to codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">We are doubly concerned because we have absolutely no trust in people such as Mr Schily or Mr Pisanu, who have put forward various proposals such as those on the establishment of camps, immigration gateways or checkpoints outside the EU. Despite the fact that these high-flown ideas have mainly been rejected, that they do not form part of the Hague Programme and that they have aroused the fierce opposition of hundreds of NGOs and of a great many members both of national parliaments and of this House, we remain concerned, because the Hague Programme includes a reference to a feasibility study on the processing of asylum applications outside the EU and because we are also aware that EUR 1 million has been released to enable the High Commissioner for Refugees to strengthen its capacities for dealing with asylum seekers in North African countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we are therefore asking ourselves is whether this does not represent both a violation of this House’s democratic powers and a relinquishing of the duties incumbent upon this House and the EU in the field of asylum and immigration, with these duties being handed over to third countries whose capacities are a great deal less developed than our own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Netherlands of integration, even if that word was completely absent from today’s discourse by the President-in-Office.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not appreciate at all, however, the fact that today no mention was made of the grave events in Iraq. Yesterday, devastating images of American marines killing injured Iraqis were bounced into our homes, as if all this barbarity and horror were routine business not even worthy of mention.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Europe cannot stand idly by at these events, nor can it confine itself to voting appropriations for reconstruction – as the Council did recently – nor limit itself to meeting Mr Allawi or placing confidence in the forthcoming elections as the event that will resolve the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Hague Programme, I do not consider there to be continuity with Tampere; on the contrary, I note a qualitative leap based on a misapprehension. The fact is, the issues of organised crime, terrorism, trafficking in human beings and immigration cannot all be thrown into one big pot, as if they all constituted a single problem. What this is in reality is a scheme for limiting Europe’s sphere of action to that of security, leaving out justice and freedom. I believe that Islamic terrorism should be combated by dialogue between cultures and religions. That is not what was done by your deputy, Mr Balkenende, who the day after the murder of Mr Van Gogh declared war on Islam, or what your country does in financing faith schools. I believe instead that we must build a school where Catholics, Muslims, Protestants and atheists can all live together.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, trafficking in human beings and immigration are not the same thing. We need to punish the criminals, but above all we must satisfy people’s needs: the needs of those who flee from wars and from hunger, who come onto our territory, seeking shelter in our sympathetic and integrated Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What does this mean in practice? What it means is that by resorting to a qualified majority, the European Union will be able to force a country to accept asylum seekers, even if that country does not wish to do so. By resorting to a qualified majority, the European Union may decide, for example, that my country, Poland, is ethnically too homogenous, and that it should be sent some Asian or African asylum seekers, as there are already too many of these in other Member States. We would be unable to object to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Countries accept immigrants because of their proximity to various neighbouring countries, their former colonial policies or their labour market requirements, and each country must make its own decisions on whether it is prepared to grant asylum and, if so, to whom. It is also for each country to decide on who should be allowed to immigrate. Depriving Member States of the right of veto on such matters is a violation of sovereignty on an extremely important issue. The Constitutional Treaty will be rejected in the referendums, and yet the Council of the European Union is already forcing us to implement one of its most controversial ideas. There is no consensus on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are therefore waiting for the European Commission's proposals in the run up to the interim review of the Lisbon strategy with great interest. This interim review, which will be carried out at the spring European Council, will be a good opportunity for honest evaluation and intervention on our part, in cooperation with the Member States, the national governments and social agencies at all levels, because this strategy lies at the heart of all present and future economic and social challenges. It includes all the policies which directly concern citizens: unemployment, poverty, job insecurity, the standard of education, health and social protection. An important tool in our work on this interim review and the new impetus which we need to give will be the report by Mr Wim Kok.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly need to find ways to bring this strategy close to the citizens and organised social agencies because, without their participation, we cannot succeed in such complex policies. This issue relates directly to the broader presentation of the Commission to citizens and it is important and encouraging that the European Council in November turned its attention to the subject of an essential information and communication strategy policy for the policy of the European Union. We must not forget the results of the European elections, which prove that citizens are alienated from the development of the European venture. This is not the first time we have noted this, but the time has come for us to take it on board. The time has come for us to understand that the communication and information policies which we applied every year in the past did not perform well. We need to take action because we face major social and strategic choices, enlargement choices which require both information for and the participation of citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The attack on Fallujah and the way in which the civil population has become embroiled are feeding the spiral of hatred, besides being the umpteenth violation of international law and the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like us here to turn our thoughts to poor Margaret Hassan, who was brutally murdered yesterday. Both terrorism and war in response to terrorism make the prospect of pacification and democratisation of the country still more remote. We therefore call for the Union to play its part in the Sharm el Sheikh conference on 23 November and to make its weight felt, in the light of the unity we have attained, in insisting on full acceptance by all sides of UN Resolution 1546, based on respect for international law and human rights. In these circumstances, it is valid to harbour strong doubts about the real possibility of holding the elections in January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of the US elections and the replacement of Colin Powell may give even greater encouragement to the extremists, both in Iraq and in the Middle East. As far as the Middle East is concerned, I am less optimistic, as it does not seem that Mr Sharon has conceded more to Abu Mazen during the period of his Prime Ministership than he conceded to Yasser Arafat. On this question, besides renewing our solidarity with the Palestinian people in the loss of their historic leader, we demand that the Union commit itself by political and financial means to ensuring fair local and presidential elections in Palestine, and resuming progress on the currently stalled Road Map. That would make it possible to replace, I repeat replace, the unilateral actions of the Sharon government with honest and proper negotiations, which, by resolving the more controversial issues, such as the settlements and the right of return, would lead to the birth of the Palestinian state and the coexistence of the two peoples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The text of the Council’s conclusions finds a Parliament that is more aware of the new era of parliamentary democracy that has opened in Europe and deserves some reflection. First and foremost, the goals set at Lisbon must be pursued with more momentum and rigour and with the courage to choose, as Mr Kok maintains. The challenge of global competition forces us not to draw back from our ambition and requires a strong sense of political responsibility and determination from governments in order to carry through the structural reforms and to sustain the change in the field of social security.</p>
<p class="contents">A reasonable balance is necessary, however, so that the Lisbon Strategy can remain a fundamental political element of the Commission, as President Prodi has ensured. This is also important in order to achieve progress on the fundamental European Pact for Youth, the lodestones of which are education, training, jobs and research. Such issues require wise, generous and coordinated policies, but above all the certainty of investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the strategy for Communicating Europe and making people familiar with the Constitutional Treaty also requires similar investment, but, until now, it does not seem to me that an adequate amount of expenditure has been allocated to this head. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Netherlands is learning!</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the European Union to adopt severe measures against terrorism, measures foreshadowed only after the barbarous murder of the film director, Mr Van Gogh. Europe must follow the good example of the Netherlands, which has had the courage to recommend the most important measure: the closure of all mosques and Islamic centres that have been infiltrated by extremist and terrorist propaganda. These are places where such propaganda is broadcast and funds are collected to fuel the barbarous murder of innocent people, as in Madrid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the ambitions of the Council of Europe and particularly those of the Netherlands regarding the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, but at the same time, with a certain amount of disquiet, I have to agree with the Council of Europe that this strategy has not brought the expected results during the last four years. I also agree with the findings of the Kok report on the feeble level of implementation on the part of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not talking about the problems of distant galaxies, but about a key project of the Union which would bring about the most dynamic and competitive economy by the year 2010, together with a balanced respect for the social and environmental aspects of development. We have fewer than six years ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that we will not achieve success by repeating what are clearly acceptable goals, but by supplementing, from the technical point of view, a strategy which is essentially a good one. What is genuinely lacking is political will and a European spirit. It would appear that at times of crisis everyone thinks of themselves first, but the history of the Union tells us that it has made progress in the past when it has acted in a spirit of solidarity and with a collective will.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the lofty ambitions of the Lisbon Strategy will not be achieved through discordant, disunited and partial activity with different rules of the game for different Member States. What is important is the simultaneous action of the key players on all the important fronts and at all levels. I would like the European Parliament, as the most legitimate representative of the interests of the citizens of the Union, to accompany the responsible implementation of the Lisbon Strategy with a contribution to a more powerful political will on the part of the Member States and to the leadership of excellence on the part of the participating collective institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course I understand that the global economic context is unfavourable, nevertheless I would not like to perceive it as an excuse, but rather as a stimulus for an enlarged European Union to find the answers to those questions which others cannot answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Economic and social policy and sustainability policy are the hallmarks of the Lisbon strategy, and it is right that the report and the Council’s conclusions do not interfere with the coherence of them. Even if growth and employment take centre stage, objectives in the social and environmental areas should in no way be made subordinate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that the mandate of the High-Level Group to develop a consistent strategy in a bid to achieve the Lisbon objectives does not focus more on common macro-economic policy at European level. After all, in that respect, there are no longer any economies in the plural, and there have not been any for a long time, but only one European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We were pleased to find out about the intention to involve the European Parliament more effectively in the preparations of the spring meeting and the Lisbon strategy. Mr Balkenende was interested to learn about our plans to set up a standing committee. I can tell him that indeed, we are carefully considering how we would give this shape, but I, in turn, would like to ask him to take into account the timeframe for the various reports, including the planning we need to draw up here in this House. In our experience, there is often too little space to make adequate use of this.</p>
<p class="contents">We also intend to involve national parliaments more obviously in the strategy. I think that this is also a very important aspect. Along with the Luxembourg Presidency, we would like to examine how we, together with the national parliaments, can prepare the spring meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">It is evident that making the Lisbon strategy more effective depends, first and foremost, on the willingness of the Member States to work truly at EU level. In my view, we are heading for a change from mutual competition among the Member States towards a focus on stronger, common, European strategy. That is where our strength lies compared to other economic blocs, including the US and China which also work as unities. In that light, we should therefore not only consider the balance of revenue and expenditure of Member States in the framework of the Stability Pact, but, as Commissioner Almunia said in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> on Monday, we should also consider the quality of public finances. The Council, the Commission, national parliaments and the European Parliament should all join in the discussion about national budget policy. The economic policy could then be more than the sum of the 25 constituent parts. That is the challenge we are facing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council is to be commended for highlighting the irregularities that occurred during the first round of voting, but I do not believe it has gone far enough in highlighting what is really happening in Ukraine. A civil society is coming into being in that country. There is no sign at all of anything of the kind happening in Russia or Belarus at present. Tens of thousands of people are demonstrating every day in Ukraine, with the aim of making their country democratic and honest, and of ensuring that links are built between Ukraine and the European Union. I do not believe it is enough merely to reprimand the current Ukrainian authorities for their failure to enforce democratic electoral rules. It is essential to boost the hopes of the people of Ukraine and open the door to their European ambitions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although there is no argument about the fact that the goal of making Europe the world’s most competitive region is the right one, we have to look to see who, in Europe, is responsible for what, and I can tell Mr Balkenende that it is when I look at the Council that I find it intolerable that, every month and every year, heads of government and ministers of the economy meet together, agree upon exalted objectives, make Europe responsible for meeting the goals of the Lisbon strategy, then go home and fail to do their homework when they get there. Indeed, they go even further and stand in the way of those things that Europe has to contribute. Take, for example, the European patent: that would be a step ahead as part of a European initiative. Think of the moves towards deregulation, and how the French President and the German Chancellor delayed them for end-users. What Europe achieves is frustrated in the Council, and what ought to be done by the nation states does not get done. The bottom line is that it is Europe that fails to make a success of the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for the Kok report; what we now urgently need – as the Lisbon strategy is the right one – is an orientation for it. The goal, although perhaps too ambitiously defined, is the right one. With Member States like ours in Europe, we can now be happy that the gap between us and America is not widening. We have to put forward a concept for this in Europe, one that compares the nation states, providing a transparent view of which European government is failing to implement this strategy and which is good at it, in order, by way of this transparency in the political process, to make the public aware that we cannot do this other than together. Apart from that, I hope that the presence of the Commissioner with responsibility for development aid is not an indication of the direction in which Europe will be drifting in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Wherever we look, whether it is at the Lisbon Strategy, or the security question and the demand for greater police and judicial cooperation, or even this week's report of the Court of Auditors, we see time and again that Member States that talk about European cooperation do not put it into practice. We cannot continue with a system where Member States pick and choose which bits of decisions they are going to implement and when – and these are decisions they themselves have agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">This is undermining political support in the European Union. I hope that once we get a full-time President of the Council he or she will regard this as an absolute priority, but in the meantime, in order to keep the Lisbon process on track, the Commission should publish a regular annual scoreboard outlining which Member States have done what and when. We can then judge, name and shame the villains.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleagues Mr Désir and Mrs van den Berg have set out many of the key elements that we would like to see emphasised in the Lisbon Strategy. I would like to add to that the need for more active labour market policies at national level. We seem very happy to pay out money to keep people on the unemployment scrap heap, to pay people to be written off and marginalised, when we should be investing in helping them back into work. There is not enough emphasis on this, although it was originally in the Kok report and I hope will continue to be.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office said that Mr Barroso is to be applauded for drawing the appropriate lessons from last month's debate on the Commission. It is a pity that the same cannot be said about the Dutch presidency. Mrs Kroes undoubtedly has the experience and expertise that will be of benefit to the Commission, but given the concerns that are being raised it is wrong for her to retain the competition portfolio. Whenever she has to adjudicate in a controversial matter, rightly or wrongly her integrity is going to be called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency should act in the interests of the European Union, not from narrow national concerns. I fear that the Dutch presidency has failed in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was delighted to see in the presidency conclusions the substantial commitment that you, together with other governments – I know the British Government is associated with this – have made to improving the business climate. I was disappointed you did not mention it in your speech, because this is one of the really important parts of your presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear – and this is highlighted in the Kok report – that cutting back on regulatory costs and encouraging new business start-ups is crucial to delivery of the Lisbon Agenda. We know about the very effective work you do in Holland, where I believe you set your ministers targets on cutting the cost of the regulatory burden every year. That is an example of best practice that should be copied not only in all the Member States but also within the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to Mr Nielson, the Commission's representative today, that we expect the Commission to deliver on this. It is one of the commitments set out in the Council's conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Our side of the House strongly supports this and wants to encourage it, and I would say to all Members that this House has a role to play here.</p>
<p class="contents">You asked us, President-in-Office, how we were going to respond to the challenge of the Kok report in becoming more engaged in the Lisbon Agenda. We need an effective committee in this House to look at the Lisbon Agenda. Not one that substitutes for committees like mine, but one that tackles issues that cut across Parliament's work, such as improving the regulatory agenda and acknowledging that we can sometimes be responsible for making life more difficult for European businesses. These are the real issues which I hope Parliament will tackle in future, and I congratulate you and your government on the foundations you have laid for helping us to move this vital agenda forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Yet we regret to see that this Programme appears to be yet another example of the Council doing little other than stating its good intentions. It is all well and good for it to congratulate itself on progress made during the past five years, particularly with regard to the establishment of a common asylum and immigration policy, the harmonisation of border controls and improvements to judicial cooperation, yet it would have only been fair to include references to the obstacles which certain Member States have placed in the way of progress in the field of justice and to note that only a minimum level of harmonisation in the field of asylum has been achieved. Although the Council expresses its regret that not all objectives were met, it has made no provision for specific measures to ensure that this does not happen again in future years.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are particularly concerned at the parallel drawn between the fight against terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration. This implies that illegal immigrants are assumed <span class="italic">a priori</span> to be potential criminals or terrorists, an assumption which is entirely unacceptable. These are people who have been forced to leave their country of origin as a result of unbearable living conditions or persecution. Whilst it is true that we need a global approach to policies relating to asylum, immigration and external border controls, I am sure you will agree that such an approach should not be adopted at the cost of migrants’ basic rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I was in Iraq last week. I have a suggestion to make as to how our aid might be most effectively targeted. As we all know, security is the major issue. European Union support, carefully targeted, could make all the difference in the training and the equipment of the Iraqi police service. Security is what the Iraqi people need and the lack of a strategic plan may already have cost many lives and will cost many more if we do not address this effectively. We need a strategic plan worked out with the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior and, as a matter of urgency, proper forensic capabilities. Westernised tactics should be adopted for the use of those capabilities and we should provide advanced surveillance equipment and the right training.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is a real need to train senior Iraqi police officers to plan and manage strategically, and that must be combined with an ethos of service and fairness within the Iraqi police service. In other words, we must move on from a reliance on countering insurgency by military tactics alone to a mixed plan. The police should no longer be treated as a second-rate military force but, with European Union funding, commitment and training, given a real chance of becoming a proper police service.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Iraqi people want the election to be held in January. A properly trained and effective police service is integral to its success. With our funding and our training competence, we in the European Union can make all the difference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe it to be a matter of urgent necessity that you should make the Lisbon objectives concrete and workable. Everyone must know who is to do what and by when; you should see to it that, after every spring summit, every Head of Government makes an official statement in his own country and that the parliaments debate the action plans specific to their own countries and vote on them, that you reinforce the Commission’s prerogatives of monitoring, coordinating and taking initiatives where the Lisbon process is concerned. Let us introduce at European level, in the national governments, and in the national parliaments, a Lisbon Steering Committee with an interdisciplinary approach!</p>

There is more to be done, and more is possible, provided that we have the political will and more determination.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have mentioned the Members’ Statute, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me tell you that you need only to accept Parliament’s resolution, and then we will have a Members’ Statute, and new rules on expenses.

Under the Palestinian Constitution, presidential elections must be held within a period of 60 days. If elections were to be held today, however, they could be hampered by a number of obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these obstacles relates to the freedom of movement of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, something which is essential both for the electoral campaign and for election preparations, the holding of elections and the counting of votes, but which is far from guaranteed. East Jerusalem poses the most problems, as the Israeli authorities there refuse to allow Palestinians to be registered on the electoral roll. I am therefore calling on the Council to take joint action with the United States in bringing pressure to bear on Israel so that it withdraws the troops currently deployed in the occupied territories.</p>
<p class="contents">The second obstacle faced is that of challenges to the eligibility of a candidate. It is up to the Palestinian authorities, and to them alone, to decide who is eligible on the basis of their own criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">The third obstacle relates to practical organisational issues and ensuring that the vote is fair, and this is an area in which the EU’s practical experience and support will be essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth obstacle is that of ensuring that the elections are safe, something which should be guaranteed for candidates, voters and observers alike. Palestinian police officers do not carry arms, and struggle to ensure the safety of civilians. Political security is dependent on the extent to which extremist groups are kept under control. The recent attempts by Fatah to include Hamas in a government of national unity, as long as it renounces the armed struggle, are something which should be monitored very closely by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to know what plans have been made at this stage with the Palestinians to ensure that the elections are safe. I am sorry to have to say it, Mr President, but to date Europe’s voice within the Quartet has been almost inaudible, and we should take this opportunity to make ourselves heard. We must now provide Palestine with staunch support to ensure that elections at any level are held freely, and we will of course always do the same for Israel to ensure that the indiscriminate attacks which plunge entire families into mourning are brought to an end. It is my firm belief that, more than ever before, the future of one nation is inextricably bound up with the future of other nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I remember the time when Soviet dictator Khrushchev declared that the Soviet Union would catch up with the USA in seven years. I also remember that he failed.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the European Union has every opportunity of accomplishing its aims, the Lisbon report is nevertheless a cause for concern. As Wim Kok has said, the dreams of catching up with the USA have been put on the back burner. Instead, the European Union is dealing with the question of how to halt economic decline.</p>
<p class="contents">I would join with my colleague Mr Radwan in giving credit to the Dutch presidency, and its bold and vigorous leadership. This is promising. However, in order to regain lost time, we need to concentrate more on one aspect – the motivation of the Process. Indeed, clear and strong motivation, together with an emphasis on results, has been the driving force behind the success of our competitors, USA and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the European Union should aim for a systemic approach to research and development activities and innovation. Wim Kok’s report stresses the need to give top priority to research and development, but special emphasis ought to be placed on the applied side of research in particular. So what is required is not less research, but more development work.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, it is especially important to base all our planned activities on the needs of innovation as a whole, and to motivate business leaders accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, the present funding schemes for innovation in research are unfortunately too administration-centred, and do not promote the practical application of results. One of the biggest problems is that funding is often directed into closed and ineffective systems. Therefore it is our task today not just to rely on attractive plans, but to show the political will to actually implement those plans. This is our responsibility to our voters.

Up until now, we had associated the name of Van Gogh with art and bold colours. The painting <span class="italic">Sunflowers</span> symbolises sun, warmth and freedom. Is it not an irony of history that a person bearing the same name should die because he exercised his freedom of speech and of thought, and because he sought the truth?</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, it is particularly significant that it was the Dutch Presidency that raised the complex issue of security for the EU, its Member States and its citizens. The public expects, and rightly so, that the EU, an institution that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, will adopt effective solutions with regard to the area of freedom, security and justice. These expectations are to be met by the Hague Programme. I should like to stress that this programme sets out objectives that were already included in the Constitutional Treaty. Indeed, it meets the majority of those expectations. The announcement that this programme is to include an anti-drugs strategy is also to be welcomed, as is the fact that the Council Presidency has chosen to make information on Europe its priority. It is clear that awareness of Europe must be heightened amongst its citizens, especially given the turnouts in the last elections. The EU must be brought closer to its citizens, but will this be achieved by broadcasting public debates on European issues before Council meetings, an idea contained in the conclusions? Will that be enough to bring the EU closer to its citizens? I am also concerned at the announcement that we will have to wait until June 2005 for a full information strategy. Why should this take so long? We need such a strategy now, especially in view of the fact that the campaigns to inform the public about the European Constitution began immediately after the Constitution was signed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I should like to turn to one last issue which relates to our future. The leaders of four Member States were quite right when they highlighted the importance of demographic factors for the EU’s future economic and social development, and when they called for a European Pact for Youth to be drawn up. This is a worthwhile initiative. Young people have a different view of Europe. They are well educated, full of energy and free of the fears and prejudices of the older generation. This is a good sign for Europe, for the EU and for all of us. The Pact for Youth should therefore be drawn up as quickly as possible, with the participation of young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the support of a team, he drafted the report on the Lisbon strategy. This coincided with the Dutch Presidency. We all agree with the findings of the report. The European Union is lagging a long way behind, and the responsibility for this lies mainly with the Member States and national governments. I agree that we need to draw up national strategies for the Lisbon process and implement them consistently, but these strategies must be coherent, and not developed separately. We must create added value on the basis of regional cooperation between neighbouring EU Member States, and I can provide three examples of ways in which this could happen. Poland has a particularly large number of extremely well-educated young people, whereas the neighbouring countries of Germany and Sweden have well-developed high-tech industries. There are opportunities for development if we were to join forces. The Baltic countries have particular opportunities for cooperation in the field of secure energy supply, an issue that is important for Europe as a whole. The Czech Republic, Germany and Poland can make the greatest contribution to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. To this end, European clean coal and carbon dioxide capture technologies must be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional cooperation also involves cooperation with the EU’s new neighbours, and the position taken by the Council on the issue of neighbourly relations with Ukraine is therefore key. We should assure Ukraine that the doors are open to its European ambitions, and we should promptly put in place an action plan for Ukraine with a view to promoting the development of civil society. Indeed there is also a need for measures to improve civil society within the EU. If this does not happen, we will not achieve our ambitious goals and crucially, millions of citizens will fail to understand the Lisbon process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The tragic events with Van Gogh and the extremists from the other side illustrate, unfortunately, that terrorism is working and what it is seeking: to ultimately suppress the obvious. Racial violence deserves zero tolerance, but the victory of the terrorists will be that we in Europe, unfortunately like others elsewhere, also consider that, in order to combat violence, war means peace and restricting personal freedoms means protecting them. Consequently, congratulations are in order for the Dutch presidency for the fact that, on the very days when these horrendous incidents occurred, it organised an informal conference for the 11 common authorities on the subject of integration. You have got the right emphasis. Integration. Not policing.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just three comments to make on the foregoing:</p>
<p class="contents">First, the Hague five-year programme which we are debating today makes provision for special funds to return immigrants and guard borders, but it makes no provision for a special integration fund, even though integration is one of the basic actions. We are asking for a commitment that the financing for integration be given the same priority, so that we get beyond words.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when we lay down policies for integration, we cannot ignore the fact that we have millions of European citizens in countries the world over who are themselves immigrants. Their experience cannot be ignored. From this point of view, we must be prepared to grant immigrants who settle in the countries of the European Union a similar level of treatment to that which we demand for European immigrants in third countries. Otherwise we are not being consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, attention to personal rights when dealing with terrorism. Biometric data in passports and other similar measures may be important; on the other hand, however, they may add little to security in relation to what they take away in civil liberties. Only if they are absolutely necessary and effective in addressing very clearly predefined objectives can they be the subject of discussion in my opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that, while I consider it a good thing that the Council turned its attention to four European foreign policy issues, events lead us to prioritise at least two at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the situation in Iraq. War is being waged again and the war is condemnable just as, of course, the terrorist action and kidnaps are condemnable. Armed conflicts and operations do not resolve problems; on the contrary, they increase the obligation of the European Union to submit, at long last, a full and integrated programme on the subject of addressing the crisis in Iraq. The first step in this process must be elections. Elections in Iraq must be held and as many forces as possible must participate, so that the elections really are not an end in themselves but a means which will allow Iraq to shortly become a progressive democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second parallel and related issue is the situation in the Middle East. The post-Arafat era is, of course, a new page in the history of this area. Over and above all, the European Union has an obligation here to intervene so that the political testament of Yasser Arafat is respected, because it is certain that the crisis in the Middle East will be addressed through the political testament left by Yasser Arafat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe still lacks its own personality; it does not have a face of its own; knowledge of Europe reaches the citizens with difficulty and it therefore has a long way to go in terms of selling the idea of European political union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council was naturally extremely concerned, given the very imminent challenges we are facing, including the ratification of the European Constitution by each of the Member States. And it made a very specific recommendation, taking a practical approach that I would like to praise, which is to promote television debates in each of the countries in order to stimulate interest in this process of ratifying the Constitution amongst the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw the attention of the honourable Members to a problem facing us: the first country to have called a referendum on the ratification of the European Constitution is Spain. Spain is governed by the Socialist Party, which is the Party of the President of this House, Mr Borrell, as we all know, since he does nothing to hide it. Although, given his role as arbitrator, he should take care to keep his ideological positions rather more hidden.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing a dilemma: this Parliament, which should occupy a vigilant position, can either promote party positions or promote institutional positions. From that point of view, Mr President, I would like to call on everybody to bear this in mind, and not to abandon that vigilant position, and we should make it very clear that this European institution must also put aside sectarian or party political behaviour and think of the common project we have before us.</p>

It is vital to ensure the general public’s security and fundamental rights, mutual trust and the primacy of law throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the Council particularly on its decision to implement in full Article 67 of the Treaty, so that qualified majority voting and a process of codecision can be applied for a range of topics under Heading IV. This is a step forward not only in terms of efficiency, but also in terms of democratic legitimacy, as it reinforces Parliament’s key role in adopting standards on topics as sensitive as asylum and immigration policy and all policies involving the general public’s fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The five-year post-Tampere period has come to an end, with significant achievements in the area of freedom, security and justice. Not all of the objectives have been met, but progress has been made. The balance is clearly in the black, something to which Commissioner Vitorino’s work contributed greatly. An impressive body of legislation has been built up, but we regret that, as regards its transposition into national legislation, major shortcomings have come to light, in terms both of meeting deadlines and of the quality of transposition.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Hague Programme for the next five years. It is now up to the Commission to table practical initiatives and to set out a timetable for adopting and implementing those initiatives. I welcome the Hague Programme, but I should point out that, here too, if we are to construct Europe we will need the necessary financial resources. There is no point in stating our priorities if we do not allocate the necessary resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the fact that the second phase of creating the European asylum system is underway. It is only by means of a common European asylum and immigration policy that we will be able to address problems such as illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings. In view of issues such as civil and corporate justice, cooperation in the area of criminal justice and, lastly, EU security, which remains one of the major priorities – the importance of condemning any kind of violence, but especially terrorism, cannot be over-emphasised – it is essential that Europol and Eurojust work in close cooperation. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Wim Kok report is undoubtedly an important step on the bumpy road toward achieving the goals set forth in Lisbon. It is apparent today that it will be almost impossible to adhere to the original schedule without deeper political commitment and serious effort.</p>
<p class="contents">The submitted report makes a valuable contribution to accelerating the Lisbon process and every, and I would like to stress <span class="italic">every</span>, recommendation in the document is worthy of consideration. The holistic approach suggesting a direct correlation between the question of job creation, the need to increase employment and developments in the macroeconomic environment is especially valuable. It also points out the important role of slowdowns and acceleration in economic growth trends.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, a few of the statements connected with this in the Report should be treated with caution. I am sure the few sentences adopting a critical tone with regard to the Stability and Growth Pact did not escape your attention either. As far as sustaining economic growth is concerned, the report paints a rather negative image of such an important instrument of public finances and budgetary discipline. We must not forget that the Stability and Growth Pact plays an important part in ensuring economic stability and consequently in ensuring that money retains its value. It must be emphasised that the assumption that reforming the Stability Pact and slackening economic discipline would in themselves create jobs through additional expenditure is something of an oversimplification of economic logic. It is evident that this assumption would only be true if governments used their budgetary expenditures only for development purposes. This, however, is far from the truth.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I do not believe that fundamental reform of the Stability and Growth Pact would be in the economic interests of the Union; quite the contrary: it would reduce competitiveness even in the short-term. Nevertheless, the criticism of the Stability Pact expressed in the Wim Kok report undoubtedly addresses real concern, namely the key role of economic growth in creating and increasing employment. I, for my part, would suggest a different approach to solve this problem: I am thinking primarily of creating an enterprise-friendly economic environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have dealt with issues that affect the European citizen directly at great length. I have also noticed that there has been support from many quarters for the keystones discussed by the Council, namely more cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs, working on safety in Europe, working on more balanced economic growth, the Lisbon strategy, and promoting public involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with the Hague Programme. Mr Schulz was right to draw attention to Commissioner Vitorino’s important role, because the excellent result has been achieved partly thanks to his input and influence. I think that now is an appropriate time to thank Mr Vitorino for this. Mr Mayor Oreja was right to talk about the importance of priorities being set in the programme for freedom and security. For example, these priorities are in place for the first item, being asylum and immigration. We are working on better decision-making. Qualified Majority Voting is being introduced and an asylum procedure will enter into effect in 2010. With regard to terrorism, we need to take decisive action to fight it and that is exactly why, as Mrs in ‘t Veld already stated, cooperation between police, justice and intelligence services needs to be stepped up. Terrorism will also be discussed in more detail at the meeting of the European Council in December. For the rest, I would draw your attention to the action plan to be compiled by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schulz was right to indicate that certain ingredients should always be present, namely security for the citizen, together with the promotion of safety on the one hand and respect for basic rights on the other. I think that the Hague Programme succeeded in striking the right balance in this respect. Mrs Kósáné Kovács has drawn our attention to the need to do justice to fundamental rights in Europe, in which context she defended the Hague Programme. Mr Alvaro spoke about a good combination of scope for investigations and doing justice to basic rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsequently, the subject of what is meant by QMV, Qualified Majority Voting, has also been raised. This is already in place in many areas, but not in respect of illegal immigration. That will change when the new Constitutional Treaty enters into effect, for then QMV will apply across the board. Mr Giertych mentioned the fact that Member States are given compulsory immigration quotas. It so happens that asylum immigration, in terms of procedures, is a joint responsibility. That is why the Hague Programme is also so important, but that does not mean that in respect of QMV, immigration quotas can be imposed on Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Eurlings spoke wise words when he talked about the meaning of values and tolerance in society. Particularly in Europe, people should approach each other with respect, but that presupposes two things. On the one hand, due account must be taken of respect for the different values which typify Europe; on the other hand, boundaries must be set when people resort to hatred, intimidation and humiliation. This is exactly how we want to build on freedom and a peaceful society. That also means that we must watch the place hatred and racism take in the debate. Respectful cooperation and co-existence are precisely what is required. In that respect, you also have to choose your words carefully. I have noticed, also in my contacts with representatives of the Islam community, that extremism and terrorism are unequivocally repudiated in the Islam community too. That is why it is dangerous to immediately associate Islam, for example, with terrorism. It is precisely the terrorists who take advantage of religion in order to commit immoral deeds, which must be emphatically repudiated. That is why it is also so important for different groups, whether they be Christian, Humanist, non-religious or Islamic, to join forces in order to put a stop to violence and extremism. In this Parliament, the importance of aid to victims was mentioned, and rightly so; this was a question raised by Mr Mayor Oreja. There is a European action plan against terrorism that was laid down in the European Council of March, which contains a section on solidarity with victims of terrorism. The Dutch Presidency plans to elaborate on that aspect in the December European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lambert mooted the idea of a human rights centre. The Commission published a communication about changing the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna to a European human rights centre. That is currently being discussed in the Council and decisions in this respect will be taken under the Luxembourg Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the Hague Programme, Mrs Flautre has spoken, and expressed her concerns, about reception in the region. It is useful to note that when we mention reception in the region, this will always be done in consultation with the UNHCR.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to the Lisbon strategy. I have noticed that there is much support for the strategy within this Parliament too, which is geared to strengthening Europe’s economy, and the need for reforms has been underlined. In that context, I would also refer to Mr Kok’s report, the report of the Employment Task Force, that was discussed some time ago. In addition to these favourable comments, though, some voices of criticism have also been heard. Mrs Lambert and Mrs Zimmer spring to mind. They claim from time to time that there is no alternative to the Lisbon strategy. Is that true? I should like to note once again that the Lisbon strategy combines economic dynamism, social cohesion and doing justice to sustainable development. It is the combination of those three components which has also come to the fore in the conclusions of the European Council. I therefore beg to differ with those who claim that Mr Kok, along with his high-level group, has paid insufficient attention to the social and environmental dimensions. The environment has been sufficiently covered, particularly since it is based on the idea of a win-win situation. In the European Council, Mr Kok maintains that we need growth precisely in order to retain the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would refer to Paragraph 5 of the conclusions of the European Council in which it is stated, and rightly so, that a balanced strategy with economic, social and environmental dimensions is needed in order to strengthen competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blokland claimed that Mr Kok put the ball back in the court of the Member States, and went on to enquire after the Dutch Presidency’s agenda for the near future. I should like to draw your attention to three things in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we have analysed the remarks, suggestions and opinions of the Heads of Government during the informal working lunch.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will be consulting the Luxembourg Presidency about future conclusions and needless to say, we will be in contact with the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, provided he and his team receive your consent.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also noticed that you demand concrete action. What is needed is not only declarations, but also that we simply examine what the matter in hand is and deal with it. In that framework, the suggestion made by Mr Eurlings is interesting. He states that different Member States boast innovation platforms and that those should, where possible, join forces. Mrs van den Burg was right to draw the attention to cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments. Mrs in 't Veld also re-emphasised the need for action. We will convey this message to the Luxembourg Presidency. It is useful to remind ourselves that liberalisation, the very element we need in order to strengthen market forces, does not have to be at odds with the European social model. Mrs Oomen-Ruijten was right to point out that the actions must be concrete and that national responsibilities must, in fact, be taken. It is also for that reason that I, as President of the European Council, have opted for a different working formula, namely for a very in-depth dialogue during the working lunch to exchange experiences with regard to the reform policy in the different European Member States. I think that that was a sound formula. I also think that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten was right to talk about the need for better regulations and an easing in the rules with a view to strengthening the entrepreneurial climate in Europe and economic growth. I agree with you that there, too, the European Parliament can play an important role.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mrs Staniszewska mentioned the Lisbon objectives in relation to the financial perspectives. These objectives will obviously be given a prominent place in the new financial perspectives and needless to say, we have yet to agree on the level of those amounts.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the third item, that of communication. People from different political persuasions have pointed at the need for good communication. Mr Eurlings was right to point out that a prompt solution must be found to the problem of the statute, and that of your provision of income, because continuous discussion of this subject does not create a good impression. Mr Nicolaï, my European Affairs Minister will also commit to this matter for that reason. Certain Members have raised the subject of language, and we had the pleasure of hearing Welsh and Irish. I have understood your message. The Constitution was also mentioned. In this context, the idea of a referendum week was mooted. It so happens that referendums deal with different situations in the Member States. Legislation is not the same everywhere. There are a number of practical and legal objections to having the referendums in the space of one week. Mr Nicolaï discussed this with your Committee on Constitutional Affairs yesterday, and this produced three elements.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is recognised that this primarily concerns national matters. Secondly, the European character can be emphasised by, for example, joint and simultaneous action, which also accommodates what you stated here before. We will also be working on subtle coordination by, for example, ensuring that consultation between the European Affairs Ministers is good in terms of planning campaigns, and suchlike.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Knapman raised the possible issues that could arise when the referendums and decisions made at Member State level have a negative outcome. You know what the deal is. It has been agreed in the European Council that, if ratification has been completed by 4/5 of the number of Member States and if a few Member States were to have issues at that point, the situation will be discussed. A treaty cannot be signed and ratified if not all countries sign. However, I urge you to do what we can in order to have a positive outcome and in order to receive support for the Constitutional Treaty. In all honesty, I have high hopes and high expectations. Let there be no mistake, though, it does require excellent communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, also in the framework of communication, Professor Grabowska mentioned a youth pact. She supported us in this and I am pleased with what she had to say.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, different remarks have been made about external relations, foreign policy and the concern that exists about various developments in the world. This brings me to the remarks made by Mr Catania, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mrs Napoletano concerning the situation in Iraq. We cannot turn a blind eye to the events in Iraq. Obviously, international legal rules will need to be adhered to. We assume that the US authorities will be mounting an in-depth investigation straight away further to the images we saw yesterday and will take measures in order to prevent similar events in future. I would also like to express my abhorrence in respect of the persistent attacks and hostage takings in Iraq, the recent low being the killing of aid worker Margaret Hassan. We sympathise with the relatives of the victims of the atrocious violence in Iraq. At the same time, we must all contribute to stability in Iraq. The conference to be held in Sharm El Sheikh next Tuesday offers the neighbouring countries and major international actors a good opportunity to send a joint message to Iraq and the Iraqi people. I hope and trust that this will be a clear message in support of the Iraqi interim government, together with democracy, freedom, security and justice in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs De Keyser expressed concerns about the Middle East. I should like to emphasise that the Union will pull out all the stops to ensure that the Palestinian elections are a success. That was also the reason for the short-term programme that we in the European Council have approved. Mr Bot and the High Representative, Mr Solana, are in consultation with Arab countries and with the members of the quartet of the party involved. We in the Presidency are also working in close consultation with Javier Solana on a package of direct measures to support the Palestinians, particularly in the run-up to the presidential elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finally turn to Mrs Staniszewska’s observation about Ukraine. There is no doubt that the Union is offering Ukraine a prospect for the future, and it is not for nothing that we developed an action plan, with and for Ukraine, in the framework of the European neighbourhood programme. Hopefully, this will be laid down formally in December, which will give us a fresh basis for future cooperation. In this respect, we will not be considering who will win the elections, but the way in which those elections are being held. Only by fair and free elections can the Ukrainian Government demonstrate that it observes European standards not only in words, but also in deeds. This brings me to the end of my speech. On behalf of the Presidency, I should like to thank the Members of this House for their in-depth and interesting contributions. You have sent out signals that are important for future international policy-making. Europe means a great deal to the public. Communication will be tremendously enhanced when Europe contributes to employment, to a prospect for the future for the economy, when Europe helps reinforce security and if Europe succeeds in achieving results in these areas. I will naturally convey your opinions to the Council, and would thank you again for your input. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, during the debate it was said that to talk about there being no alternative to the Lisbon Strategy was questionable, but that reflects an incorrect perception of what it is really about. It is not a simple and easy fix that drew us to defining this position in Lisbon, it is a more complex and broadly defined strategy. It is not an <span class="italic">à la carte</span> list, available for selective political shopping, but one balanced menu. Of course it is complex, and that is why we needed to re-evaluate where we are and how we can improve performance. If we did not have it at all, we would have to invent it.</p>
<p class="contents">One aspect links the challenge of the ageing population in Europe with the challenge of increasing competitiveness. In a broad sense, that aspect is education. In my view, we are not entitled to life-long earning without life-long learning and this has to be very broadly defined. It is not just about elevating the elite in Europe, it is also important to look at the broader definition of education for the labour market. Here, the challenge for Europe to improve its competitiveness is not to say 'work harder' but to say 'work smarter'. This is the only way forward and is also why increasing the focus on education is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Money is also essential. One per cent is not enough! It does not make sense to talk about ambition and to define and identify with the ambition of Lisbon without doing something to the budget. This is not just about the Community budget, but it does include it. We cannot have a credible ambition for Europe without a credible budget for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Titley suggested a scoreboard to show the performance of Member States' implementation efforts. I see the Kok report as an initial step along those lines. I am totally convinced that President Barroso and the incoming Commission will do its utmost in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Harbour mentioned the need for the Commission to reduce red tape and to simplify procedures. An important point on the European agenda should be to look again at the existing <span class="italic">acquis</span> of directives and find out whether they could be simplified by transforming them and clarifying things to have more regulations and fewer directives. This would make it easier for economic players in Europe to find out what the existing legal situation is by reading it in a regulation instead of having to find out how directives have been implemented in all the different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To mention just one example, the Prodi Commission has reduced the different ways of tendering from 48 to 8. This is not the answer to all the problems and I would say that the Financial Regulation is still a monster. We have not reached the point of simplification that we had hoped for. One reason for this is that in reacting to the problems of the previous Commission, we perhaps added too many layers of futile <span class="italic">ex ante</span> controls. I hope the Commission and Parliament will continue to look at the Financial Regulation. Confidence-building between our European institutions is necessary, but it is now necessary to build self-confidence. We can do better.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to some final remarks on external relations. I add my voice to the sympathy being expressed to the family of the aid worker, Margaret Hassan, particularly because we in the Commission have been funding her work and the work of her organisation in Iraq over many years.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to be perpetually necessary to remind the strongest power in the world about the need to respect international humanitarian law. I was totally shocked to learn the other day that Red Crescent aid workers were not given access to Fallujah by the United States Army there. This is very, very bad and the international community – if we have one – should react very strongly against this type of behaviour. We, as Europeans, cannot create a credible basis for our relationship with an emerging democratic Iraq if we do not invest and do not clarify that it is possible for our views to differ from those of others on some points.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the readmission problem I would also say that confidence-building is necessary. It is not just about telling our neighbours and some developing countries far away from here that they have to take back refused asylum seekers from their own country or maybe their neighbouring country. We have to consider Europe's image in this. We have to offer some burden-sharing when we do these things. We must make it clear that we should not fund these activities with money earmarked for development cooperation. We have to talk about additionality, because we are adding to the list of things to do.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the last time I will address this House. I want, on a personal note, to thank you for five very good years, both on the level of the results we have achieved together and on a personal level.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, and good luck.</p>

It is therefore important that we highlight our opposition to this Treaty and our criticisms of economic, monetary and competition policy. The Treaty contains a profoundly neoliberal slant, to the detriment of social policy, and a narrow outlook on social rights and fundamental freedoms, with the emphasis placed on centralism and federalism in their various forms. As highlighted in the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European United Left, the conception of a European security policy in the Treaty contains a major military dimension, and provides for close cooperation with NATO and an increase in Member States’ military efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy, we strongly criticise the Kok report on the interim review of the Lisbon Strategy, particularly in view of its emphasis on ‘competitiveness’, on further increasing the flexibility of labour markets, on structural reforms in the internal market and on the liberalisation and privatisation policies, despite the disastrous impact that those policies have already had. We strongly believe that the Stability and Growth Pact must be revoked and replaced with a Growth and Employment Pact, as stated in our Group’s motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
