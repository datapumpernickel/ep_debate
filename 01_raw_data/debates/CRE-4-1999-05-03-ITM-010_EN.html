<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bösch </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have always been convinced that in the end the European Union and its institutions would emerge from the crisis of the past weeks and months stronger. By setting up OLAF, the new European Fraud Investigation Office, we shall make a visible contribution to this. I think it is a good sign that the legal base for OLAF will be one of the first texts to be adopted under the new procedures of the Amsterdam Treaty. This would certainly not have been possible had not all those involved – the Council, Parliament and, after initial hesitations, the Commission – collaborated on this project in a very constructive spirit. My thanks therefore go to all those who have been and still are members of the high‐level group of representatives of our three institutions at both technical and political level. In my capacity as Parliament"s rapporteur, I should like to mention three of the participants by name and express my sincere thanks to them: my committee chairman, Mrs Theato; a courageous friend from my group, Mrs Wemheuer; and my tireless assistant, Mr Schönberger.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the proposal itself. We have put together a package consisting of three components. The first component is the Commission decision to establish OLAF, an office which, although located organisationally within the Commission, is guaranteed to be independent of the Commission and to be free to take its own decisions when conducting investigations and enquiries. The Commission adopted this decision last week. The second component is the Council and Parliament regulation laying down how the investigations are to be conducted and what should happen with the results. This regulation is the centrepiece of the package. It covers external investigations in the Member States and internal investigations within all the EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, these are the most important points which we wish to incorporate in it: firstly, the Director of OLAF has a free hand in the investigative work. In this context, he may not accept instructions from any party. He may open investigations at the request of a Member State or an institution, but may also do so on his own initiative, and he has the right to lodge complaints with the European Court of Justice if he finds that his independence is compromised. We included this point on the express recommendation of the Court of Auditors, whose opinion has incidentally been of great assistance to us in eliminating any remaining inconsistencies from the texts.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Director is under a specific obligation to inform and call in the competent national judicial authorities if Office staff working on internal investigations come across facts which might relate to matters open to criminal charges. OLAF is not therefore about replacing or circumventing national public prosecutors and judges. Nor is OLAF a way of setting up an EU police force by the back door. What it is about is carrying out administrative investigations – if you like, preliminary investigations – which should allow the police and public prosecutor to do their job.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, OLAF will be subject to monitoring by independent, external experts. The German version of the text rather unfortunately still refers to a scrutiny committee. The English version captures the meaning much better. It uses the term supervisory committee. Here we particularly have in mind experienced experts in criminal law or high‐ranking civil servants from the relevant bodies in the Member States such as the <span class="italic">Guardia di finanza</span> or the British Serious Fraud Office. It is not intended that this committee should interfere in the Director"s everyday work, but that it should ensure, by carrying out <span class="italic">ex post</span> controls, that no mistakes are made. All of this and more – on which I cannot enter into detail in the short time available – is therefore part of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the third component, the institutional agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission on internal investigations. This is the subject of another report, which was adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control today, shortly before the beginning of this debate, and which will be put to the vote along with the report on the regulation this Thursday. All of the other Union bodies, institutions and agencies are specifically invited and requested also to enter into this agreement. This is necessary for OLAF to be able to conduct investigations within them. In addition, it is stipulated that officials and other EU employees are obliged to inform their superiors – and, if they think it necessary, OLAF – directly and without delay of any facts which might allow cases of fraud, corruption or similar crimes to be closed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only the staff but also the members of the institutions and bodies who will cooperate fully with OLAF. At this stage there can be no exceptions, as this would cause us to lose credibility. However, neither can our independence as Members of Parliament be threatened. It is precisely with our parliamentary immunity in mind that a number of sensitive issues remain to be clarified. This was not part of the negotiations and nor could it be. It is no longer possible for this Parliament to make any over‐hasty decisions on this either; it will be a matter for the newly elected Members.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally there are several points which, although they are also to be decided by the newly elected Parliament, are matters on which we ought to make progress in the high‐level group over the next few weeks, and if possible by the ECOFIN Council on 25 May. We need a proposal for the five members of the supervisory committee to which everyone can agree; we need a job description for the Director of OLAF so that the job advertisement can be published; and, as our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets have already recommended in their opinion, we need an establishment plan for OLAF so that a supplementary budget can be agreed on that basis. This has to happen very quickly, and it is also the decisive test of our credibility. OLAF must actually be up and running by the end of the year.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blak </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, most of us are growing rather tired of hearing about corruption and fraud involving EU funds. Hopefully, the forthcoming election campaign will also deal with other important political issues, but the battle over the major reforms should be fought now, while the political will is still present. We have succeeded in reaching an agreement on OLAF, and would like to take this opportunity to commend the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, for his outstanding work in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission. We have achieved a really good result. The new proposal is far better than the original. The Office will now be located in the Commission for organisational purposes, but it will be entirely independent as far as carrying out investigations is concerned. Its independence will be guaranteed by the fact that the Commission will not have powers to direct the Office. The Office will also have powers to investigate irregularities and fraud in other EU institutions. The Commission is not the only place where there are problems. The Office will have full access to all relevant information, and it will be able to carry out investigations on its own initiative. With this proposal, we will hopefully get the best of all worlds. We will get an Office which is independent, and at the same time gain an extra benefit by locating the Office within the Commission. If the Office is part of the Commission, we will have access to confidential information which it would otherwise not have been possible to obtain. We will not have an Office which is hoodwinked, as we have been in Parliament for years. If we had instead chosen a solution which involved setting up an entirely new Office outside the Commission, it would have required a change in the Treaty. We cannot wait for that. It is vital that we have the Office now, and not in two years' time or never.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting this proposal, we will set up the legal framework. But that is far from enough. Money must now be made available in the budget for staff. We in Parliament have asked for a staff of 300, which is definitely not too many. The Office must have the resources to operate effectively. Otherwise we would reproduce the problems which result from leaving such an important task to the Commission without allocating the necessary resources. When Parliament meets again in the autumn, we shall ensure that sufficient funds are earmarked in the budget. We have a huge task here. The whole question of what the Office needs cannot be left to the Commission. The tripartite committee should be involved in the discussion, and I would therefore like to propose a meeting of the tripartite committee after 25 May, when the proposal will also have been adopted by the Council. We can then quickly discuss the appointment of the Supervisory Committee, and then we can elect a Director. Then we can get the Office up and running as quick as possible. That is what we need.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Theato </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control. – (DE)</span> Mr President, it will be remembered that one of the touchstones for being able to grant discharge to the Commission for 1996 was the creation of an operationally independent fraud prevention office. Parliament laid down some important ground rules for an office of this kind when it adopted the report of the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Bösch report, by a large majority in October 1998 and requested a proposal for a regulation along those lines from the Commission. As I see it – and I am not exaggerating – if the Commission had made a reasonable proposal to improve fraud prevention at the beginning of December, then it might have been spared the refusal of discharge shortly before Christmas and thus all that followed.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it was the middle of March before an amended Commission proposal which met Parliament"s demands was tabled. Happily, in this proposal the Commission abandoned the unreasonable idea of entrusting the responsibility for irregularities and fraud to an external agency with, would you believe it, 48 officials, that is one official to protect an average of EUR 2 billion. Since then, progress has been extremely quick. If Parliament, the Council and the Commission continue to cooperate as well as they have done in recent weeks, then we will even be able to adopt all the legislation for an independent fraud prevention office before the European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to highlight the constructive role played by Commissioners Anita Gradin, Karel Van Miert and Mario Monti, but I also wish specifically to commend the Council presidency, our rapporteur Mr Bösch and the secretariats of the three institutions for the huge amount of work which they have done. The Committee on Budgetary Control has done its homework; it has unanimously reached a common position in agreement with the German Presidency, and has just this minute approved the accompanying interinstitutional agreement. If Parliament and the Council keep to this line, then OLAF will be able to enter into force in June. The rapporteur has already described its responsibilities. I should just like to emphasise its operational independence once again – from an institutional point of view, the responsibility still lies with the Commission; we had to do this to find a speedy solution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that the Director has access to the judicial authorities in the case of matters which may be open to criminal charges. However, there is another snag here. Our experiences with the national judicial authorities have not been very encouraging up until now. To my knowledge, for example, final verdicts have not so far been reached in any of the 27 internal cases of fraud which UCLAF has investigated since 1994. In conclusion, I think that our aims in creating OLAF are to make a constructive contribution to better protecting the interests of the EU against abuse, to make prevention a priority, and to recover money which has gone missing.</p>

As far as I am concerned, it is therefore vital that the new Office is free to investigate any matter it wishes and that it has complete independence in deciding whether or not the matter should subsequently be handed over to the judicial authorities, the national courts. I think it is crucial for us now to have an investigation office which can investigate circumstances in all the EU institutions. That should certainly give it enough to do. When I say all the EU institutions, that should also include the European Investment Bank, for example. With the accusations which have recently been made, I would expect the Bank itself to have an interest in uncovering everything that is going on there. But the European Parliament should also offer its assistance, and there may be examples of tasks which it would be interesting to have investigated, such as the problems surrounding our premises, where there are still a large number of unanswered questions. I therefore believe, Mr President, that the new office, OLAF, is a significant improvement of the situation in the EU. It gives us a good chance to clear things up and to ensure openness and transparency in all the institutions.</p>

Fraud and theft are now a way of life and are turning into a scientific study. Organised crime is now a fashionable and studied crime, occurring in the best circles, and its sole goal is theft.</p>
<p class="contents">Organisations must therefore be created which are fully prepared and independent. They must have the necessary financial and human resources and be able to act independently. But is acting independently actually the ideal given that the legal systems of many Member States are in crisis? For it is frequently the legal system itself, influenced by the executive – since Montesquieu"s separation of powers is fast disappearing – which fails to condemn totally blatant cases of fraud in which billions are at stake. Anyone, like us, who participated in the Action Committee on BSE and the Committee of Inquiry into Community Transit can say that the ideal of a Europe without borders has indeed been created, but without borders and without control. It is clear that this is a temptation and a paradise for organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the solutions put forward by Mr Bösch are supported by the political will which is needed to ensure their total success. However, the cooperation of the Member States is fundamental because they are as guilty as the Commission and we should not forget this.</p>

Its predecessor, UCLAF, has not been in existence for very long, but the major shortcoming of this has already become apparent, namely that in political terms it is under the control of the Commission. It is of the utmost importance that OLAF really is independent and has the task of investigating <span class="italic">all</span> the European institutions, which is quite an extensive mandate but one which I believe we in Parliament will ensure it actually carries out. It is naturally also important for there to be unrestricted access to all material, so that a proper investigation can be conducted. This is necessary in order to combat the fraudulent use of the EU's own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mr Bösch for working so assiduously on this report, as well as the Commission for withdrawing its first blueprint for OLAF and making a constructive contribution to finding the solution we shall be dealing with this week.</p>

<p class="contents">I must first of all pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, who managed to stick to his guns, despite the opposition from within his own group, the Group of the Party of European Socialists. In the same vein, I have to say that the Group of the European People"s Party, as represented on the Committee on Budgetary Control, was fully behind the rapporteur, put up a good fight, and came away victorious. Furthermore, what took place, such as our refusal to grant discharge, may be the crowning achievement of the efforts of this Parliament, whose term comes to an end this week. We will all be remembered for the effort we made to clean up the economy of the Community, and the establishment of OLAF will have a prominent place at the heart of this endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I in turn hope that this office will prosper, and for this to happen the old confrontations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council are of no import. But we must all tend this plant which is just beginning to take root, so that it can bear fruit for the good of the European Union, its economic and, above all, its fiscal policies.</p>

In my brief comments I am particularly keen to highlight the important role played by Mr Bösch who – even at times when it was not all that easy to make any headway with this idea – has always been very consistent in maintaining the need for an independent body, given the serious nature of the events which have occurred and the difficulties of tackling them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw your attention to the many years of work done by the committee and by Mr Theato in order to establish a role for Parliament enabling legality and transparency to be improved. The cooperation provided by the Committee on Civil Liberties and the reports we have produced have also played a part here. On this report too, although we only played a minor role, we wanted to draw up an opinion which was consistent and in harmony with all the work done over the years.</p>
<p class="contents">We set out a short to medium‐term solution, but we also – on the basis of Article 280 – mentioned a possible later development. In fact I believe that the political legacy we have acquired – the independence of the Office – is one which should first be put into practice and then adapted and improved later.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that only an Office which is independent in its internal and external investigations can allow us adequately to combat the developments which have threatened to overwhelm our institutions. I would add, however, that it is also highly important to monitor the Office"s organisational capacity. Woe betide us if a bureaucratic mentality were to destroy what should be a fresh new development: it is a new departure in institutional terms and this should also be the case when it comes to getting results.</p>
<p class="contents">May I conclude, Mr President, by giving my particular congratulations to the colleagues to whom we are most indebted for this work.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Diller, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 15 March 1999, under my chairmanship, the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers adopted a clear position: no leniency, zero tolerance of fraud and corruption in the Community. Abuse of the money which belongs to the people of the Union damages the Community"s reputation; headlines about it weaken public support for integration and push the Union"s successes into the background.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the creation of the new Fraud Investigation Office is a great opportunity for the Community and an important objective of our presidency. The Council, Parliament and the Commission can hereby demonstrate their will and ability to protect Community resources effectively. If we succeed in setting up the Office by 1 June this year, as planned, then this will be an important sign, and the fact that this is just a few days before the European Parliament elections will lend it a particular significance.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have managed – in close cooperation with the European Parliament – to produce a workable blueprint. I should like to single out three aspects of this. Firstly, the proposal you have before you ensures that the Office will take effective action wherever the interests of the Community are at stake. The Office has not only been tasked with external control – and this is undoubtedly important, because it is the Member States which administer around 80 % of Community aid – it will also be an independent guardian of Community interests within the bodies and institutions of the Community. Many speakers have already pointed out the significance of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, even though the Office is being set up within the Commission, its operational independence is guaranteed. The Director of the Office may not seek or accept instructions from anyone. Decisions on opening, conducting and evaluating investigations are his personal responsibility. The Commission can only appoint the Director in agreement with the European Parliament and the Council. A committee of external, independent individuals will supervise and protect the Director"s autonomous running of the Office.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, although public interest is currently focused on uncovering suspected irregularities, prevention is of not inconsiderable importance. That is another reason why the blueprint for OLAF is a good start, because the Office is called upon to collaborate on the overall strategy for fraud prevention and will also make its experience available for preventive initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, I will also say a few words on the timetable. The Office is meant to be created by 1 June. Adoption by ECOFIN is planned for 25 May. Afterwards the regulation will be signed by both the President of the European Parliament and the President‐in‐Office of the Council. The accompanying agreement will be signed by the Presidents of the three bodies – Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The other bodies and institutions are requested to enter into the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to highlight the trusting and constructive cooperation we have enjoyed with the European Parliament delegation, in particular Mrs Theato and the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, and with Commissioner Gradin. For all those who have worked on OLAF this has been an encouraging experience, which also bodes well for future cooperation.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gradin, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, Mr Bösch's report and the Commission decision to establish a European fraud prevention office marks the end of a long process starting back in 1995. Since then, we have come a long way when it comes to strengthening the tools in the fight against irregularities, fraud and corruption. The European tax‐payer has every right to expect us to protect their money and to administer it in an efficient way.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully committed to meet this demand. To me it is also a matter of credibility of our institutions. I believe that the establishment of the OLAF responds to both these objectives. The decision to establish this office is built on a constructive political dialogue between our two institutions and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I comment on Mr Bösch's report, I want to put the fight against fraud into its right perspective. When I took office in 1995 the staff working in the anti‐fraud area were still spread around several services of the Commission, with only around sixty staff working in UCLAF. Since then, UCLAF's operational capacity has been considerably strengthened and the staff put under one roof.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, UCLAF has 141 staff to deal with around 1000 cases where there is suspicion of irregularities, fraud and corruption. The number of cases under investigation has risen continuously. This is, of course, regrettable but it is also a sign that we are getting better in our work to fight fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">During the course of last year much attention focused on the 27 internal investigations in the Commission. It is often forgotten that the great majority of UCLAF investigations relate to external cases in the Member States. I do not mention this to diminish the internal problem in the Commission: just one single internal case is one too many.</p>
<p class="contents">UCLAF works in close cooperation with Member States. For instance, in the course of 1998 the total number of cases dealt with by the Member States and UCLAF was almost 5000 cases covering around EUR 1 billion. This cooperation is particularly important since there is a growing number of fraud cases that cut across borders, as well as growing involvement of international organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The strengthening of UCLAF and its capacity to fight fraud stems from a number of internal Commission decisions. As long ago as 1995 I took the initiative to bring together all the anti‐fraud activities under the UCLAF umbrella. This was followed up in 1997 with a decision to strengthen the independence of UCLAF by, among other things, giving the director the same status as the independent financial controller.</p>
<p class="contents">A new decision in 1998 transformed the office into a taskforce. At the same time, units were added to UCLAF to deal with fraud in third countries, corruption inside the institutions, and the legal and judicial cooperation with Member States. In July 1998 the Commission decided to further clarify, strengthen and make more transparent the UCLAF mandate. The primary aims were to underline the obligations of staff to cooperate in investigations and at the same time to protect the rights of the individual.</p>
<p class="contents">Initiatives have also been taken to improve information about the work of UCLAF. In early 1998 the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, and I, agreed on a procedure to inform the committee <span class="italic">in camera</span> on ongoing UCLAF investigations as well as internal audit reports from the financial controller. It is in fact UCLAF who brought information as regards suspicion of fraud to the committee's attention and not, as is often believed, journalists having conducted their own investigations. One could therefore say that we, too, have been whistle‐blowers.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all these efforts it became increasingly clear during 1998 that one further step was necessary. This is why I responded positively in July last year in the Committee on Budgetary Control to further increase UCLAF's independence. As a consequence the Commission put forward a proposal to externalise UCLAF's investigation functions. One of several important aspects to me was that this would avoid the situation where colleagues would investigate colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the proposal to externalise UCLAF was not acceptable to the Council and the European Parliament. To find a solution a high‐level working group was set up at the political level, with participation from Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Commissioners van Miert, Monti and I participated as the Commission representatives. In this context I wish to stress that I found this interinstitutional way to find a compromise very constructive. The Commission moved quickly to approve the first result of the work in the high‐level group in March.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not venture into a detailed account of how work progressed. It is sufficient to note that the Commission has a adopted a decision to establish OLAF. I wish to remind you that the establishment of the new office with the Commission will require resources, as Mr Blak also said. The Office will need extra staff and expenditure is bound to increase in light of the broadened scope of operations. A request for these additional resources must therefore be expected in the rectifying letter to the budget to be presented later this year to the new Parliament. I trust that the budget authorities will receive this request positively.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Wednesday the Commission also took note of the amendments proposed by Parliament in the Bösch report. I am very pleased to inform you that the Commission can accept all the amendments in this report. The Commission has also approved the draft interinstitutional agreement which will enable the office to conduct internal administrative investigations in Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would very much like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bösch, and other Members of the high‐level group: Mrs Theato, Lord Tomlinson, Mr Blak and Mr Grosch. My thanks also include the Council presidency which has participated in the group with the same positive spirit. I believe that this joint process has proven highly effective. It could set an example for the way our institutions could work together in other areas in the future. I hope that Parliament, in its vote on the Bösch report on Thursday will recognise the important efforts made and the added possibility the OLAF will bring to the joint fight against fraud. This would clear the way for the ECOFIN Council on 25 May to take the necessary decisions for OLAF to come into force on 1 June 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always had the interests of the tax‐payers foremost in mind. With this initiative we are sending a clear signal that all three institutions share this concern. With a new OLAF we will have a tool in place that will strengthen our fight against fraud and corruption considerably. It is a great achievement for the Union and its citizens.</p>
