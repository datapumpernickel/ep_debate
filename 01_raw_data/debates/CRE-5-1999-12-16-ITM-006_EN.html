Although a peace agreement was signed in Lomé in July, on 22 November, a UN investigation team sadly noted once again a significant deterioration. The terror against the civilian population in certain parts continues, as do the killings, rape, incarceration and arming of children. This leads me to raise two specific questions, Mr President, Commissioner, which we need to ask ourselves in all honesty, both as a Commission and as a Union. Can we allow this arms trade to continue? We know that diamonds – smuggled diamonds, in particular – play a crucial role in this. Can we continue to turn a blind eye? </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, for the sake of maintaining the peace agreement, a pledge was made to deploy UN peace-keeping troops. Is the mandate of these troops powerful enough or should we not find out as a matter of urgency what this comes down to in practice other than paying a few mercenaries to be stationed in safe zones? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To improve things we need to change the quality of government. It is a country which was highly educated and highly law-abiding. It is being ruined by international money laundering: diamonds are more easy to exchange internationally than money. But the poor respect both education and humanitarian values and they respect democracy. Soon there will be another general election. We should support that push for democracy. They have earned their chance to vote.

Nevertheless, the hopes which gave rise to this agreement have not been fulfilled and today, five months later, we must note with great concern and sorrow that the rebel attacks against civilians, the killings and rapes, have not only failed to diminish, but have actually increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we Christian Democrats, who have always defended the use of dialogue and reconciliation, wish to repeat our complete condemnation of the acts of violence and violations of human rights which are still being carried out and deplore the delay in the development of the peace process. However, above all, we wish to call on the parties in the conflict to abandon arms for good and respect the commitments contained in the agreement. Since words are not enough, however, and actions are required, we earnestly request that measures be adopted and means provided that will allow compliance with the agreement. In particular, the Security Council of the United Nations must decide to go ahead with the deployment of international peacekeeping forces. Also, the necessary funds must be provided so that the agreement may be put into effect; particularly – and this has already been mentioned – with regard to the promotion of development and education, of all those measures which will finally allow the population of Sierra Leone to come together and live in peace, freedom and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In July, a peace agreement was concluded between the government and the RUF rebels. This is laudable, if it were not for the fact that we are dealing with one of the world’s cruellest rebel groups, without a political goal other than gaining control over the diamond. One of the goals of the peace agreement is to provide general amnesty, for crimes against citizens as well. It offers the rebels various ministerial posts and also the important presidency of a committee authorised to exploit and export minerals. This is a worrying sign: a sign that terror works; that the mutilation and killing of citizens not only remains unpunished, but even pays; that any warlord could take up arms against a democratically elected government and be rewarded into the bargain. For the government, the peace agreement is a pragmatic solution. Indeed, President Kabbah does not have his own army. He completely relies on the West African peace-keeping force ECOMOG and on the Nigerians, in particular, but they have already announced that they wish to retreat from this bloody war. This means that the President now has his back against the wall. This is why the European Union must urge the UN to deploy the peace-keeping force quickly in order to end the terror. This is why more should be invested in the programme for the disarmament of rebels. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need to continue to advocate a form of justice on behalf of the thousands of victims of this terror movement. If not, a scenario similar to that in neighbouring Liberia is likely to present itself, where people choose a warlord for fear that he would otherwise take up arms again. This is, I think, totally unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After eight years of civil war, the road to peace seemed finally clear but the abhorrent brutalities, in particular those against women and children, carry on relentlessly. Child soldiers are abused on a large scale to pander to the malafide interests of adults. It is impossible to stabilise and reconstruct the country as long as citizens continue to be slaughtered. Europe should make a financial contribution to implement the DDR Programme. Diamond smuggling must be addressed efficiently. European support for rehabilitation programmes is also essential. Indeed, good mental and physical guidance of the victims is urgently required. It is also vitally important for enduring peace that the guilty parties are brought to justice rather than being appointed to ministers.

In our Finnish newspapers, we could read a week or two ago about an eighteen year-old girl who had been compulsorily recruited, had suffered an amputation and had been raped. She could see <span class="italic">no</span> future and <span class="italic">no</span> hope. For me, her story represents everything that is so horrific about the use of child soldiers and forces us to think about what we can do about this. We should also note that a third of the child soldiers who have been recruited in Sierra Leone are still mere girls. </p>
<p class="contents">We should demand – and I hope that the Commission also does so – that the President should respect the agreement once entered into with Unicef. This means that Unicef should be allowed to work in the country in order to rehabilitate children who have suffered psychological damage. I believe that Unicef is the organisation which has far and away the greatest experience of this work. I therefore believe that, in the future, we should in every way support precisely this organisation, for it is psychological damage above all that the children are suffering from and which makes many of them want to return to the military forces. It is this that is one of the most serious threats for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is very important that we make it clear that the horrific human rights violations such as those which we have seen and which we are seeing in Sierra Leone are a matter of concern to all Europeans because it is our understanding that human rights and human dignity are indivisible throughout the world and we will not tolerate a selective perception which results in our taking a closer interest in acts of violence in our own region than in the eruptions of violence which we have witnessed in Sierra Leone for several years now.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those who have said that there are few conflicts in the world which are as barbaric, as bloodthirsty and, unfortunately, as hopeless, as far a political solution is concerned, as this conflict in Sierra Leone.</p>
<p class="contents">The peace agreement concluded in July was welcomed at the time by the European Union. We called on all parties to help implement it and stated that we ourselves were prepared to do so. We could see that it would be very difficult and we could see that, in the final analysis, all the conditions for a working, stable, democratic rule of law in Sierra Leone would have to be created anew and that there was only limited willingness to cooperate. Like Parliament, we are therefore extremely worried about the latest violations of the ceasefire and we are concerned that the peace agreement is only being implemented slowly, if at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we must ask ourselves what we can do to help the tormented victims of this conflict. Merely stating that the situation is horrific does not help, which is why we are starting by offering concrete help with reintegration with the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1997, the Commission has been financing reconstruction of the social and economic infrastructure destroyed by the war through its rehabilitation programme. With the help of this programme, families settling there and former fighters are obtaining jobs and an income. We are currently working on a bigger programme to the tune of some EUR 20 million to support reconstruction and reintegration. This programme should replace the current programme, which expires in the middle of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Further help to resettle rural communities is being given in the form of agricultural resources and is being funded under the food security budget line.</p>
<p class="contents">ECHO will also provide further humanitarian aid. In 1999, non-governmental organisations and UN organisations received EUR 14 million for the benefit of the people who had suffered during the war. It included aid for Sierra Leone – refugees in neighbouring Liberia and Guinea and, as referred to here, help for NRO, which gives psychological and social support in the refugee camps, has initiated aid programmes for demobilised child soldiers and is addressing the particularly gruelling problem of mutilated children in order to give them some prospects in life. The lady Member just said that these children had no prospects. I do not think we should accept that so readily. I think that we should do everything we can to give these children a dignified life.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you that the scope of humanitarian aid in Sierra Leone does not depend on the funds available but on the security situation in the country itself.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the aid organisations are severely hampered in their work by the insecurity which prevails in the northern and eastern provinces of the country. Whether or not there is additional impetus in the disarmament process and hence an improvement in the security situation will depend this month on the arrival of the UNAMSL forces, the UN mission to Sierra Leone.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently preparing further help for the year 2000. We are, in fact, discussing further aid for the children affected by the war with UNICEF, the Ministry of Social Affairs and with various groups from civilian society. I should like to stress here that the Commission will always be prepared to examine proposals from these groups for action in the human rights sector. The Commission is also prepared to examine funding for the Truth and Reconciliation Committee being set up under its budget line for human rights and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
