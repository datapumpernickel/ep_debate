<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alojz Peterle, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">- </span><span class="italic">(SL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this report we are taking a stance on one of the most difficult problems of the European Union. The epidemic spread of cancer is making it the number one disease in the Union and one in three citizens of the Union will encounter it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that, at the beginning of this term of office, it is not necessary to call on the Commission and the Council to take basic steps in order to combat cancer because we have the Council’s clear conclusions of June 2008 and an ambitious project, the European Partnership for Action against Cancer, which the Commission presented in September 2009 and which forms the subject of this report. It is important to note that action is already underway. With this report we are supporting one of the most ambitious goals of the Commission, that we reduce the burden of cancer by 15% over a period of ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that the partnership was developed in accordance with our health strategy resolution ‘Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013’. In that resolution, we upheld the importance of health for all and of health in all policies and placed major emphasis on cancer prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an astonishing and worrying fact that, on average, Member States invest a mere 3% of their health budgets in cancer prevention. While it might appear to be a statistical error, this figure means that the health policies of Member States do not take prevention very seriously. What we really need is a paradigm shift towards more prevention in our strategic, technical, organisational and financial approaches. We know this and also we know, and it has been proven, that early detection of cancer can significantly reduce cancer mortality.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key word in the report is inequality, and several types of inequality at that. The most significant type is known as ‘the Iron Curtain between the East and the West’ in terms of major differences between the survival prospects of cancer patients, but we are also aware of significant differences within Member States themselves. Besides the differences in the success rates of treatments, we also have significant differences in the frequency, or scope, of early cancer detection, differences in palliative care and differences in the effectiveness of rehabilitation of cancer patients.</p>
<p class="contents">The Citizens of the European Union find it difficult to accept that there are such differences in the level of organisation of the fight against cancer given that some Member States have national programmes, while others do not. Differences exist in the acquisition of cancer data, too. Although even the Treaty of Lisbon only allows the European Union to take support measures, a coordinated and well-organised approach at this level is extremely important if we are to combat cancer effectively. The exchange of good practice would be unimaginable without encouragement from Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The third key word in the report is partnership. We will be able to get closer to the Commission’s ambitious goal only if we join forces both vertically and horizontally. The prerequisite for that is ensuring that the fight against cancer remains firmly on the political agenda of European and national institutions. A close relationship between doctor and patient is not enough. It is our task to contribute to a strong political partnership, to a political will, which will provide impetus for a faster momentum throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On this occasion, I would like to place particular emphasis on the issue of rehabilitation of cancer patients. We ought to pay a great deal more attention to people who have beaten cancer. They must not be stigmatised or written-off, but given the opportunity to reintegrate fully into social life and to continue their professional careers. A key element in the fight against cancer in Europe today is proximity to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who have helped in the drafting of this report for their considerable assistance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am grateful for the efforts that have been made in preparing this report, in particular by the rapporteur, Mr Peterle.</p>
<p class="contents">Strong action at European level can have an important knock-on effect at national, regional and local level. This underlines the potential of the European Partnership for Action against Cancer. The success of the Partnership largely depends on the active participation of its numerous and diverse partners. So far, Member States, health professionals, cancer institutions, NGOs, patient organisations and industry representatives have taken part in the preparation of concrete proposals for action to be carried out by the end of 2013. It remains to be seen, however, whether this new means of cooperation will result in more sustainable action to tackle cancer. I sincerely hope that it will.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad aim is to achieve more long-term goals and to make better use of available resources. This depends on the commitment of all partners and of course on adequate financial input. Parliament’s support for the necessary resources to be secured in the future Community budget for health will be crucial. The report refers to a range of actions for a comprehensive approach towards cancer prevention and control, many of which have already been taken into account in the development of the Partnership, based on the Commission’s communication.</p>
<p class="contents">The Partnership has five main pillars: health promotion and prevention, including promotion of the European Code against Cancer; screening and early diagnosis aiming at improved implementation of the Council recommendation on cancer screening; exchange of best practices in cancer care; cooperation and coordination in cancer research; and making available comparative information and data on cancer. A key task of the Partnership will be to help Member States improve the development and implementation of their cancer plans.</p>
<p class="contents">By the end of the Partnership, the objective is for all Member States to have integrated cancer plans. Some actions will build on the result of the good work done so far. Other actions will require additional help. The Commission stands ready to provide all the necessary support. In addition, the Commission will continue its close collaboration with the International Agency for Research on Cancer as regards its contribution to the Partnership. I should also mention the overarching objective of seeking to ensure better integration of health concerns into all our policy initiatives, which I shall take forward with relevant colleagues within the Commission. Of course we will continue our strong focus on prevention through our policies on health determinants as part of the fight against cancer. We will try to achieve the maximum possible with the limited resources available and I welcome vey much the strong support of the European Parliament for these efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to endorse the aims of the European partnership envisaged by the European Commission in order to combat cancer more effectively, whether it be in terms of the importance of prevention and early detection, the creation of a new cancer prevention model or, above all, a reduction in the inequalities within the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the concerns and anxieties expressed in the European Commission communication and in the draft report. I should like to commend the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Peterle, in drafting this report, and the compromise proposals tabled for the purposes of including the various amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I wished, among other things, to highlight the following issues: firstly, the increase in annual cancer-related deaths caused by exposure to carcinogens in the workplace, but also the importance of better access to information on medication for cancer patients; the implementation of the REACH Regulation and the regular updating of the list of substances of very high concern, which covers carcinogens; the support for initiatives seeking to prevent imports of goods containing cancer-producing chemicals and to intensify checks to detect such chemicals within the European Union; and, lastly, the drafting of guidelines for a common definition of disability covering persons suffering from chronic diseases or from cancer.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the issues that we wished to raise, while at the same time lending our support to this draft report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no need to repeat the figures; we all know what the public-health, social and economic costs for the Union will be if we do not address this issue consistently and make the appropriate resources available, especially in order to overcome the disparities between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The burden of cancer is a threat for the sustainability of our public health systems, and the EU should definitely take the lead in responding to it adequately. Whether we speak about prevention, diagnosis, treatment, research or information, of course we speak about partnership, but we will manage to combat effectively the burden of cancer in Europe only if we make sure that all stakeholders – and particularly patients’ groups – are involved in the long run, if we ensure an efficient exchange of good practices between Member States and if we guarantee that the functioning of such a partnership will be closely monitored and supported.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission will play its role and make sure the partnership delivers its objectives. I would like to stress one particular point: the call on the Commission to use the existing ECDC and to add non-communicable diseases to its mandate. I believe this could definitely strengthen the expertise and recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of timely and equal access to prevention, diagnosis and care should be closely looked at if we want to ensure that the fight against cancer also contributes to the objective that we should all keep in mind the reduction of health inequalities in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I look forward to seeing you tomorrow at Patients’ Rights Day, because this is extremely important for all patients’ groups, and your commitment matters to all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Another point about which we <span class="italic">can</span> do something is the large number of carcinogenic substances in the environment. We have toxins everywhere in our homes: just think of asbestos, kitchen utensils and even toxins in our food. The EU needs to protect its citizens from such toxins, whether or not that is to the detriment of industrial interests.

We now know that a person can be genetically disposed to developing cancer and that at least one enzyme is involved in triggering the disease. Stress, lifestyle, chemicals and viruses can also cause cancer. This year, almost two million European citizens are expected to die of this disease. Thus, cancer does not stop at national borders. I am therefore pleased that the Commission has taken the initiative to draw up an ambitious plan for action against cancer at European level. I have two questions. Where does the Commission stand with regard to research? Can the financial resources that have been allocated ensure effective research and what level of priority is it being given? The Commission points out that the screening volume is low in relation to the Council’s recommendation. Therefore my second question is how will the ambitious target be converted into real patients in our countries? Can we realistically double the effectiveness of our screening throughout Europe? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission’s involvement in the partnership created to promote action against cancer offers a new chance of life to those affected by this terrible disease and to their families. It is vital for us to continue to combine all our efforts to establish permanent cooperation in terms of both increasing specialist knowledge and devising solutions to the new challenges arising in such cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The European partnership for action against cancer must therefore ensure the proper use of the resources, skills, not to mention funds which are available to all Member States.

Almost 30% of cancers can be avoided and their consequences alleviated through early detection and treatment. Some types of cancer affect women and men differently. Every year in the European Union there are more than 275 000 women with breast cancer and it has been shown to be increasing, even among younger women. Every year, 50 000 European women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 25 000 die from this disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, cervical cancer can be practically eliminated by making vaccination and scanning programmes widely available. That is why it is urgent that all Member States extend their vaccination and scanning programmes to all women who are in the right age group to benefit from them. It is also necessary that they promote health-education campaigns, make the public aware of the importance of early diagnosis and inform people about the available programmes and services. I therefore welcome this initiative by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Research in this field has made progress in terms of reducing the costs for tests and of increasing the accuracy of cancer screening through the use of biomarkers. A recent invention, awarded a prize at the International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva, makes it possible to screen for certain types of cancer in less than six minutes at a cost of less than one euro.

I would like, however, to mention one other very important aspect of this disease: the families of patients who are losing the fight against cancer. The family should be a place of relief, support and encouragement for its members. However, it is enormously difficult to be faced with a progressive disease, and families must not be left alone in this predicament. Therefore, when we talk about the struggle against cancer, we must also think about the conditions for a dignified end. This should take the form both of systematic care and advice for families facing arduous long-term care in the home, as well as a system of accessible specialised facilities providing expert and above all humane care for patients in the final stages of this disease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must, of course, address the plague of cancer. Cancer is caused by many factors. I want to outline what I believe: that smoking, being overweight, low fruit and vegetable intake, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption are contributory factors. It is essential that health promotion strategies at European level and, indeed, at national level are strengthened and properly resourced. Early detection is vital, and we have seen when we have early detection that it is so important that many people are still alive who would not have been if not for early detection.</p>
<p class="contents">Through cancer research, the European Union can play a leading role: importantly, over EUR 750 million has been devoted to cancer research under the seventh Framework Programme, and I would hope that more funding could be made available over the coming years. In conclusion I want to pay tribute to all of those, particularly to those in my own country, who provide such exceptional care to cancer patients. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the EU, around 3.2 million people develop cancer each year. The main types of cancer are lung, bowel and breast cancer. Screening, particularly as we get older, also plays an important part in maintaining health. The principle that prevention is better than cure has proven to be true here.

<p class="contents">The European Union has an important role in relation to this: first of all, in providing money for research, and secondly in organising this research, and in particular, in encouraging cooperation between institutes who are carrying out this research.

I would like to thank Mr Peterle for the report he has drawn up, and I would also like to thank Mrs Morvai, who has just delivered her speech, for having shared with us the aspect of hope, and the positive aspects; all is not lost when one contracts this disease. Many points have been raised; many of the thoughts you expressed in Parliament were given consideration in the Commission’s communication, and I assure you that the suggestions you are putting forward today, and those you mentioned in the report, will be given very careful consideration in our programme of activities.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the environmental aspect, I can state that the environment is a truly important factor – indeed a determining one – in the struggle against cancer. However, one must also state that the high standards we currently enjoy in Europe are of great help in lowering the incidence of this disease. Therefore, we should increase our efforts to ensure that these high environmental standards are maintained. We must also keep stressing the importance of research. Now that the pharmaceutical industry is part of my portfolio and of my responsibilities as Commissioner, there is a much greater opportunity for working with the industry and possibly coordinating research in a better way, thus ensuring its efficacy.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the pillars which I would like to build my work upon in the coming five years is the widest possible accessibility to medicines available on the market; one of the biggest problems we have in Europe – it was mentioned here today as well – is the inequality in the health sector. This is something we must especially ensure: accessibility to medicines that come onto the market. I would like to thank you once again. By way of conclusion, may I reiterate that we must all work as hard as possible to convince people of the importance of prevention, for example, of the importance of screening for breast cancer which was repeatedly mentioned today. It is important that, since this facility exists in many, if not all, parts of Europe, we must strongly encourage all women to undergo this procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Due to the time constraint, I had no time earlier on to say a few words about a healthy lifestyle. I firmly believe that we politicians could play a major role here in leading by example and we need to promote a healthy lifestyle. As I myself have been diagnosed with a condition similar to that of Mrs Morvai, I would like to congratulate her even more warmly on her victory. I believe that in this way we are showing that cancer does not necessarily have to be synonymous with a death sentence.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Commissioner Dalli, in particular, for his attention and for announcing more rapid action, because cancer has its own dynamic and so we, too, need to act dynamically. I offer my services to the Commissioner for close cooperation in the future, too. I think that our cooperation so far has been exemplary and that together we can achieve a lot more.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that we will shortly be re-establishing the members’ group for the fight against cancer which was known under the acronym MAC (<span class="italic">Members Against Cancer</span>) during the previous term.

I fully support the approach of the rapporteur who places a special emphasis on the preventive action. In this perspective I strongly believe that comprehensive national cancer plans are more than welcome. I would also favour the cooperation on this topic in the field of research. We need to clearly identify the main causes generating this disease so that we can also identify the main elements on which we need to focus within our prevention efforts. This is absolutely necessary for an effective preventive action. I also believe that it would be reasonable to build our future action upon existing initiatives such as the European Code against Cancer or the Council Recommendations on screening for breast, cervical and colon cancer, which are already a good basis for action. Of course, prevention can’t be done without a proper level of financial resources. I therefore call on the Member states to allocate the necessary funds to the prevention plans so that the 15% target for the reduction of the number of new cases remains realistic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The onus must also pass to us as MEPs to use our access to the media and to our constituents to implore Europeans to avail themselves of these crucial checks.

The work carried out within networks should concern not only research and health, but also education, diet, communication and the environment. It should seek the participation and contribution of civil society, including in an effort to introduce people to healthy habits and healthy lifestyles.

Despite the many achievements of medicine, the spread of cancer in the world today is nevertheless very much on an epidemic scale. Every third European will be diagnosed with cancer in his or her lifetime, and every fourth European will die as a result of this disease. The Member States, and in particular their national strategy for preventing cancer, have an important role in stopping the spread of the disease. Since, in the fight against cancer, it will only be possible to achieve the results laid out in the strategy through long-term and consistent action, I call on all Member States in the present economic crisis not to cut financial resources for the fight against cancer and for the needs of both primary and secondary prevention. Parsimony today may lead to all kinds of expenses tomorrow. Preventative methods play a large role in the fight against cancer, as a third of cancer cases can be avoided with the help of preventative action. Another important matter concerning preventative action, in my opinion, is the raising of awareness in the area of gender-specific forms of cancer; we need to raise standards of prevention as well as to advance screening studies of these diseases. To finish my speech, I would like to welcome the Commission’s proposals to relaunch the European partnership initiative for adopting anti-cancer measures in the period 2009-2013, in order to support the anti-cancer action taken by the Member States. Only through collective effort can we achieve success in fighting an enemy like cancer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
