<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Elchlepp </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report draws our attention to a new, extremely promising, but unfortunately under‐utilised opportunity for Europe to export to and cooperate with third countries in the field of renewable energies, and also proposes a practical plan of action. It is a happy coincidence that, in this very area, Europe is in an ideal position to merge its interests in the export and labour markets with the interests of third countries in cost‐effective, suitably adapted energy supply systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that renewable energies are an essential part of a responsible energy and environmental policy which may yet achieve the climate protection objectives set out in Kyoto is, hopefully, well‐known. But forecasts show that, because of both financial and non‐financial considerations, wind power, solar energy, biomass and other energy sources in the renewable energies sector deserve to have much stronger support in the EU"s industrial and employment policy. That is why I expect the new German Presidency to set new trends in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in 1995, in the Commission"s White Paper ‘An energy policy for the European Union", a clear statement was made concerning renewable energies, also from the point of view of foreign economic policy, and in the 1997 White Paper ‘Energy for the future – renewable sources of energy", the one million solar roofs programme for photovoltaic systems was introduced, which would satisfy half the energy requirements in third countries, and at the same time provide an opportunity to promote exports for our domestic industries in Europe. Yet I ask myself: where are the actions? I ask the Commission: where are the implementation proposals? I ask the Council: where are the necessary funds, the majority of which must be provided by the Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Two things need to be done. Firstly, we need a long‐term European strategy to encourage exports in the renewable energies sector; this will include the entire export chain and will be trans‐sectoral in nature, and it will help in particular our small and medium‐sized enterprises to gain a foothold in world markets. Our SMEs often lack reliable information on overseas markets, which I was able to gain first‐hand knowledge of during a visit I made yesterday evening to such an enterprise in my own constituency which exports solar vessel systems to third countries. As is made clear in a report, out of 17 potentially relevant EU support programmes, there is not a single one that aims specifically to provide export support for renewable energies. Many of these programmes are unsuited to small and medium‐sized enterprises, as only large projects requiring at least EUR 1 million are being supported. The lack of market information and problems in finding business partners are further obstacles, as I have seen for myself.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to synchronise and significantly strengthen appropriate foreign trade activities in Europe, I am calling for a ‘European Export Council for Renewable Energies", which will in particular help SMEs through effective advice and facilitate their access to the world"s future markets. This Export Council could be funded jointly by the EU and by industrial associations in the renewables sector. It should first and foremost serve as a point of coordination, encourage the foundation of export cooperatives, link these up with strong partners in the target countries and support premarketing activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Haste is paramount. The competition in the USA and Japan never sleeps. In the USA there is already a ‘US Export Council for Renewable Energies", which has offices in the client countries of the future and also has generous funding. I will quote some figures to illustrate the importance of the sector as a whole. For the period 1990‐2010 the overall world market in renewable energies will be almost EUR 1 800 billion. The annual productive investment volume is estimated at EUR 86 billion. The photovoltaic sector, which is not even the biggest sector, is recording an annual market growth of 15 %. Even in the wind energy sector an average market growth of 26 % is being projected in emergent and developing countries for the period 1998‐2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Employment opportunities are also considerable. The Commission itself has talked of between 500 000 and 900 000 new jobs by the year 2010, and an equal number of jobs could be created by exports in this field. No other industrial sector, apart from telecommunications, has such a high growth rate in employment as, for example, wind energy; Denmark is an example here. The proposed export initiative can only have a chance if we in Europe help renewable energies along the road to success, as we create confidence in European technology among our world partners by using it ourselves and by creating a viable domestic market; we must therefore promote it considerably better than hitherto and in a completely targeted way.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Myller </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI) </span> Mr President, this is a very important issue which should be examined particularly from the point of view of how to create a demand for renewable energy sources. We live in a market economy, and commercial applications for which there is no demand are rarely developed. However, we in Europe are in a situation where there is natural demand. We have a situation of natural demand in the Member States of the European Union, but there is still more demand in the applicant countries. The European Union is to enlarge, and in those countries that are currently applying for membership of the European Union there are very great problems in the energy sector. They have obsolete industrial plants which are a serious risk to the environment, and outdated nuclear power plants which are also a risk to health and safety. Nuclear safety must improve in these countries to comply with international regulations, and defective nuclear power stations must be taken out of use. This has been said many times.</p>
<p class="contents">But what should replace them? In my opinion it is necessary to switch to renewable energy resources and power stations that exploit the highest possible technology. This will also be in the interests of the applicant countries in the European Union"s internal market, enabling them, in this very difficult situation, to acquire an immediate competitive edge over the present Member States. What it will mean for the present Member States is that we will be able to export the know‐how. But the problems themselves will obviously have to be solved in each country individually.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kyoto agreement as it is obliges us to find solutions. When, for example, the international funding institutions of the European Union support energy programmes in the applicant countries, special attention must be paid to making sure the money is spent on the best possible technology as well as renewable energy sources, in order to improve our chances of acting in accordance with international climate agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur raised the issue of employment very forcefully; it is just as important in the applicant countries as it is in the European Union. From the point of view of the applicant countries, if we underline the importance of decentralised production and renewable energy sources we can also do much to weaken the conflict that exists between environmental demands and questions of employment. This problem will diminish if new jobs are created from the production of energy.</p>

It is a report which will enable us to become directly involved in the spheres of activity of the European Union and to implement the measures it contains.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, as Mr Elchlepp has already stated, this can go some considerable way to helping third countries meet the environmental standards that were set jointly in Kyoto.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, however, it is an enormous opportunity to progress through positive economic cooperation within the various development scenarios and agreements and, through cooperative partnership, to not only export new technologies but develop them jointly with our partners in the developing countries, within the framework of joint ventures.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, these new technologies could help African countries to reduce their very costly consumption of fossil energy sources and to make significant progress, above all in rural development, not only in production of energy for electricity, lighting and hot water, but also for the energy needs of small and medium‐sized industries and craft industries.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, therefore, this is an excellent report which calls upon us to take action. I would also like to mention that the European Union should establish a means of channelling aid, just as the Americans have done. However, we are not in support of a system of aid which introduces export subsidies, such as those in the agricultural sector, for example, but we are in favour of one which covers quite a broad spectrum, as Mr Elchlepp has already partly indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">This should include, first of all, the provision of information. We need to inform our SMEs, who are leading players in this sector, about opportunities in the third world. At the same time, however, we need to inform third countries, especially the ACP countries, about these opportunities and, above all, about the opportunities in rural development, where, for example, cooperatives and producer groups could implement these uncomplicated technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this should include education and training in respect of the new markets which could arise for our enterprises. We already have the appropriate provisions and even the new budget items which make this possible. However, these are far too modest, and every year in the Committee on External Economic Relations we fight to get the Committee on Budgets to see the importance of these opportunities and to translate this importance into a few extra million. In comparison to the huge budgetary blocks, this is virtually nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this should include pilot projects to show the SMEs what is possible in the third world in the field of rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying something more about actual implementation. I am now talking, in my role as Vice‐President of the ACP‐EU Joint Assembly, about actual implementation for these countries. In Africa there is sun in abundance. We must take advantage of this and give our African friends the chance to use this energy correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must also make the necessary organisational decisions. I am glad that our rapporteur on the future of the Lomé Convention and chairman of the PPE Group, Wilfried Martens, is still here and is perhaps listening to my contribution. We first of all have the possibility of setting up an energy chapter within the framework of the new Convention and then, within this new energy chapter, of giving priority to renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must also inform the Centre for Industrial Development, which is provided for in the Lomé Convention, about this report and, in our next meeting with the ACP countries we must point out to this centre that here we have new opportunities for action which can be very quickly implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I would like to say that we must hold this discussion in the ACP‐EU Joint Assembly over the coming months in a very intensive, result‐oriented and targeted way.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ryynänen </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR). </span>‐ <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Elchlepp, has produced an excellent and very interesting report on this important issue. Renewable energy technology and its markets are a global issue, requiring EU resources for development. As the report points out, the new opportunities can help to solve problems caused by uncontrolled migration in developing countries, in rural areas, and elsewhere. I see a great opportunity in the development of renewable bio‐energy and wood energy technologies, and the logistics know‐how associated with this whole sector, in the development strategies for countries like these.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise the importance of something close to us in the Nordic countries, which people are not always sufficiently aware of in more southern parts of Europe, which is that the most important aspect of renewable energy is the biomass that comes from the natural forest, such as branches, crowns and small‐diameter trees in a thinned‐out forest. There could be a demand in other parts of the world for the export of know‐how and logistics associated with gathering these, especially in the EU partnership and applicant countries. We have already managed to develop the world"s highest levels of know‐how in the technology used in small combined heat and power plants. It has also been adopted on a very large scale, as, according to the latest statistics, bio‐fuels are the largest source of energy in Finland. Renewables can thus be used for combined heat and power production. Furthermore, in Central Europe the consumption of conventional fuels for fires and boilers could in this way be lessened or altogether replaced with renewable energy sources. Some of the know‐how already exists, as do more efficient boilers.</p>
<p class="contents">The common policy of the European Union calls for a particular focus on the most important issues, having, as we do, limited resources at our disposal. I would like to emphasise in this connection the importance of business in developing and exporting renewables technology. For that reason, the European Union must, as a priority, strive to support commercial exports, through marketing subsidies and investment aid, for example, in the less developed regions of the European Union. Furthermore, there should be more opportunities for companies in the partnership countries such as those in the TACIS and PHARE programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Because technology is still searching for new forms, instead of so much planning and guidance, the main focus should be on decentralised methods of progress, where all endeavours are encouraged and these forms of renewable energy become competitively priced compared to other energy sources. During the first stage, however, we will still need financial incentives.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Seppänen </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI) </span> Mr President, world energy production is predicted to grow at a rate of 1.6 % a year. That means that by the year 2020 the world"s energy production figure will have increased by 50 %. The developing world"s share in that figure will be substantial, and it will account for perhaps three‐quarters of the increase in oil consumption. The earth, however, will not tolerate this kind of democratised energy consumption if we go on the way we are.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy of energy consumption demands new thinking and new technology. It requires us to make room in our developed capitalist countries for energy consumption in other lands. Market mechanisms hamper the role of democracy in energy consumption. Prices of conventional forms of energy at the moment are too low compared to those of the new technologies, and for that reason we have to create incentives for their introduction.</p>
<p class="contents">We have common resources in the world and the rapporteur, Mr Elchlepp, quite rightly points out that the partnership countries and the developing countries are in an important position from the point of view of the future of energy consumption and its technological development. It is also very important to stress the importance of solar and biomass energy. Neither the goal of doubling the consumption of renewable energy by the year 2010 nor the Kyoto agreement will be implemented unless room is made for the new technologies in the production of energy.</p>

We have neglected this sector for far too long. For far too long we have relied on energy sources that cost the earth and cannot be disposed of, such as nuclear power, for example. This report gives us the opportunity to place our future hopes in new energy sources, in tandem with the countries in the south and with the new countries in the east. This is also a special challenge for the German Presidency, which is held by Joschka Fischer. We will need money, which we must take away from other energy sources, to effect this volte‐face. Despite the fact that new oil reserves are still being discovered, word should have got around by now that this substance is finite. That is why we must follow this new path out of our responsibility towards future generations.</p>

<p class="contents">In order to maintain this position, it is vital that the European institutions demonstrate their political and financial support for this important industrial sector. It is a sector that is capable of making job creation compatible with the protection of the environment. A true Community policy for renewable energies and SMEs in this sector, coupled with an increase in the specific budget for such forms of energy and in appropriations for exports would make a valuable contribution to job creation, the European Union"s main preoccupation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is estimated that close to one million direct and indirect jobs could be created between now and the year 2010 if the use of renewable energy were to double. These jobs would also be compatible with the protection of the environment because the use and promotion of these forms of energy avoids the use of fossil fuels, thereby preventing emissions of CO<span class="sub">2</span> into the atmosphere. This is a particularly interesting point when we take account of the fact that, with this reduction in environmental pollution, we would also be fulfilling the commitments made at the Kyoto Conference on Climate Change.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, a third of the world"s population, mainly in third world countries, do not have any electricity supply. The use of renewable energies would therefore offer a rapid and effective way of resolving this problem without harming the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for all these reasons that we welcome the idea of creating a regulatory European Export Council for Renewable Energies. It would provide the Union with a coordinating body to work on a true European strategy for the entire export chain. In this way, it would contribute to job creation, to the protection of the environment and to the development of third world countries.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van Dam </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, exporting renewable energy is in the interests of a sustainable economy, and there is therefore every reason to encourage it. I congratulate Mr Elchlepp on the inventive way he has tried to find ways of doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still a few hurdles to overcome before exports can really get under way. According to the rapporteur, the long‐term export outlook for renewable energy is good, but as yet there is no prospect of it happening. Up to now, European firms have been less than eager to export technology.</p>
<p class="contents">The market share held by renewable energy also needs to increase dramatically, and European firms must use the lead that they have gained in this field to promote exports. Renewable energy cuts down pollution and prevents natural resources from being exhausted, so there is every reason to try to promote it. Our current biased economic system which charges too little for fossil fuel energy is not geared towards this, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Money therefore needs to be provided to get exports under way, and the rapporteur has a number of ideas here. He calls for extra funding for an active European export council for the product, and for renewable energy projects to be included in our development policy. I think this alternative way of spending development funding is an excellent idea. I would suggest that the funding should firstly benefit the developing countries, such as by implementing the proposals on ‘debt for solar swaps". The developing countries should be rewarded by having their debts reduced if they use sustainable energy.</p>

<p class="contents">Faced with the reluctance of world leaders to adopt direct measures, especially the greatest polluter of all – the USA – which emits a quarter of the world"s total pollution, the Union is the only hope and the only possible avenue for effective action. The White Paper and the positions of the European Parliament, as expressed in this report, provide a very good framework for stepping up efforts for the further development of technology, mainly through assistance for small and medium‐sized enterprises and through the transfer of this technical know‐how, so that the huge energy requirements can be met by renewable sources. It is frightening to think that even today there are two billion people on our planet who live without electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">Renewable energy is certainly an important future market, because its potential is unlimited compared with the limited and low‐entropy energy sources in the earth's crust. In any event, the European Union must cooperate closely with developing countries in the context of the new Lomé Convention, to promote viable forms of development and to settle their debts – as proposed in the report – in exchange for coverage of their energy needs from renewable sources.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be clearly understood that mineral energy reserves are becoming exhausted, while solar and wind energy ensure a continuous and unlimited flow and their use involves no pollution at all. In my own country, Greece, we have both those types of energy in abundance.</p>
<p class="contents">In Buenos Aires, the world"s powers assured us that they will be adopting measures in the coming century to implement the Kyoto decisions, but in the few months before the end of the millennium, ecosystems – which cannot of course await the outcome of negotiations – will have sustained further serious damage. That is why the Union must act at once and incorporate fully into its trade policy, external economic relations and the framework for enlargement the promotion of renewable energy sources as a principal means of securing viable development, protection of the environment and enhancement of the Union's competitiveness and the creation of new jobs.</p>

Many thanks.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to broaden the subject somewhat to include an area which lies particularly close to my heart. We have a massive market for renewable energies on our very doorstep, that is, in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. I should like to cite as examples the countries which I frequently visit: Hungary, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Lithuania. In all these regions there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done. In this regard, Mr Elchlepp, I should like to add one point to your excellent report. The people in these countries do not yet know enough about renewable energies. They must be informed and the governments must be informed, because we are dealing here in with certain large commercial concerns which have no interest whatsoever in the use of renewable energies and will therefore do everything they possibly can to stifle it. I should therefore like to ask you to ensure that both the people of these countries, and their governments, who also do not know enough, are informed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, two points are of particular relevance. It must not be forgotten that under the Russian regime many dreadful sins were committed against the environment, but now in these countries the environment is being severely damaged by lignite. The massive utilisation of lignite, which I see especially in Hungary, for example, in the region of Obosar, must be replaced by energy sources which have no such harmful impact on the environment. This is a task which it behoves us to carry out because we can achieve so much in this field. We can and should give these countries a great deal, because in these countries we can start from scratch and carve out the correct path.</p>

In Finland we use renewables mainly in the form of wood, in its various forms, and peat, which has a substantial share of the market. The volume of peat that grows in marshlands is approximately equal to the volume of wood that grows in the forests. When they form, wood and peat absorb carbon dioxide, so burning them does not upset the earth"s carbon dioxide balance as with fossil fuel. Harvesting and preparing the wood and the peat requires work. Peat and wood consumption, therefore, at the same time promotes employment. Promoting the consumption of wood and peat is also sensible because energy can be produced as a cottage industry using very simple methods. On the other hand, mass production requires highly developed technology. The EU and our country too leads the world in the large‐scale exploitation of renewables, and this will also mean great opportunities for exporters.</p>

<p class="contents">As a result of the improvement of social and environmental living conditions, especially in third world countries and in Eastern Europe, and the finite nature of fossil resources, together with the lessons learned from the dangers inherent in atomic energy, it is necessary to take urgent support and cooperation measures in the renewable energy sector. That is why we recognise that an important basis has been established in this report. We have put in place five new budget items for third world countries. This report could be the starting point for us to move forward in this area. Expansion of production capacity in third world countries must be supported, for example by means of the European Development Fund. Just as important are education and training, support for small and medium‐sized enterprises, the one million solar roofs programme, ‘debt for solar swaps" and also what was said by Mr von Habsburg.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the PHARE programme offers an important basis, not for supporting nuclear power plants in the East, but for supporting the renewable energy sector. Within the framework of the Lomé Convention, we need not only an energy chapter but, as Mr Schwaiger said, determined action on the part of the Commission to implement the necessary measures. In my opinion the Commission must set up a special unit to promote marketing and cooperation here, to support the NGO projects in third world countries and, through the PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes, to support projects in the Mediterranean region and in Eastern Europe. As we do not have responsibility for the budget in the European Development Fund, demands must be made of governments and so the impetus must come from the Commission. They must make use of our joint potential with these countries to help the people and to maintain the basis for our lives and our existence. Otherwise we would not be able to survive because we would not have the energy sources.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to be able to address Parliament on the issues raised in this very timely report and to respond to the proposal for a resolution. For a few moments at least, this will be an opportunity for me to return to a former role I had several years ago as Commissioner for energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report and its explanatory statement are a valuable contribution to the current work on promoting renewable energy and will help us to understand better what opportunities such energy forms offer. In a very clear and detailed manner, the report sets out the possible different courses of action that must be considered if our ambitious goals are to become an achievable reality. Therefore, I should like to begin by expressing my sincerest thanks to Mr Elchlepp for this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union"s strategy, contained in the November 1997 White Paper on renewable energy sources, has already received the support of both Parliament and the Council. Its main objective is to increase renewable energy sources in the Union and thereby enable us to create the internal base and platform needed to increase exports to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In the work leading up to the adoption of the White Paper at the end of 1997, the Commission tried to take Parliament"s contribution into account, as expressed in its resolutions on the White Paper itself and on access for renewable energy to the electricity market as well as the Altener II programme, which was adopted in 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper reflects the views expressed by Parliament in 1997 on the main renewable energy issues that would be useful when drawing up a Community policy in this field. It also reflects the wide range of reactions and requests of industry, specialists, interest groups and the people in general throughout the Union who would be affected by such a policy. One essential aspect of our common priorities is, of course, the export market for renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on from this, I will briefly tell you about the progress made in the first year since the White Paper was adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Work on the necessary advance studies of the current programmes and efforts being made concerning renewable energies has almost been completed in the Member States and in the Community. I should like to pass on the Commission"s satisfaction with the progress made. It is pleased with the diversity of action plans and national programmes on developing renewable energies that have been drawn up since the adoption of the White Paper. It is clear that much of the work we are asking Member States to complete over the next decade has already been planned, or at least initiated.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is still a great deal to be done and there is no reason for us to be complacent, especially if we take into account the commitments made in Kyoto, as the report rightly points out. I am pleased, however, that the majority of Member States have already announced policies and national plans which, generally speaking, have a similar scope and objective to the proposals for Community strategies and action plans. This will make applying these strategies and action plans much simpler. The public debate that took place at the Energy Council of November 1998 confirmed their importance. The Commission will draw up a detailed study as soon as possible that will serve as a starting point for subsequent planning and coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">The key action plans must be applied within the Union but it is clear that the actual experience of promoting exports is valuable. We will also increase our credibility through successful marketing in third countries. The amount of effort all this will require in terms of planning and presentation is also clear and the Commission fully shares Parliament"s desire for close cooperation between the industry and the public sector, both at Union level and within each of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with Parliament"s wishes, renewable energies are, and increasingly will be, promoted in European assistance programmes such as PHARE, TACIS, MEDA, the European Development Fund and other Lomé Convention instruments. All the relevant cooperation agreements will therefore be revised, as will other agreements with both industrialised and developing third countries. This will encourage our partners to follow this same line, yet without forgetting each of their priorities and specific restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">As the proposal for a resolution suggests, a pro‐active approach for exports and cooperation in the field of renewable energies will be promoted, particularly through EU programmes related to energy, such as the SYNERGY programme. We will also encourage the elements of the fifth framework programme on research relating to scientific and technological cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Many activities have been set in motion under the Thermie programme. In the five years that this programme has been running, more than 190 programmes have been set up by the European industry. These have been cofinanced by the Community with more than EUR 20 million. There have also been measures aimed at countries outside the European Union. These include projects aimed at determining and assessing export markets for EU technologies and at designing and applying the best strategies to encourage the use of new technologies in the markets selected in this way. Aid for exporters of renewable energy sources from the EU will continue to be seen as a priority, particularly in terms of credit guarantees, insurance, organising the necessary contracts, disseminating information and setting up networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Another priority is cooperation on energy planning and integrated resource planning, particularly with emerging economies on energy policy. The reasons for this are highlighted in the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">An additional aspect that the Commission believes to be extremely important is that of access to innovative financial instruments that are specifically adapted to the needs of the renewable energies market. The Commission will continue to cooperate with financial institutions such as the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Global Environment Fund. I could give a number of examples of such cooperation, which currently extends beyond the European Union, such as the World Solar Programme 1996‐2005, which aims to carry out high priority regional and national projects worldwide, particularly in developing countries. And in relation to this, I should like to point out that the White Paper stressed the need to make special efforts regarding the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. Initiatives for promoting solar electricity and for encouraging diversification to alternative renewable energy sources have been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the associated countries, one of our priorities is to encourage them to bring their legislation on renewable energies into line with European legislation. Other priorities are to extend EU programmes such as Altener to include these countries, and to involve them in activities under the fifth framework programme on research.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of this morning"s speakers asked if any organisation had been established at European level with similar responsibilities to the United States Export Council on Renewable Energies, which receives federal funding. On these lines, I should like to inform you that back in 1996, Commissioner Papoutsis opened the European Export Council on Renewable Energies in Brussels in the presence of various senior officials from the Commission and other organisations. The Council is currently composed of five European associations for renewable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, I have briefly tried to explain what we are doing, and what we have in the pipeline in relation to the content of the report and resolution in question. The European Parliament has once again shown itself to be most constructive in its initiatives for promoting renewable energies. I can assure you that the European Commission also believes that the export market for renewable energy sources constitutes one of our main priorities for the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish my speech by once again thanking the rapporteur, Mr Elchlepp, and all the Members who participated in this debate.</p>

Intensive use of these new technologies would therefore give the developing countries a more realistic chance of reducing their energy bills while increasing the amount of energy supplied to their populations, particularly in the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">The increased use of these cheap and clean technologies also provides an opportunity for industrialised countries in that it may lead to the creation of new jobs in high value added sectors together with access to new and immense markets in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p class="contents">As an aside, I must point out, as the rapporteur did, that greater use of these technologies within the EU would allow us to achieve our self‐imposed objectives on climate protection. It would also increase our independence in the energy sector and have a positive influence on our energy balance.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, I support the proposal to set up a European Export Council for Renewable Energies whose responsibilities would include encouraging and structuring the activities of SMEs in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that the European approach must be transverse and that, within the context of international cooperation and our partnership agreements, we must encourage our representatives to give strategic priority to renewable energy when planning their energy, environmental and development policies. This must occur in such a way so as to ensure that their natural interest in guaranteeing development at the lowest possible cost matches our search for external markets.</p>
