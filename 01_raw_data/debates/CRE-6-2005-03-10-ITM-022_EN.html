<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kallas,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-president of the Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the situation in Tibet remains high on the political and human rights agenda of the European Union's relations with China. The EU is concerned about the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people, and more particularly about the restrictive conditions imposed by the central authorities on the exercise of religious freedom in the Tibet Autonomous Region.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, some Tibetan monks were sentenced, allegedly for possessing portraits of the Dalai Lama. We heard that some were detained and beaten. We are also still waiting, in spite of continuous requests, for information on the whereabouts of the Dalai Lama’s choice of the eleventh Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seized every opportunity regularly to raise these concerns with our Chinese interlocutors. We have done so at the highest political level, for example at the seventh bilateral summit held in the Hague on 8 December 2004, as we have done regularly within the framework of the ongoing bilateral dialogue on human rights. During the last session of this dialogue, held in Luxembourg on 24/25 February 2005, the issue was again extensively addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also brought to the attention of the Chinese authorities the situation of Tibetan individuals, together with individuals from all over China, who have been sentenced for freely expressing their opinion or belief. The case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche has become emblematic. We fully share the view that the European Parliament expressed in January in a resolution on Tibet and we will continue urging the Chinese authorities to release this monk at the earliest possible date.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that a solution compatible with Chinese sovereignty and respect for the Tibetan population will be found soon. In our view, to reach this ultimate goal, there is no alternative to a peaceful process based on dialogue. We have called for years, and will continue to call, for such a dialogue. We, therefore, fully support the consultations that have taken place over the past years between Beijing and the representatives of the Dalai Lama. We welcome the fact that the two Special Envoys of the Dalai Lama were able to visit China last September for the third time since the resumption of contacts in September 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">We met - as we often have in the past - Kelsang Gyaltsen, one of the two Dalai Lama’s Special Envoys, on his return from China, and we felt encouraged by his positive assessment of the visit. We understand that progress has been made to narrow the gap between the existing respective positions. We hope that those developments will encourage the start of a meaningful and direct dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama, which will lead to the recognition of genuine autonomy for the Tibetan region. We firmly believe that only such direct dialogue can be conducive to a lasting solution of the Tibetan issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the opening of a direct dialogue should not be subject to any precondition. On the other hand, the respective parties should refrain from taking any steps that would compromise the establishment of a climate of confidence, which appears indispensable if a solution is to be reached. In all circumstances, we would condemn violence from any quarter as a solution to the problem of Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would certainly be prepared to become more involved in finding a solution if it were the wish of the parties most concerned. We will, no doubt, continue to pay the greatest attention to the situation in Tibet and to press for conditions that allow the Tibetans to fully exercise their basic political, religious and cultural rights and permit the cultural identity of Tibet to be preserved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Forty-six years ago today, in Lhasa, Chinese troops crushed the Tibetans’ peaceful protests against the armed occupation of their country, killing 87 000 of them, and arresting thousands of others. To date, over a million Tibetans have died as a result of hunger, torture and execution, and over three-quarters of their shrines, temples and monasteries have been systematically destroyed. While 10 March is a day of mourning, it is also a day of resistance to enforced silence, to the violation of human rights, to the suppression of cultural, religious and human identity. Today, as every year, Tibetan flags are being hoisted all around the world, in 2 000 cities and municipalities in the European Union, over 650 of them in Germany – my own country – alone. The day after tomorrow, in Berlin, we will be joining thousands of campaigners for human rights, including an increasing number of young people and political office-holders, remembering the victims before the Brandenburg Gate. This House has adopted significant resolutions that have given the Tibetans courage, among them the outstanding Romeva Report on arms exports, in which the Council was urged to maintain the embargo on the sale of armaments to China – an appeal backed up by our joint resolution on the Geneva Human Rights Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The day after tomorrow, the 3 000 delegates to the Chinese People’s Congress will be assembling in Beijing. They will be adopting an anti-secession law, intended to back up a possible military strike against Taiwan. To endorse such a confrontation, even if only indirectly, is a fatal and irreparable error, as we, Commissioner, have pointed out time and time again, calling at the same time for the continuation of dialogue between representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities. It is not enough to announce, immediately before important state visits, that talks are in progress, only for them, again and again, to prove fruitless. In his message on the occasion of the anniversary of the popular uprising, His Holiness the Dalai Lama declares his determination to find a solution that both takes account of Chinese interests and enables the Tibetan people to live in peace, freedom and dignity. Our Parliament’s Tibet Intergroup, composed of representatives from all the political families, will continue to campaign for human rights campaigners, NGOs, members of other national parliaments to be heard in this House again and again. In terms of our solidarity with the Tibetan people and their justified claims, there is no more appropriate day than today, 10 March. And so, to those of us who join in showing our colours in cities, towns and parliaments, ‘Tashi delek’ – good fortune. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is only thanks to this communication that we can help our Chinese friends in their transition towards an open society and one more respectful of human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">This two-way communication must also be the cornerstone of our discussions on Tibet. The recent case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche gave us the opportunity to appeal to the Chinese Government to improve the conditions of prisoners. If China wishes to play a wider global role, it must comply with international standards on imprisonment, including in Tibet. In particular, everyone is entitled to a fair and equitable trial, internationally recognised as such. For this reason, we are delighted whenever prisoners of conscience are freed in Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents">We again ask them to abolish the death penalty. The European Union has managed to eradicate capital punishment from its territory. This was a great victory for humanity, and we hope China will follow in these footsteps.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like to see an ongoing improvement in the human rights situation in Tibet. We invite China to ratify the UN International Pact on Civil and Political Rights. Everyone must be able to express his or her political opinions freely and without the threat of imprisonment.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union/China inter-parliamentary delegation was able to travel to Tibet two years ago. The visit taught us a great deal. We looked at European programmes and were able to grasp the importance of our relations with China and with the autonomous province of Tibet. Tibet needs electricity, running water and hospitals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like the European Union to share its experience in terms of minority rights. We could share best practice on the rights of minorities to maintain their heritage and traditions, something which is sorely needed when we see the disfigured state of Lhasa.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would encourage China to maintain a dialogue with representatives of the Dalai Lama. This dialogue must be undertaken with a view to finding a mutually acceptable solution to the question of Tibet as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has also been aiming to strengthen its position at the expense of other countries and peoples. I can provide abundant evidence of this. Allow me to recall the annexation of part of Kashmir by China, the war in the Himalayas between China and India and China’s attack on Vietnam in 1979.</p>
<p class="contents">The most appalling and shameful action of this type happened earlier and has already been mentioned in the House. I refer to the subjugation of Tibet. Very few events of this kind have taken place over the last 50 years, and they have never gone unpunished. Conquests of this sort have not been allowed to continue. I could remind the House of the case of East Timor or of the cases of Kuwait and Iraq with which we are so very familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">Things turned out differently where China and Tibet are concerned. It is a case of more than mere conquest, as China has taken over every aspect of Tibetan life by force. Large numbers of Chinese settlements have been set up in Tibet, and they are of course controlled by the central government. Tibetans cannot find work in their own country, as all new jobs are reserved for the Chinese. The national identity of Tibet is being destroyed, and its great historical legacy eroded.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, such a course of action meant that Tibet’s great religion was first in the line of fire. This is evident from the treatment meted out to the Dalai Lama, and also from the disappearance of the second most important religious representative, the Panchen Lama, whose fate remains unknown. In addition, wholesale indoctrination of Buddhist monks and nuns has taken place. The brainwashing process always concludes in the same way. Individuals are forced to choose between signing a statement breaking with the Dalai Lama or not returning to their religious communities. The outcome has been that some 12 000 Buddhist monks and nuns have been expelled from their communities. As the House will be well aware, even possession of an image of the Dalai Lama is a punishable offence. The intention is to erase him from the collective memory of the Tibetan people.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all alarmingly reminiscent of the steps taken in Russia, when Bukharin, Trotsky and others were airbrushed out of photographs. As to the position that this is an internal Chinese matter and we should not become involved, it brings to mind the arguments adduced by a person being tried for murdering his parents, who pleads with the court for a lenient sentence on the grounds that he is an orphan.</p>

<p class="contents">You mentioned, Commissioner, that the Commission will get involved as and when both parties approach you. For that, I fear, we will have a very, very long time to wait, for it is not exactly in China’s interest that Tibet and the suppression of its culture be publicly debated and exposed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for us in this European Parliament – and also for all European delegations that travel to China – to spell out the fact that it is Tibet that will – and must – determine whether there is to be more cooperation between Europe and China, both in terms of improved trading relations and of whether or not embargos are to be lifted. Let the Chinese Government be aware that the latest attacks on Tibetan religion are counter-productive in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has been quite rightly pointed out, the Tibetans are being denied their most basic political and democratic rights. What, moreover, we see, and have seen for a long time, is an all but systematic destruction of their cultural heritage and of their ability to practise their religion. The example given by the Commissioner, namely of monks being imprisoned for having portraits of the Dalai Lama, is just one example of how absurd this oppression is. As is well known, the EU has expressed this view on quite a number of occasions. The question is: is this enough? It would be interesting to hear more about plans for the future. How is the pressure on China to be increased where the issue of Tibet is concerned?</p>
<p class="contents">China is now an economic and political giant which is increasingly also becoming a global player. There must, however, be no beating about the bush where China is concerned. The positive economic development is in no way matched by correspondingly positive democratic development. We see nothing of that at present. On the contrary, the fact is that China’s economic progress is partly based upon its systematically denying its own workers their most basic rights. Policy on China is therefore a test of the EU’s credibility on human rights issues. Economic interests vie with support for Tibetans’ and other Chinese people’s political and democratic rights. That test is one that the EU must pass. It would therefore be quite absurd to do what is now proposed, namely to lift the arms embargo on China. That would be to give two different signals at the same time. There would be oral criticism, but a simultaneous demonstration in practical terms that another type of relationship with China was desired, with little real importance attached to the oppression practised by that country. The EU must adopt a more consistent attitude. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also pleased that the European Commission is dealing with it, and I should like to thank the Commissioner for his statement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear that I cannot accept some of the content of the Commissioner’s statement. As I understood Mr Onyszkiewicz’s speech, he cannot accept it either. The Commissioner seemed to indicate that this was an internal Chinese matter. I beg to differ. This is not an internal Chinese matter, and we are all aware that China violates human rights on its own territory. As Mr Onyszkiewicz said, this is a matter of a nation conquered by China, and I fully agree with him.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you ventured to suggest that a solution compatible with Chinese sovereignty and respect for the rights of the Tibetan people should be sought. That is a tall order, as there are no limits to the aspirations of the Chinese leadership. We can only go as far as agreeing to what the Dalai Lama is prepared to consent to, namely that China could represent Tibet in the international arena.</p>
<p class="contents">Tibet must run its own internal affairs. There can be no question of autonomy. It therefore seems to me that calling for a climate of mutual trust is not the right approach. What is needed is a change in the Chinese attitude. The people of Tibet have shown quite clearly that they are acting appropriately and building a climate of trust. The fact that they have agreed for China to represent them abroad is ample proof of the trust they deserve. It has to be said that trust is an unfortunate term to use in connection with a conquered and humiliated nation.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we need to understand that in conquering Tibet, China identified religion with cultural and national issues. The Tibetan people are being persecuted on all three counts, and this persecution must be stopped. Thank you, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to thank you particularly for allowing me to take the floor. I had intended to do so on behalf of the Non-attached Members, but I differ from my colleagues in that I wish to thank Commissioner Kallas very much for his statement.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the European Commission needs to find its own way of dealing with Tibet. The Commission’s way is likely to be effective but less dramatic than ours. I believe the Commission has presented such a policy today and demonstrated the political will to see it through, and I wished to thank the Commissioner for that. As I see it, the Dalai Lama’s latest statement, in which he refers to respecting the territorial integrity of China, is very significant. Another important development is political in nature. I refer to the Chinese leadership’s undertaking to engage in the dialogue the Commissioner mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that even the so-called ‘step-by-step’ policy is effective. I am convinced that with the support of the House and acting also on its behalf, the Commission will be able to ensure that all the problems previous speakers rightly pointed out are resolved. Essentially, the Members who spoke before me were presenting a snapshot of reality. I very much hope that any future snapshot will be entirely different. It is my earnest desire that the problems referred to today will have faded into oblivion in a couple of years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my gratitude to the Commission for this statement. I am often critical of the European Commission, but on this occasion I believe it has taken a step in the right direction. Finally, I should like to thank the President again for enabling me to speak pursuant to an earlier agreement. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The PPE-DE Group supports the middle-way approach for increased Tibetan autonomy or self-government within a united China that is respectful of cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is exactly what the Dalai Lama has reiterated today to be his approach and that of the Tibetan people. I quote his words of today: 'I want once again to reassure the Chinese authorities that as long as I am responsible for the affairs of Tibet, we remain fully committed to the middle-way approach of not seeking independence for Tibet and are willing to remain within the People's Republic of China.' I acknowledge that His Excellency Mr Guan Chengyua, the Chinese Ambassador to the EU, stated this morning at the China delegation meeting, in response to a question, that the door is open for the Dalai Lama, especially if he abandons any secessionist activities and recognises that China is whole and indivisible.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears to me that the Dalai Lama, and indeed His Excellency the Chinese Ambassador, are singing from the same hymn sheet on this and I would urge them to make progress. The Dalai Lama accepts the middle way as the only way forward. He has made that very clear and reiterated it today. It is also the view of my own group, which passionately supports that way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">China has made great economic progress in recent decades and it is now a major player on the world stage, which delights us all. We see the potential and the enormous contribution that China and the Chinese people can make worldwide. There still is, as Commissioner Kallas said earlier, a problem in certain areas of human rights. We should be able to sit down and make progress in these areas. In China, with a population of 1½ billion, the scale of the problem is different, but China has made enormous progress on the economic side. I believe, with the good will and support of all concerned, China can make the same progress on human rights issues and we want to encourage it to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">Tibet, however, is an international treasure and international treasures are not the preserve of any one people. We want to help the Chinese to preserve Tibet, which has a unique cultural, religious and linguistic heritage. I say to the Chinese authorities: please preserve it, through the middle way approach, through supporting the autonomous region of Tibet, so that we can all continue to enjoy the heritage of this absolute jewel on the world stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that this offers us a good opportunity to point out that it is not the Tibetan Government and the Dalai Lama who now have to make a move in favour of Sino-Tibetan dialogue and a lasting and fair solution for the people of Tibet — they have already done so — but rather the Chinese Government in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework of growing relations with the European Union, I believe that it is important to send a clear message to China that it must respond favourably to the progress in this dialogue and it is therefore very worrying that the possibility of lifting the arms embargo on China is also mentioned. I believe that this is a serious mistake and that it would not just send an inappropriate message about the European Union's double standards when assessing human rights in the world, but also about our institutional inconsistency, since we should remember that the European Parliament recently adopted a resolution that expressed quite the opposite point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore insist that to lift the arms embargo on China today, before the situation in Tibet is resolved, would clearly send the wrong message. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having at the time been on the rapporteur’s staff, I still remember the counter-arguments to the effect that independence for the Baltic states would never be possible, that this was utopian fantasy, that the Balts possessed no right to self-determination, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that there are, today, Members and Commissioners from the Baltic states sitting in this House should encourage us not to be deterred from our course where Tibet is concerned. Tibet is – as has been said here today many times – not only in essence a human rights problem, but much more than that. There are those who talk of it being a minorities issue, but to do so is to misread the facts. Tibet is not a minority problem; the problem is that it is a country that has been overrun by colonisers. China is a colonial power – no more and no less. If the Chinese want to go on living together with the Tibetans – a possibility to which the Dalai Lama has referred – then it is they who must take the first and crucial step and gain the trust of the Tibetan people – something they can do only by acknowledging and defending their right of self-determination, their own culture and religion and their rights as human beings. It is only through partnership that integration is possible. Suppression integrates nobody; it results in disintegration.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it makes such an impact that so many former human rights activists – Milan Horáček, who is sitting here, his former fellow-campaigner Václav Havel, many of our Polish Members – are so strong in their support for Tibet, for it is a clear sign that Europe’s freedom and Tibet’s are, in the long run, inseparable one from another, and that freedom is indivisible.</p>
<p class="contents">So my thanks go to Mr Thomas Mann and to all the others in our group with primary responsibility for Tibet, for having joined with Members from other groups in securing for us this debate on a current issue before we move on to matters of urgent importance. The only thing I have to say to the Chinese leadership is that we, in the European Parliament, will not give up until this symbol of a free Tibet that we have set up here can indeed shine forth in freedom, and until the Tibetans can follow their own democratically chosen path.</p>

<p class="contents">We in Europe have to be concerned at the situation in Tibet, and I am pleased to say that the Commission is keeping this issue high on its agenda. What can be done? The Commission is in favour of genuine autonomy and the preservation of cultural, religious and national identity. We have received some positive signs that the process is going in the right direction. We have had consultations with representatives of the Dalai Lama and know that there have been consultations between his representatives and the Chinese authorities. We hope that possible solutions will follow.</p>
<p class="contents">In history, large-scale, comprehensive and unanimous peaceful pressure from the free world has brought impressive results. I am convinced that the European Parliament and the European Commission will again prove powerful driving forces for such pressure.</p>

Last week a family with five special needs children had their children taken from them. That family’s case had been reported in the national media, exposing the lack of services for their own children and children in general. In Ireland the services are very patchy and in places very poor, and some families have been told that if they need help the State might take their children from them. I have had at least six families come to me about this.</p>
