<p class="contents">What is this about? A subsidiary of the Alstom group, whose creative, research and production resources are established in Europe – 250 employees in France, in Vélizy, 300 in Germany, in Stuttgart, and a number of plants in the Czech Republic, Portugal and Poland – but whose headquarters are in the United States, in Connecticut. This company’s expertise is in the manufacture of boilers for generating steam and electricity. It is the world leader in the production of clean coal and is developing new technologies for CO2 capture. With the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and the need to diversify energy sources, it is clear that such technologies have huge potential. However, for reasons that are unclear, the management of Alstom has decided to transfer the European expertise to the United States, to reduce the workforce in Vélizy by four fifths and to halve that in Stuttgart, probably with the aim of eventually closing the main European sites. The pretext for this siphoning-off of European expertise was a pseudo-study carried out – what a surprise – by the Americans, announcing that the market was expected to shrink by a third over the next four years.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the example of the employees of Power Boiler, we cannot take this study seriously, especially when we know the enormous demand in this field that is emerging throughout the world. As they say in my country, though, when you want to kill your dog, you accuse it of having rabies. A lack of a real long-term industrial strategy, a frantic scramble for immediate profits, those have been the main characteristics of the Alstom Group since it was privatised. The Commission, and also the French Government, must also take some of the responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the employees at the European sites affected, supported by their trade unions, have not thrown in the towel. The employees in Vélizy, in particular, have come up with a counterplan based around withdrawing the company from the Alstom group for a sales price in the region of one symbolic euro, creating a European public limited-liability company grouping together the Vélizy and Stuttgart sites and retaining the plants in the Czech Republic, Poland and Portugal. This plan is based on the voluntary participation of the employees. It has the advantage of fitting in with the demands of 7 July 2004 drawn up by the European Commission with regard to Alstom on the subject of the disposal of assets, the aim being to safeguard and increase employment and European technological potential compared to the United States. This cooperation between European employees is at the forefront of the application of European law, as it will result in the creation of a European public limited-liability company. We must work fast, though, as the company’s intellectual property is on the way to being transferred to the United States and Switzerland and Alstom’s general management is working to put the company in financial difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">If, ladies and gentlemen, we are committed to the growth of industry and employment, we must do all we can to support this initiative. It is true that the directive on European public limited-liability companies and the regulation on the involvement of employees in corporate governance have not yet been transposed into French law, but it is always possible to look ahead. It is a question of political will and I expect the Commission to show this will. So, let us not disappoint these workers, whose jobs are threatened but who are so proud of their unparalleled technical achievements and are always ready to innovate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, like my fellow Member, Mr Henin, I am one of the authors of this question to the Commission. A few weeks ago, we received here a delegation of employees of the Alstom group made up of representatives of both French and German trade unions from the two sites of this subsidiary that specialises in boilers. These workers are now affected by the announcement made by their management on 16 February 2005, of the closure of the company or, at any rate, of major cuts in jobs and activities, both in Stuttgart and in Vélizy: 150 jobs out of 350 will be lost in Stuttgart, and 150 out of 200 in Vélizy. This means that, in the end, these two sites will probably be doomed.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago, on 7 July 2004, the European Commission approved aid granted by France to Alstom subject to strict disvestment conditions but with the aim, not only of re-establishing sound competition conditions, but also of safeguarding the long-term future of the Alstom industry and of its various subsidiaries. The subsidiary Alstom Power Boiler, as has already been mentioned, is a company that specialises in the construction of power station boilers. It is a technological leader in Europe, and in the world, in a number of fields, particularly in difficult and clean combustion and CO2 capture.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the European Union’s priorities in terms of the Lisbon strategy, which we have debated recently and which will serve to ensure that Europe develops its competences and its technology and becomes the most competitive economy in the world, and also from the point of view of our objectives with regard to sustainable development and clean energy, this company is a strategic tool, and the fact is that, obviously, many jobs depend on it.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what justified the agreement given by the Commission in July 2004 to a considerable quantity of aid: EUR 3 billion granted by France to the Alstom group to help with its restructuring. In its final decision, the Commission stated that, with regard to the Power Generation and Transport sectors, the restructuring plan was adequate to ensure industrial recovery. It considered the planned job cuts to be proportional to the level of over-capacity in these industries, and felt that the estimates of the costs of this restructuring and of the saving that would result seemed realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, though, the group’s management is going beyond the job cuts announced at that time, and is going beyond the disvestments to which it committed itself. Consequently, I think that the European Commission needs to take an interest in the decisions that have just been taken by the management of the Alstom group. Indeed, as the Commission is always very scrupulous with regard to compliance with the competition rules after aid has been granted, it must be equally scrupulous with regard to the consequences for employment. After all, unless I have misunderstood, Commissioner, it seems to me that the ultimate justification for granting aid for the restructuring of a business is to keep this activity going, particularly and ultimately because it makes it possible to save jobs, because it generates a multitude of benefits, tax revenue, etc., but above all because it makes it possible to save jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot be hemiplegic – it cannot, having granted aid, only look at the effects on competition and respect for competition. It must also ensure that this aid actually does contribute to maintaining activities and employment on all sites, insofar as it was indeed decided, when this aid was approved in July 2004, that the planned job cuts were adequate and that it is therefore not justified to go beyond that. We are therefore now counting on the Commission to ensure that jobs are safeguarded and that the two sites in question are not closed down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that Mr Désir’s speech set out the real problem. I said to former Commissioner Monti years ago that the day would come when the Competition Directorate-General’s main task would be not so much to refuse aid as to see whether that aid was properly used.</p>
<p class="contents">What authorises a country to award State aid in apparent violation of Article 87 of the Treaty? It is the fact that Europe considers it to be in its interest because, if this aid were refused, jobs would be lost that could not be replaced. A source of expertise, and of work in the interests of the EU’s objectives, of its citizens and of its consumers would disappear.</p>
<p class="contents">In their great wisdom, the Competition DG and the Commission granted this aid to Alstom a year ago. It was not a case of bowing to pressure from the French Government. It was a case of expressing an opinion on the fact that, in the condition in which Alstom was proposing to continue, yes, it was worthwhile for a state to grant it aid. It was good for the whole of Europe. Well, if this assessment was right a year ago, it is right today. However, Alstom is in the process of proving that, when it asked for this State aid, it was not trying at all to maintain the supply of clean technologies in Europe, it was not trying to contribute to the objective of full employment in Europe. It was simply trying to obtain State aid according to the principle of the privatisation of profit and the nationalisation of loss. This is something that neither the left nor the right in Europe can accept.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we have here a key example on which the Commission should base its policy. If the fairly extensive list of authorisations for granting State aid – there are a dozen cases in Article 87, which is also retained in the Constitution – really forms the basis, so to speak, of industrial policy in Europe, this is the time to prove it. The Commission must say whether the aid granted a year ago simply served to bail out the Alstom group’s shareholders or whether it really served the interests of the people of Europe, their future, and in particular compliance with the Kyoto Protocol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This issue can – and indeed must – be considered from two angles, first in terms of industrial policy and secondly in relation to the monitoring of state aid. Being myself responsible for industrial policy, I feel myself on very safe ground when I say that it is in Europe’s political interests not only to maintain, but also to extend, innovative technologies, modern enterprises and modern jobs in Europe. It is of the utmost importance to the European Union that we should retain in Europe a strong industrial base, without which we will not be able to maintain our competitiveness in global markets. It is with this in mind that I tell you, in my capacity as the Commissioner with responsibility for industry in Europe, that I am very much concerned that Alstom should successfully complete the restructuring it has started and continue to exist as a healthy, successful and profitable business. So much for the industrial policy aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, though, it is not industrial policy that we are talking about. What is at issue is the monitoring of state aid. It is indeed the case that the aid by the French state could not have been granted had not the Commission approved Alstom’s restructuring plan. The Commission did so and imposed conditions on both the plan and the aid. The honourable Members are quite right to say that it is the Commission’s task to ensure that those conditions are complied with and that the aid is used for the purpose for which the Commission approved it, and we are checking to see that this has been the case. In particular, the Commission stated at the time that approval of the aid was conditional on certain areas of the business being disposed of and on operational restructuring being carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">The question to be answered this evening is whether or not the present supplementary restructuring plan runs counter to the Commission’s decision. If this restructuring plan is not in breach of the conditions, then it is the company’s management, rather than the Commission, that is responsible for implementing it; Alstom is not run by the Commission, but by its own management. Although I have been informed by the departments responsible that the Commission has not, so far, had any indications that the conditions it imposed on the granting of aid have been breached, I can assure you that we will, of course, continue to monitor the situation and will be paying very close attention to see that the conditions are complied with to the letter.</p>
<p class="contents">As a matter of principle, the Commission is committed to seeking, in partnership, solutions that take account of all economic, social and environmental considerations. In its latest communication, ‘Restructuring and Employment’, it explicitly envisaged the mobilisation of all social forces to better accompany restructuring, with the aim of bringing about sustainable development of competition and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Commission proposes the organisation of reinforced sectoral and regional follow-up, with special funds being made available to support the implementation of this strategy. Retaining and improving Europe’s capacity for innovation, research and development is also of strategic importance. Only a few days ago, the Commission presented a framework programme on research and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware that our options are very limited indeed where job losses are concerned, and I share your sentiments in this regard, but the Commission must adhere strictly to the law as it stands. I have given you an undertaking that we will examine this case with great care and will take action if it should emerge that the conditions attached to this aid have not been met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the future of Alstom’s 25 000 employees in France that is at issue. We have had to fight hard and our government has put itself firmly on the side of the Alstom employees. It was our Minister for Finance, Mr Sarkozy, who negotiated with the Commissioner at the time, Mr Monti, so that we could grant the aid that saved Alstom. It was of course a question of safeguarding the future of the employees, but also of saving a jewel in the European energy and transport industry.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening, we are talking about Vélizy and Stuttgart, but also about Brno in the Czech Republic and Setúbal in Portugal, and large numbers of subcontractors throughout Europe. Today, the announcement that 350 jobs will be lost, including 200 in Vélizy at Alstom Power Boiler, increases the worry for the employees still further. It is true that the weakening in the market for boilers is clear, but it is not at a level that would justify such job losses.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not down to the Commission, of course, to dictate the management of companies or to manage, on behalf of governments, social assistance for any redundancies. It is worth pointing out that Alstom Power Boiler is a leader in the field of the production of clean coal and is developing technologies for the capture of carbon dioxide. We are therefore not talking about a company condemned by ossification and obsolescence. Acceptance of its migration across the Atlantic or, even worse, its disappearance, is like looking at the future through a rear-view mirror.</p>
<p class="contents">The employees – and we must congratulate them for this – have developed a plan based around the concept ‘let us create the European champion in clean combustion’. They have, with the help of experts, developed a plan for the future covering all aspects: the legal structure of the new company, technological aspects, commercial aspects, social aspects. We must welcome this approach, which represents a refusal to cave in. It has been brought to the attention of the European partners: the Commissioners responsible for employment and social affairs, enterprise and industry, trade, competition, and environment, who are awaiting your conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, today you must look ahead to the cultural and social revolution set in motion by the draft constitutional treaty. In future, social rights, with the constitutional treaty, will prevail over the perfection of the internal market which had the upper hand in previous treaties. Social dialogue will be institutionalised, but above all we must formulate an industrial policy that favours skills centres and will safeguard the social market economy proposed to us as a social model in Article 3 of the constitutional treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The question being put to you today, Commissioner, is this: how do you see the future philosophy of the constitutional treaty? Do not be the clerk of the old Europe, but instead put in place the new Europe, the one intended by the constitutional treaty. You have a good opportunity to do so, by safeguarding the future of Alstom Power Boiler. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
