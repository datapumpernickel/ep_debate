<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langenhagen (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, we are latecomers; time is running away from us and, above all, from the GALILEO project. The longer the European Union hesitates in getting the European satellite navigation system underway, the more both industry and the people will react to it with apathy. The ultimate danger is that GALILEO will one day be buried. My anxieties increase when I recall some of the statements made to me over the years when I worked on the European satellite navigation project.</p>
<p class="contents">The position Parliament has taken with regard to the Commission's communication does not, admittedly, possess any legislative character, but points in an important direction. I hope that it will be by a large majority that Parliament will adopt my report tomorrow and thus support the position that Europe urgently needs a satellite navigation system of its own, not least in view of the special situation in which Europe and the rest of the world find themselves since 11 September. The Council also holds this fundamental view, as again confirmed by the final conclusions from Stockholm.</p>
<p class="contents">How, though, may we clear away the doubts that surface again and again, even in the amendments before us? The fundamental issue is now as it was before: why do we need a European satellite navigation system of our own, when the Americans have already supplied a working model in the form of GPS?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me quote some of the main arguments. The first is that the American system is conceived on military lines, with resultant disadvantages as regards continuity of availability, precision, and also legal certainty. What concerns us here is reliability, which must be guaranteed even in a crisis. It must be clear to all of us that Europe's sovereignty and security would be gravely imperilled if the navigation systems were to be taken out of European control. We quite evidently need our own civilian system which, however, must be available to all – and I emphasise all – potential users. I regret therefore that I am unable to support the amendments newly reintroduced by the GUE/NGL Group, which demand a purely civilian use.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: we are pressing for free competition not only within the EU, but also worldwide. It can, then, be only a cause for amazement if we readily accept a monopoly from a foreign State and expose our users to the risk of provision being less than optimal. We must commit ourselves to the best interests of our citizens and users.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: if the European Union were to do without its own system, it would fall back massively in the high technology sector. That can surely not be the intention. On the contrary, we want to see Europe at the top, and for that we need GALILEO.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly: GALILEO creates employment in Europe. The jobs created are for the highly qualified and in a sector with a future, namely high technology. The building-up of the infrastructure and the many potential applications could create up to 100 000 jobs in the next few years and result in high earnings in the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, then, is GALILEO vital for Europe? In my report, I have described at length the advantages and positive aspects for the various fields of application. These advantages become all the more convincing if we succeed in involving other countries in the project. For example, China expressed interest only recently, at the Brussels Summit. Europe is capable of developing its own system. We are not going to keep GALILEO, like a confection, for our own enjoyment, but will offer it to those of our partners who are willing to have it, and we will let those partners share in the great benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">As we want to offer the best service possible, we set great store on compatibility with other systems from the outset. Industry is showing an interest, as demonstrated by the EUR 200 million pledged to the Commission as a statement of intent, but we must not make excessive demands on Europe's industry. The wheels of industry will not start rolling without a clear and definite political signal, a green light given by us. The preparatory work done by the Commission and the European Space Agency deserves high praise. Now, though, I await expectantly the Commission's financial and administrative framework, as called for in the report. This framework will be a further building block and a weight-bearing pillar for developing our own satellite navigation system.</p>
<p class="contents">GALILEO is a Community project – incidentally, the first in this field, which makes it a vision for the future! Let us now, then, get to grips with it, instead of putting it off forever and a day, for GALILEO will revolutionise transport and mobility, just as the Internet has done. Success stories – of which we in Europe can already claim a few – require careful thought, courage and decisiveness. Let us make good use of this historic moment when we vote tomorrow! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the current stage, GALILEO does not comply with the statement on financial programming, which was adopted by the three institutions on 20 July 2000. According to this statement, ‘the budgetary authority must have accurate<span class="bold"> </span>information about the financial consequences of each new proposal presented by the Commission, in order to be able to assess the impact of the proposal on the ceilings of the financial perspective (…)’.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, at a meeting of EU transport ministers in April 2001, it became clear that the Union had major problems finding the extra EUR 1.5 billion required from private sources for the deployment phase (2006-2007) of GALILEO.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Commission states that when it issued a call for an expression of interest in order to establish the conditions needed in order to set up a public-private partnership, several European industrial consortia responded to this, without reference to any further problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear that I support the Commission’s approach in principle. Nevertheless, I would warn that GALILEO may have a much bigger impact on the general budget than initially expected.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that the budgetary authority should have a clear picture of GALILEO’s source of funding before it can commit appropriations to the project. The identification of the sources and amounts of private funding should be concurrent with the identification of public funding. Financing needs should be met by 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, Parliament should demand prior consultation of the budgetary authority in the event that the expenditure to be financed from the general budget is to be revised. This would ensure that no restrictions are placed on other activities financed under heading 3 if GALILEO does not attract the investments foreseen by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">However, following my approach, in a situation of crisis, the European Union would have the possibility to use the satellite navigation services provided by GALILEO without having to rely on other (primarily military) satellite systems operated by the United States and Russia such as GPS and GLONASS, although it would still be compatible with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this Council meeting, great emphasis was placed on the need to launch this satellite navigation programme immediately. Our Committee acknowledges the benefits of such a programme, the main feature of which is that it is European as well as civilian in nature, and is therefore independent of systems developed by the military, such as the American GPS and Russian GLONASS systems, and that is reliable and has greater precision than these two existing systems.</p>
<p class="contents">We are proposing, however, that the following points be implemented during the development and validation phase from 2001 to 2005, the deployment phase from 2006 to 2007, and the operation phase, which begins in 2008, essentially under the aegis of the European Space Agency and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we must accurately monitor the funding, initially estimated to be in the region of EUR three billion, as well as the partners chosen, particularly private industries, and their involvement. We must also carry out an in-depth analysis of the cost-effectiveness and the implications for the economy and employment. We are demanding the greatest level of transparency in this matter and to receive regular information from Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we stress the fact that the structures established during the development of the programme should be used solely for civilian purposes, and we point out that it is vital, in this case, to develop the use of space for purposes related to the general interest and public service.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the GALILEO programme must not be applied in such a way that will jeopardise the right to or the protection of privacy and it must not under any circumstances be used for the surveillance of citizens. It must, in particular, be developed in order to protect and safeguard the environment, to protect the lives of citizens and natural resources, and ensure early detection and even prevention of natural or man-made disasters. It must also contribute to progress in European research, when drawing up the future Sixth Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we are proposing – and this is important – to set up an advisory ethics committee, whose task would be to ensure respect for the aforementioned requirements and which would assist the Commission and the European Space Agency in their decision-making duties. I want to emphasise – and I call on Mrs De Palacio to give us her point of view – the fact that it will be civilian organisations that set up the system. Of course, we cannot say that, ‘we will not vote in favour of GALILEO if it is used by the military in the future’, because, when we set up transport and communication systems, for instance, anyone can use them. What matters is that Europe is independent and that it is not dependent on the USSR or the US.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that these various provisions are realistic conditions, which must accompany and justify GALILEO, and we would also hope to hear Mrs De Palacio’s point of view on setting up the ethics committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that there were at least three major production centres, the USA, Europe and Asia, was extremely good for business all round.</p>
<p class="contents">Airbus is another good example of what can be achieved by exposure to international competition, if we are not simply content for other people to make a good product that we can buy or even use free of charge like the GPS. It will be no different with what we are discussing today – the GALILEO satellite navigation system. Of course it is no bad thing that GPS exists. Of course it is no bad thing, it may even be a good thing, that in many cases it is available to users free of charge. But that there is, to all intents and purposes, only an American system is not good at all. The Russian GLONASS is probably not entirely in the same category. We Europeans have no real rights of access. The examples there have been in the past have shown that we are suddenly bereft of navigation in one case or another.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost more important and quite central from my point of view as a university teacher is that we have no real involvement in technological innovation if we are not engaged in development ourselves, if we do not carry out research ourselves and if we do not ourselves take research to the applications stage so that it can also go into industrial production. We need both, we need access and we need technological development. We cannot talk about a society of knowledge and learning without taking the next logical step. Above all, too, we also need the many potential applications in transport. I believe that requires no further explanation. Admittedly there are also problems when it comes to GALILEO. The problems of finance have still not really been resolved. Industry is still biding its time, waiting for public funding, while the public authorities in turn plead Maastricht criteria, empty pockets and the like. Hopefully there will sooner or later be a genuine public and private partnership in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">A last word on the tricky subject of double use or only civilian use. I cannot understand the naivety of many of the tabled amendments. There is not only good in the world. The events of 11 September were a cruel demonstration of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally a word of thanks and appreciation to the two ladies who have made such a big contribution to this evening’s report, the rapporteur Brigitte Langenhagen and the Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio. Neither of them lost their bearings in dealing with this topic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that the same will happen tomorrow when the House votes on the report, since this is a particularly important, even historic text for the European Union. The European Union is a major power. Europe is a major player in the aviation and space industries, but the European Union does not have aviation and space power, since it has never had a policy in this area until now and, as Mrs Langenhagen said, GALILEO is a historic beginning for us, our first Community programme. The GALILEO programme is all the more important because it guarantees that the high technology and the activity of our industries will be maintained in the future, since 150 000 jobs will be created.</p>
<p class="contents">GALILEO represents the political independence of the European Union, since, as you are aware, we had no frequency access during the Kosovo war due to the American GPS system, and as things stand at the moment, we cannot count on the American system being completely reliable in the coming years. I therefore believe that it is crucial that we consider the success of GALILEO as vital in ensuring the EU’s credibility over the next few years in an area where competition in the aviation and space industries is increasingly marked, particularly when faced with new competition, for instance from China or Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned about how this operation is funded, about the delays in its implementation and that it has been postponed on numerous occasions. Let us be clear about one thing – in the space industry, as in all the other transport industries, nothing can be achieved without State funding and without a boost from the government, whether this is direct State funding or so-called co-funding, along the lines of the American model, where the military sector funds the civilian. We must be aware of this situation. With regard to infrastructure, it is very difficult to find private sector investment, therefore we must be prepared, the Commission is not only responsible for this, Member States are responsible as well. The Council must certainly be made aware of this. This is why the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not want to increase the number of obstacles. We shall not vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left or the amendment by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party on the funding method, whereby the GALILEO programme must be halted if private sector investment is not sufficient. This is because we believe GALILEO is a crucial programme for the future of the European Union and for the future of European space policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been a long haul, with obstacles and unruliness along the way, and the end is certainly not yet in sight. However, we are taking an important decision tomorrow, which will bring us one step closer to our goal. International developments underline the importance of having a system of our own, but at the same time, of establishing sound international cooperation, so that interoperability of the system can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention three other points which the ELDR Group considers important. First of all, the management structure. To the ELDR Group, it is important that the management is transparent, and we are already glad of a major step forward by the Council, namely the proposal to set up a single administrative structure in agreement with Article 171 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I should like to raise is the financial concern. We are still not entirely convinced that that is going in the right direction. We accept that at the beginning, public money must be invested, but industry must contribute too. There must be a balance. There is still no binding agreement with the private sector and there is still uncertainty in that area. That is why we have tabled an amendment for which I should ask your support, so that the European Union does not become a safety net. And given the high cost, we expect a contribution towards the cost of the use.</p>
<p class="contents">Improved geographical access and reliability must be factors in favour of which industry must choose and in which they must display willingness to invest. That is exactly what makes the system first-rate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A report has been drawn up. That too took up a lot of time. However, a whole host of arguments are being put forward, with which – let there be no mistake – I entirely disagree. The wrong arguments are being used in order to sell a project.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with the technology. Some people claim that superior technology is being used here. That is absolutely not the case. GPS is a similar system. Our system is slightly better because it uses ground stations. As a result, it is slightly more reliable and communication is possible. But the subsequent generations of GPS II – did you think the Americans were mad? – and GPS III are just as capable. No problem whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">If we consider the levels concerned, the first level is an open access system, which is free. It is similar to GPS with matching criteria: same height, same accuracy in terms of horizontality, etc. The subsequent systems CAS I and CAS II are commercial and intended for the government, while the latter system is also used for military purposes. To quote another point on which people appear to be misinformed: it is also possible for CAS II to be switched off at regional level if it is used for military purposes. You may not have been aware of this, but that is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all: GALILEO is not more accurate, and it cannot be switched off. In summary, all those technological features which have been listed, also for transport, are also very much part of the current system.</p>
<p class="contents">Where military use is concerned, we are agreed that we do not want this in any event. I will not enter into the detail of the arguments, but at this moment in time, in the light of 11 September, I do not find it necessary to highlight the need of such a system once again. It is somewhat inappropriate, in my opinion. It is clear that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has agreed to the wording for civil use, and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has not. It will be interesting to see what tomorrow brings when the amendments are tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the funding, the Council has launched an enquiry. It appears that there are actually no business partners. One and a half billion must be coughed up. Two hundred million is being freed up indirectly and it is suggested that that funding is now available. The problem in this connection is that it is the same people who have freed up tens of billions for UMTS. When I listen to Mrs Langenhagen’s opening words, I have a feeling that GALILEO will be laid to rest in the not too distant future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Up until now we have had the similar Russian and American systems, but these were designed and developed and are also operated from a military perspective. The American system does in fact hold the real danger that in times when the USA is using it for military purposes the Europeans and all civilian users will be switched off, as actually happened during the Gulf war!</p>
<p class="contents">The GALILEO project is now being presented as a civilian project that will make the European Union independent from the USA in an important field of technology. In my group, too, opinions on the GALILEO project differ widely. But we are united on one point: we want it to be used for purely civilian purposes. We have tabled amendments that are designed to ensure its exclusively civilian use. Mr Rack, I am neither naïve nor do I believe there are only good people in the world. But if we do not do this, we will have the same problem as with the American system, namely that when it is being used by the military it will be switched off for civilians. You are not solving the problem you are claiming to want to solve.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I also have concerns about finance. A total of EUR 1 730 000 000 of European taxpayers’ money is to be spent on development, validation and construction. Industry wants to join in the construction phase, contributing EUR 1.5 billion, but so far only EUR 200 million have been committed. That is 13%. From a business point of view, no company could afford to develop something with such a poor equity position. I think it an impertinence that you want to pay for this out of public funds!</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is another aspect to this GALILEO project. The Americans allow the GPS to be used free of charge. You want future users to pay for the European system. Where do you think that will land you with your much-vaunted competition? Competition works like this: if I am being asked to pay for something that I can get free somewhere else, I am not going to pay, and you won’t get any users. Then you will have thrown all that taxpayers’ money away! Mrs Langenhagen, you described this so beautifully as a confection, and Mr Savary used the word historic! This historic confection will cost a total of EUR 3.2 billion. I think that is much too expensive for the present time and at this stage! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Queiró (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the development of a European satellite radio navigation programme raises various questions that warrant our consideration. This is a project of global scale, that uses cutting-edge technology and involves vast amounts of public and private financial resources. The strategic importance of political decisions which must be taken for the project to a large extent explain the hesitation that the Council has shown, despite the commitment and enthusiasm that both the Commission and the European Parliament have demonstrated in their statements and in the documents they have drafted.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the problem is not insignificant. First of all, because a project of this scale requires close international cooperation. This cooperation is fundamental, not only because of the future installation in various parts of the world of control centres and communication equipment to support the around thirty satellites that will also have to be sent into space, but also because the success of a project of this nature clearly depends on its interoperability with other, existing systems: the North American GPS and, to a lesser extent, the Russian GLONASS.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore makes no sense to base the argument and the need for a system such as GALILEO on a vague feeling of suspicion in Europe and amongst Europeans towards the United States due to the situation of near total monopoly that that country currently enjoys. And which could cause it unilaterally and for no plausible reason, in other words irresponsibly, to stop data transmission via satellite, or to introduce unacceptable levels of signal degradation affecting the accuracy of this data for civilian users. The GPS system and the radio navigation by satellite that this allows have been used successfully by the whole world, particularly in Europe. It should be added that reception of GPS signals has been completely free to users and any member of the public can access the necessary sectors at an affordable price.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons that the European Union must use in its definition ‘Development, installation and use’ of a system of this type are, of course, quite different. They chiefly concern the boost that GALILEO would give to the European high-tech industry and providers of related services, thereby introducing an element of healthy economic competition in this sector of activity, which is crucial to its development. This system would also provide enormous assistance to the development of European technological potential and to improving the associated academic and applied research. We must also emphasise the invaluable contribution that a project of this scale would make to the creation of new jobs – more than one hundred thousand – and we are talking about highly qualified posts. And, lastly, the installation and use of the system would enable the development of a public or private partnership of enormous strategic value to support sectors as important as transport (maritime, air or terrestrial), air traffic management, search and rescue, meteorology, mobile telephony and so many others. It is for all of these reasons, which I have briefly summarised, that we give our support to the GALILEO project, in the hope of thereby contributing to the construction of a genuine Europe of the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is understandable, based on her line of thinking. However, I, coming from a critical stance, can see major drawbacks to this project.</p>
<p class="contents">The calculated costs of this project are more than considerable, especially now that the contribution of the private sector is not clearly marked and secured at all. Despite the fact that, according to the Commission, only 150 km of high-speed link can be built for the funding initially required, any amount is too high if it does not yield clear advantages. In this case, the advantages should mainly be in the field of reliability and price.</p>
<p class="contents">As things stand at the moment, it is very likely that GALILEO will become a facsimile of the existing system, at least in terms of functionalities. Despite the civil line of approach, the system will also boast a military component in time. I have no doubts about that.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings to an end the advantage which GALILEO would have compared to existing systems, namely to be independent from military use and more reliable as a result. What remains is a situation in which we obtain the same services at higher costs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the most important aspect to us is that the system could play an unwelcome role in the relations between the European Union and the United States of America. Especially in a military context, it has appeared more than once that the European Union produces little without the United States. Not only does stirring up trouble in the relationship with the United States not make any sense, it is also very dangerous. That is why I am in favour of accepting the existing offer and not deluding potential users with illusions. For it is very much the question whether the use of satellite signals will be better and more efficient than it is at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">So, having congratulated the rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, I should like to make a point of repeating the view that, at every stage in the design, implementation or application of the system, the political decisions will need to be discussed and taken at European Union level and at that level only, although the role of the candidate countries will, of course, also need to be determined. It is equally obvious that international collaboration with the United States and Russia is essential, not just in order to reduce the huge costs but also because the question of frequencies can be regulated so as to guarantee reliability by ensuring that enough frequencies are available for GALILEO to provide a broad range of services.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we need more information on the organisation, administration and funding of the implementing agency, with integrated, realistic proposals, mainly as regards private investment. At least, from the information available to date, there appears to be no particular drive to attract private investment, given that we have not yet clarified if the system will provide services in return for a fee, which it will need to do if there is to be private investment, or free of charge, so that it can compete with GPS, which provides its services free of charge.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, is there any chance of Member States being called upon to pay large sums of money from their national budgets so that the initial appropriations are not lost? I think the Commission should give a prompt response here. Similarly, we must push ahead and resolve outstanding issues, by which I mean technical issues, such as incorporating EGNOS and the corresponding financial analysis and lawyers, both at Community and national level so that we can make any deliberate interference in or distortion of the system a crime and set up an authority to decide when to impose sanctions. We trust that, one way or the other, GALILEO will progress more quickly now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am taking the floor today because I feel we need technical systems that offer environmental benefits. Technical progress is ever more rapid. Personal computers and mobile telephones have drastically altered our working lives and our everyday life. We have also seen how technology is changing all the time and creating new aids and how companies are forever developing new products to be used within different areas of society.</p>
<p class="contents">A European satellite navigation system can, in fact, mean major opportunities for developing the transport sector, especially when it comes to combined transport, dovetailing different types of transport. For aviation and shipping, too, as well as for transport by road and rail, the new technology can be used to make transport more efficient and environmentally friendly.</p>
<p class="contents">I do agree with the rapporteur that GALILEO will enable Europe to be involved in developing a new technology-based industry and to be in the vanguard of this. There is a space industry in various parts of Europe today, for example in northernmost Sweden, and I think it important that we should use existing infrastructure to keep down the future costs of this project.</p>
<p class="contents">Major technical breakthroughs have more often than not taken place following development using research supported by the public sector, often with a view to the research’s being used for military purposes. The money and resources needed for developing completely new technologies often do not exist in private companies. This particularly applies to the GALILEO project which is based upon joint financing by the EU countries but to which the private sector too has to contribute.</p>
<p class="contents">What is unique about GALILEO, unlike the GPS system, is that it is being developed for civil rather than military purposes. I consider this to be an absolute prerequisite for the European Parliament’s supporting the project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to insist on the importance of this proposal which is intended to establish a single management structure for the programme at the beginning of 2002. Given that the timetable is so tight, it is essential that Parliament can issue its opinion on this proposal before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the conclusions of the Transport Council of last April, we have implemented a study of the services which GALILEO may offer, the income it may generate and the methods for collecting it. This study must be finished in the coming weeks so that the Transport Council in December may take the decisions necessary for the programme to move ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we will send the results of this study to this House and I hope that those of you who have expressed more reservations about the programme will find that it provides better explanation and greater confidence and that we will therefore have greater support – I know that it is supported by the majority of this House, but also that some of you have expressed significant reticence, if not opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">As the motion for a resolution clearly states, international cooperation is essential to the GALILEO programme. Its objective is to guarantee the interoperability of GALILEO with the existing radio-navigation systems, such as the American GPS or those in preparation, such as the Russian GLONASS. In this respect – and some of you have wondered whether or not it is necessary – I would like to say that the idea is that they are compatible and that they benefit each other mutually.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, after what happened last month, the need for a second system which reinforces the existing system and which provides greater security and is, when the time comes, not only a complement, but also an alternative in the event of possible unwanted situations – when we are seeing a huge increase in the applications which affect all the areas of our lives relating to GALILEO – is absolutely essential, not only for Europe, but for the whole world, including the users in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that we have the support of third countries so that we might have the necessary frequencies, principally within the framework of world radio communications conferences – the next one being in 2003. As you know, the allocation of frequencies is due to be consolidated in 2003. When this happens, it should aid participation in the development of the GALILEO programme.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the data issued by GALILEO, the international and Community instruments intended for its protection will clearly be applied. As Mrs Langenhagen’s report stresses, we believe – and this is one of its special features compared to the GPS system – that GALILEO must supply a public signal, that is, a robust and precise signal which cannot be interrupted as a result of military issues, as happens in the case of GPS, and sensitive applications, whether they be public – customs, judicial investigation and so on – or private – such as banking transmissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me to sum up the next stages of the programme. At the end of the year, after receiving Parliament’s opinion, the Council must adopt the statutes of the GALILEO joint undertaking and decide how the programme must continue to be developed by the said joint undertaking in close cooperation with the European Space Agency. As some of you have said, the green light must be given to the GALILEO project once and for all. The development phase, which should last from 2002 until the end of 2005, should allow the launch of the first satellites with a view to testing the system in reality and allow the receivers sector to bring those receivers into line.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, there is still much to do. Your support is absolutely essential and, in any event, we will keep this House fully informed of all the steps we take in relation to this project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
