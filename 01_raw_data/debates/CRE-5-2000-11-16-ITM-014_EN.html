<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bösch (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the report we are debating this evening fits very well into today's agenda, because around midday today we already adopted an important report on access to documents, and I believe what we are discussing now and will have to decide tomorrow is very closely related to that.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the Ombudsman, a matter we have just been discussing, there were several complaints in the past about the lack of transparency in regard to recruitment, and that is a very crucial point, because we entirely agree with the Ombudsman's view that recruitment procedures are many young EU citizens' first contact with the European institutions. Here it is important for the procedures to be highly transparent, comprehensible and open.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, the point of departure of this report was the recommendation by the Ombudsman to the Commission to give applicants access to their own marked examination scripts during the selection procedure it organised. The previous Commission did not comply with this recommendation, despite several requests. That was one reason why the Ombudsman adopted a special report in which he once again emphasised his concern in this respect. Meanwhile, the Prodi Commission has agreed to implement the fourth recommendation addressed to it and to allow applicants access to their own corrected test papers in a selection procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee, the Committee on Petitions, looked into the matter and adopted the report before us. When we adopted this report in committee we decided on principle to accept the Ombudsman's recommendation. We would also like to give warm thanks to the Commission and congratulate it on its positive response to the Ombudsman's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The hope was also expressed that all other European bodies and institutions will follow the Commission's example and grant job applicants access to their own, corrected test papers. We believe that giving applicants for jobs in the European institutions this kind of more transparent and open access would also represent an important step in the widely broadcast reform of the European Commission. It would also bring Brussels and Europe closer to the citizen and make them more comprehensible.</p>
<p class="contents">A word now on the amendments, on which we shall be voting tomorrow. To a large extent, they respond to the recommendation made by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and on that basis, they are clearly intended to spell out in a little more detail what we actually expect of the Commission in this respect. In particular – and this is also part of the amendments – I think it is important to set the Commission a sensible timetable for implementing these announced reform measures. I hope – that is my position as rapporteur – that the House will endorse this view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am speaking today on behalf of our Co-President, Mrs Hautala, who is unable to be here this evening. It is her opinion in particular that I want to draw attention to as I speak tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much welcome the Ombudsman's report. We particularly welcome the reforms and changes which we believe ought to be and, Commission-willing, will be introduced as a result of this report. After all, access to documentation is a fundamental civil right and no documentation is more important to a candidate than documentation in relation to examinations. The core of the Ombudsman's report is the fact that candidates for Community recruitment are entitled, if they so request, to see their examination scripts.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to make a particular point about minority languages. There is a great difficulty about examining people in a different language. I have had to do it myself from time to time, looking at scripts in Italian or German as a native English – or at least a kind of English – speaker. The difficulty is resolved by translation, but then we must be sure that the quality of translation is high and that the candidate can check that what was written in the original language is what appears in the paper as examined. If there are inconsistencies it must be open to the candidate to draw attention to them.</p>
<p class="contents">We are glad that the Commission is going to do this. Not only the Commission but the other institutions and bodies of the Community ought to comply with the Ombudsman's recommendations, even in the case of recruitment procedures which have already been initiated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable that the Commission agreed to apply the Ombudsman's recommendation only for recruitment procedures launched after June 2000. We believe that the institutions of the Community should conduct their staff recruitment procedures, and indeed all recruitment procedures, with a maximum of openness and transparency in order to avoid the suspicion of partiality, injustice and administrative incompetence.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also make sure that the procedures encourage the appointment of women to salary groups, including the highest salary groups in which they are under-represented. We would also like to draw attention to the point about temporary and auxiliary posts in the institutions, offices and bodies of the Community and the Union. These should be published in the Official Journal and in the press and on the Internet to guarantee a genuine sense of competition. Senior officials must ensure that merit is rewarded and that all vacant posts, even the most senior ones, should be published in the Official Journal and on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, persons employed in the private offices of members of the Commission must be obliged to take part in a general selection procedure before they can take up any other vacant post in the institution in question. We note, for example, that Mr Prodi's former <span class="italic">chef de cabinet</span> was transferred to another post in the Commission hierarchy. We hope that he will see that he should resign when the mandate of the current Commission finishes, since he has never passed a Commission competition at all.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a byword throughout the Union that it is difficult to get into jobs unless you are well connected. We must do all that we can to make that byword not merely false, but seen to be false. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, we must thank all those involved in this matter. We thank the Ombudsman for his initiative, his determination to achieve transparency and his extreme attention to relations between citizens and the European administration. Congratulations also to the European Commission, which, after some hesitation, cooperated fully with the Ombudsman and responded to his demands, especially to the recommendation that is the subject of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">We thought it legitimate for candidates to have access to their marked test papers, since access to documents is a fundamental right and one that is also recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights we adopted this week. In the same way, we find it entirely justified for candidates to be able to take the examination questions home with them after the test. The recruitment procedures must be transparent to avoid all abuse; that is obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, we feel that a certain flexibility is required. We must not introduce more rigidity into provisions that may apply to institutions as different as the Commission and the Court of Justice. Nor do I think we should further burden some procedures with cumbersome provisions that are disproportionate to the real risks of dispute. I am referring here to an amendment on the need to provide indisputable proof relating, for instance, to oral test procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group was very satisfied with the vote in the Committee on Petitions. The rapporteur proposed new amendments in plenary session. We studied them and we can accept three of them, which are in line with the way we voted in committee. We think the others are difficult to implement, or even rather out of context.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would say that we welcome the fact that the European Commission followed the Ombudsman’s recommendations. This dialogue between the mediator and the Commission proves that the latter wants to follow a policy of transparency and good administration. That resolve will encourage a rapprochement between the institutions and the European citizens. It also shows very clearly how useful and effective the Ombudsman is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Ombudsman looks after the public interest in the direction of the administration. The Ombudsman, Jacob Söderman, works, by virtue of his job description, for the people and in order for good administration to take root in the Union. We all know that there is still much to do. It is, however, vitally important to adopt good, open and effective administrative practice, so that the European Union will gain the support and confidence of its citizens more satisfactorily than it does at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman’s report discussed this time regards the secrecy attached to the Commission’s recruitment procedure. The report contains recommendations that the Commission has already begun to implement. The rapporteur, Herbert Bösch, from the Committee on Petitions, states in the explanatory statement in his report that the principles that led to the Ombudsman’s recommendations proved to be the same as those adhered to by the European Parliament: correctness, transparency and the desire to create confidence. And that is how it should be. Parliament is a body elected directly by the people. Its job is legislation and to monitor the Union’s bureaucratic machine on behalf of the public. Parliament and the Ombudsman must therefore work for the same causes.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by the Committee on Petitions states that the Committee approves the special report being discussed and, in particular, the point which states the desire to improve the impression the public gets of the institutions from our competitions procedures. The most important of Mr Söderman’s proposals is the right of applicants to have access to their corrected examination papers afterwards. The Committee says that the Commission has informed the Ombudsman it was implementing this recommendation as from the start of July 2000. In addition, the report urges all the institutions and bodies of the European Communities to allow applicants to have access to their corrected examination papers in future recruitment competitions, if they so request.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Mr Bösch, has already briefly presented here the amendments to the report he tabled. I hope they will be supported in Parliament.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As things stand, the institutions are too often experienced as remote and bureaucratic – something which has had negative repercussions for Parliament as shown, for instance, in the low turnout in the last elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking part in competitions for jobs in the European Union is for many people their first close-up experience of the European institutions. Any doubts concerning the fairness of the competitions must therefore be taken seriously. The fact that these competitions have been surrounded by suspicions of irregularities and favouritism in the media has been quite damaging to the public perception of the institutions. Having good staff and officials is obviously in itself essential for well-functioning institutions and this can only be assured if the recruitment procedure is impartial and as objective as possible. Transparency in the procedure, with due respect for the independence of the boards, is central in this regard. Allowing the candidates to see their marked tests is a simple means of increasing transparency and confidence in the procedure for the recruitment of European civil servants.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman's initiative and recommendations can therefore be warmly welcomed, as can the decision by the Commission to follow them. The example should be followed by all other institutions and bodies, as the Committee on Petitions has recommended. It is vital to the construction and administration of a multinational community such as the EU that there should be no suspicions whatever of discrimination between candidates for posts in the administration, whether on national or other grounds. I therefore thank the Ombudsman for his report, which I fully support. I also thank the Commission for having agreed to follow the Ombudsman's recommendation to allow the candidates access to their marked tests in future competitions. I call for all other institutions to follow this example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">They are extremely clear, concise, pragmatic amendments which represent genuine reform, that is, the only reform worthy of the name which the European institutions ought to adopt on the recruitment procedure. However, between the fine words and noble principles expressed by the European Ombudsman and practice, things are not always so cut and dried. When I tabled two questions to the Commission on the management and organisation of the last internal competition, I received clear, detailed replies. These replies revealed a clear case of maladministration, if not abuse of authority, by the Director-General for Personnel and Administration, and the second reply implicated Commissioner Kinnock. I notified the Ombudsman of this, who, in his reply, said that he had decided not to open an inquiry because the competition was already far advanced.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I did not – and still do not – possess those paranormal capacities which make it possible to predict the future. Not only that: Article 2(4) of the European Parliament Decision on the Regulations and the General Conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties stipulates that the Ombudsman must be notified within two years of the date on which the petitioner becomes aware of the grounds for the accusation.</p>
<p class="contents">Insofar as my duty and my political responsibilities are concerned, the Ombudsman's decision is a routine defence of the Commission. This is not the mandate that Parliament conferred upon Mr Söderman. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I begin by congratulating Mr Bösch on an excellent report and also congratulate the European Ombudsman on the work he is doing. I know that, though this was before my day, there was concern in the House about whether to have an Ombudsman at all, because it would then seem like a conflict of interests. But history has shown that this is not the case and that an Ombudsman does work very hard to protect the interests of our constituents and becomes a point of access for legitimising complaints and finding out what has gone wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">I had the privilege of serving on the select committee on the Ombudsman in the House of Commons and that was a very powerful committee. We could summon anyone in the country before the Ombudsman committee, and the select committee procedure which I will discuss in two minutes is something that we could learn from. Citizens of the European Union should receive a positive impression when encountering the Community institutions. The question is, has this been achieved? I fear that the short answer is: "no". Clearly, as this report reflects, improvements are being made.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the Commission on accepting the four recommendations made in the special report on the Ombudsman. Access to official documents by citizens of the Union is a hallmark of a responsible and fully functioning democracy. The fact that applicants for Community institution jobs should see their marked scripts shows that institutions are confident in the way they run their application and selection procedures. It is a hallmark of a confident democracy if the processes by which selection is made is done openly and without any recourse to confidentiality or secrecy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the select committees of the House of Commons we had the power to introduce a regime of monitoring of every level of the executive, not only the ministers in the same way we monitor the Commission sometimes in terms of them coming here and answering questions, but a two-hour session with the particular minister with officials in attendance where the elected Members could ask questions and be prepared to ask questions in detail and to get detailed answers. This is the beginning of opening up the process of government and making it transparent. In our resolution we talk about transparent government and we should start to implement it in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, congratulations must, of course, go first and foremost to Mr Södermann; he has been highly receptive to numerous complaints from European citizens about maladministration in the Commission recruitment procedure and has drafted an own-initiative report in order to solve the problem. I am delighted that the Commission has accepted many of the Ombudsman's suggestions. However, I think there is still one lacuna: it refuses to design a system of integrated principles with clear guidelines which would result in completely objective recruitment competitions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the only way to limit arbitrariness and the resultant complaints – well-founded or not, that we do not know – about competitions with pre-determined results. Technical problems, however difficult, cannot obstruct the political objective of transparency. If they could, there would be no point in even discussing transparency. The President of the Commission himself has repeatedly assured us that transparency in the administration of European affairs is an absolute priority. I do not believe, when he said this, that he was unaware of the difficulties in achieving this objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to finish by saying that the Commission has a obligation to comply with the recommendations of the European Ombudsman and to design a full system of objective examinations for two reasons: first, because it is legally obliged to do so under Article 255 of the Treaty, as revised by the Treaty of Amsterdam introducing the principle of transparency. This is why we are calling on the Council to work with the Commission and issue the relevant directive. And secondly, because, from a purely political point of view, its credibility depends on it. Unlike the Member States, with their long history, the European Union has only a short past, which is why it must create the expectation of something new. And the something new in this case is that it must apply best practices and avoid anything which experience tells us will damage its credibility within the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs to give a greater impression of reliability than the Member States, which have different ties with their citizens, such as ties of common descent; the European Union's main link is the respect which the citizens of Europe expect of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of the requests contained in this have already been put into effect. For example, candidates are already allowed to take the examination questions away with them, the general evaluation criteria can be made known to those candidates who request them, the list of passes can be published in the Official Journal and the composition of the selection board may be published in the Official Journal (in the case of general public entrance examinations) or on the Commission’s web site (in the case of internal or restricted examinations).</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission endeavours to be as objective as possible, and I should like to make two comments on a couple of questions which have arisen in the debate. Firstly, the corrections to the examinations set by the Commission are always made anonymously. No one knows who the candidates are, since they are identified by secret codes rather than by their names. Secondly, and where languages are concerned, the examinations take place, and are marked in, the national languages, and the tests are not converted from one language to another before they are marked. The aim, therefore, is to have the maximum amount of precautions and guarantees to ensure that the examinations take place in the form which is fairest and most acceptable to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, the point which created most interest today in the debate on Mr Bösch’s report concerned what happens regarding candidates’ access to their marked examination scripts. President Prodi has already made due reference to this subject. I can now confirm something which has already appeared in the White Paper on reform of the Commission, specifically in action 29 which is about improving transparency in a way which benefits candidates and in which it is stated that ‘Finally, pursuant to the European Ombudsman’s recommendation, the Commission will allow candidates access to their corrected tests in all competitions launched after July 2002’.</p>
<p class="contents">Why July 2002, some of you are asking. Well, precisely because of this same concern with transparency and knowledge of the procedures that you have expressed and also because a number of administrative steps will first have to be taken if there is to be access to corrected examination scripts. What form is this correcting of examination papers to take? Who is qualified to carry it out? How and to whom is this type of procedure to be presented?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s commitment regarding this matter is absolute and we hope that, as soon as these measures have been implemented, they will be applied generally.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission can obviously make a commitment on its own behalf. With regard to other institutions, it is they themselves who will decide whether the procedures proposed in this report or in the requests by the Ombudsman are adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The impossibility of having more than one supplementary for a Member adds to this. There is no sense of interrogation of the Council at all.
