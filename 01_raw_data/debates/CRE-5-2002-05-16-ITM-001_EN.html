<p class="contents">It would be very tempting to list the issues and problems of sustainable development and the future of sustainable development at length, but there is just such a list in the report and in the resolution proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. So I shall refrain from doing so. I mainly want to explain the logic behind the political message we want to send out.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us begin with the bottom line and the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years after Rio, is clearly in the red. With the exception of Kyoto, no progress has been made either with the environment per se – in fact there have been setbacks – or with the state of the world in general. Poverty has not been eradicated or reduced; on the contrary it is rising and we know full well that, with so many people living below the poverty line, there is no point in talking about protecting productive resources, renewable sources of energy and so on. The bottom line is in the red but no one accepts any responsibility for it. Perhaps they will do so in Johannesburg; it would be a useful exercise because it might throw some light on what we need to do in the future, because the future is not looking too rosy. The population on this planet is exploding, all the statistics say so. The pressure on resources is increasing as a result of globalisation and other factors, and both environmental and social cohesion problems look set to get worse.</p>
<p class="contents">So what should we be doing? What should we be talking about in Johannesburg? I think we all agree that whatever the definition of sustainable development, it must include development, social cohesion and environmental protection. The to-do list is clear on this count, I think we all agree. We talk about changing production and consumption standards, we talk about eradicating poverty, we talk about mainstreaming the environment in all policies, in farming, fisheries, industry, energy, tourism, water and air policies, but we have no objectives, timetables, indicators to tell us if we have reached our targets, mechanisms, capital, and the means to move and control the use of resources. This is where the problems lie.</p>
<p class="contents">The report and the resolution contain numerous proposals on reducing poverty, on renewable sources of energy and on countless other points which all require resources, institutions, rules, proper local, national and global management, political management. It is this management that will, I think, be the main problem in the future. Reforming the international system of Bretton Woods institutions and of more recent institutions such as the World Trade Organisation, for example when their rules clash with environmental protection. Reforms so that poor people can farm, agricultural reforms, for example, to give them water, energy, the rudiments needed to move to a modern perception of environmental protection and, of course, government action. As we know, the United States are loath to make any kind of commitment. They are also distancing themselves from those who have. The role of the European Union is the sixty-four thousand dollar question. The European Union will be able to play a part for quite some time to come, but not for ever. And if it is going to play its part, it needs to put its own house in order. It needs to do more to promote environmental protection and social cohesion policies. To table commitments at international organisations in which it has enough clout to achieve some degree of success, to be a reliable partner, internationally and with the third world, so that we can hope for some sort of improvement post Johannesburg and so that, in ten years' time, we do not find ourselves in the same situation we were in 30 years ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lannoye (Verts/ALE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> It was in Rio in 1992 that the international community established the concept of sustainable development. There is no doubt that in the intervening ten years the language used in speeches on the environment and development has changed, and changed for the better. Solemn undertakings have been made and conventions have been signed – if not ratified, at least signed – but we must also note, ten years on, that the situation on the environmental front has not improved, it has deteriorated, and that where poor and developing countries are concerned there has been no improvement there either. The inequalities have continued to increase: today, more than 800 million people are still undernourished and a billion people do not have access to drinking water. This is surely a state of affairs which cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p class="contents">Johannesburg, which will take place in a few months, will not only be a time for taking stock; it will also be the moment of truth. It is not enough to have a ceremonial preaching of environmental values, which would be a repeat of what was said in Rio. Neither is it enough to have a chorus of lamentations: we need on the agenda a programme of ambitious political change for the next ten years. That, in any case, is the message which the Committee on Development and Cooperation has asked me to pass on to you.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are proposing is that we make the overall priority the fight against poverty and hunger and the fair and sustainable use of natural resources. The message that we are sending to this House, to the Commission and to the Council is focused on five chapters: the first is fighting poverty and promoting social development, and it contains a whole series of specific proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is about harnessing globalisation. What does this mean? It means quite clearly that sustainable development must take precedence. Trade legislation, the rules of international trade and rules on investment must therefore be made subject to sustainable development criteria, and not the other way round.</p>
<p class="contents">The third is the sustainable management and conservation of natural resources. This will require the development of new technologies and here I am thinking in particular, where energy is concerned, of renewable sources of energy. The proposals that we make in this regard are both credible and ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth chapter is related to something the Commission said itself in the first document it published last year, that it was necessary to change production and consumption patterns. This is true, but it will require us to make some hard choices. I think, for example, that as far as we are concerned, some European Union policies – and I am thinking in particular of the common agricultural policy, the fisheries policy and the trade policy – will need to be reviewed if we are to avoid their running counter to the objectives of sustainable development. Furthermore, it will give us much greater credibility at international level, especially at the Johannesburg conference, if we put our own house in order before saying what needs to be done at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fifth and final point is that we need to ensure that there is good governance at all levels. The concept of good governance is often tainted with paternalism. I believe that if it is applied at all levels of decision-making, and in particular at the level of international institutions, the use of this term will become more credible. I think, for example, that the international economic institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation, need a serious facelift so as to introduce a minimum of democracy and a minimum of public and political oversight.</p>
<p class="contents">That, in essence, is the message which the Committee on Development wishes to see this House and the Commission – I turn here to Commissioner Nielson – take away with them, because in a few weeks' time, there is a key date: the meeting in Bali, the last preparatory meeting before the Johannesburg Summit. So far, we have no cause for optimism because there is still no document on the table and up for discussion which shows real ambition. I therefore hope that our contribution will help the European institutions to play a leading role in this preparatory meeting, if there is still time, and in any case I hope that we will avoid giving the impression of thinking that handing over the responsibility for managing the problems related to sustainable development to partnership initiatives with the private sector is the way to resolve the problem. It may form part of the solution, but it has to be in addition to the commitments made by individual States and by the international institutions and not instead of them. This is what I wanted to say, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that the EU should be playing a leadership role in Johannesburg. Our own treaty commitments oblige us to do so, and European citizens expect us to do so. That means that the Council and the Commission must listen to Parliament's views and respond to them, because it is clear that Parliament wishes to see measures that are both ambitious and more targeted. The Development Council and the Seville Summit should therefore insist on a proper revision of the Commission's communication in order to address existing gaps, add timetables for implementation and develop action plans for each measure. We do not need any more monitoring of the problem: we are in danger of going down as the only species that monitors its own extinction instead of taking steps to prevent it. We need bold, imaginative action plans and we need them now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission rightly identifies what it calls a global governance gap, with global market forces running far ahead of the ability of institutional mechanisms to contain them. And yet the measures which the Commission proposes to close that gap are woefully insufficient. In particular, the Commission's disproportionate emphasis on free trade and investment as engines for development should be balanced with far stronger commitments to binding frameworks for corporate accountability. As a first step we are proposing a directive on mandatory social and environmental performance.</p>
<p class="contents">WTO rules must also be reformed to allow governments to make the vital distinctions that need to be made between products on the basis of the way in which they have been produced. How else can we move towards more sustainable production and consumption practices?</p>
<p class="contents">It is hard to overstate the importance of urgent action at Johannesburg. It has been estimated that if we continue with our current production and consumption patterns we will soon need an extra three planets in order to provide the necessary resources and absorb the wastes. We do not have three planets; we have just one planet, and it is already showing signs of major degradation. Johannesburg has to deliver results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is little to celebrate, anyway, since over these ten years the signs of unsustainability have got worse. Rather, the Johannesburg Conference gives us the opportunity to start all over again, making a world-wide commitment to a development model that blends the economic dimension with both the social dimension and the environmental dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, there is a further difficulty associated with the Rio de Janeiro Summit. This time, we shall be even more alone in the leadership of a global agreement. The political agenda that the European Union defines will, therefore, be critical for the success of the conference. I believe that both the Commission communication and the Papayannakis and Lannoye reports contribute to making this a good agenda. There are, however, certain paragraphs and a few amendments that, in our view, take away some of the objectivity and detachment of Parliament’s resolution – I mean the Tobin tax and writing off the debt of the developing countries. Even so, the PPE Group will vote for the final resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope the following objectives will be achieved at the Johannesburg Summit. First of all, it should mark the coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol. For this to happen, some countries need to speed up their ratification of the Protocol – Russia, Japan, Canada and Australia. Secondly, the political conditions must be created for the United States to rejoin the joint effort in the environmental field. Thirdly, an initiative is needed to green the economy by internalising environmental costs, dissociating economic growth from intensive resource use and focusing on cleaner technologies. Fourthly, we hope that the Summit will provide joint answers to global problems and that, as happened in Rio de Janeiro, when the foundations were laid for the Conference on Climate Change, Johannesburg will also lay the foundations for protocols and new institutions in other environmental areas, such as water, for instance. Fifthly, we hope a boost will be given to international governance and institutional reform. It is not possible to create an Internet for sustainability if the nodes in this net are obsolescent.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, we hope that this Summit will not content itself with vague intentions but will set out timetables, goals and policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the first time, as far as I can remember, that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has been able to conduct a debate at a time that might be called in any way normal. It is no doubt a sign that the wind of change is blowing through the Judicial Board for Public Lands and Funds, and we must hope that it continues to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The wind of change also characterises the excellent reports prepared by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Lannoye on ‘ten years after Rio’ and ‘sustainable development’. Were we to succeed in complying with these reports and taking the relevant decisions in this House on the model supplied by Mr Lannoye and Mr Papayannakis, then we should have done more than has been done in the last ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">The wind of change clearly died down when it reached the Commission, however. There is no evidence of very much having happened there. Certain breezes are perhaps detectable, but not much more. Above all, the Commission is finding it incredibly difficult, just as it did last year when we discussed sustainable development, to engage in a dialogue with Parliament. I do not know what kind of impediment it is that prevents the Commission from achieving proper communication and having proper discussions with Parliament on the subject of sustainable development. Instead, we have to continue to tag along with our proposals and ideas. A serious grass-roots debate on this issue is needed, and Parliament is an excellent forum in which to begin that discussion. Parliament must therefore be taken seriously when it talks about this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years after Rio and five years after our having made a pledge concerning sustainability strategies in all the UN countries, we can of course see what has happened. One sample figure that sticks in the mind is the fact that the four richest people on this planet own as much as the 48 poorest nations combined. I think this says quite a lot about the way the situation now appears in the world. For example, we allow 5 500 children to die every day because of polluted air, polluted food and polluted water. Children, who are the most vulnerable, are being allowed to die because of the pattern of life we now have.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as Mr Lannoye said, we permit the rich world to over-produce, and waste, food at the same time as 800 million people are starving. This is a policy and a pattern of life that cannot continue for very much longer. There are nonetheless certain bright spots following Rio. There are cities, countries, municipalities and regions that have done an incredible amount to change the situation. Nevertheless, the overall result is disheartening and. something must be done. I think we must repeat the message in precisely the same form we used before the Gothenburg Summit. We need committed political leadership on the issue. Political priorities need to be set. I think it would have been good if at least one representative from the Spanish Presidency, which is to communicate this commitment of ours in the light of Rio, had been here in the House and listened to today’s debate. We have heard what problems there are, and our documents contain the proposed solutions. I hope that both the Commission and the Council will now listen to what Parliament has to say. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Without a clear and ambitious policy on renewable sources of energy there will be no development and no solution to the problem of the greenhouse effect either. I would propose five avenues for the European Union to explore in the run-up to the Johannesburg Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is a Marshall Plan-type programme for the two billion people who, even today, do not have sufficient energy resources and often live in rural areas or shanty towns. Now that President Bush has blocked the G8 plan on renewables, the European Union – either on its own or with like-minded countries like Japan – should take the initiative and fund a programme for 500 000 decentralised units, to an existing design combining solar, wind and possibly hydraulic energy. These units would be built in rural areas. Information technology could also be incorporated, thus creating a real catalyst for development.</p>
<p class="contents">The second, which is probably the most simple and most economic way of combating the greenhouse effect, considering the levels it will have reached by 2020, is to set minimum standards for millions of new household appliances – in China alone there will be 100 million new fridges in 2020 – for new engines and for millions of new computer tools. If we manage to set minimum standards for these items, we will be taking the simplest – and by far the least costly – measure, and also the one which will probably have the greatest influence on international policy on the greenhouse effect. Admittedly, this will not be very easy: we would need a secretariat at OECD level before we could proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point actually consists of three sub-measures which I will outline briefly: first of all the European Union and the countries of the OECD need to lay down clear objectives on renewable sources of energy. We then need to help developing countries to build and structure their energy markets so that they head in that direction. Finally, EUR 350 billion in subsidies currently go to fossil and nuclear energies. If this money were used for something else the economy would be healthier and so would the planet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He was talking about democracy and said that the word ‘democracy’ had been used so much by those who were against democracy that the word had lost its virtue and value.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the same thing is happening with sustainable development. The term appears in all European Union documents, government documents and, more importantly, in the documents of those who wish to destroy sustainable development and foster unsustainable development and a model of consumption that is going to prevent us from leaving Johannesburg with clear priorities and mechanisms for action, although, of course, I hope to be proved wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely agree with the reports by Mr Lannoye and Mr Papayannakis. The priorities have to be sustainable management of resources and changing production models. We cannot allow the 25 % of mammals, 11 % of birds and 15 % of plants that are in danger of extinction to disappear. Meanwhile, in terms of models of consumption, 86 % of global consumption corresponds to 20 % of the population. That is unsustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding another priority, eradicating poverty, Mr President, the results of the Monterrey Summit were meagre. Along with the World Bank, which has no members in our Group and which has calculated that in the next thirty years the number of poor people in the world will more than double, we have been saying for many years that unless action is taken to tackle poverty, marginalization, environmental degradation, conflicts, epidemics and migrations, there will be serious economic and political destabilisation at world level.</p>
<p class="contents">Eradicating poverty is therefore a priority, and the outcome of the last ten years is poor, as is the outcome of the Monterrey Summit, which gave 0.39% development aid for 2006. I hope, Mr President, that the outcome of the Johannesburg summit will not be a poor one, and I therefore trust that the delegation from the European Parliament will strongly defend what we are saying here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The World Summit in Johannesburg will give us a unique opportunity to set an agenda for sustainable development over the next ten years. We can be pleased about the very fact that the Summit has been called, but otherwise no progress has, in general, been made in the global preparations for the summit. The negotiations at the UN’s preparatory meeting in New York did not lead to binding agreements, which is why the next and last chance for the global negotiations will be at the end of May in Bali. There, it will hopefully be possible to produce a real action plan and political declaration which, for example, will be able to promote the implementation of various international conventions, something which, however, presupposes increased pressure on the part of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States has clearly expressed the view that it does not want to assume new obligations in connection with the world summit. If the summit is to be a success, the EU must take on the role of political leadership and, as the country holding the presidency during the summit, Denmark has a big responsibility for leading the international process in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The basis for Denmark’s proposal is the desire for a global agreement consisting, for example, of practical concessions from the wealthy part of the world, as only a global agreement can create the framework capable of translating the political declarations from Rio into genuine action in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has also undertaken to work for a global agreement but, as Mr Lannoye pointed out, the Commission wishes to concentrate more on global partnerships, which is far from adequate. The EU will not, however, be deciding upon its contribution to Johannesburg until as late as the July summit. It is unfortunate that only a few EU Heads of State have undertaken to participate in the world summit for, without such high-level participation, there are fewer possibilities of success. We have had enough words. What we need now is action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This excellent report confirms that. I would like to highlight one aspect in particular. I think Johannesburg must start here. I think that in this House, we sometimes fail to recognise the opportunities afforded to us in this context by the Treaty of Amsterdam, namely the co-decision procedure. We must wield this instrument with far more determination and vigour. Indeed, in my view, the greater our resolution in influencing the passage of European legislation on environmental matters, the greater our credibility will be in Johannesburg and, of course, at future conferences too. We must recognise that we need rather more self-confidence here and must sometimes endorse more stringent yet feasible demands. We must also reject any notion that nuclear power has a role to play in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of a whole range of summits and conferences, few people can dispute that we are today a long way from achieving the objective of sustainable development. We are now in actual fact still further from that objective than when the Brundtland report was presented in 1987 and when the Rio Conference took place. The opposite ought, of course, to be the case. The other day, the OECD, which is not, of course, an environmental organisation, pronounced that ‘All major global ecological indicators are negative’<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Things are just as bad when it comes to poverty and social development. The number of poor people is increasing, not decreasing. In the light of this, the Johannesburg Summit is very important, but, as has been indicated in this House, hopes are fairly low-key. The machinery of negotiation is sluggish, and interest on the part of the American administration is also anything but lively. As Mrs Hulthén said, the Spanish Presidency is unfortunately not represented in Parliament today, a fact which also does not indicate a particularly high degree of interest in this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the reasons why we are still such a long way from achieving a sensible balance between economic growth, social development and consideration for the environment? There are two main reasons. First of all, there is strong resistance to implementing all the measures which, in a whole range of conferences, government says it recommends: for example, doing away with subsidies to industries which are harmful to the environment; incorporating environmental costs into prices; establishing clear environmental criteria for our export credits guarantee boards so that we do not export non-sustainable systems to the developing countries; and, in general, encouraging, rather than discouraging, activities that take the environment into account. Economic regulations are not at present leading us in the direction we want to go, but we do little about this. Mr Lannoye’s report, which I welcome, contains a series of proposals concerning the route which might be followed. The EU must push ahead in this respect, as on a range of issues concerning the fight against poverty. Otherwise, there will be very little in the way of results from Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, development is proceeding slowly because, as I see it, we have models for both education and economics that are unduly top-down and reductionist. We have chosen to organise our society by focusing on specialisation. There are more than 20 000 different disciplines in our universities, and specialisation is, of course, good for solving a variety of individual problems. There are, however, extremely few experts engaged in the solution of cross-border problems. The Johannesburg Summit is now to try to solve all these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside the short-term measures, we must, then, also reflect upon the big picture and ensure that we learn to think better in terms of systems in our societies. In particular, we must help the poor, or developing, countries to develop research skills so that they are themselves able to develop strategies that are both more profitable financially speaking and more sustainable in environmental terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to take this opportunity to say that as parliamentarians, we must consider whether in future, when we adopt a position on a key conference such as Johannesburg, we could do so with more brevity, conciseness and structure, especially as this then makes it easier to convey to the public what the European Parliament does and does not stand for.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous speaker referred to the Commission and everything that it has to do. I would like to point out, on the basis of my own almost three years of experience, that even in this House, the majorities are not always in favour of sustainable development and sustainable solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The three elements of sustainable development have been cited frequently: they are economic, social and ecological development. Here, it is important that in future, GDP growth does not remain the only key indicator of social progress. GDP growth has nothing to do with sustainability. We therefore urge the Commission to bring pressure to bear in Johannesburg so that new social and ecological indicators are adopted to calculate a country's well-being in future.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot talk about a global partnership for sustainable development without highlighting the link between poverty and environmental destruction. Poverty breeds population growth. It is estimated that by 2015, the global population will have reached 7.5 billion. This means more pressure on natural resources and more pressure on the environment. In this context, I would like to stress the importance of greater efforts to ensure women's legal equality and their right to protection of their reproductive health, and to strive for progress in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to touch specifically on the proposed amendments. My group will not vote for the Greens' Amendment No 5 to delete paragraph 26. However, I should also stress that we are working from the French original. We would delete the German version as it stands as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also mention that my group does not support Amendment No 12 which seeks to introduce a Sachs tax, i.e. tax-deductible contributions for charitable purposes. Personally, I have problems using the adjective "charitable" at all. When we refer to sustainable development as the challenge of the century, this has to do with the fact that we need to change our own production conditions; it has nothing to do with charity. I also see a further problem, namely that we would be deducting tax revenue for developed countries which need this income for their own sustainable development in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The environment, social and cultural issues, development and governance are, of course, all intrinsically connected. This is shown by the fact that despite some advances since the Rio Summit, man-made climate change is still unabated. Vital resources are being further depleted and the gap between rich and poor becomes ever wider.</p>
<p class="contents">So many opportunities were presented in Rio, and as Mr Papayannakis' report states, so many expectations were raised with the Kyoto Protocol, the Cartagena Protocol and so on, but they failed to progress. It is not really any surprise that so many NGOs are already predicting negative outcomes for Johannesburg. But people expect us in the European Union to take a lead on these issues and we cannot shirk that responsibility. In another ten years, people will be asking what action we took in 2002 to address and to reverse the lack of progress in the past ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">Other colleagues have made very many important points relating to the summit. I would like to draw attention to one other aspect and that is the need to look at diversity in its widest sense, including the cultural aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The future needs sustainable communities in the true definition of that concept. Today, about half of the 6 000 or so languages spoken in different parts of the world are under threat: that means that 3 000 languages are either seriously endangered or are dying. The need to protect and enhance the diversity of cultures in the world becomes even more urgent in the face of increasing globalisation. We need to ensure that an artificial polarisation between the needs of the environment and the needs of people is not allowed to develop any further.</p>
<p class="contents">So I welcome the positive and the constructive comments of the rapporteurs, as Mr Lannoye said, "this is a major challenge and we need to take a radical new approach".</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We look forward to it with inevitable expectation and grant it the importance due to an event that may or should lead the international community to draw up an agenda effectively aiming at the sustainable development of the planet, the improvement of living standards and the eradication of poverty, rooted in the agreements reached at the Rio Earth Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">We should like to be optimistic, even though there are plenty of reasons to hold a different or even opposing view: the enormous delays in complying with the gains made at Rio, the North-South divide, the perpetuation of poverty and the debt itself, the insistence on unsuitable and unfair economic recipes, the lack of political will on the part of the rich countries – especially the United States – to alter guidelines that they themselves determine and to make available the resources needed for world-wide change, which, after all, would benefit everybody. Even recently, Monterrey, despite its last-minute decisions, was yet another reason to dampen our much-needed optimism.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, we must now urge the Member States and the Commission once and for all to adopt a position in keeping with the scourges that affect the world and to push for guidelines, measures and the means needed for fair and sustainable development, linking environmental protection to the eradication of poverty. They must also commit themselves to an ambitious agenda for the next decade that will prevent the unacceptable failure that some already think is bound to result from this World Summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We had high expectations in those days. We are now 10 years on and the Summit in Johannesburg is around the corner. This is an opportune moment to take a critical look at what has happened during that time. Unfortunately, there is little reason to be cheerful. We can only conclude that the high expectations of a decade ago have not been materialised. What is more, the environment has now disappeared from the public eye, and hence the political eye, while the strain on the environment has only increased.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time we did something about this. If the EU wishes to continue to play its pioneering role, it is of major importance for it to find resonance with the people. And at the moment, people are particularly concerned with issues such as security and health. It therefore goes without saying that we should take advantage of this. Indeed, if we continue to neglect the environment, this will irrevocably lead to yet more floods, forest fires, pollution and poor health for a large number of people. In short, without sustainable development, not only the environment will be damaged, but issues that concern people, including a lack of security, disease and death, will also enjoy an upturn. By referring to these issues, we can galvanise public opinion and thus wake up the politicians responsible in these areas. Only in this way will the environment be given the attention it deserves and will the political will be created in order to take legally binding environmental measures at international level and to actually implement them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, we need to beware of this concept being hijacked and used with overweening ideological verbosity, encroaching on new areas and being intoned in support of questionable technical proposals. The extreme diversity of the areas of activity addressed in the Lannoye report underlines this risk of distraction.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, if it is to be put into practice, the notion of sustainable development has to be applied to clearly identified priorities. The first of these would appear to me to be the need – which the rapporteur stresses – not to resign ourselves to the persistence and indeed the increase in poverty, the eradication of which must remain an absolute and constant priority in our work.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we need to contribute to striking a healthy balance between public aid, which remains essential, and developing international trade, which must not be systematically caricatured as a scarecrow. Obviously, there is no question of considering ODA as a substitute for international trade, but as a necessary addition to it. Current circumstances do not in any case allow the latter to be a catalyst for development on its own, for the very simple reason that we cannot pit economies and states in competition against each other when they have completely different structures in terms of production costs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely vital to avoid perverse scenarios, such as food-producing crops disappearing because of cheap imports of agricultural products and, as a corollary to this, developing countries gearing themselves up to export cash crops – which do not foster local development – or raw materials, which are an unreliable basis for sustainable development because of the huge variations in price.</p>
<p class="contents">If we consider it essential not to rely solely on the workings of international trade to reduce poverty, then it is vital to halt the cuts in ODA. Here, the countries of Europe have a particular task to fulfil, both together and separately. The Member States need to resist the temptation of relying exclusively on Community aid and abandoning bilateral cooperation, as the distinctive contribution and specific expertise provided under these auspices are of irreplaceable value. It is not enough, however, to halt the decline in ODA by respecting global guidelines on rate rises. It is essential to redirect this aid towards reinforcing national State structures in developing countries, which in many cases are still fragile, and towards developing the rural world, which has to be a top priority. Public money has a decisive role to play in halting the scourge of the rural exodus and people's descent into poverty when they reach the large cities, which leads to their emigrating out of despair.</p>
<p class="contents">Developing food crops and fundamental public services, particularly in the areas of health, education and social protection, is the most likely way that poverty will be reduced because it will create jobs in rural areas. When disbursing public aid, we need to recognise the particular role played by decentralised cooperation, organised through local authorities such as districts, counties and regions. These authorities have local expertise, they tailor projects to real needs, they ensure that they are monitored rigorously and they foster warm and lasting relationships between the people of the North and South. This form of cooperation should be strongly encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">Of all of the issues mentioned in the Lannoye report, Mr President, these are what I believe our priorities should be if we are to ensure that the concept of sustainable development makes a genuine contribution to poverty reduction in the world today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the delegation representing the European Parliament on that occasion was very small. I was honoured to be one of its members. At the time, the developing countries went as far as to push for the term "sustainable development" to be omitted from the final declaration and merely for the phrase "sustainable economic growth" to be used instead. I understand this position in some ways, because poverty is of course the key issue for the developing countries. When we talk about environmental protection, what we say sometimes lacks credibility. Nonetheless, as the EU, we should keep both aspects – economic and social development, but also environmental protection – in mind, for they are of course connected. For example, the World Bank calculates that if we fail to act on the issue of climate protection, there will be a 1% – 2% drop in GDP in the industrialised countries in the coming years as a result of climate change, but a 10% fall in GDP in the developing countries. This makes it clear that the environment and social and economic development cannot be played off against each other, but are inter-linked.</p>
<p class="contents">However – and the developing countries are right in this respect – we must demonstrate that it is possible to organise economic growth and prosperity without doing so at the expense of the environment. In the climate process, for example, we must thus reduce our own emissions before we can impose any obligations on the developing countries. I therefore believe that the time has come to practise what we have always preached and actually implement, in the European Union, the measures which we have consistently called for in our resolutions. There is a great deal of room to criticise the Commission's proposals, for example on emissions trading, and they can certainly be improved upon, but we must pursue this basic approach. We must now act locally if we are to convince the developing countries that sustainable development is possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the two reports complement each other and really do contain some innovative and very interesting proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that people’s awareness regarding the environment has increased a great deal, as have the political measures taken by Heads of State and Government on the issue. However, I believe that the raising of awareness and the political measures taken have both been inadequate, if not nominal. As far as awareness is concerned, we are well aware that natural resources are being exhausted, that there are mammals, birds and plants that are in danger of extinction, that there is a growing population dying of hunger and suffering from poverty. We know all of this and we are environmentally aware, but we keep increasing consumption, and we in the developed world, which represents 20% of the world population but uses 80% of its resources, are the ones responsible for it.</p>
<p class="contents">I say that the political measures are also nominal because the majority of them, following international agreements, are not carried out or are inadequately carried out. The Kyoto Protocol has still not been ratified by the majority of the countries, after ten years of debate. The United States are not going to sign it and, to give an example of a country that has agreed to it, my country, Spain, has increased emissions by 33 % compared with what it had agreed to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this is how things stand now, and at present, after the Barcelona Summit and Johannesburg, in which the issue of the environment was not sufficiently dealt with, I would not ask for the ambitious programme that too many people are asking for here. I think that if in Johannesburg we manage to fulfil all the previous commitments, if we manage to ensure that at least a percentage of international transactions are used for those poor countries, and if we manage to change the values that are currently damaging us, we will have achieved a great deal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is encouraging that the Environmental Summit is in actual fact to take place and that both rapporteurs have done a very good job when it comes to expressing the European Parliament’s misgivings, hopes, proposals and demands prior to the summit. I want to thank both rapporteurs for the sterling work they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel disappointed and frustrated, however, about the fact that the world’s leaders do not appear to take the situation in the world seriously. Just a few months before the summit is to be held, the world’s leading politicians have not even said definitely whether or not they intend to be present at the meeting in Johannesburg. The EU’s sustainable development strategy and statement prior to the world summit have also come very late, given that the matter is about our future and concerns everyone. There ought, however, to have been more respect for democratic debate and for the opportunity for civil society to take part in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out, as other speakers have already done, that the Spanish Presidency is not represented in this House. That also indicates the lack of respect for this important issue of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do I think that the EU has attached appropriate importance to the Johannesburg World Summit. The Barcelona Summit, in which the EU’s position was to be firmly set out, was also a disappointment. In Johannesburg, the EU must show clearly how it intends to reform, for example, its agricultural and fisheries policies, which have major global consequences, especially for the poor countries. We in the EU must also show that we have a credible sustainable development strategy to enable the world summit to obtain the result that is required if today’s growing environmental crisis is to be averted. The EU must play a pro-active role in this respect. I think the EU countries have a specifically moral and economic responsibility for showing the way to sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">Many seem to rely upon voluntary undertakings by industry and major companies, but these alone will not lead to the pledges of ten years ago being fulfilled. Voluntary undertakings can help, but what is required is for a world environmental organisation within the UN to ensure that human rights and environmental regulations are complied with. The international environmental and human rights conventions must also take precedence over the WTO’s regulations. The situation should not, as at present, be the other way round. This is a policy which must be pursued by ourselves in the EU and by all who take part in the Johannesburg Summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is this economic organisation which forces half of the world's population to live on less than two dollars a day? An economic system which on the one hand subsidises set-aside and destroys or stores food so as to prop up prices, while on the other leaving 826 million people undernourished, 16 million of them to starve to death, is an absolutely criminal system.</p>
<p class="contents">But the harsh reality of this statement only serves to underline how pathetic the conclusions are, especially the solutions proposed. While huge private interests pillage the planet, taking advantage of the poorest, and widening the gap between the rich minority and the poor majority, the European Parliament adopts powerless resolutions, knowing full well that summits such as those in Rio, Monterrey or Johannesburg will not change anything about anything. The European Parliament, like all representative institutions, is reduced to the role of a fig leaf, covering up the scandals which drive people to seek profits at world level.</p>
<p class="contents">While agreeing with many of the statements made in the report, the Members of <span class="italic">Lutte ouvrière</span> will abstain in protest at the immense hypocrisy which characterises the activities of the European Parliament when it claims to be combating poverty. Remaining silent about why an economic system based on profit is so damaging, and remaining silent about the responsibility of the major industrial, commercial and financial groups for the extreme poverty, hunger and impoverishment of the majority of the world's population, is akin to remaining a passive bystander of crimes against humanity and thus to acting as an accomplice to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Floods and ecological catastrophes are becoming ever more frequent; desertification is gathering pace, and it is against this background, with time running out, that we will go to Johannesburg in September.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Papayannakis and Mr Lannoye have produced very good reports, and if they really were implemented soon, in spirit and letter, both in Europe and in other parts of the world, they would make it possible for us to look to the future with greater confidence. But these texts are our consciences talking, and sustainable development will remain an ideal for as long as we are unable to bring sufficient pressure to bear on the world's economic and financial systems. Ten years ago in Rio, we already identified commitments together, commitments which it has not been possible to keep. Today we see that liberal economic policies have widened the gaps between countries, making the rich even richer and the poor ever poorer. And all the while, we have been generating more and more wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has adopted some courageous positions and it now remains for us to put them into practice and add to them. It is this model that we will be taking to Johannesburg, in the hope that as many delegations as possible will draw inspiration from it. To succeed, however, we will need more than speeches and documents. We will need tools, and these tools are political, economic and financial. The political tools will require a new form of international governance, which must incorporate sustainable development policies. The financial tools obviously include more substantial aid from rich countries, but also taxation of financial transactions so as to give developing countries the resources to improve their social and democratic standards. Today we are being asked to consider the future development of our planet. We cannot afford to delay any longer in fulfilling the promise of a world which lives in greater solidarity, when the pressure on all our societies and the lack of prospects for large numbers of people are exacerbating their fears and causing them to seek refuge in isolationism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must be able to mesh economically and socially stable development with a high level of environmental protection in such a way that these factors do not hold each other back but together give a greater boost to welfare and prosperity than either one could do alone.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft report is rather pessimistic in its assessment of developments to date. Obviously it takes time even to slow down the negative development that is so rapidly on the increase. Only then will positive developments start to become visible. We, nevertheless, have to take care that we do not try to respond to exponential negative development with a linearly developing policy, in which case we would always be lagging behind reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In Rio an important principle was agreed to foster cooperation with grassroots civil society. The principle is already close to the ideals of the EU in the first place, but it is also important in that it could break the rigidity and inertia of traditional politics. Partnership projects are built on the principle that good models are easy to copy. The social, economic and ecological development of societies and democratisation are closely connected as we have seen many times in adverse situations.</p>
<p class="contents">A new report out on the UN’s development programme says that only a very small minority of the world’s companies bear sufficient social responsibility. However, there are good examples too. It is of vital importance how we in the European Union treat our responsible companies and those that are aspiring to responsibility. It is more important than ever to pitch Community policy in such a way that companies are able to comply with it and so that it is also more advantageous for them to do so. Similarly, we must make a consistent effort to prevent social and ecological dumping in global markets with reference to the rules agreed in the WTO. A recent example is emissions trading: we must be able to fix payments and tariffs for products from third countries that do not participate in the scheme to compensate for the additional burden for companies that do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share his view that the Commission communication is too long on description, but too short on action. I should like to make two points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point concerns the section of the communication on trade for sustainable development. The Commission is still too willing to make the unthinking assumption that trade liberalisation is an aim in itself, rather than a tool to serve the greater purpose of sustainable development. Contrary to the Commission's assertion that most causes of global inequality are unrelated to globalisation, the widening gap between the rich and the poor has developed precisely because unregulated markets and free capital mobility have tended to favour the countries, companies and individuals most able to harness these forces for their own benefit, at the expense of those with fewer resources or less political and economic influence. Accelerated environmental degradation over recent years has occurred as a direct result of the increase in resource consumption and economic activity generated under globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, coming from Parliament's rapporteur on corporate social responsibility, the Commissioner will not be surprised to be told that his commitment to simply promoting the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprise is wholly inadequate, in Parliament's view, as the European Union's contribution to developing global corporate accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">In today's global economy there is mounting evidence that multinationals registered in the north, the majority of them within the European Union, are actually causing harm in developing countries. Transgressions include abusing workers' rights and causing them bodily harm, destroying local lands and livelihoods, promoting harmful products to consumers, breaking national laws and undermining local democracy. That is why we will support Paragraph 59 in the resolution. The EU should use its development assistance and other external powers to pursue the objective of binding minimum standards with respect to the social and environmental performance of companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you can make a good start by making a clear and unambiguous commitment in your response to support the proposed framework convention on corporate accountability at the Johannesburg Summit. I look forward to your answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Commissioner Nielson too, who is always sensitive to issues concerning developing countries. The world summit due to take place in less than four months’ time in Johannesburg in South Africa is certainly an opportunity for the entire international community to give practical effect to its efforts and keep its promises in the field of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Although considerable progress has been made in a number of areas in recent years, I am afraid that a great deal still remains to be done. Addressing and attempting to provide a credible, sustainable response now to the issues which can no longer be put off – such as combating poverty, including the fundamental question of the debt which we debated during the last part-session in Brussels too, the huge social and health problems afflicting the poorest countries of the globe and, last but certainly not least, environmental protection, trade and access to international markets – would be a clear, coherent signal which the European Union itself, as the principal donor of aid, should be the first to give, in line with its recent undertaking to increase development aid by USD 20 billion by 2006 and by a further USD 7 billion from the year 2006 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it will be essential for the beneficiary countries to really get down to work with genuine development policies in the context of a regional integration process. Indeed, a unilateral approach not bound by a practical commitment on the part of the governments and the local authorities with adequate management and sound internal policies would serve little purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The first positive signs which, despite everything, give us hope are the undertakings given at Barcelona – and, before that, at Laeken, Gothenburg and the G8 Summit in Genoa – to work towards providing the planned 0.7% of GDP in aid to the developing countries. This is a positive trend: we need an intermediate goal, which is what the level of 0.39% of Member States’ GDP is, to help us reach our objective as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, I feel that, with reasonable deadlines and a precise timetable, we will succeed in halving poverty by 2015. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear from the messages we receive on a daily basis that we can no longer satisfy our requirements by borrowing against the future of our children and future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union played one of the leading roles at the Rio summit on sustainable development, making commitments on important issues without hesitation, although we must admit that several of these commitments were not honoured. Today, 10 years on, we are preparing for the Johannesburg summit and we need to take stock and take a critical look at all the decisions which fell by the wayside. This is the only way we shall improve our odds of meeting the new targets, i.e. economic development geared to social progress which takes serious account of the environment. The Union needs to make a decisive contribution to this endeavour, in the form of proper political decisions, followed by proper practical application. The Union must also recognise the right to development of developing countries, by taking initiatives and setting a proper example on all aspects of sustainable development and ensuring that non-governmental organisations are involved in all development plans.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to focus on issues relating directly to the eradication of poverty and applying a macroeconomic strategy will help here. Of course, all this and all the other questions raised by the rapporteurs in their reports require funds as well as political will.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by thanking and warmly congratulating both rapporteurs on their very important reports; I hope they will be applied in practice and will not just remain dead letters which merely express our wishes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, each summit on development and the environment has marked a turning point in the relationship between man and his environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stockholm Summit led to a general increase in awareness about the major threats to our environment. The Rio Summit defined a new arena, that of sustainable development. However, the concept of shared but differentiated responsibility has not gained the necessary support from the wealthiest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">World leaders cannot, of course, be satisfied when they are reminded that the Rio commitments have not been fulfilled. In the ten years between Rio and Johannesburg there has been a significant change of scenery to a globalised society in which social and economic inequalities seem to be closely linked to environmental problems and to the governability of all countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Eradicating poverty is a world priority, because it is the only way that we can manage the processes of globalisation in positive and fair manner. However, trends show that those living in the wealthiest countries wish to maintain their standard of living, while the other 80% of the world population needs to attain a dignified standard of living.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the only hope for global sustainability is to change methods of production and consumption. We are aware of the key elements required to achieve fair growth in this globalised world, but we are not being determined enough in applying them. Transparency and openness in the markets, knowledge management, innovation management and the transfer of technology, efficiency in our processes and products and accepting and practising social and environmental responsibility in all sectors are some of the most important elements.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has given clear signals that it is capable of leading that process. I hope that in Johannesburg we will be capable of defending our courageous, generous and worthy positions, which confirm us as leaders of a new world order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A clear agenda for sustainable development was set as long as ten years ago in Rio but, since then, developments have, however, largely been in the opposite direction. Poverty is spreading, and the gulf between rich and poor is growing every single day. The use of natural resources is increasing every day, there has been no reduction in humanly induced climate change and, every day, species of animals and plants disappear forever. There really is a vital need for us in the EU to assume a global responsibility at the World Conference in Johannesburg. What needs to be prepared is a global agreement with a practical work programme for sustainable development over many years to come, stating a number of precise objectives and precise deadlines. Allow me to specify some individual and crucial features.</p>
<p class="contents">Partly through giving the developing countries real opportunities in world trade, we should conduct a pro-active campaign against poverty and hunger in order to fulfil the pledges to the UN concerning development aid. We should break the link between economic growth and increased environmental damage, namely through the increased use of renewable energy and cleaner technology. We should ensure that, in all policy areas, we give consideration to sustainability, whether we are talking about legislation, trade agreements, investment or development aid. We should ensure that we have better and more reliable methods of implementing the international environmental and social agreements. Finally, I think it important that we establish more specific objectives for the proper use of natural resources and for safeguarding the diversity of the natural environment.</p>
<p class="contents">It might be said that, with the lack of preparation so far for the world conference and with a Bush administration in the United States, there is every good reason for fearing a fiasco in Johannesburg. We Europeans face an enormous task in securing a positive and binding result in Johannesburg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Rio was a milestone. Yet here we are today, feeling very depressed because we have nothing to show for it. I ask you this: who else, apart from the European Union, should take the lead role here? Who else has the opportunities, the awareness, and the skills, knowledge and economic scope? Without a strong economy, environmental protection is impossible. Yet Johannesburg will soon be upon us, and we have to face facts: the preparations are way off course.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a few words about this New York preparatory conference, which took place from 25 March to 5 April. I am told that progress was far too slow and there was far too much bureaucracy. We have not even begun negotiating yet. The forthcoming preparatory conference in Indonesia has now been extended, and will now take place from 24 May to 7 June. If we do not make progress this time, Johannesburg will have failed before we get there.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me mention one issue which is very important to my own country, namely mountains. At the preparatory conferences, Switzerland and Austria have called for a separate mountain chapter containing strong commitments, and this demand was endorsed by the European Union. Yet here too, it was impossible to make progress during the preparations. The countries which we represent here have all signed the Alpine Convention. Yet there is absolutely no movement on ratifying the protocols. If we want to have a strong presence at an international summit and demand measures which will benefit our mountains, we must start by doing our homework in our own countries. I ask you all to urge your governments to ratify the relevant protocols of the Alpine Convention as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unless the corporate social responsibility issues are understood properly, this will become another sort of shibboleth for the global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Global economy requires global rules. If you do not have global rules to sustain the development of our planet, we are going to end up with a problem where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, the environment will get worse and sustainable development flies out of the window. Sixty thousand people will be wasting their time in Johannesburg in September.</p>
<p class="contents">The last time there was a semblance of any sort of global economy was during the period of the empires, when the British, the French, the Italians and the Spanish empires went out and created economic activity. But even the British East India company had social corporative responsibility: they built schools; they cleaned up Bengal; they built railways; they put infrastructure in and they created offset investments. That is how the inter-dependency between economies of the poorer and the richer countries developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, corporate social responsibility requires us to recognise that if you take the top 200 largest multinational companies, their combined turnover is greater than the combined GNP of 172 countries. So the 200 chairmen of these companies have enormous social responsibility. We need to enjoin them to forge a partnership for development; not carp about what they do, but help them, because shareholder value depends hugely now, even in the City of London, on whether companies behave ethically. I have seen time and time again that companies with proper environmental and development policies have higher shareholder value than those companies that engage in looting and raping the other places.</p>
<p class="contents">So I am asking colleagues on my Right, not colleagues on my Left who are already there, to understand that inter-dependence requires us to look at our own economic and enterprise development and tell our companies to be partners in this development process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a sad fact that progress towards the goals established at Rio has been slow and in some respects conditions are worse today than they were ten years ago. Against this background it is meaningful and hopefully also useful that Johannesburg actually takes place. It is a way of attracting the world's attention back to these issues. We certainly want to make the best use of this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Parliament that the preparatory process for the World Summit is not going as well as we would have liked but the increase in development spending announced in Monterrey should facilitate progress in Johannesburg. At least having the debate on the financing of development behind us with some real result makes it more probable that Johannesburg will be able to focus on sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also have to be more creative in finding innovative means of implementation and financing. We still have a lot of work to do to ensure that the last preparatory meeting in Bali at the end of May produces results. This is not certain. The debate is not concerned with objectives, as there seems to be a consensus that poverty eradication and sustainable consumption and production are the overriding goals of the Summit, which – as a general feature – is further guided by the commitment to achieve the Millennium Development Objectives. As always, the question is how to achieve these goals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is in the process of identifying a series of key priorities for common action derived from our Sustainable Development Strategy. The Commission will promote specific initiatives for partnerships in the following areas. Let me note that it does not make much difference whether we talk about partnerships or deals. These partnerships we are promoting together add up to something that can meaningfully be called a "global deal".</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning water – with a view to better resource management and improving access to safe drinking water and to adequate sanitation, we will launch an initiative, based on integrated river basin management.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning energy – the Commission will propose an initiative to improve the provision of adequate, affordable and sustainable energy services. The core of the initiative will be the provision of technical assistance to developing countries to put in place appropriate energy policies through the development of partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning health – the Union will increase, over the next five years, the volume of development assistance targeting improved health outcomes and will invite recipient countries and the international community to join in such efforts. Particular attention will be paid to maternal health. WTO members should resolve differences on compulsory licences and work to ensure that pharmaceutical products can be made available to the developing world at the lowest possible prices. I remind Parliament that a year ago we untied the procurement of essential medicines for AIDS, malaria and TB globally as far as the Commission is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning education – the Union will also increase, over the next five years, the volume of development assistance in education and invite recipient countries to develop supportive policy frameworks and appropriate national budgets. We will support the World Bank “Education for All” fast tracking initiative, and strengthen partnerships especially with UNESCO to build capacity and monitor progress; we will also give priority to primary education and the closing of the gender gap.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning trade – making globalisation work for sustainable development requires timely progress on the work launched in the Doha Development Agenda, and concrete trade-related initiatives going beyond it. The Union will argue for levels of access comparable to Everything But Arms to be decided by all OECD countries in favour of the least developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning forests – the Union will effectively contribute to the strengthening of international cooperation to fight illegal logging and trade in timber. Here we need more than monitoring. We need policing.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning fisheries – the Union intends to contribute effectively to maintaining biodiversity, while securing the long-term viability of the fishing industry. We will fight illicit, unreported and unregulated fishing, and support sustainable fishery policies in developing countries in the context of poverty reduction strategies. At present we are in the process of renegotiating the traditional fisheries agreements with a large number of countries in Africa and elsewhere. This renewal process is essential if we are to move in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning governance – the Union will contribute to the strengthening of global governance structures and institutions in the economic, social and environmental fields as well as their respective linkages, so as to ensure policy coherence, integration and increased effectiveness. In this context we will also actively engage in the emerging debate on global public goods and will explore innovative mechanisms for international financial solidarity and for incentives for reducing externalities. We will propose setting up a task force open to all actors to identify and discuss the appropriate supply of relevant global public goods. This was one of the elements that we missed in the Monterrey consensus but which the Commission and some of the Member States took up during the week of discussions in Monterrey, making sure that what was not included in the Monterrey consensus was in fact re-injected in the international debate during the conference. We want to use Johannesburg as the platform for moving these items up on the international agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">All these initiatives will be implemented in the framework of the national and regional poverty reduction strategies of our partner countries which form the basis for sustainable development. In the implementation of these initiatives, the Union will pay special attention to Africa and African countries’ own efforts to achieve sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the contributions from Mr Howitt and Mr Deva, together they make up a balanced presentation of the challenge. I will continue to listen carefully to both sides in this House on this issue. I agree with both of them so, in principle, this should not be impossible. The big issue is moving forward to create real international governance. This is also the main sticking point between Europe and the United States. We find it natural and necessary to move forward in creating global governance on a large number of issues, where the US Government, which is less multilateralist, favours a different course of action. This has to be discussed. We see these international conferences as useful arenas for pushing these views forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Several speakers, from all political groups in this House, have mentioned that we need to make progress in reforming the agricultural policy and the fisheries policy in Europe in order to be able to present ourselves in a credible manner internationally in these areas. I could not agree more. These are two elements which will take up a lot of attention. The reform of these two areas is as important as any other contribution by Europe to global development, as far as international consequences are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Preparations for Johannesburg will be one of the main items for discussion at the Seville European Council in June. Let us ensure that the European Union plays a leading role in achieving an ambitious and action-oriented outcome at Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">Some speakers have mentioned the lack of clear decisions concerning participation from the highest levels of government. Let me use this occasion to inform Parliament that it is clearly the intention of the President of the European Commission to take part in the Johannesburg Summit. A number of other Commissioners will be there, making sure that our different areas of responsibility are given the maximum attention during the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has always been an advocate of sustainable development and its integration in all Union policies. Your efforts help bring a sense of urgency to the preparations for Johannesburg. This is needed. I thank Parliament for the contributions today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
